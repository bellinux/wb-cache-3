40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to study and analyze the {{performance}} of a rough hyperbolic slider bearing under the presence of a magnetic fluid lubricant. The magnetic field is oblique to the stator and the bearing surfaces are considered to be transversely rough. The roughness of the bearing surface is characterized by a stochastically random variable with non-zero mean, variance and skewness. The concerned Reynolds equation is stochastically averaged with respect to the random roughness parameters. This stochastically averaged equation is solved with suitable boundary conditions to obtain the expression of pressure distribution, which is then used to calculate the load carrying capacity. Besides, friction is also computed. The results show that the transverse surface roughness affects the performance of the bearing system adversely. It is seen that the load carrying capacity increases while friction decreases due to the magnetic fluid lubricant. It is revealed that the negative effect of transverse roughness can be minimized to certain extent by the positive effect of the magnetization in the case of <b>negatively</b> <b>skew</b> roughness. It is noticed that positively skewed roughness and variance (+ve) decrease the friction. Thus, this article offers some scopes for reducing the friction, increasing the load carrying capacity at the same time. This article may also be prevailed some measures for the extending the life period of the bearing system...|$|R

In addition, the spread between GVIX and VIX (GV-Spread) follows a mean-reverting process.|$|R

40|$|In several markets, {{consumers}} can gain further information regarding {{how well a}} product fits their preferences only by experiencing it after purchase. This could then generate loyalty for the products tried first. This paper considers a model in which consumers learn {{in the first period}} about the product they buy and then make choices in the second period about the competing products, given what they learned in the first period. The paper finds that if the distribution of valuations for each product is <b>negatively</b> (positively) <b>skewed,</b> a firm benefits (is hurt) in the future from having a greater market share today—the brand loyalty characteristic. With negative skewness, two effects are identified: On one hand, marginal forward-looking consumers are less price sensitive than myopic consumers, and this is a force toward higher prices. On the other hand, forward-looking firms realize that they gain in the future from having a higher market share in the current period and compete more aggressively in prices. For similar discount factors for consumers and firms, the latter effect dominates. The paper also characterizes the importance of consumer learning effects on the market outcome. consumer learning, brand loyalty, dynamic competition, experience goods, lifetime value of customers, forward-looking consumers, forward-looking firms...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{conclusion of}} this investigation is that the inhibitory effect of plasma or serum on hemolysis by saponin and lysins of the same type is similar in nature to the inhibitory effects of certain sugars and electrolytes, which again {{are similar to the}} acceleratory effects produced by indol, benzene, and other substances already studied. All these effects, both inhibitory and acceleratory, are the result of reactions between the inhibitors or accelerators and those components of the red cell membrane which are broken down by lysins. The inhibitory effect of plasma on saponin hemolysis has a number of properties in common with the inhibition produced by sugars and electrolytes and with accelerations in general. (a) The temperature coefficient is small and negative. (b) The extent of the inhibition depends on the type of red cell used in the hemolytic system. (c) The most satisfactory measure of the extent of the inhibition, the constant R, {{is a function of the}} concentration of lysin in the system, and (d) R is a linear function of the quantity of inhibitor present. It is also shown that the inhibitory effect of plasma, and serum is not entirely dependent on its protein content. The process underlying the phenomenon of lysis and its acceleration or inhibition seems to be one in which the lysin reacts with a component or components of the cell membrane in such a way as to break down its semipermeability to hemoglobin, and in which the accelerator or inhibitor also reacts with the same component in such a way as to increase or decrease the effectiveness of the lysin in producing breakdown. The membrane is considered as being an ultrastructure made up of small areas or spots of varying degrees of resistance to breakdown, the resistances being distributed according to a <b>negatively</b> <b>skew</b> type of frequency curve, and the process of lysis seems to begin with the least resistant spots breaking down first. These spots may be arranged in some regular spatial pattern, and the membrane has also to be regarded as possessing spots of varying rigidity of form. The accelerator or inhibitor changes the resistance of every reactive spot in the ultrastructure by a factor R, which suggests that acceleration and inhibition are results of some over-all effect, such as that of changing the extent to which lysin is concentrated at the surface or partitioned between the material of the membrane and the surrounding fluid. Some kind of combination between the accelerator or inhibitor and the material of the ultrastructure is presumably involved; at first the combination seems to be a loose one and partly reversible, but later some of the loose links are replaced by more permanent combinations involving the same types of bond as are broken down by the lysins themselves...|$|R

This {{model has been}} exaustively used for describing hazard rates – an important quantity of survival analysis. In the context of monotone hazard rates, some results from the literature suggest that the Weibull law is a reasonable choice due to its <b>negatively</b> and positively <b>skewed</b> density shapes. However, this distribution {{is not a good}} model for describing phenomenon with non-monotone failure rates, which can be found on data from applications in reliability and biological studies.

40|$|Category {{ratings of}} {{stimulus}} intensities {{are affected by}} the skewing of frequency distributions of stimuli.

According to Haubensak's theory, these effects are due to the tendency of participants to use all categories during the initial presentations. Frequency effects should be reduced by the presentation of stimuli with extreme intensities as standards before each variable stimulus. In this experiment, participants rated brightnesses of squares or lengths of lines using integers from 1 to 5. Target stimuli were presented with or without standards and, for each of these two conditions, frequency distributions were <b>negatively</b> or positively <b>skewed.</b> Results show that the skewing of frequency distributions strongly affected subjective scales independently of {{the presence or absence of}} standards.

40|$|In several markets {{consumers}} can only gain further information regarding {{about how well}} a product fits their preferences by experiencing it after the purchase. Furthermore, while some consumers may have a better fit with one given product, other consumers may end up appreciating more another product. In addition, firms may not have any significant private information regarding which consumers value more or less their own product. In such markets, consumers then try products and only keep on buying them if they provide a good fit. Furthermore, after trying a product a product a consumer has more information about that product than about the untried products. These features generate, in general, dynamic effects because the market shares in one period affect demands in the next period. The paper finds that if the distribution of valuations for each product is <b>negatively</b> (positively) <b>skewed</b> a firm benefits (is hurt) in the future from having a greater market share today. The negativity of the skewness {{of the distribution of}} valuations is then shown to be related to consumer risk aversion with respect to the physical performance of the good. With negative skewness it is shown in a two-period model that, as expected, firms compete more aggressively in the first period, and charge higher prices in the last period. The analysis of the infinite-horizon case with overlapping generations of consumers shows that these two effects average out in higher prices. In this later case, I also characterize oscillating market share dynamics, and comparative statics of the equilibrium with respect to degree of skewness, consumer and firm patience, and importance of the experience in the ex-post valuation of the product. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{parameterization}} for {{the horizontal}} subgrid-scale variability of water vapor and cloud condensate is introduced, {{which is used}} to diagnose cloud fraction in the spirit of statistically based cloud cover parameterizations. High-resolution cloud- resolving model data from tropical deep convective scenarios were used to justify the choice of probability density function (PDF).

A development from previous statistical parameterizations is that the new scheme is prognostic, with processes such as deep convection, turbulence, and microphysics directly affecting the distribution of higher-order moments of variance and skewness. The scheme is able to represent the growth and decay of cirrus cloud decks and also the creation of cloud in clear sky or breakup of an overcast cloud deck by boundary layer turbulence.

Rice, Hoffman, and Wexler (2009) have developed a grammatical judgment measure as a clinical marker of language impairment, which has an extended developmental range to adolescence. Method: We conducted the first twin analysis, along with associated phenotypic analyses of validity, of an abridged, 20 -item version of this grammatical judgment measure (GJ- 20), based on telephone administration using prerecorded stimuli to 405 pairs of 16 -year-olds (148 monozygotic and 257 dizygotic) drawn from the Twins Early Development Study (Haworth, Davis, & Plomin, 2012). Results: The distribution of scores is markedly <b>skewed</b> <b>negatively,</b> as expected for a potential clinical marker. Low performance on GJ- 20 is associated with lower maternal education, reported learning disability (age 7 years), and low scores on language tests administered via the Twins Early Development Study (age 16 years) as well as General Certificate of Secondary Education English and Math examination performance (age 16 years). Liability threshold estimates for the genetic influence on low performance on GJ- 20 are substantial, ranging from 36 % with a lowest 10 % criterion to 74 % for a lowest 5 % criterion. Conclusions: The heritability of GJ- 20 scores, especially at more extreme cutoffs, along with the score distribution and association with other indicators of language impairments, provides additional evidence for the potential value of this measure as a clinical marker of specific language impairment...|$|R

40|$|In the U. S., {{there are}} 400, 000 {{respiratory}} failure deaths. Conventional treatment for acute respiratory failure employs lung damaging mechanical ventilation. The only long term treatment for chronic respiratory failure is lung transplantation. However, only 1800 transplants are performed each year due to donor shortages, {{resulting in the}} need for a destination therapy. Extracorporeal gas exchangers have been used as an alternative to mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure and as a bridge to transplantation in chronic respiratory failure. Blood is diverted to an extracorporeal gas exchanger, where oxygen is added and carbon dioxide is removed before returning the blood to the patient. Current gas exchangers are limited by their high resistance and low biocompatibility that lead to patient complications and device clot formation. This dissertation discusses three gas exchangers; the compliant thoracic artificial lung (cTAL), the compact cardiopulmonary support device (CCSD), and the pulmonary assist device (PAD). Fourteen day in vivo studies evaluated the cTAL’s long term performance and biocompatibility. The uncoated cTAL was capable of 14 days of support without a resistance increase or clot formation. In the future, the cTAL will be coated with anti-coagulant coatings and tested in vivo for 2 months. Individual components of the CCSD were designed and when tested, met design goals. However, enclosure pressures of negative 197 mmHg at flowrates of 4 L/min were encountered in CCSD system testing, causing gas embolus formation. The risk of gas embolus resulted in the discontinuation of CCSD development. The PAD was designed for long term use as a bridge to transplantation and destination therapy. Computational simulations were used to design the PAD with a theoretical resistance of 1. 50 mmHg/(L/min) and a 98. 3 percent blood outlet oxyhemoglobin saturation at blood flowrates of 1. 25 L/min. In vitro testing of the PAD yielded lower gas exchange performance (88. 4 percent saturation) and higher resistance (3. 47 mmHg/(L/min)).
