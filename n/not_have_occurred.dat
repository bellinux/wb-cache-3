5|$|On 29 January, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted Minh's MRC in a bloodless pre-dawn coup; {{although}} Khánh {{accused the}} junta of intending {{to make a}} deal with the communists and claimed to have proof, he was actually motivated by personal ambition. After Khánh was deposed a year later, he admitted that the allegations against Minh's group were false. In later years, Khánh, Thơ and Minh's generals all agreed that the coup was strongly encouraged by the Americans and could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> without their backing.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

25|$|A {{writer for}} The Diplomat {{suggested}} that the blast <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>occurred</b> {{on the anniversary of}} Babri Mosque destruction on 6 December, and the shoddy design of the attack, were indicative of the weakening of the Indian Mujahideen due to police action.|$|R

25|$|Expert {{witnesses}} {{testified that}} Mrs. Muncey's blood samples {{taken during the}} autopsy were kept in test tubes without preservation. They said that in such conditions, certain enzymes invariably degrade.

Furthermore, the data available to us did not contradict the possibility of a deliberate transmission of HIV to the infected children.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} available {{record of}} a cricket match in Yea is for January 1869, against a Murrundindi side, though formal creation of a club seems <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> until 1872.|$|R
25|$|The Parliament of the United Kingdom {{also drew}} up an {{analysis}} of the key features of Cuba's healthcare system, drawing comparisons with the state funded National Health Service (NHS).

The study concluded the following.|$|E
25|$|In retrospect, {{the tragedy}} of May 4, 1970, should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred.</b> The {{students}} may have {{believed that they were}} right in continuing their mass protest in response to the Cambodian invasion, even though this protest followed the posting and reading by the university of an order to ban rallies and an order to disperse. These orders have since been determined by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to have been lawful.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of today's theme-park killer whales {{were born in}} captivity: 33 out of 56. Kalina, a female orca born in September 1985 at SeaWorld Orlando, was the first captive orca calf to survive more than two months. Kalina's mother is an Icelandic female named Katina, and her father, Winston (also known as Ramu III), was a Pacific Southern Resident, making Kalina an Atlantic/Pacific hybrid – a unique situation that would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in the wild.|$|E

25|$|Other {{parts of}} speech would be very unusual in this position. However, in verse, poetic {{inversion}} {{for the sake of}} meter or of bringing a rhyme word {{to the end of a}} line often results in abnormal syntax, as with Shakespeare's split infinitive (to pitied be, cited above), in fact an inverted passive construction in which the infinitive is split by a past participle. Presumably, this would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> in a prose text by the same author.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power station}} {{operators}} {{around the world}} began to install Passive Auto-catalytic hydrogen Recombiners ("PARs"), which do not require electricity to operate. PARs work much like the catalytic converter on the exhaust of a car to turn potentially explosive gases such as hydrogen into water. Had such devices been positioned {{at the top of}} Fukushima I's reactor and containment buildings, where hydrogen gas collected, the explosions would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> and the releases of radioactive isotopes would arguably have been much less.|$|E
25|$|In the North Island, {{specimens}} {{of the smaller}} subspecies rufifacies were allegedly collected from the forest districts of Mount Taranaki/Egmont (1856) and the Wairarapa (1868); the unclear history of the latter and the eventual disappearance of both led to suspicions that the bird may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> on the North Island at all. This theory has been refuted, however, after ample subfossil bones of the species {{were found in the}} North Island. Sight records exist from Porirua and Te Karaka; according to Māori tradition, the species last occurred in Te Urewera.|$|E
50|$|Interviews were {{conducted}} during a 6-month follow-up period, with both victims and offenders, {{as well as}} official records consulted {{to determine whether or}} <b>not</b> re-offending <b>had</b> <b>occurred.</b> The study lasted approximately 17 months and included 330 cases.|$|R

25|$|Following his defence of the thesis, {{students}} at Paris swore {{to defend the}} position, and the tradition grew of swearing to defend the doctrine with one's blood. The University of Paris supported {{the decision of the}} (schismatic) Council of Basel in this matter. Duns' arguments remained controversial, however, particularly among the Dominicans, who were willing enough to celebrate Mary's sanctificatio (being made free from sin), but, following the Dominican Thomas Aquinas' arguments, continued to insist that her sanctification could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> at the instant of her conception.|$|E
25|$|Though gender {{discrimination}} and sexism refer to beliefs and attitudes {{in relation to}} the gender of a person, such beliefs and attitudes are of a social nature and do not, normally, carry any legal consequences. Sex discrimination, on the other hand, may have legal consequences. Though what constitutes sex discrimination varies between countries, the essence is that it is an adverse action taken by one person against another person that would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> had the person been of another sex. Discrimination of that nature is considered a form of prejudice and in certain enumerated circumstances is illegal in many countries.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{action of}} his term was a strict new ethics law. When campaigning for {{re-election}} in 2006, Blagojevich said that if his ethics law had existed when former governor George Ryan had been in office, Ryan's corruption might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred.</b> Blagojevich also signed a comprehensive death penalty reform bill that was written by then-Senator Barack Obama and the late U.S. Senator Paul M. Simon. Organized labor and African Americans were Blagojevich's staunchest political supporters. In 2008, he {{told a group of}} African-Americans that he sometimes considered himself the first African American governor of Illinois.|$|E

25|$|Intercollegiate debates {{have been}} held since at least {{as early as the}} 1890s. Historical records {{indicate}} that debates between teams from Wake Forest University and Trinity College (later Duke University) occurred beginning in 1897. Additionally, a debate between students from Boston College and Georgetown University occurred on May 1, 1895, in Boston. Whitman College debated Washington State University, Willamette University, and the University of Idaho in the late 1890s. Southwestern claims that the first debate held on its campus was between Southwestern and Fairmount College (which eventually became Wichita State University) but that debate could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> prior to 1895, the year Fairmount College began classes.|$|E
25|$|In 2017 a {{group of}} canid {{researchers}} challenged the recent finding that the red wolf and the eastern wolf {{were the result of}} recent coyote–wolf hybridization. The group highlight that no testing had been undertaken to ascertain the time period that hybridization had occurred and that by the previous study's own figures the hybridization could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> recently but supports a much more ancient hybridization. The group found deficiencies in the previous study's selection of specimens and the findings drawn from the different techniques used. Therefore, the group argues that both the red wolf and the eastern wolf remain genetically distinct North American taxa. This was rebutted by the authors of the earlier study.|$|E
25|$|Medieval writers often {{assumed that}} paganus as a {{religious}} term {{was a result of}} the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> to Romans during Early Christianity. Third, unlike words such as , paganus had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.|$|E
