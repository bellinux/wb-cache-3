5|$|A {{number of}} {{arthropod}} parasites {{have been recorded}} on this duck, including chewing mites of the families Philopteridae and Menoponidae, feather mites and skin mites. Internal helminth parasites include roundworms, tapeworms and flukes. In a survey in Florida, all 30 ducks tested carried at least two helminth species, although <b>none</b> <b>had</b> blood parasites. Only one duck had no mites or lice.|$|E
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, <b>none</b> <b>had</b> university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E

The matchwon 22–3 by the New Zealanders, who scored three tries to nilmarked Gallaher's first international cap. The last match of the tour was against New South Wales Country; New Zealand won 32–0. On their ten-match tour of Australia, New Zealand had scored 276 points and conceded only 13.|$|E

5|$|The IJN's faulty anti-submarine {{doctrine}} {{also contributed}} to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack {{before and during the}} early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943. The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though <b>none</b> <b>had</b> any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Southern African Development Community, a bloc of 15 nations {{including}} Madagascar, {{announced on}} 19 March {{that it would}} not recognize Rajoelina's presidency since the takeover was unconstitutional. His ascension to the presidency was also condemned by the European Union and the United States, and the African Union suspended Madagascar and threatened sanctions if the constitutional government had not been restored in six months. No foreign diplomats attended Rajoelina's investiture; the HAT foreign minister said <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been invited.|$|E
5|$|Until the 19th century {{very little}} {{was known about}} hill forts, as <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been {{excavated}} and their original purpose had been long forgotten.

5|$|Also {{on display}} is a burden basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and <b>none</b> <b>had</b> the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 16 was {{the second}} of the Apollo type J missions, {{featuring}} the use of the Lunar Roving Vehicle, increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days. As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15, obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, <b>none</b> <b>had</b> actually visited the lunar highlands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. <b>None</b> <b>had</b> come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of the New Democratic Party (NDP)).|$|E

5|$|Distribution of Tamerlane and Other Poems was {{so light}} that Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1850 claimed {{it had never}} existed, noting that <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been found. The first known copy turned up in 1859 with a second found in 1874. A type {{facsimile}} of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and introduced by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 facsimile by Thomas Ollive Mabbott, who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.|$|E
5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a new plan would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been adopted.|$|E
5|$|In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, {{head of the}} Flanders Flotilla, used UB-6 to test {{a theory}} that British {{defenses}} in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, UB-6 departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. UB-6 sailed past Dunkirk {{on the surface and}} made Boulogne in the early morning of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. UB-6 immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I boats, , , and , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather and fog hampered the boats and <b>none</b> <b>had</b> any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these forays into the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.|$|E

5|$|Much of Savile's career {{involved}} {{working with}} children and young people, including visiting schools and hospital wards. He spent 20 years presenting Top of the Pops before a teenage audience, and an overlapping 20 years presenting Jim'll Fix It, in which he helped the wishes of viewers, mainly children, come true. During his lifetime, two police investigations had looked into reports about Savile, the earliest known being in 1958, but <b>none</b> <b>had</b> led to charges; the reports had each {{concluded that there was}} insufficient evidence for any charges to be brought relating to sexual offences. In October 2012, it was announced that the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, would investigate why proceedings against Savile in 2009 were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' {{is a white}} {{form from}} Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been {{previously}} preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which grew on water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the Macadamia twig girdler.|$|E

5|$|The Rialto Grain and Securities Company, whose {{principal}} {{place of}} business was in St. Louis, Missouri, was under investigation by the Postmaster for mail fraud. The Postmaster had received two complaints and forwarded them for investigation on November 7, 1902. State courts were also investigating complaints from investors against Rialto. Hugh C. Dennis, the President of Rialto, and other officers had been criminally indicted, but (at the time of Burton's indictment) <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been convicted. As of Burton's indictment, Dennis had been once acquitted in federal court and four indictments were pending against him in state courts. For a time, Rialto's offices had been closed due to a judicial attachment by its creditors.|$|E
5|$|The first Springbok colours {{were created}} in 1906 during the 1906–07 South Africa rugby union tour of the Northern Hemisphere as <b>none</b> <b>had</b> been {{provided}} for them and the captain Paul Roos decided that the team need {{to create their own}} emblem and nickname to prevent the British press creating one for them. Using the guidelines that the director of the South African Rugby Board (SARB) had given for the playing kit of myrtle green jerseys and a gold collar, Roos instructed that a green blazer with gold piping and a Springbok emblem on the breast pocket would be made for the team in Richmond. Despite this, not many colours were made as they were not standard issue at the time. Later on they became standard issue for all sportsmen representing South Africa internationally but primarily was used by rugby union as the creators.|$|E

Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|E
