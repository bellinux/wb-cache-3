The theme of the meetings was to study how uncertainties could be included in the decision-making process and whether pre-structured generic attributes and value trees would help this process and save time. The approach was to present a generic value tree, a decision table and a selected information package at the beginning of the interviews. The interviewees then examined the suggested value tree in order to ensure that no important factors have been omitted and they made changes when necessary. Also, the decision table was examined and altered by some participants and some of them asked for further information on some issues. But all in all the selected approach allowed for more time and effort to be allocated to value trade-offs and elicitation of risk attitudes.

40|$|The Agency {{has a role}} to help {{facilitate}} the procedure for authorising the placing in service 1 of vehicles and the harmonisation of the <b>National</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Authorities</b> decision making processes for authorisation. This is particularly important in the transition phase until all the Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) are complete and all networks and vehicles conform to the TSIs. In this context this report {{is part of a}} suite of initiatives intended to facilitate vehicle authorisation. These initiatives include: defining and maintaining the list of parameters to be checked for vehicle authorisation compiling and maintaining the Reference Document that: o lists the national rules for each parameter; o describes the national legal framework covering the authorisation procedure, and o records the equivalence of the various national rules for each parameter. The Agency, under the auspices of its Cross Acceptance Working Party, set about understanding and documenting the different existing national authorisation procedures, their commonalities and differences. The analysis also identified technical subject areas of authorisation that generated the most cost, time delay and uncertainty. It soon became clear that as well as determining the “status quo ” of authorisation procedures used today, it was essential to have a common understanding of the new procedure contained within the recast Interoperability Directive.

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of Fusion as energy source requires also {{the demonstration of}} a limited impact in term of risk to the sta, to the public, and to the environment, well below the limits established by international committees and <b>national</b> <b>safety</b> <b>authorities.</b> Therefore, a systematic safety analysis has to follow the design development {{to demonstrate that the}} safety objectives are met for each solution proposed. This analysis points out the dominant accident sequences as well as outlines the possible prevention, protection and mitigation actions and relevant systems. One of the most challenging accidents is a large break of the primary cooling system, due to the possible consequences in terms of radiological releases to the environment. However, thanks to the relative small radiological inventory and to the lower decay heat density, the risk associated with a break of the primary cooling loop in a fusion reactor is lower than the risk of the same event in a fission reactor. However, this event should be detected as soon as possible to limit the consequences: e. g. limiting radioactive inventory from the primary confinement, impairment of secondary confinement due to the enthalpy of the helium mass released. Therefore, the Primary Heat Transfer System (PHTS) of the DEMO helium cooled Blanket requires system performances far dierent to that one of the fission reactors cooled by pressurized water. For this purpose a numerical assessment of PHTS has been carried out, considering two possible layout solutions. This analysis has been performed employing MELCOR 1. 8. 2 and aims to support the design of the Blanket and its PHTS with some safety-related consideration...|$|E

40|$|A {{continuously}} {{changing and}} increasingly complex society leads to new challenges in safety design. Modern buildings and road tunnels are being packed with {{new technology that}} creates new failure modes, multiple subsystem interactions and tight couplings between different socio-technical systems. Meanwhile, safety is largely designed into these systems using prescriptive design rules that have evolved through reactions to accidents in systems with limited resemblance to modern systems. The traditional prescriptive approach to safety design was developed to avoid the re-occurrence of previously experienced accidents. New types of systems and accidents need a different design philosophy. The focus {{should be on the}} future instead of the past. Hence, the following question was outlined as the major issue of this thesis: what promotes and inhibits performance-based safety management of design processes? Performance-based design principles and regulations are nothing new. In Norway, performance-based fire safety legislations were introduced in the onshore building industry in 1997, and the international fire safety science community had a great focus on promoting these issues during the 1990 s. However, experience with the performance-based legislation regime shows that the majority of fire safety designing activity is still based on prescriptive design rules, even in the most novel and complex cases. This is an unfortunate practice, considering that the prescriptive design rules have a boundary of validity associated with historically appropriate designs. Another matter is the restricted empirical foundation for the prescriptive design rules. Accidents are relatively rare events in socio-technical systems. Hence, the ‘test of time’ is a rather weak test in terms of determining the appropriateness of the prescriptive design rules. Strengthening the performance-based alternative to safety management of design process is thus of major importance. Four research questions were developed to support the major issue. The research questions were associated with: (1) understanding current fire safety engineering practice, (2) investigating the scientific foundation of the concepts of fire safety level and safety margin, (3) investigating methodological challenges associated with current practice, and (4) SUMMARY VI transforming the understanding associated with current challenges into proposals for improvement. The research was limited to issues associated with engineering practice, safety science and safety regulation, explored through six case studies: A. A study of fire safety engineering practice in Norway in the period from 1997 to 2012. B. A study of fire safety science’s treatment of major concepts associated with the measurement of safety levels and safety margins. C. A study of 40 different technical fire safety strategies (combinations of safety measures) for multi-story residential apartment buildings. D. A study of the application of an engineering methodology to a specific design example: a concert hall. E. A study of the risk analyses and uncertainty management process in the Rogfast road tunnel project. F. A study of the application of a Bayesian Network model for risk analysis in road tunnels generally and in the Rogfast tunnel specifically. The data the case studies dealt with has mainly been written documents, either collected from the different projects or through literature surveys associated with the topic.

Fire safety engineering practice builds largely on the application of prescriptive design rules. Deviations from these design rules are often made, and the consequences of these deviations are often documented qualitatively using engineering judgment and argumentation. Fire safety science, on the other hand, builds on a rather narrow scientific framework, greatly inspired by the natural sciences. Fire safety is preferably measured by the application of quantitative relationships and models. The type of qualitative knowledge reflected by the fire safety engineering practice is poorly reflected in fire safety science, and the type of quantitative rigor reflected in fire safety SUMMARY VII science is poorly reflected in fire safety engineering practice. Obviously there is a need to increase the common understanding. I argue that the scientific framework for fire safety science is too narrow to capture the essence of the concept of fire safety. The traditional framework builds on scientific reductionism, which leads to great simplifications in the treatment of systems and environmental complexity and excludes critical issues that are difficult to quantify dependably. Examples of the latter are human and organizational behavior. Similar conclusions are drawn with regards to the risk concept from the Rogfast cases. Overemphasis on model concepts, such as relative frequencies or universal causal structures, excludes the individual knowledge safety experts may bring to the table in novel designs. An alternative scientific framework is suggested, which builds on a constructivist systems thinking perspective. A fundamental assumption is that complex socio-technical systems, such as certain modern buildings and road tunnels, are modeled as social hierarchies. The macro-level includes social institutions, such as <b>national</b> <b>safety</b> <b>authorities</b> and fire departments, while the micro-levels include the building’s components, sub-systems, and nuts and bolts. Fire safety, then, is a property of the system as a whole and cannot be associated with any lower layer in the hierarchy, for instance by only considering the technical infrastructure or the reliability of an automatic sprinkler system. Moreover, complex socio-technical systems are constantly adapting to changes within themselves and in the environment. Hence, safety design is a matter of creating a control structure that enables the system to change in a safe manner. Application of the proposed framework would lead to a more holistic approach to safety design, regardless if one applies a risk-based methodology or a systems safety methodology. For instance, it would broaden the view on what knowledge is relevant in design processes and what measures could be used to achieve safety. Knowledge associated with the individual engineer’s experience would become more important. This knowledge may be tacitly known, and works, for instance, in terms of how the engineer creatively frames and reframes design problems to the stakeholders’ needs. A holistic perspective on safety measures includes, in principle, all thinkable measures, SUMMARY VIII and not only those measures associated with quantitative knowledge. A consequence of this would be that mathematical rigor would have to give way to more qualitative and discursive decision processes.

This legislation recognises that it is not just technical and procedural harmonisation that is required to create an effective internal market for railway services in Europe.

Studies have shown that there are links between these reckless behaviors and road accidents. It is therefore critical that such drivers be identified early in advance to eliminate that likelihood. Currently, the road traffic offence data collected by <b>National</b> Transport and <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> for instance speeding and drunk driving data is solely used for reporting and prosecution hence not adequately utilized in ensuring road safety. Effective utilization of these data can positively impact road <b>safety</b> management since <b>authorities</b> can put in place mitigation mechanisms {{in order to prevent}} the frequent road accidents. The algorithm-based system developed in this study makes use of traffic offence data to predict the likelihood of a driver causing road accident. Data was gathered using close-ended questionnaires and interviews. The questionnaires and interviews intended to determine causes of road accidents and specific aspects about; booking an offender, relaying of traffic accident data and the need for a system among users within the transport sector in Kenya.

40|$|Introduction The {{labelling}} of foodstuffs is {{an important}} communication tool between the manufacturer/retailer and the consumer. However, some economic operators recognize that although food products’ front of package information adds value to their business; it risks hindering the sales of some food categories, especially the less healthy ones. Aim The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the type of legal infringements associated with the labelling practices for foodstuffs sold on the Portuguese market, based on official audits developed by the <b>National</b> Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority.</b> Methods All samples were collected under the National Sampling Plan of the Portuguese Food and Economic <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority,</b> between 2007 and 2011, with a total of 8, 549 food products under evaluation. Results After evaluation of the label and laboratory testing, 432 were identified as non-compliant, from which 164 were identified as presenting non-compliant labelling. “Meat and meat products”, “milk and dairy products” and “ready to eat food” were the groups with more non-compliant labels. Relatively to the offenses, 51 % were associated with error-inducing mentions, followed by labelling imprecision (40 %) and 9 % were non-compliant samples with a potential risk for consumer’s health. The detected offenses were related mostly with incomplete mentions, followed by names not corresponding to the product, mandatory mentions not translated to Portuguese and the incorrect use of nutritional claims. Discussion/conclusions It is essential to promote specific training on food labelling rules aimed at economic operators and employees, in order to reduce the number of offenses of this nature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn 2003, the French Guided Public Transport Safety Decree updated {{the current}} {{transport}} legislation. It gave safety missions to the Service Technique des Remontées Mécaniques et des Transports Guidés (henceforth STRMTG), mainly in assessing and controlling the safety level of those systems. Since then, this <b>national</b> <b>safety</b> <b>authority</b> has collected <b>national</b> data on <b>safety</b> {{for each type}} of systems. And each system requires a particular follow-up, related to its specificities. The aim of the present paper is to concentrate mainly on underground systems, taking into account their specificities such as tunnels, automatic pilots, platform doors, etc. From those, a classification for the safety indicators was nationally established to identify the information needed by the STRMTG and the related means used to obtain it. The information needed by the STRMTG concerns different types of events with a classification distinguishing those, which have to be immediately reported to the <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> of <b>safety</b> from those, that have to be followed simply by statistics. For all of them, different elements are required to understand the circumstances of the events and their aftermath. Moreover, as there are only very few collective events, the STRMTG decided to ensure a follow-up of other indicators, which don’t generate any real incidents but could have, in other conditions: these are precursors of incidents, that also reflect the safety level of the networks. With all this information, the STRMTG constitutes a yearly report, presenting the statistics with those safety indicators and their evolution over a few years. This statistical analysis doesn’t aim at comparing networks nor at presenting a safety level classification. The aim of this is first, to have a national and anonymous view on underground events and second, to know which type of configuration is related to the biggest number of events and which aggravating factors are involved. It also gives the possibility to the STRMTG to make analyses on specific issues, to find common events between networks, and to analyse the evolution of these indicators in order to reinforce its attention on those points. This study is only made possible thanks to a number of operators, who regularly transmit all the necessary data to ensure this follow-up. Such follow-up is conducted by different means: annual reports or a national common data-base. On a daily basis, a significant amount of work was carried out with those local actors and still goes on to improve the reliability of the follow-up process. After a presentation of the methodology referred to above, we will present the results of this safety indicators’ follow-up over the period from 2012 to 2014, based on the data from and on underground networks...|$|R
40|$|Air {{bags and}} airbag system design have evolved {{significantly}} over the many years since their introduction to motor vehicles. This process will inevitably continue {{and there are}} likely to be more changes in system design and deployment methods covering all aspects of the system from sensors to inflators and diffuser tubes as air bag usage extends through first the inside and then potentially the outside of the motor vehicle. However, despite various considerations of material options for the cushion material, nylon 6, 6 remains the material of choice. This is not surprising, as experience shows that where energy-absorbing fabrics are required, the special properties of nylon 6, 6 continue to make the material a logical choice. Today, the latest research on potential airbag materials including polyester fiber, continues to point the industry towards nylon 6, 6. This paper examines the critical data and reasons why nylon 6, 6 is likely to remain the airbag material of choice for the foreseeable future.

30|$|Studies {{of driving}} {{behavior}} usually rely on self-reported assessments, but {{the validity of}} this method has been questioned [6, 28], in particular with regard to speeding [5]. In order to assess the validity of self-reported assessments, we obtained both objective and subjective data on driving behaviors, including violations. In addition, traffic safety interventions usually seek to change behavior by relying on the deterrence paradigm [21, 23]. We complemented this approach by exploring the potential role of rewards in motivating behavioral change. Finally, we explored the relationship between objective measures of driver behavior and individual-level attitudinal variables. The current study examined driving behavior among 114 young drivers in Israel, focusing on speeding violations (hereafter speeding). Numerous studies conducted in different countries found that young drivers suffer from a disproportionate risk of crashing [15, 32]. In Israel, {{a recent report by}} the Israeli <b>National</b> Road <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> (RSA) found that during 2015, 71 % of young drivers (aged 24 and below) who were involved in a fatal accident committed a traffic violation, compared to 58 % of drivers aged 25 – 44 and 54 % of those aged 45 – 64  years old [12]. A common violation exacerbating both the risk of crashing and the potential of its severity is speeding [26]. In Israel, speeding has been identified as the major cause of fatal accidents amongst 28 % of young drivers involved in an accident, compared with only 13 % amongst drivers aged 25 – 64 [12].|$|R
40|$|The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) {{has been}} asked by the Norwegian Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> to perform a health risk {{assessment}} on decomposition substances and oxidation products in fish oils {{intended for human consumption}} except pharmaceuticals. Seal and/or krill oil intended for human consumption might be included but in separate chapters. EU’s hygiene regulations for the production of fish oils intended for human consumption were strengthened from 2008 in the EU (from March 2010 in Norway), but concerns regarding the possible presence of decomposition substances and oxidation products in the oils and their possible consequences on human health were raised. In the request from the <b>National</b> Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority,</b> VKM was asked to include descriptions of the substances resulting from decomposition of the various raw material used for fish oil production, and the products formed during oxidation of marine oils. Additionally, a description of the substances formed and/or eliminated during the various processing steps in the production of marine oils intended for human consumption and to take raw material, processing conditions, storing and transporting conditions of raw material and fish oil into account. Depending on the detectability of the identified substances/products of concern in n- 3 fatty acid food supplements, a qualitative, and if possible quantitative, health risk assessment should be performed. The main focus is on production of fish oil and on fish oil used as food supplement (i. e. in bottle or encapsulated). Other marine sources for oil production such as krill and seal blubber, as well as emulsions and microencapsulation of marine n- 3 fatty acids used for fortification of regular food, are not evaluated in detail. Food supplements based on oil derived from the crustaceans Calanus finmarchicus, which is a growing business in Norway, has not been included. It was {{beyond the scope of this}} evaluation to address environmental contaminants in marine raw materials/oils and in final products...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the adequacy}} of the Australian Offshore Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan in responding to petroleum platform-sourced oil spills, in light of the Montara Oil Spill in the Timor Sea in August 2009. After a consideration of the causes of the Montara Oil Spill, this study outlines the regulatory and response framework for marine oil spills in Australia, outlining the three pillars of oil spill planning, namely preparedness, training and response. The study then analyses {{the adequacy of}} the NatPlan and the National Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan to address petroleum platform-sourced oil spills. This analysis highlights the weaknesses in oil spill preparedness, training and response to oil spills from oil installation-sourced oil pollution. In addition, it highlights the discord between the aim of the oil company to cap the leak, and the <b>National</b> Offshore Petroleum <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> to preserve life through the implementation of a `no go 2 ̆ 7 zone around the Montara platform. In responding to the weaknesses identified in this critical analysis, this study also offers possible changes to Australia¿s oil spill response strategy to ensure that the response to future petroleum platform-sourced oil spills are best practice...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} offshore petroleum legislation in contributing to offshore facility integrity incidents in Australia’s offshore petroleum jurisdiction. It examines the regulatory framework that existed {{at the time of}} the Varanus Island, Montara, and Macondo facility incidents, determining that the regulatory regime contributed to each of these incidents. Assessing the response of the Commonwealth government to the regulatory framework existing {{at the time of the}} events, particularly the integration of well regulation as part of the <b>National</b> Offshore Petroleum <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority’s</b> (“NOPSA”) functions and the establishment of a national offshore regulator, this Article determines that while the integration of well management into NOPSA’s functions has been a valuable and a significant improvement. There is still a likelihood that differing standards applied to the regulation of petroleum facilities (“Safety Case Regime”) and wells (“Good Oilfield Practice”), multiple regulators, and regulatory disjuncture may continue to contribute to facility incidents. This Article concludes that the establishment of the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Authority, the retainment of the Joint Authority, and the enhancement of NOPSA’s functions to include environmental management have created a regulatory framework that is complex, increasingly convoluted, and has not addressed the root cause of facility incidents in Australia’s offshore petroleum jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{national}} {{database of}} the use of stallions, supplied by the Department of Animal Registration and Breeding Organization of the Hungarian <b>National</b> Food <b>Safety</b> <b>Authority</b> was analyzed {{for the purpose of this}} research. 680 foaling data of 7 horse breeds was processed during the work. The factors effecting gestation length were examined by univariate analysis of variance (GLM). Breed, month of mating, method of fertilization, age of the mare, and sex of the foal were considered as fixed effects, and the sire was used as random effect in the study. The population genetic parameters of gestation length and the breeding value of sires were also estimated. The overall mean value of gestation length was 334. 1 ± 2. 62 days. The longest gestation length (336. 2 days) was detected in the Kisberi breed while the Shagya had the shortest (333. 3 days). Differences between the breeds were not significant. The effect of month of mating and effect of sex of foal on the gestation length were statistically proven (P< 0. 01). The mares fertilized in March and April had the longest gestation lengths 342. 4 days, 341. 4 days, respectively. In the cases of mares fertilized in later months of the year the gestation length was about 10 days shorter. Fillies had longer gestation length (335. 6 days), than colts (333. 5 days). Method of fertilization and age of the mare had no significant effect on the gestation length. The effects of sire on the gestation length were significant (P< 0. 05). The heritability (h 2) of gestation length was 0. 18. Based on the analysis it can be presumed, that if the mares are kept in a suitable environment (professional nutrition, good health and breeding practices), well-balanced gestation parameters can be expected in the case of any genotypes...|$|R
