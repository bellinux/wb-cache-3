We find a substantial {{increase in the number of}} directors holding equity capital in the firms in which they hold their directorships.

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on productive internationalisation (international fragmentation, global value chains, channel perspective, {{are some of}} the terms used to describe this more general phenomenon) has focused on strategies based on <b>non</b> <b>equity</b> inter firms relations, involving both single firms and local production systems. While equity-based forms of internationalisation have been amply analysed, {{there is a lack of}} information on the extension and characteristics of non equity-based forms. The intra-industry trade stemming from <b>non</b> <b>equity</b> relations has been studied with reference to different types of empirical evidence: some early efforts were based on the analysis of temporary import export flows; later contributions analysed bilateral trade flows, in the light of the sequence of the production phases, aggregated at the minimum geographical scale available. In this paper we propose a new methodology that extends the latter approach by considering micro data instead of aggregated information. Knowing both the production phases realised by the single firm and the type of goods the firm imports and exports from/to specific countries, our methodology allows to identify both the various forms of production internationalisatio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{the choice of the}} {{governance}} form of strategic alliances. We survey arguments inspired by the transaction cost economics tradition and other contractual perspectives on the theory of the firm, according to which such choice mainly depends on the transaction cost economizing properties of different organizational forms. We proposes additional considerations based on evolutionary and competence based theories of the firms which emphasize the role of interactive learning in shaping forms ’ decisions. In the empirical section, we analyze a sample composed of 140 bilateral contractual (i. e. <b>non</b> <b>equity)</b> agreements and equity joint ventures concluded in the period 1983 -’ 86 by 68 North American, European and Japanese enterprises out of the world largest firms in Information Technology industries. In accordance with the results of previous studies informed by transaction cost economics, the estimates of a logit econometric model provides evidence that firms tend to resort to equity forms to govern complex transactions. On the contrary, for collaborations in the technological sphere {{they are more likely to}} use contractual modes. More importantly, the form of alliances proves to be dependent upon the technological capabilities of partner firms, with the probability that a given collaboration be a joint venture decreasing with the degree of overlapping of firms’ patterns of technological specialization...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{theoretical}} papers on Transaction Cost Economy, {{several studies have}} addressed the problem of designing governance forms in inter-firm relationship. Scholars have deeply investigated the problem and several theories have been proposed to face with it. The biopharmaceutical industry {{is one of the}} most interesting testbed for understanding dynamics and rationality of governance forms in IFRs; indeed, in this industry the advent of the biotechnology has not been disruptive as in other industries, so that the new comers, the biotech companies, and the incumbents, the pharmaceutical ones, have incurred in several types of IFRs such as licencing agreements, <b>non</b> <b>equity</b> alliances, equity alliances and mergers and acquisitions. Thus, several papers have tried to investigate what kind of drivers influence the choice of the governance form in this industry, but most of them have focused on general characteristics of inter-firm agreements, such as the investment specificity, the number of prior ties, the technology distance and so forth. Differently from other researchs, in this paper, we focus on specific characteristics of IFRs in the biopharma industry and we build a theoretical framework consisting of 13 drivers that are able to influence the governance mode of IFRs in this industry. We test our theoretical framework through an explorative empirical analysis. Even if more confirmative empirical analysis is needed, the empirical results evidence the validity of the theoretical framework proposed in this paper and provide some interesting managerial implications...|$|E
40|$|Die vorliegende Studie bietet eine erste Bewertung der Auswirkungen internationaler Produktion auf die Dynamik regionaler Integration in Europa. Was die Rolle ausländischer Direktinvestitionen angeht, so sind die anfänglich sehr hohen Erwartungen mittlerweile der Skepsis gewichen. Auf der Grundlage oftmals impliziter regionsübergreifender Vergleiche wird hier festgestellt, daß Direktinvestitionen in Zentral- und Osteuropa niedrig sind, daß sie keine nennenswerten Technologietransfers und 'backward linkages' mit sich bringen, und daß die Aussichten für die europaweite Entwicklung 'transnationaler Produktionsnetzwerke' bestenfalls unsicher sind. Es wird argumentiert, daß Verallgemeinerungen auf der Basis von Direktinvestitionsziffern mehr verschleiern als enthüllen. Daher wird hier die Entwicklung von 'Outward-Processing-Verkehr' zwischen der Europäischen Union und Zentral- und Osteuropa als {{alternative}} Quelle herangezogen, um einige der Transformationen zu kennzeichnen, welche das europäische Integrationsmodell im Augenblick durchmacht. " (Autorenreferat) "This {{paper offers}} a first {{assessment of the}} contribution of international production to the dynamics of regional integration in Europe. After very high expectations, there is increasing scepticism concerning the rote of foreign direct investment as an engine {{of growth in the}} region. On the basis of often implicit cross regional comparisons, it is argued that the level of foreign direct investment in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) is low, that it does not lead to significant technology transfers and backward linkages, and that the prospects for 'cross national productions networks' to develop continent-wide are at best uncertain. The paper argues that generalisations based an foreign direct investment figures hide more than reveal and looks at the development of outward processing traffic between the European Union (EU) and CEE as an alternative source of evidence to characterise some of the transformations that the European model of integration is undergoing. It finds that EU firms, mainly medium sized German companies, make an important use of <b>non</b> <b>equity</b> forms of international production when expanding eastwards. The resulting patterns of cooperation are 'fluid', but not necessarily precarious. In fact, they are an ideal vehicle for implementing new flexible methods of production which have greater potentials for spillovers and 'multiplier effects'. Overall, these patterns of cooperation give rise to different market linkages that hardly fit into static categories, a process in which policy makers have only little say.

40|$|Default {{probability}} is {{a fundamental}} variable determining the credit worthiness of a firm and equity volatility estimation {{plays a key role}} in its evaluation. Assuming a structural credit risk modeling approach, we study the impact of choosing different <b>non</b> parametric <b>equity</b> volatility estimators on default probability evaluation, when market microstructure noise is considered. A general stochastic volatility framework with jumps for the underlying asset dynamics is defined inside a Merton-like structural model. To estimate the volatility risk component of a firm we use high-frequency equity data: market microstructure noise is introduced as a direct effect of observing noisy high-frequency equity prices. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis is conducted to (i) test the performance of alternative non-parametric equity volatility estimators in their capability of filtering out the microstructure noise and backing out the true unobservable asset volatility; (ii) study the effects of different non-parametric estimation techniques on default probability evaluation. The impact of the non-parametric volatility estimators on risk evaluation is not negligible: a sensitivity analysis defined for alternative values of the leverage parameter and average jumps size reveals that the characteristics of the dataset are crucial to determine which is the proper estimator to consider from a credit risk perspective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the determinants of}} cross-border asset holdings on cross-country data and a Swedish data set. We focus our analysis {{on the effect of}} the euro not only for the determinants of bond holdings, but also of equity and banking assets. With the help of a simple theoretical model, we attempt to disentangle the different effects that the euro may have had on asset holdings for both euro zone countries and countries outside of the euro zone such as Sweden. We find evidence that the euro has implied 1) a unilateral financial liberalization which makes it cheaper for all countries to buy euro zone assets. For bonds and equity holdings, this would translate into a 14 % and 17 % decrease in transaction costs. Using Swedish data, we find that the effect is larger for flows than for stocks. 2) a preferential financial liberalization which on top of the previous effect has decreased transaction costs inside the euro zone by 17 % and 10 % for bonds and equity respectively. 3) a diversion effect {{due to the fact that}} lower transaction costs inside the euro zone have led euro countries to purchase less <b>non</b> euro <b>equity.</b> Our empirical analysis also suggests that the elasticity of substitution between bonds inside the euro zone is higher than between bonds denominated in different currencies.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the role}} of private equity investors in solving asymmetric information problems and the relationship to underpricing, wealth loss for pre-existing shareholders {{and the cost of}} going public. According to certification theory, companies backed by private equity investors are expected to have lower underpricing at the moment of an initial public offering, as they have fewer adverse selection problems, and there is less ex-ante uncertainty. However, the relationship between private equity backing and the cost of going public to issuers is less clear. We use a data set of 66 private equity-backed and 94 non-private equity-backed companies that went public on the Milan Stock Exchange between January 1998 and June 2008. Our findings provide evidence that out of the PE-backed firms, only those backed by private equity syndication show lower initial-day returns and indirect issuance opportunity cost, while there is no difference in the certification role between bank-related and <b>non</b> bank-related private <b>equity</b> investors. We also find that the benefits persist for IPOs backed by private equity syndication, although to a lesser extent, even after adjusting for direct costs (gross spreads) the opportunity cost of issuance.

The results for the variables of value and performance demonstrated sensitivity depending {{on the concept of}} family firms used. For family firms under the wider concept (CF 1), the results for creating value and operating performance are lower than private non-family companies.
