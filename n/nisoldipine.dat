40|$|We {{have studied}} the action of {{nifedipine}} and <b>nisoldipine</b> on the contractile activity of human isolated coronary arteries and human isolated auricular and ventricular muscles. <b>Nisoldipine</b> depressed dose dependently the spontaneous rhythmic contractions displayed by the coronary artery preparations and at 1 nM abolished these contractions. <b>Nisoldipine</b> was twenty times more potent than nifedipine as an inhibitor of increase in tone induced by depolarization (100 mM K+). The rhythmic activity induced by serotonin (10 microM) was about five times more sensitive to <b>nisoldipine</b> than to nifedipine. In both auricular and ventricular preparations, isoprenaline evoked {{an increase in the}} rate of force development and in the rate of relaxation.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the calcium entry blocker <b>nisoldipine</b> on ATP {{catabolism}} in the rat heart, perfused according to Langendorff. Even 1 nM <b>nisoldipine</b> induced vasodilatation; concentrations of 30 nM and higher caused significant negative inotropy. The drug had a very strong affinity for silicon rubber tubing. Myocardial ischaemia was induced by lowering the perfusion pressure, which reduced flow without <b>nisoldipine</b> by 85 %. The efflux of purine nucleosides and oxypurines rose 14 fold. <b>Nisoldipine</b> reduced this efflux of ATP catabolites dose-dependently. The highest concentration, 300 nM, suppressed ischaemic purine production completely. The action of the drug was antagonized by an increase in Ca 2 +-concentration in the perfusion fluid. We also showed the protective effect of <b>nisoldipine</b> on adenine nucleotides in freeze-clamped hearts. A concentration of 20 nM partially prevented the reduction of ATP and adenylate energy charge due to ischaemia.

40|$|The circulatory {{consequences}} of slow-calcium channel blockade {{with a new}} dihydropyridine <b>nisoldipine</b> were evaluated at rest and during exercise-induced angina in 16 patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. In 10 patients resting cardiac stroke output (thermodilution) and pulmonary artery occluded pressure were determined following four intravenous <b>nisoldipine</b> injections (cumulative dosage of 1, 2, 4 and 8 micrograms kg- 1). The exercise effects of <b>nisoldipine</b> were evaluated by comparing {{the effects of the}} 8 micrograms kg- 1 cumulative dosage with a control exercise period at the same workload. At rest <b>nisoldipine</b> reduced systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure, and increased heart rate, cardiac and stroke volume indices. During 4 min supine-bicycle exercise <b>nisoldipine</b> reduced systemic mean arterial pressure and vascular resistance; this resulted in augmented cardiac and stroke volume indices at an unchanged pulmonary artery occluded pressure. In six additional patients rest and exercise ejection fractions were measured using a nonimaging nuclear probe. <b>Nisoldipine</b> (4 micrograms kg- 1) resulted in a small trend to increase left ventricular rest and exercise ejection fraction.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the response of plasma levels of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) to dynamic exercise in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic stable angina pectoris and positive exercise tolerance test, before and after treatment with the calcium antagonist <b>nisoldipine</b> (20 mg/day buccally for 7 days). Plasma ET- 1 levels and hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure and heart rate) were determined at rest, at peak exercise and recovery. All patients had a positive electrically and clinically stress test and all of the eight patients did not developed ECG signs of myocardial ischemia after <b>nisoldipine</b> administration. Before <b>nisoldipine</b> treatment the plasma ET- 1 levels did not increase significantly during exercise. After <b>nisoldipine</b> treatment the plasma ET- 1 levels were significantly lower at rest and during exercise compared with those revealed before calcium antagonist treatment.

Neither <b>nisoldipine</b> nor nifedipine was associated with significant subjective benefit at these doses. Two hours post-dosing, exercise capacity improved after both <b>nisoldipine</b> (duration + 37 s,?< 001; time to angina + 67 s,?< 001; time to significant ST depression + 60 s,?< 001) and nifedipine (duration + 21 s, ns; time to angina + 56 s, P< 005; time to significant ST depression + 49 s P < 0 - 05). However, this improvement was not maintained 12 h post-dosing. Ambulatory monitoring did not demonstrate {{a significant reduction in}} the amount of silent or total ischaemia following the addition of either nifedipine or <b>nisoldipine</b> to atenolol monotherapy. There {{was no significant difference between}} nifedipine and <b>nisoldipine</b> in any parameter tested. In conclusion, like slow-release nifedipine 20 mg, the effective duration of anti-ischaemic action of <b>nisoldipine</b> 10 mg is less than 12 h.

40|$|Systemic and {{coronary}} hemodynamic {{effects of}} the new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist <b>nisoldipine</b> were studied over a 30 -minute period in 12 patients with angina pectoris. Previously instituted beta-blocker therapy was continued. <b>Nisoldipine</b> was administered in an intravenous bolus of 6 micrograms/kg over 3 minutes. Heart rate increased as mean aortic pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased in all patients. Cardiac output increased significantly, from 5. 8 +/- 0. 3 to 7. 9 +/- 0. 5 liters/min, 10 minutes after <b>nisoldipine</b> infusion.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{mechanisms by}} which dihydropyridine-type calcium antagonists lead to regression of hypertension-related cardiac hypertrophy have not been clarified. We previously showed that angiotensin II (AII) and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) induce protein synthesis in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes, probably through protein kinase C (PKC) as second messenger and the gene product of the early growth response gene- 1 (Egr- 1) as third messenger. We now show that the dihydropyridine derivative <b>nisoldipine</b> inhibits AII- and ET- 1 -induced protein synthesis at low concentrations (IC 50 7. 5 nM for 0. 1 microM ET). Induction of c-fos and Egr- 1 mRNA by AII and ET was completely blocked by <b>nisoldipine.</b> Therefore, <b>nisoldipine</b> may influence the signal transduction pathway, i. e., through PKC. These results provide a potential pressure-independent mechanism by which <b>nisoldipine</b> may influence development of cardiac hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim was {{to assess}} the effect of <b>nisoldipine</b> on left {{ventricular}} systolic and diastolic function during prolonged myocardial ischaemia. METHODS: The left circumflex coronary artery was ligated for 2 h and reperfused for 4 h in 12 calves. The animals were randomised to a control group (n = 6) or to treatment with 1. 25 mg. h- 1 intravenous <b>nisoldipine</b> (n = 6) during 2 h of ischaemia. Circulatory support by a ventricular assist device was performed throughout the experiment except for the time of haemodynamic measurements. Regional wall thickening of a normal and an ischaemic left ventricular region was determined using pairs of ultrasonic crystals. Left ventricular pressure was measured by micromanometry. Left ventricular wall thickness and regional wall stiffness at a common preload of 10 mm Hg were calculated using an elastic model with shifting asymptote. RESULTS: Ten animals survived after 6 h. No difference was observed in systolic function between controls and <b>nisoldipine</b> treated animals. Systolic thickening of the ischaemic wall remained depressed 4 h after reperfusion and showed some recovery after dopamine infusion. Ischaemic wall stiffness at a common preload was lower after <b>nisoldipine</b> during ischaemia and reperfusion than in controls. Control wall stiffness remained unchanged during the whole experiment with and without <b>nisoldipine.</b> Diastolic thinning of the ischaemic wall was prevented by <b>nisoldipine</b> during ischaemia and after reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged myocardial ischaemia is associated with increased myocardial stiffness of the ischaemic wall. Mechanical unloading can help to bridge the acute phase but cannot prevent postischaemic diastolic dysfunction of the ischaemic wall. <b>Nisoldipine</b> has a beneficial effect on regional diastolic function during ischaemia and reperfusion by decreasing regional wall stiffness and preventing diastolic thinning of the ischaemic wall...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Earlier {{angiographic}} {{studies have}} suggested that calcium antagonists may prevent the formation of new coronary lesions and the progression of minimal lesions. Conversely, a meta-analysis suggested that these drugs may increase cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether <b>nisoldipine</b> retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis or reduces the occurrence of clinical events. DESIGN AND SETTING: The NICOLE study (<b>NIsoldipine</b> in COronary artery disease in LEuven) is a single centre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial with coronary angiography at baseline, six months, and three years of follow up. PATIENTS: 826 patients who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty were randomised to <b>nisoldipine</b> 40 mg once daily or placebo. The intention to treat and per protocol population consisted of 819 and 578 patients, respectively. RESULTS: In the per protocol population, 625 of the <b>nisoldipine</b> treated and 655 of the placebo treated patients (NS) showed angiographic progression in at least one coronary arterial segment, defined as an increase in diameter stenosis of > or = 13 %. The average minimum luminal diameter of the non-dilated lesions decreased by 0. 163 mm and 0. 167 mm in the <b>nisoldipine</b> and placebo groups, respectively (NS). The respective numbers of new lesions detected were 7 and 13 (NS). In the intention to treat population, the rates of death, stroke, and acute myocardial infarction were similar in both treatment groups. However, <b>nisoldipine</b> use was associated with fewer revascularisation procedures and thus the percentage of patients with any clinical event was lower (44. 6 % v 52. 6 %, p = 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Nisoldipine</b> has no demonstrable effect on the angiographic progression of coronary atherosclerosis or the risk of major cardiovascular events but its use is associated with fewer revascularisation procedures. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the concentration-dependent effects of <b>nisoldipine,</b> a dihydropyridine Ca 2 + channel blocker, on K+ currents in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. Myocytes in the conventional whole-cell configuration were bathed in normal Tyrode's solution or K+-free Tyrode's solution for the measurement of the effects of 0. 01 – 100 μM <b>nisoldipine</b> on rapidly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKs), inwardly rectifying K+ current (IK 1), and reference L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa,L). <b>Nisoldipine</b> inhibited IKr with an IC 50 of 23 μM, and IKs with an IC 50 of 40 μM. The drug also had weak inhibitory effects on inward- and outward-directed IK 1; the IC 50 determined for outward-directed current was 80 μM. Investigation of <b>nisoldipine</b> action on IKs showed that inhibition occurred in the absence of previous pulsing, and with little change in the time courses of activation and deactivation. However, the drug-induced inhibition was significantly weaker at ⩾+ 30 mV than at + 10 mV.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>nisoldipine</b> on {{regional}} myocardial perfusion and neuro-hormonal status were assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 32 patients. All patients had ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 25 % and 35 %; per protocol, they were stratified according to concomitant use of ACE inhibitors. After baseline measurements at rest, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with Tc-MIBI, plasma neuro-hormones (norepinephrine, renin, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide) and echocardiography, {{the patients were}} randomized to <b>nisoldipine</b> (core coat tablet, 20 mg once daily; n = 16) or placebo (n = 16). Measurements were repeated after 8 weeks. SPECT data were analysed qualitatively (visual comparison by blinded observer) and quantitatively to derive an index of hypoperfusion representing {{the percentage of the}} left ventricular mass with Tc-MIBI activity below normal. At baseline, all patients had left ventricular areas with reduced Tc-MIBI uptake and 29 patients also had increases in plasma neuro-hormones. With <b>nisoldipine,</b> the extent of hypoperfusion (quantitative analysis) was reduced in 8 / 14 patients vs only 2 / 14 patients with placebo (P = 0. 046, 2 -tailed test). The benefit of <b>nisoldipine</b> was similar in patients with or without ACE inhibitor therapy and was also confirmed by the visual analysis of the data.

40|$|In smooth {{muscles of}} the rabbit {{coronary}} artery, <b>nisoldipine</b> inhibited the phasic and tonic responses of the contraction induced by 128 mM K (the IC 50 values were 4 X 10 (- 8) M and 1 X 10 (- 13) M, respectively). This agent also inhibited the tonic response of the acetylcholine (ACh) (10 (- 5) M) -induced contraction (the IC 50 value was 3 X 10 (- 10) M), but only slightly inhibited the phasic response (in 10 (- 7) M, 0. 86 times the control). <b>Nisoldipine</b> (less than 10 (- 7) M) {{had no effect on}} the K-induced depolarization of the membrane at any given concentration. This drug (5 X 10 (- 8) M) did inhibit the oscillatory potential changes and spike potential evoked on the ACh-induced slow depolarization. After depletion of stored Ca from the polarized muscles (5. 9 mM K), muscle cells accumulated Ca by application of 2. 6 mM Ca without generation of contraction, i. e. a subsequently applied 20 mM caffeine produced the contraction in Ca-free solution. <b>Nisoldipine</b> (less than 10 (- 7) M) had little effect on this accumulation of Ca. The rate of rise and time to reach the maximum amplitude of the 128 mM K- or ACh-induced contraction (in 2. 6 mM Ca) depended on the amount of stored Ca in cells. <b>Nisoldipine</b> (10 (- 8) M) consistently inhibited the Ca-induced contraction evoked in depolarized muscles (128 mM K), regardless of the amount of stored Ca. However, this agent (10 (- 8) M) did not inhibit the Ca release from storage sites evoked by activation of the muscarinic receptor. After prolonged superfusion (over 120 min) with Na- and Ca-free solution (guanethidine and atropine were present), application of 2. 6 mM Ca produced contraction which was inhibited by 10 (- 8) M <b>nisoldipine,</b> while the depolarization induced by application of these solutions was not inhibited by <b>nisoldipine.</b> In saponin-skinned muscles, <b>nisoldipine</b> had no effect on the contractile proteins, as estimated from the pCa-tension relationship, or on the Ca accumulation into the Ca release from the Ca storage sites, as estimated from the caffeine-induced contraction.

Cardiac output was not significantly affected. Transmural myocardial blood flow and vascular conductances increased dose-dependently after <b>nisoldipine.</b> The elevation in {{blood flow to the}} left ventricle favoured epicardial layers. Endocardial blood flow showed small increases as the changes in conductance of the endocardial layer more than compensated for the loss in perfusion pressure. The endo-epi blood flow ratio decreased from 1. 16 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 70 +/- 0. 01. Myocardial O 2 -consumption was unaltered as the decrease in arterial-coronary venous O 2 -content difference (30 %) was balanced by the increase in transmural blood flow. <b>Nisoldipine</b> increased blood flow to skeletal muscle (500 %), stomach (50 %) and adrenals (25 %), but decreased that to the liver (50 %), spleen (25 %) and kidneys (25 %). No changes were noticed in the small intestine, skin and brain. In spite of differential effects on blood flow, vascular conductance in all organs and tissues, {{with the exception of the}} liver, increased. After beta-adrenoceptor blockade the responses of mean arterial blood pressure, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance to <b>nisoldipine</b> remained virtually unchanged, but the elevations in heart rate and LV dP/dt max were abolished, as was the decrease in left ventricular filling pressure. A higher dose of <b>nisoldipine</b> was required after beta-adrenoceptor blockade to elicit significant vasodilatation in the epi- and endocardial layers. However, the reduction in endo-epi blood flow ratio by <b>nisoldipine</b> was not affected by propranolol.

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of <b>nisoldipine</b> on chronically underperfused {{myocardial}} areas ("hibernating myocardium"), the global and regional left ventricular (LV) function was analyzed before and after 2 months of double-blind monotherapy with <b>nisoldipine</b> (10 mg twice daily) or placebo in 17 patients with a previous anterior myocardial infarction. The baseline LV ejection fraction ranged from 34 to 51 %, and no patient had heart failure. Compared to placebo, <b>nisoldipine</b> significantly lowered the LV systolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure (- 3 vs. + 6 mmHg with placebo; p < 0. 01) and the LV pressure {{at the time of}} mitral valve opening (- 2. 0 +/- 3. 4 vs. + 3. 5 +/- 3. 0 mm Hg; p < 0. 01). Despite this reduction in driving pressure, the global LV early peak filling rate improved only with <b>nisoldipine</b> and this improvement was related to a selective increase in the expansion rate of the anterior areas, from 1, 010 +/- 360 to 1, 339 +/- 496 mm 2 /s (p < 0. 001). The time to regional peak filling rate (- 8 %; p < 0. 01), the asynchrony of diastolic wall motion, and the regional ejection fraction (33 +/- 10 to 38 +/- 12 %; p < 0. 001) also improved in the anterior areas with <b>nisoldipine</b> but not with placebo. In contrast, in the inferior control zones, the regional ejection fraction and filling rate remained unchanged, both when compared to baseline and to placebo.

The drug was delivered either 30 min before ischaemia, {{at the onset}} and after 30 min of ischaemia and during reperfusion only. Cardiac protection was evaluated in terms of recovery of left ventricular pressure during reperfusion, release of creatine phosphokinase (CPK), mitochondrial function, tissue content of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP), calcium homeostasis and the occurrence of oxidative stress, established measuring content and release of reduced and oxidized glutathione.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new HPLC-UV diode array procedure applied to follow the hydrolytic degradation of two well-known 4 -nitrophenyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine derivatives, nitrendipine and <b>nisoldipine</b> is reported. Hydrolysis of each drug were carried out in ethanol/Britton–Robinson buffer at different pHs, stored into amber vials at controlled temperatures of 40, 60 and 80 °C and periodically sampled and assayed by HPLC. Nitrendipine degradation in different parenteral solutions was also evaluated. The HPLC procedure exhibited an adequate selectivity, repeatability (1 %) and reproducibility (2 %). The recoveries were higher than 98 % with CV of 1. 13 and 1. 54 % for nitrendipine and <b>nisoldipine,</b> respectively. A significant degradation was observed at alkaline pH (pH 8) with a first order kinetic for both drugs. At pH 12, 80 °C, k values of 3. 56 × 10 − 2 h− 1 and 2. 22 × 10 − 2 for nitrendipine and <b>nisoldipine,</b> respectively were obtained.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect of}} {{long-term}} treatment with the calcium antagonist <b>nisoldipine</b> on develop-ment of hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP) was determined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) {{of the same}} age. Measurement of immunoreactive ANP in plasma provided a sensitive marker for the severity of hypertension and the associated cardiac overload. Long-term treatment with <b>nisoldipine</b> prevented the development of hypertension, the associated heart failure, and the increase of plasma levels of ANP in SHR but {{had no effect on}} systolic blood pressure, heart weight, and plasma levels of ANP in WKY. In addition, <b>nisoldipine</b> had a therapeutic effect in old SHR with manifest cardiac failure in end-stage hypertension, as evidenced not only by the reduction of blood pressure but also by the reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, of elevated immunoreactive ANP in plasma, and of increased plasma renin activity.

40|$|We {{compared}} two newer dihydropyridine-calcium antagonists (lacidipine and <b>nisoldipine)</b> {{with the}} classic prototype of this group, nifedipine, in the rat working heart preparation. The hearts were paced at a frequency of 5 Hz and perfused with Tyrode's solution of 37 degrees C. The following five parameters were determined: left ventricular pressure (LVP), maximal rate of pressure increase (+dP/dtmax), aortic output (AO), coronary blood flow (CBF), and cardiac output (CO). First, dose-response curves were constructed; from these data the EC 50 concentration {{for the three}} calcium antagonists was calculated. Subsequently, washout from the cardiac tissue for these three compounds was determined. The effects of lacidipine did not diminish during < or = 90 -min washout, whereas the effects of nifedipine disappeared completely in 10 min. The effects of <b>nisoldipine,</b> however, disappeared partly in 10 min. In separate experiments, the antiischemic activity of the three calcium antagonists was analyzed, using low-flow ischemia. The calcium antagonists were used in a concentration that produced a 60 % reduction in contractile force (EC 60). Nifedipine and <b>nisoldipine</b> caused significant improvement in functional recovery. The antiischemic properties of lacidipine could not be shown because of its slow kinetic properties with accumulation in the membrane phase and slow kinetics with the channel. <b>Nisoldipine</b> and lacidipine {{appear to be more}} potent calcium antagonists as compared with nifedipine, whereas lacidipine displays a clearly different kinetic pattern in comparison to nifedipine and <b>nisoldipine.</b> In particular, the extremely slow onset and very long duration of action of lacidipine are of interes...|$|E

40|$|Maximal {{treadmill}} {{exercise testing}} at 1, 3 and 8 hours {{was used to}} assess the onset, duration and antianginal efficacy of the d 1 hydropyridine slow channel calciumblocking agent, <b>nisoldipine,</b> in an oral dose range of 5, 10 and 20 mg. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design was used involving 12 patients with stable effort angina. Exercise tolerance was significantly increased 3 hours after each dose, when the maximal beneficial effect occurred. The improvement was observed as early as 1 hour after the 10 and 20 mg dose, and persisted for 8 hours after the 20 mg dose. At 3 hours, the onset of an exercise-induced ST segment depression of 0. 1 mV or greater was increased by 62 (p < 0. 05), 75 (p < 0. 01) and 117 seconds (p < 0. 01) with the 5, 10 and 20 mg dose of <b>nisoldipine,</b> respectively, compared with placebo. Similarly, time to onset of angina was significantly increased. The sum of exerciseinduced ST segment depression at peak exercise was significantly decreased (p < 0. 05) from 8. 7 ± 2. 3 to 6. 7 ± 1. 8 and 6. 4 ± 2. 0 mm, respectively, after the 10 and 20 mg dose of <b>nisoldipine.</b> The rate-pressure product was significantly greater with <b>nisoldipine</b> than with placebo at the onset of ischemia and at peak exercise (22. 8 ± 1. 1 versus 20 ± 1. 4 × 103 U for the 20 mg dose; p ± 0. 01).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify the {{mechanisms}} responsible for the increase in early filling rate observed during oral <b>nisoldipine</b> therapy in patients with ischaemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. For that purpose, the global and regional LV function was analysed before and after 2 months of double-blind monotherapy with <b>nisoldipine</b> (10 mg twice daily) or a placebo, in 17 patients with a previous anterior myocardial infarction. The baseline LV ejection fraction ranged from 34 - 51 % and no patient had heart failure. Compared to the placebo, <b>nisoldipine</b> significantly lowered LV systolic pressure and end-diastolic pressure (- 3 mmHg vs + 6 with the placebo; P less than 0. 01) and the LV pressure at the time of mitral opening (- 2. 0 +/- 3. 4 mmHg vs + 3. 5 +/- 3. 0; P less than 0. 01). Despite this reduction in driving pressure, the global LV early peak filling rate improved with <b>nisoldipine</b> only and this improvement was related to a selective increase in expansion rate of the anterior areas, from 1010 +/- 360 to 1339 +/- 496 mm 2. s- 1 (P less than 0. 001). The time to regional peak filling rate (- 8 %; P less than 0. 01), the asynchrony of diastolic wall motion and the regional ejection fraction (33 +/- 10 to 38 +/- 12 %; P less than 0. 001) also improved in the anterior areas with <b>nisoldipine</b> but not with the placebo.

The NICOLE study is a single-center, randomized, double-blind trial in 826 patients, who underwent a successful PTCA. <b>Nisoldipine</b> 40 mg coat-core or placebo was started the morning after the procedure and continued for 3 years. All coronary arterial segments were measured on preprocedural angiogram and on the second follow-up angiogram at 3 years. On the first follow-up angiogram at 6 months only the dilated segments were measured. Although the study is still ongoing until the primary end point is reached, we report in this study the angiographic restenosis data as well as the clinical events observed at 6 -month follow-up. The per-protocol population consisted of 646 patients. Restenosis, defined as a > or = 50 % loss of the initial gain (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criterion IV) occurred in 49 % and 55 % of the 308 nisoldipine-treated and the 338 placebo-treated patients, respectively (p = NS).
