5|$|The current {{head coach}} for the Chargers is Anthony Lynn, who {{replaced}} Mike McCoy after he was fired {{at the end of}} the 2016 season. In 2007, <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> had led the team to a win in the playoffs for the first time since Bobby Ross in 1992. Turner was fired on December 31, 2012, after six seasons in charge of the franchise. Marty Schottenheimer, the head coach before Turner, led the team into the playoffs in 2004 and 2006, but they were unsuccessful both times. Six coaches—Gillman, Don Coryell, Ross, Schottenheimer, Turner and McCoy—have led the Chargers into the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|After the {{challenges}} faced by his rookie campaign, Smith went into the 2006 season with a new offensive coordinator (<b>Norv</b> <b>Turner)</b> and an improved set of offensive weapons around him. The 49ers used their top draft choice on tight end Vernon Davis. They also upgraded their offensive backfield, trading underachieving running back Kevan Barlow to the Jets, making Frank Gore the feature back.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{entered the}} 2007 season {{learning}} under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons. <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> {{was hired as}} the head coach by the San Diego Chargers. Jim Hostler replaced Turner. Hostler's system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season. During the offseason, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith.|$|E
50|$|Mariucci {{expressed}} interest in the head coaching job of the San Diego Chargers in late 2012 with speculation of <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> departure from San Diego.|$|R
50|$|On November 2, 2016, the Vikings {{promoted}} Shurmur to interim Offensive Coordinator in {{the wake}} of <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> resignation. He was confirmed for the position for the 2017 season.|$|R
50|$|On January 17, the Browns {{also added}} Mike Sullivan as {{offensive}} line coach, Scott <b>Turner,</b> <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> son, as wide receivers coach, and Brad Roll as {{strength and conditioning}} coach.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, the Bears' {{defensive}} efforts {{failed to}} match {{the success of their}} 2005 season. Nevertheless, the team was still a notable presence in league, finishing with the league's third ranked and conference's top-ranked points allowed category. The defense's success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches. The Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers interviewed him in January 2007. He was a candidate for the vacant Dallas Cowboys head coaching position, a job that ultimately went to San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Rivera was named as a potential candidate to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer in San Diego, but the job was filled by <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner,</b> the brother of fellow offensive coordinator, Ron Turner, Rivera's offensive counterpart in Chicago. After the announcement, ESPN reported that the Bears were considering letting Rivera go. This came after several other teams interviewed him, and the negotiations between his representatives and the Bears were making little progress. On February 19, 2007, it was announced that Ron Rivera's contract with the Bears would not be renewed.|$|E
25|$|The team hired former Cincinnati Bengals {{defensive}} coordinator Mike Zimmer to replace Leslie Frazier {{as head coach}} on January 16, 2014. Former Cleveland Browns offensive coordinator <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> replaced Bill Musgrave, and George Edwards replaced Alan Williams as {{defensive coordinator}}. In the 2014 NFL Draft, the Vikings selected Anthony Barr, a linebacker out of UCLA, and Teddy Bridgewater, a quarterback out of the University of Louisville. Bridgewater would later lose the starting job to Matt Cassel only to become the starter for the Vikings when Cassel was lost to a season-ending foot injury in week 3. Star running back Adrian Peterson only played in one regular season game due to his ongoing child abuse trial, with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell placing Peterson on the Commissioner's Exempt List indefinitely. On April 16, 2015, the league released a statement issuing Peterson's reinstatement to occur on April 17, 2015. The Vikings concluded their season with seven wins and nine losses, winning only one game against a divisional opponent, although Bridgewater set a franchise record for wins by a rookie starting quarterback. On January 3, 2016, the Vikings beat divisional rival Green Bay 20–13 to win the NFC North {{for the first time}} since 2009. The Vikings, led by their top 5 defense, ended the 2015 season with an 11–5 record, and a #3 seed in the playoffs. However, they lost to the Seattle Seahawks 10–9 after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal in the third coldest game in NFL playoff history.|$|E
500|$|Although Wheatley's 2003 {{performance}} {{had been}} modest {{compared with the}} other seasons that he led the Raiders in rushing (1999, 2000), it was sufficient to convince the Raiders {{that they did not}} need to re-sign the pass catching running back Charlie Garner for the 2004 season with the new coach <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner.</b> The 2004 Raiders used a platoon of five runners (Wheatley, Crockett, Justin Fargas, J. R. Redmond and Amos Zereoué) who all rushed for between 100 and 500yards and caught between 10 and 40passes. Wheatley compiled his final 100-yard rushing game on September 26 in week 3 of the season at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers [...] with 102yards on 18 carries. [...] This was the earliest point in the season Wheatley had rushed for 100yards in a game as a professional. [...] Wheatley's career ended in week 12 of the season on November 28, 2004 in a 25–24 win over the Denver Broncos with an injury that was first described as an injured hamstring. [...] The hamstring tear turned out to be acute. [...] Wheatley had been under contract until 2009 with a 2005 base salary of $800,000 and a 2006 base salary of $2million.|$|E
50|$|The win was the Chargers' {{eighth in}} their {{previous}} nine games at Oakland. It improved <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> record to 4-2 in Chargers' season openers. Running back Ryan Mathews and receiver Vincent Brown missed {{the game with}} injuries.|$|R
50|$|Rodgers {{was also}} the {{head coach of the}} United States Football League's Memphis Showboats from 1984 to 1985 and of the Canadian Football League's Memphis Mad Dogs in 1995. He also served as the Washington Redskins {{director}} of football from 2001 to 2004. At 69, he was considered for the Redskins' head coaching position before <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> eventual firing during the 2000 season.|$|R
50|$|The 2009 San Diego Chargers {{season was}} the 50th {{season for the}} {{original}} American Football League team, and its 40th in the NFL. The Chargers improved upon their regular season record of 8-8 in 2008 and won their division for the fourth straight year and fifth time in six seasons. They finished the regular season with a 13-3 record, the second best winning percentage in franchise history but were eliminated in the Divisional Playoffs by the New York Jets. It was also <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> best regular season record as head coach.|$|R
2500|$|The 2007 San Diego Chargers {{season began}} with the team trying to equal their 2006 regular season success (14–2) and avoid another early {{departure}} in the playoffs. After a struggling start under new head coach <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> (5–5), they finished the regular season strong, with six straight wins, an overall record of 11–5, and the AFC West title. [...] More important, they went further in the playoffs than the previous year, but fell again to the undefeated New England Patriots, {{this time in the}} AFC Championship game.|$|E
2500|$|The AFC was {{coached by}} <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> of the San Diego Chargers staff, while Mike McCarthy {{and the staff}} of the Green Bay Packers coached the NFC. Three Washington Redskins players (Chris Cooley, Chris Samuels and Ethan Albright) wore #21 in memory of Taylor, their {{deceased}} teammate. The game featured 41 players appearing in their first Pro Bowl (out of 86 total players), the most in eight years. [...] In addition, the NFC played their first defensive play with only ten players on the field, lacking a free safety, in Taylor's honor.|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{choose from}} the pool of strong {{offensive}} coordinators available {{at the end of}} the 2000 campaign (including former Redskins coach <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner),</b> Dungy decided to elevate his receivers coach Clyde Christensen to the position. It can be argued that this controversial decision was the final nail in the coffin for Dungy's tenure. Although the team achieved a 97 winning record in 2001, they barely made it into the playoffs as the lowest-seeded wild card. [...] To add insult to injury, the Bucs were once again blown out by the Eagles—this time, 319.|$|E
2500|$|In Snyder's {{first season}} as owner, the Redskins went 10–6, {{including}} a four-game winning streak early in the season, and {{made it to the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> career (and the first time for the Redskins since 1992) in the final game of the season (on January 2, 2000 against the Dolphins). Running back Stephen Davis rushed for a then club-record [...] and quarterback Brad Johnson completed a then club-record 316 passes and threw for more than [...] in regular play that season. They then beat the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the Buccaneers, 14–13.|$|R
2500|$|When the Raiders signed Kerry Collins {{prior to}} the 2004 season, some thought that Gannon would be cut {{in favor of the}} strong-armed Collins, whom skeptics thought was a better fit in new coach <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> {{vertical}} offense. Gannon not only kept his starting QB spot, but thrived. He threw for 305 yards in the season opener against Pittsburgh, including a 40-yard touchdown strike to Doug Gabriel. The Raiders nearly won the game over a Steelers team that finished the 2004 season with 15 victories. The Raiders were a competitive team with Gannon as their QB, going 2–1 when he started and 3–10 after his injury.|$|R
50|$|In Snyder's {{first season}} as owner, the Redskins went 10-6, {{including}} a four-game winning streak early in the season, and {{made it to the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> career (and the first time for the Redskins since 1992) in the final game of the season (on January 2, 2000 against the Dolphins). Running back Stephen Davis rushed for a then club-record 1405 yd and quarterback Brad Johnson completed a then club-record 316 passes and threw for more than 4000 yd in regular play that season. They then beat the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the Buccaneers, 14-13.|$|R
2500|$|The 2000 season {{started with}} the {{selection}} of future Pro Bowler Chris Samuels and the tumultuous LaVar Arrington in the 2000 NFL Draft and included five consecutive wins {{in the first half}} of the season. However, they ended up going 7–6, and on December 4, 2000, <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> was fired as head coach. [...] Terry Robiskie was named interim coach to finish out the season, which ended with an 8–8 record. [...] During the final game of the season on December 24, 2000, Larry Centers became the NFL's all-time leader in catches by a running back with 685 receptions.|$|E
2500|$|Coming {{off of a}} win at Arrowhead {{that gave}} Kansas City their first win of the season, they headed to San Diego {{to take on the}} Chargers and their new head coach, <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner.</b> [...] Much like their {{previous}} game, the Chiefs began with a weak showing offensively before getting a lot of use out of their rookie wide receiver Dwayne Bowe, and a touchdown catch by Tony Gonzalez (his record-tying 62nd). [...] The TD by Gonzalez tied him with Shannon Sharpe for the most touchdown receptions by a tight end. [...] After another TD catch by Bowe, cornerback Tyron Brackenridge ran back a fumble by San Diego to effectively win the game for Kansas City.|$|E
2500|$|The 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as the {{new head}} coach, and Greg Roman {{replaced}} Johnson {{as the new}} offensive coordinator. [...] Harbaugh, a former quarterback, was the best teacher the 49ers had since <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> in Smith's second season. Harbaugh made it known to Smith that he was welcomed back on the team. Smith's family wanted him to leave San Francisco. Although he was unsigned, Smith organized the players' workouts during the 2011 NFL lockout and helped to install Harbaugh's new offense. After the lockout ended, Smith signed a one-year $5 million contract with the 49ers. Smith was named the starting quarterback heading into the regular season, and Harbaugh believed Smith could succeed in the coach's West Coast offense.|$|E
5000|$|When the Raiders signed Kerry Collins {{prior to}} the 2004 season, some thought that Gannon would be cut {{in favor of the}} strong-armed Collins, whom skeptics thought was a better fit in new coach <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> {{vertical}} offense.

50|$|This {{year would}} mark the Cowboys' {{return to the}} playoffs {{after a number of}} seasons, {{including}} a 1-15 campaign just two years prior. This also marked <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> first year as offensive coordinator under head coach Jimmy Johnson. The young offensive nucleus of Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and Emmitt Smith continued to develop, as did the offensive line, while the defense also improved. Though the Cowboys would lose in the playoffs to the Detroit Lions in the divisional round, the season was considered a resounding success, and a glimpse of things to come. Notable additions to the team this year include defensive tackle Russell Maryland, wide receiver Alvin Harper, offensive tackle Erik Williams and linebacker Dixon Edwards.|$|R
5000|$|An H-back is an {{offensive}} position in American football. The H-back lines up similarly to a tight end, but is [...] "set back" [...] {{from the line}} of scrimmage, and is thus counted {{as one of the}} four [...] "backs" [...] in the offensive formation. The H-back, while similar in name, {{should not be confused with}} [...] "halfback" [...] or [...] "running back", which are used to denote a separate, primary ball-carrying backfield position. The position was made notable in the National Football League (NFL) by the Washington Redskins under head coach Joe Gibbs, who ran a two tight end system. The position was named F-back when used later in <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> offensive system. The position is similar to that of a slotback.|$|R
2500|$|After a postseason {{loss to the}} New England Patriots, {{offensive}} and defensive coordinators Cam Cameron and Wade Phillips left for new coaching jobs with the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys respectively. Marty Schottenheimer, after originally being told he would stay as head coach, was fired in February. Replacing Schottenheimer was <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner,</b> who was signed {{to take over the}} helm later in the month. Turner, who installed the Chargers current offensive set when he was the Chargers' offensive coordinator in 2001, was selected to be the head coach largely {{due to the fact that}} he would maintain the offensive game plan that led the team to its best regular season record in team history. Turner also agreed with general manager A.J. Smith on the hiring of defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell, who had worked with Phillips when both were with the Buffalo Bills and later was the defensive coordinator with the Bills. Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Ron Rivera, who interviewed for the Chargers' head coaching job, was hired to coach the Chargers' linebackers instead. [...] Smith also re-signed Charger free agent offensive guard Kris Dielman to a six-year contract that will virtually guarantee him almost $17million and put him around $40million over the life of the deal. Linebacker Donnie Edwards was not offered a contract and signed with his former team, the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chargers released veteran wide receiver Keenan McCardell during the offseason along with safety Terrence Kiel.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the end of}} Gibbs' first tenure, the Redskins hired former Redskins player Richie Petitbon for the 1993 season. However, {{his first}} and only year as head coach, the Redskins {{finished}} {{with a record of}} 4–12. [...] Petitbon was fired {{at the end of the}} season and on February 2, 1994, <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> was hired as head coach after being the offensive coordinator of the Dallas Cowboys. 1994 was even worse as they finished 3–13, their worst season in over 30 years. Their sole bright spot that year came on October 9, 1994, linebacker Monte Coleman played in his 206th career game with the Redskins, which broke Art Monk's team record for games played (Coleman retired at season's end with 216 games played). They improved to 6–10 in 1995 where they were able to get a season sweep on the eventual Super Bowl XXX Champions the Dallas Cowboys. On March 13, 1996, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, and Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry signed a contract that paved the way for the immediate start of construction for the new home of the Redskins (now FedExField). The 1996 season saw Washington post their first winning record in 4 years by finishing 9–7. On December 22, 1996, the Redskins played their final game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, a victory over the Dallas Cowboys 37–10, and finished their tenure at the stadium with a 173–102–3 record, including 11–1 in the playoffs.|$|E
2500|$|Since Super Bowl XIII in January 1979, {{the home}} team is given the choice of wearing their colored or white jerseys. Originally, the {{designated}} home team had to wear their colored jerseys, which resulted in Dallas donning their less exposed dark blue jerseys for Super Bowl V. While most of {{the home team}}s in the Super Bowl have chosen to wear their colored jerseys, there have been five exceptions: the Cowboys during Super Bowl XIII and XXVII, the Washington Redskins during Super Bowl XVII, the Pittsburgh Steelers during Super Bowl XL, and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 50. The Cowboys, since , worn white jerseys at home; the Redskins wore white at home under coach Joe Gibbs starting in [...] through , continued by Richie Petitbon and <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner</b> through , then again when Gibbs returned from [...] through [...] Meanwhile, the Steelers, who have always worn their black jerseys at home since the AFL-NFL merger in , opted for the white jerseys after winning three consecutive playoff games on the road, wearing white. The Steelers' decision was compared with the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX; the Patriots had worn white jerseys at home during the [...] season, but after winning road playoff games against the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins wearing red jerseys, New England opted to switch to red for the Super Bowl as the designated home team. For the Broncos in Super Bowl 50, Denver general manager John Elway simply stated, [...] "We've had Super Bowl success in our white uniforms"; they previously had been [...] in Super Bowls when wearing their orange jerseys. The Broncos' decision is also perceived to be made out of superstition, losing all Super Bowl games with the orange jerseys in terrible fashion. White-shirted teams have won 32 of 50 Super Bowls to date (64 percent), including 11 of the last 12 Super Bowls.|$|E
5000|$|In Snyder's {{first season}} as owner, the Redskins went 10 - 6, {{including}} a four-game winning streak early in the season, and {{made it to the}} playoffs {{for the first time in}} <b>Norv</b> <b>Turner's</b> career, and the first time for the Redskins since 1992. One of the most important games of the regular season occurred on December 26, 1999, when the Redskins overcame a 10-point fourth quarter deficit to defeat the San Francisco 49ers 26 - 20, to give the Redskins their first NFC East crown since 1991. [...] The final game of the season, on January 2, 2000, against the Dolphins, running back Stephen Davis rushed for a club-record 1405 yd and quarterback Brad Johnson completed a club-record 316 passes and threw for more than 4000 yd. [...] They then beat the Detroit Lions in the first round of the playoffs, but lost to the Buccaneers, 14 - 13. The Redskins had a chance to win the game with a 52 yd field goal attempt in the final seconds of the game, but the snap from center Dan Turk to Brad Johnson, the holder, was off and the Bucs won. This was Dan Turk's last game in the NFL, as he died later that year of cancer.|$|R
