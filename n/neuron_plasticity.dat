The clinical reports indicate that, even with low resolution, retinal implants are potentially useful in providing crude vision to individuals who otherwise would not have any visual sensation. [...] However, clinical testing in implanted subjects is somewhat limited and the majority of spatial resolution simulation experiments have been conducted in normal controls. It remains unclear whether the low level vision provided by current retinal implants is sufficient to balance the risks associated with the surgical procedure, especially for subjects with intact peripheral vision.

Upon learning, local inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) -expressing Basket cell networks can switch to opposite configurations that either favor or interfere with further learning, but how this opposite plasticity is induced and relates to distinct learning requirements has remained unclear. Here, {{we show that}} PV Basket cells consist of hitherto unrecognized subpopulations, with distinct schedules of neurogenesis, input connectivities, output target neurons, and roles in learning. Plasticity of hippocampal early-born PV neurons was recruited in rule consolidation, whereas plasticity of late-born PV neurons was recruited in new information acquisition. This involved regulation of early-born <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity</b> specifically through excitation, and of late-born <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity</b> specifically through inhibition.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{results from}} a {{progressive}} degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system leading {{to a decline in}} movement control, with resting tremor, rigidity and postural instability. Several aspects of PD can be modeled in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, including α-synuclein-induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, or dopamine (DA) loss by genetic elimination of neural DA synthesis. Defective behaviors in this latter model can be ameliorated by feeding the DA precursor L-DOPA, analogous to the treatment paradigm for PD. Secondary complication from L-DOPA treatment in PD patients are associated with ectopic synthesis of DA in serotonin (5 -HT) -releasing neurons, leading to DA/ 5 -HT imbalance. Here we examined the neuro-anatomical adaptations resulting from imbalanced DA/ 5 -HT signaling in Drosophila mutants lacking neural DA. We find that, similar to rodent models of PD, lack of DA leads to increased 5 -HT levels and arborizations in specific brain regions. Conversely, increased DA levels by L-DOPA feeding leads to reduced connectivity of 5 -HT neurons to their target neurons in the mushroom body (MB). The observed alterations of 5 -HT <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity</b> indicate that loss of DA signaling is not solely responsible for the behavioral disorders observed in Drosophila models of PD, but rather a combination of the latter with alterations of 5 -HT circuitry...|$|E

Here, we provide structural and functional evidence for aberrant pre-mRNA splicing in a chronic type 1 model of experimental diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN). Cajal bodies (CBs), unique nuclear substructures involved in RNA splicing, increased in number in diabetic sensory neurons, but their expected colocalization with survival motor neuron (SMN) proteins was reduced – a mislocalization described in motor neurons of spinal muscular atrophy. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), also participants in the spliceosome, had abnormal multiple nuclear foci unassociated with CBs, and their associated snRNAs were reduced. CWC 22, a key spliceosome protein, was aberrantly upregulated in diabetic dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and impaired neuronal function. CWC 22 attenuated sensory <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity,</b> with knockdown in vitro enhancing their neurite outgrowth. Further, axonal delivery of CWC 22 siRNA unilaterally to locally knock down the aberrant protein in diabetic nerves improved aspects of sensory function in diabetic mice.

Dysfunction of the vestibular system can severely affect a person's quality of life. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of vestibular neuron survival, maintenance, and innervation of the target sensory epithelia is fundamental. Results Here we report that a point mutation at the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) docking site in the mouse neurotrophin tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB (Ntrk 2) specifically impairs fiber guidance inside the vestibular sensory epithelia, but has limited effects on the survival of vestibular sensory neurons and growth of afferent processes toward the sensory epithelia. We also show that expression of the TRPC 3 cation calcium channel, whose activity {{is known to be}} required for nerve-growth cone guidance induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is altered in these animals. In addition, we find that absence of the PLCγ mediated TrkB signalling interferes with the transformation of bouton type afferent terminals of vestibular dendrites into calyces (the largest synaptic contact of dendrites known in the mammalian nervous system) on type I vestibular hair cells; the latter are normally distributed in these mutants as revealed by an unaltered expression pattern of the potassium channel KCNQ 4 in these cells.

40|$|Neurons {{are born}} {{throughout}} adulthood in the hippocampus and show enhanced plasticity compared with mature neurons. However, there are conflicting reports {{on whether or}} not young neurons contribute to performance in behavioral tasks, and there is no clear relationship between the timing of maturation of young neurons and the duration of neurogenesis reduction in studies showing behavioral deficits. We asked whether these discrepancies could reflect differences in the properties of young neurons in mice and rats. We report that young neurons in adult rats show a mature neuronal marker profile and activity-induced immediate early gene expression 1 – 2 weeks earlier than those in mice. They are also twice as likely to escape cell death, and are 10 {{times more likely to be}} recruited into learning circuits. This comparison holds true in two different strains of mice, both of which show high rates of neurogenesis relative to other background strains. Differences in adult neurogenesis are not limited to the hippocampus, as the density of new neocortical neurons was 5 times greater in rats than in mice. Finally, in a test of function, we find that the contribution of young neurons to fear memory is much greater in rats than in mice.

An increase in the expression of high molecular weight isoforms of NCAM, PSA-NCAM and GAP- 43 was observed in the preoptic area and median eminence arcuate regions of hypothalamus (taking olfactory cortex and dentate gyrus region of hippocampus as controls) after estradiol+progesterone induced gonadotropin surge in ovariectomised rat model. Immunohistochemical localization of GnRH terminals and cell bodies in median eminence and preoptic area, respectively, was studied as baseline data.

40|$|Quantitative {{receptor}} autoradiography {{was used}} to map the distribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the developing rat spinal cord. Three different specific ligands, which label partially overlapping subpopulations of NMDA receptors, were used: an agonist (L-[3 H]glutamate), a noncompetitive antagonist ([3 H]MK- 801), and a competitive antagonist ([3 H]CGP- 39653). In the adult, NMDA receptors labeled with all three ligands are restricted to the substantia gelatinosa in the spinal dorsal horn. In marked distinction, at postnatal day 7 NMDA receptors labeled with L-[3 H]glutamate and [3 H]MK- 801 are present throughout the spinal gray matter. NMDA receptors in the neonatal spinal ventral horn have a higher affinity for L-[3 H]glutamate {{than those in the}} adult substantia gelatinosa. Over the second and third postnatal weeks, NMDA receptors are lost from all areas of the spinal gray matter except for the substantia gelatinosa. Neonatal NMDA receptors identified with [3 H]CGP- 39653 are restricted to the substantia gelatinosa. These results show that the immature ventral horn contains a subpopulation of NMDA receptors and raise the possibility that motor neurons transiently express NMDA receptors in early postnatal life. Ventral horn NMDA receptors may be a component of the mechanisms by which the mature phenotype of motor neurons is acquired through activity-dependent processes.

The study included 201 ischemic stroke patients, and 217 age- and sex-comparable healthy controls. The quantitative methylation level in the 14 CpG sites of the ERα promoter was measured by pyrosequencing in each participant. Multivariate regression model was used to adjust for stroke traditional risk factors. Stroke subtypes and sex-specific analysis were also conducted. The results demonstrated that the stroke cases had a lower ERα methylation level than controls in all 14 CpG sites, and site 13 and site 14 had significant adjusted p-values of 0. 035 and 0. 026, respectively. Stroke subtypes analysis showed that large-artery atherosclerosis and cardio-embolic subtypes had significantly lower methylation levels than the healthy controls at CpG site 5, site 9, site 12, site 13 and site 14 with adjusted p = 0. 039, 0. 009, 0. 025, 0. 046 and 0. 027 respectively. However, the methylation level for the patients with small vessel subtype was not significant. We combined the methylation data from the above five sites for further sex-specific analysis. The results showed that the significant association only existed in women (adjusted p = 0. 011), but not in men (adjusted p = 0. 300). Female stroke cases have lower ERα methylation levels than those in the controls, especially in large-artery and cardio-embolic stroke subtypes. The study implies that women suffering from ischemic stroke of specific subtype may undergo different protective mechanisms to reduce the brain injury...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{memory is}} {{susceptible}} to age-related impairment and relies on intact function of the entorhinal cortex. In this thesis, we examine the hypothesis that normal aging is characterized by structural degeneration of entorhinal neurons, and predict that these changes are reversible through the administration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In the medial entorhinal cortex, cell filling and spine density analysis of perforant path- projecting neurons revealed that aging results in decreased excitatory input to these neurons. Aged rats exhibited {{a significant reduction in}} the density of basilar (18. 2 %) and apical (16. 0 %) dendritic spines. Mushroom spines, the most active and stable spine type, exhibited a disproportionate decline with aging. We also found decreased density of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in the dentate molecular layer of aged rats, suggesting that aged neurons of the medial entorhinal cortex provide fewer inputs to the hippocampus. Age- related changes in neuron structure may be sensitive to brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein that influences adult <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity.</b> To test this hypothesis, we delivered BDNF to the medial entorhinal cortex through lentiviral vector administration. The expression of BDNF, but not NGF or LacZ, reversed the age- related decline in spine density and increased the density of three spine types. Furthermore, the expression of BDNF, but not EGFP, in the entorhinal cortex increased synaptophysin density in the aged rat dentate gyrus. BDNF also influences synaptic function. Based on previous experiments, we predicted that BDNF lentiviral vector delivery to the aged entorhinal cortex would increase long -term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate hilus following tetanic stimulation of the perforant path. On the contrary, we found that chronic BDNF administration significantly reduced hippocampal LTP in comparison with the responses of aged control rats or young subjects. Possible mechanisms are discussed. Collectively, these results indicate that normal aging leads to structural degeneration of perforant path-projecting neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex, and that the changes occur in plastic regions: presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated BDNF delivery to the entorhinal cortex reverses age-related structural degeneration of entorhinal neurons and modifies the function of perforant path-dentate granule cell synapse...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{abuse is}} defined as use of child or {{adolescent}} by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse {{can be in the}} form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10 - 40 %. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5 - 15 % of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during <b>neuron</b> <b>plasticity</b> phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response.

Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed.

The dependence of the distribution on the synaptic weight of the mean-field environment allows us to determine the mean synaptic weight self-consistently.
