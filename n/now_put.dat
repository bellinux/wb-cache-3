25|$|Cyclemys {{taxonomy}} and phylogeny {{have been}} historically difficult to ascertain {{due to the}} morphological similarity between species, as well as changes in the color patterns during growth. Until recently, the genus was thought to comprise {{only one or two}} morphologically variable species, C. dentata and C. oldhamii. Subsequent investigation has <b>now</b> <b>put</b> the number of species under the genus to seven, though this remains controversial. The status of C. enigmatica as a valid species is contested, as is the recognition of C. atripons and C. pulchristiata, both of which are nearly impossible to tell apart morphologically.|$|E

The plan was to seize the King and his brothers during a Twelfth-night mumming at Eltham, and establish some sort of commonwealth. Oldcastle was to be Regent, the king, nobility and clergy placed under restraint, and the abbeys dissolved and their riches shared out. King Henry, forewarned of their intention by a spy, moved to London, and when the Lollards assembled in force in St Giles's Fields on 10 January they were easily dispersed by the king and his forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} Polish {{government report}} on war damages prepared in 1947 listed 6,028,000 war victims during the German occupation (including 123,178 military deaths, 2.8 million Poles and 3.2 million Jews), {{out of a}} population of 27,007,000 ethnic Poles and Jews; this report excluded ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian losses. Losses were calculated for the territory of Poland in 1939, including the territories annexed by the USSR. The figure of 6.0 million war dead has been disputed by Polish scholars {{since the fall of}} communism who <b>now</b> <b>put</b> the total actual losses at about 3.0 million Jews and 2.0 million ethnic Poles, not including other ethnic groups (Ukrainians and Belarussians). They maintain that the official statistics include those persons who were missing and presumed dead, but actually remained abroad in the West and the USSR after the war.|$|E
25|$|These successes greatly {{encouraged}} {{the army and}} the people, who <b>now</b> <b>put</b> pressure on Belisarius to march forth into an open battle. At first Belisarius refused because of the still-great numerical disparity, but was at length persuaded, and made his preparations accordingly. The main force, under his command, would sally forth from the Pincian and the Salarian Gates in the north, while a smaller cavalry detachment under Valentinus, along with the bulk of the armed civilians, would confront the large Gothic force encamped west of the Tiber and prevent them from participating in the battle, without however engaging it in direct combat. Initially, because of the poor quality of the Roman infantry, Belisarius wished the battle to be restricted to a cavalry fight, but was persuaded by the pleas of two of his bodyguards, Principius and Tarmutus, and positioned a large body of his infantry under them as a reserve and rally point for the cavalry.|$|E

25|$|Late on June 27, when PAGASA {{made their}} first few bulletins on Gorio, Public Storm Signal #1 {{has been raised}} mostly over Regions VIII and a few islands over XIII. The agency advised {{residents}} living in low-lying and mountainous areas under public storm warning signals to be alert against possible flash floods and landslides. On June 29, Gorio made landfall over eastern Samar. As the JMA upgraded Gorio to Tropical Storm Rumbia, Signal #2 were <b>now</b> <b>put</b> up over Region V and VIII, whilst Signal #1 were put up over southern Luzon, Visayas and northern Mindanao. PAGASA also upgraded Rumbia to a tropical storm. In Manila, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority's(MMDA) Monsoon Task Force deployed 200personnel to 11station in the local metropolitan area to monitor flooding and traffic conditions, as well as assist in potential rescue situations. The authority also requested the dismantling of all outdoor advertisements and billboards. Army rescue trucks were also on standby in Guadalupe, Makati. The Philippine government allocated ₱6.9million in relief funds {{to deal with the}} effects of Rumbia. The Department of Social Welfare and Development in Eastern Visayas activated rapid response teams and prepared 1,040family food packs for potential delivery in disaster areas. The department also readied ₱263,920 in standby food funds and ₱1.7million in food items, as well as ₱270,350 in standby non-food funds. The civil defense office in the province also called for the preemptive evacuation of citizens in potentially affected areas. Local disaster management units in Caraga were activated, with 2,000family food packs readied and a standby fund totaling ₱300,440. In total, the cost of prepositioned food packs, standby funds, food items, and other relief materials in Eastern Visayas and Caraga amounted to ₱6.9million.|$|E

The attack began with a concentrated artillery barrage at 17:00. This was very effective and stunned the defenders. Two regiments from the crack 308th Division attacked starting at 20:00. At 04:00 the following morning, an artillery shell hit the battalion headquarters, severely wounding the battalion commander and most of his staff.|$|E

Summoning a jury from their number– which was legal because two North Carolina magistrates were present– the colonists selected random prisoners and charged them with crimes ranging from theft to arson to murder. By evening, the jury had convicted thirty-six prisoners and sentenced them to hang. After the first nine hangings, however, Shelby ordered them stopped.

The college was facing a shortfall of at least £500,000 in 2009 and its auditors expressed doubt about RNC's ability to continue as a going concern. In response Ian Pickford said that much of thePoint4's costs had been paid for through donations and that the shortfall issue was being addressed through cutbacks, including some redundancies. Of the auditors' concerns he said; [...] "I think post the banking crisis a lot of auditors are incredibly nervous about making bland statements in terms of the future of organisations and therefore they frequently <b>now</b> <b>put</b> those sort of caveats in to protect their position going forward." ...|$|E

500|$|British {{critics were}} {{especially}} enthusiastic about Nicolas Roeg's direction. In {{the view of}} Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look <b>Now</b> <b>put</b> him [...] "right {{up at the top}} as film-maker". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined [...] "that handful of names whose appearance {{at the end of the}} credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: [...] "Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection." [...] American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of [...] "those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading [...] "makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [...] Scott and [...] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is [...] "a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions", while Pauline Kael labelled him [...] "chillingly chic" [...] in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to [...] "maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it".|$|E
