40|$|This paper {{addresses}} contemporary theoretical {{arguments about}} how the digital image is not principally visual, is beyond representation, and how this constitutes a significant break between chemical and digital photography. Henning uses 1930 s American urban documentary photographs, particularly by John Gutmann and Helen Levitt, to rethink the assumptions about analogue, chemical photography implicit in such theories. The street {{is a place where}} these photographers found the traces of activities and encounters that are not always explicit or observable, but happening off-scene, inside buildings and basements, or at <b>night.</b> <b>Photographs</b> by Gutmann and Levitt challenge the idea that pre-digital photography was concerned with visual truth, or was a static and direct record or representation of events, people and places. They also allow us to engage in new ways with the differences and connections between contemporary mobile photography and older documentary and street photography practices...|$|R
