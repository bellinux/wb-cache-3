50|$|Georgia {{was named}} among the highest-emigration {{countries}} in the world (with respect to population) in the 2007 World Bank report. The 2002 population census in Georgia revealed a <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>loss</b> of 1.1 million persons, or 20% of the population, since the early 90s. The decline in Georgia's population is caused by the emigration in search of employment, and a sharp fall of birth rates. Over 300,000 Russians, 200,000 Georgians, 200,000 Armenians, 85,000 Greeks, 50,000 Azerbaijanis, 50,000 Ukrainians and 20,000 Jews have migrated from Georgia since independence.|$|E
40|$|The {{region of}} Québec {{comprises}} nine counties {{and at the}} time of the 1961 census had a total population of 643, 843 inhabitants. The author briefly describes the physical characteristics of the region and shows that its unity resides in the dominating influence of Québec, regional capital. In the study of the settlement, the author's analysis is devoted particularly to a criticism of the « rang » System of rural settlement. The growth of the population is rather appreciable even though all of the counties except Québec experience a <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>loss.</b> The pattern of urban influence seems unbalanced. The Québec agglomeration alone includes more than half of the population of the region. Aside from Québec, the region has only small towns with population smaller than 5, 000. In order to retain its importance, the region needs to undergo development in all sectors of its economy, particularly in that of secondary industry, which is currently somewhat retarded...|$|E
40|$|This {{annual report}} is the 15 th {{in a series}} that {{examines}} trends in temporary and permanent migration to and from New Zealand. The report updates trends to 2014 / 15 and compares recent immigration patterns with patterns identified in previous years. Canterbury returns to normal Canterbury had the second highest regional net migration gain of 6, 400 people. A net outflow of permanent and long-term migrants followed the earthquake in February 2011, but since 2011 / 12 the number of arrivals has steadily increased. Although {{the number of people}} approved for Essential Skills work visas in Canterbury in 2014 / 15 increased, it was a much smaller increase than in the previous three years, suggesting the rebuild might have reached capacity. Net migration continues to grow A net migration gain of 58, 300 people occurred in 2014 / 15, the highest net gain ever recorded. This was due to a low <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>loss</b> of New Zealand citizens (5, 600 people) combined with a large net gain of non–New Zealand citizens (63, 900 people). Net migration is forecast to rise slightly until September 2015 before dropping back. International student numbers on the increase again A total of 84, 856 international students were approved to study in New Zealand, an increase of 16 per cent from 2013 / 14, the second year-on-year increase. China has remained the largest source country of international students (27 per cent) followed by India (23 per cent) and South Korea (6 per cent). Numbers of temporary workers increased across the three main work categories A total of 170, 814 people were granted a work visa, an increase of 10 per cent from 2013 / 14. Those approved to work in New Zealand under the Essential Skills policy rose 8 per cent from 2013 / 14. This was the third year-on-year increase in Essential Skills workers since the global financial crisis, and it reflects the ongoing demand for labour in New Zealand. One in six international students gained residence International students have become an important source of skilled migrants for New Zealand and in other OECD countries. By 30 June 2015, 17 per cent of students had transitioned to residence five years after their first student visa. In 2014 / 15, 43 per cent of skilled principal migrants were former international students. Skilled principal migrants largely have New Zealand work experience Research shows migrants have better employment outcomes if they have New Zealand work experience. By 30 June 2015, 18 per cent of temporary workers had transitioned to residence three years after their first work visa Permanent migration In 2014 / 15, 43, 085 people were approved for resident visas, down 2 per cent from 2013 / 14. The increase in those approved under the Skilled/Business stream (6 per cent increase) was not enough to offset the decrease in those coming through the Family stream (down 14 per cent). India is the largest source of skilled migrants In 2014 / 15, 21, 165 people were approved through the Skilled Migrant Category, almost half of all residence approvals (49 per cent). The number of Skilled Migrant Category approvals increased 4 per cent from 2013 / 14. China is the largest source country of family-sponsored migrants In 2014 / 15, 8, 922 people were approved for residence through the Partnership Category and 4, 477 people were approved through the Parent Category. Family approvals made up 35 per cent of all residence approvals. Around half of International/Humanitarian Stream approvals were from Pacific countries Over 1, 400 people were approved residence through the Samoan Quota Scheme and Pacific Access Category in 2014 / 15, with Samoa and Tonga being the largest source countries of approvals.  ...|$|E

40|$|Both natural {{increase}} and internal migration have played {{roles in the}} shaping of population distribution of Finland since 1900. Far reaching recent changes in the economy have brought about massive shift of jobs from agriculture to manufacturing and services. As a result people have relocated from rural to urban areas. Both natural change and <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> have distinct geographical patterns, resulting in serious depopulation in remote areas {{in the east and}} north of the country. Internal migration benefits the south, the west, coastal areas, urban agglomerations and suburban areas. International migration is a marginal phenomenon in Finland and has little impact on population dynamics. <b>Net</b> <b>migration</b> <b>losses</b> in the past were offset by high {{natural increase}} and in recent decades Finnish emigrants have returned. Urban concentration is a dominant feature of the Finnish migration system. At the subregional level, suburbanisation is visible, but is not as strong as in the overcrowded metropolises of Western Europe. The relationships between migration and size of municipality, migration and population density and migration and urban/rural class of municipalities show that the process of concentration is the strongest force at work in shifting people to urban agglomerations and their suburban rings. Regional patterns of migration show strong transfers of population from north and east to south and to lesser extent to west of the country. The Baltic Sea coast has a strong attraction to migrants. Migration is sex-selective, with a much higher propensity of females to leave remote and rural areas and migrate to urban centres and {{the southern part of the}} country. The result is a significant gender imbalance: a deficiency of females in rural areas and in the north and east of the country and a surplus in urban and semi-urban areas. However, the economic indicator unemployment has a rather weak and imprecise effect on migrants...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides a}} statistical overview of major migration trends and regional differences in Europe and pays {{special attention to}} trends in <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> During the past decades, Europe saw substantial positive migration gains, which accelerated in the early 2000 s. There are large regional differences in net migration: southern Europe, and especially Spain, experienced massive immigration in 2000 - 2008 while many countries in south-eastern, eastern and central Europe registered <b>migration</b> <b>losses.</b> In total, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> in Europe amounted to 28. 4 million in 1980 - 2008, of which 22. 2 million `net migrants' were reported in European Union (EU) countries. In 2000 - 2009, the EU population gained almost 15 million through <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> This number {{is higher than the}} total for the previous four decades, making the European Union a more important migration destination than the United States during this period.

50|$|The <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate is the {{difference}} between the number of immigrants (people coming into an area) and the number of emigrants (people leaving an area) throughout the year. When the number of immigrants is larger than the number of emigrants, a positive <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate occurs. A positive <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rates indicates that there are more people entering than leaving an area. So when we have more emigrants than immigrants the result is a negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> rate, meaning that more people are leaving than entering the area.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{migration}} on population growth {{has become a}} ubiquitous argument in UK immigration debates, leading {{to the introduction of}} immigration restrictions to reduce <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and prevent the UK population from reaching 70 million. Taking the UK as a case study, this article assesses the rationale for setting a national <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> target as a pivotal point for migration policies and the feasibility of limiting <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> using immigration controls. A framework for analysing the effects of <b>migration</b> policies on <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> is proposed and applied to UK official migration data. The results show that, due to various policy constraints, competing objectives and unintended feedbacks, it is neither optimal nor entirely feasible to prioritize a reduction of <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> as a target for migration policies.

This methodology is predicated on the observation that migration rates have a very different age pattern from death rates; it is only when this condition is true that <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> and deaths can be distinguished.

30|$|As {{explained}} before, Bruni and Venturini (1995) {{distinguish between}} migration pressure, measured as excess labour force or {{size of the}} non-employed population, and actual migration. The former is determined by macro-level economic factors while actual emigration and immigration is determined by micro-level factors where migration depends on a person’s propensity to migrate. Thus, {{it is possible that}} in a positive economic growth scenario migration pressure decreases because employment opportunities increase, while actual emigration also increases. The latter may occur if the propensity to emigrate rises. Therefore, migration assumptions for population scenarios up to 2050 do not conflict with inferences derived from results of those population scenarios regarding migration pressure (i.e. changes {{in the size of the}} non-employed population). Since immigration and, in particular, emigration statistics are often unreliable, we use migration assumptions expressed in <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> numbers. Baseline and historical <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> estimates were obtained from databases maintained by the UN (e.g. Preston et al. 2001). For the business-as-usual scenario, we adopted the United Nations medium variant <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> assumptions (UNPD 2016). The open economies scenario assumes higher <b>net</b> negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> up to 2020 than in the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, as emigration is expected to increase in the take-off stage of development while immigration hovers around a constant low level. Between 2020 and 2025, growth of emigration is expected to level off and decrease when production and numbers of jobs start increasing. Return migration and immigration also increases, so that by 2025, negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> is at the BAU level, and by 2030, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> has become zero. Between 2030 and 2050, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> turns positive, and by 2050, it has reached a historically high (positive) level. The reason for this pattern of change is that, initially, during the take-off stage of economic growth, it takes time before sufficient numbers of quality and adequately paid jobs are generated which make many prospective migrants decide to stay and attract immigrants and return migrants. The closed economies scenario assumes that emigration increases while immigration and return migration become very low leading to an increase in negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> after 2025 to a historically high level of negative <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> number by 2050. In all scenarios, <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> numbers are redistributed to sex and age groups according to model age schedules of migration, while change over time is assumed to unfold in a linear way (Rogers and Castro 1981; UN 1992).|$|R
40|$|This study models {{population}} {{in the state of}} Arkansas using a small econometric model, and is similar to a previous demographic model developed by Fullerton and Barraza de Anda (2008). The components of population change consist of births, deaths, and <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> Births minus deaths equal natural increase, and {{population in}} the current period is population from the previous period plus natural increase plus <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> Births and deaths are modeled as functions of a one period autoregressive lag as well as national trends. <b>Net</b> <b>migration</b> is also modeled as a one period lag of itself in addition to relative labor market conditions. Results confirm that births and deaths contain strong inertial components. National trends positively affect births and deaths as well. <b>Net</b> <b>migration</b> also contains a strong inertial component. Additionally, relative labor market conditions also influence migration. Specifically, if employment in Arkansas increases relative {{to the rest of the}} country, Arkansas will experience positive <b>net</b> <b>migration.</b> Out of sample simulations are conducted in order to further test model validity. Simulation results are reasonable and follow recent trends. Natural increase and <b>net</b> <b>migration</b> are expected to decrease. Accordingly, population growth is expected to slow down. Experimentation with alternate specifications in addition to using different assumed growth rates for the exogenous variables is suggested. Furthermore, modeling population in nearby regions may assist in confirming, or rejecting, the results obtained in this study. ...|$|R
