50|$|Actovegin is a deproteinated, pyrogen- and antigen-free hemodialysate of calf blood. It is {{manufactured}} from calf {{blood in}} several steps by ultrafiltration: here, the manufacturer uses different cut off sieves: first, an ultrafiltration step employing a cut off of 6 kD is performed, {{followed by a}} vacuum distillation step and removal of the precipitate by filtration (0.45 urn) and titration to pH 6.8. Afterwards, the product is subjected to sterile filtration with prefilters of 0.2 pm and 0.45 pm and stored at 2-6 °C for more than 14 days and subsequently filtered (0.45 pm) and again titrated to pH 6.8. After subsequent pH titration steps, the product is again subject to filtration (7 pm and 0.2 pm) and another ultrafiltration step with a lOkDa cut off, followed by sterile filtration with prefilters of 0.45 pm and 0.2 pm. After another storage period at 2-6 °C for more than 56 days, the final precipitate is removed by filtration (0.45 pm) and diluted to a <b>nominal</b> <b>concentration</b> to 200 mg/ml dry weight. Finally, deproteinization is completed by sterile filtration with prefilters of 0.2 pm and 0.45 pm. The analysis of the final product shows that it contains a mixture of natural substances: both inorganic components like common blood electrolytes (e.g. chloride, phosphate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, several sources for nitrogen, amino acids, peptides, glucose, acetate and lactate) and organic components like amino acids, a number oligopeptides, nucleosides, glycosphingolipids and products of the intermediary metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{exposure}} to cigarette smoke {{leads to an}} array of complex responses including apoptosis, cellular senescence, telomere dysfunction, cellular aging, and neoplastic transformation. To study the cellular response to cigarette smoke, a common in vitro model exposes cultured cells to a <b>nominal</b> <b>concentration</b> (i. e. initial concentration) of soluble cigarette smoke extract (CSE). However, we report that use of the <b>nominal</b> <b>concentration</b> of CSE as the only measure of cellular exposure is inadequate.

As found in other similar xenobiotic assays, our work suggests that the effective dose of CSE is more accurately related to the amount of bioavailable chemicals per cell. In particular, interactions of CSE components both with cells and other physical factors limit CSE bioavailability, as demonstrated by a quantifiably reduced cellular response to CSE that is first modified by such interactions. This has broad implications for the nature of cellular response to CSE exposure, and for the design of in vitro assays using CSE...|$|E

30|$|Whereas the {{toxicity}} of dispersions {{can only be}} expressed {{on the basis of}} <b>nominal</b> <b>concentrations,</b> {{the toxicity}} of filtrates can be expressed in terms of either <b>nominal</b> or analytical <b>concentrations.</b> Therefore, the toxicity results for the small TiO 2 particles varied from no toxicity at all, to EC 20 values of several mg/L (dispersions or filtrates expressed as <b>nominal</b> <b>concentrations)</b> to EC 20 values of several µg/L (filtrates expressed as analytical concentrations). Effect concentrations are used to trigger hazard statements, and according to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC, not readily biodegradable substances with a low solubility in water (≤ 1  mg/L) and a log Kow ≤  3 are classified as harmful for the aquatic environment if the ErC/LC 50 is between 10 and 100  mg/L. If the ErC/LC 50 is below 1  mg/L they are classified as very toxic to aquatic organisms. Therefore, the conclusions drawn with respect to the toxicity of nanomaterials and the resulting consequences will differ depending on whether total concentrations from dispersion testing or concentrations in filtrates are used to calculate toxicity indicators. Because information on the toxic fraction of dispersed nanomaterials is still limited, <b>nominal</b> <b>concentrations</b> currently appear to be more suitable for effect characterization. This may be revised, and recalculation of the toxicity may be possible, when more information about the toxic fractions of nanomaterials becomes available.
