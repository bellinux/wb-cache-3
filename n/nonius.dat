5|$|The Prince of Lobkowitz, who in 1854 {{became the}} head of Mezőhegyes, {{stressed}} the importance of fixing the type– that is, making the characteristics of a breed of animal genetically homogenous– of the horses. This goal was achieved by linebreeding, though the one season that <b>Nonius</b> Senior served his own daughters was notably unsuccessful: of the 33 foals, 11 died while only 2 were broodmare-quality and 1 was stallion-quality. However, with more experimentation, the <b>Nonius</b> breed emerged as a uniformly heavy but elegant military driving and carting horse. In 1865, Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions were bred to <b>Nonius</b> Senior's female descendants in the hopes of correcting a lack of balance and elegance among the <b>Nonius</b> horses. <b>Nonius</b> Senior stood at stud for 22 years. By the end of his breeding life, he had served mares of Arabian, Lipizzan, Thoroughbred, Spanish and Norman blood. Fifteen of Nonius's sons in turn stood at stud, and 122 of his daughters were used as broodmares.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Norman {{was used}} to create several other breeds of horses {{throughout}} Europe and Asia. These included the Greek Andravida, which was created by crossing native Greek mares with Anglo-Norman stallions, and the Swiss Freiberger, a blend of Anglo-Norman lines with Thoroughbreds and native horses from the Jura Mountains. The Hungarian <b>Nonius</b> breed stems from an Anglo-Norman stallion named <b>Nonius</b> Senior, and Anglo-Norman blood was also used to add refinement to the German Oldenburg, through the stallions Condor (born 1950) and Furioso II, a Selle Français. The Anglo-Norman {{was used to}} create the Polish Sokolsky horse and the Chinese Heihe breed.|$|E
5|$|Today {{estimates}} put {{the population}} of <b>Nonius</b> horses at about 450 mares and 80 stallions. The largest population is found at Mezőhegyes, with other herds in Romania, Bulgaria, and the Serbian province of Vojvodina.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Nonius</b> is {{commonly}} crossed with Thoroughbreds to create riding horses with improved jumping ability. Members of the breed {{have also been}} crossed with Furioso-North Star, Thoroughbred and Shagya Arabian blood to breed warmbloods in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help meet the demand for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted agile, responsive, impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, resilient mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling these demands led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier <b>Nonius.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to {{the written}} standard, the Austrian Warmblood {{is built on}} a mare base of old Austrian cavalry horses such as the <b>Nonius,</b> Furioso-North Star, Shagya and Gidran. Foreign warmblood sport horse bloodlines have been and will {{continue}} to be used to produce a horse more suitable for modern-day dressage and show jumping. Refinement comes from Thoroughbred, Shagya Arabian and Trakehner blood. The combination of the plain <b>Nonius</b> type and the Arabian-influenced Shagya and Gidran suggest a broad range of distinctive types, particularly about the head.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Nonius,</b> Furioso-North Star, Shagya, Gidran, {{and several}} other strains are often collectively {{referred}} to as the Altösterreichische Pferderassen ("Old-Austrian Horse Breeds"). These horses formed the native mare base on which the Austrian Warmblood was founded.|$|E
25|$|Pedro Nunes, one of {{the first}} Europeans to apply {{mathematics}} to cartography, discovered the concept of rhumb lines, later applied to the Mercator projection, which, in 1569, revolutionized cartography. He was also the inventor of several measuring apparatus, including the <b>nonius,</b> to measure fractions of a degree.|$|E
25|$|Nunes, {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the greatest mathematicians of his time, is best known for his contributions in the nautical sciences (navigation and cartography), which he approached, for the first time, in a mathematical way. He was the first to propose the idea of a loxodrome, and was the inventor of several measuring devices, including the <b>nonius</b> (from which Vernier scale was derived), named after his Latin surname.|$|E
25|$|While the AWÖ {{does not}} {{disallow}} any colors or markings, the Old Austrian Warmbloods {{tended to be}} of uniform color, allowing them to be matched better in harness configurations. For instance, the <b>Nonius</b> is almost uniformly dark and unmarked, the Gidran is entirely chestnut, the Shagya largely grey, and so on. Therefore, coat colors apart from the usual black, brown, bay, chestnut, and grey would likely need to be introduced from an outside source. While there is a Pinto studbook under the ZAP, none of the stallions presently standing for Austria are of unusual coat colors.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 160s, Fronto's {{son-in-law}} Victorinus was stationed as a legate in Germany. He {{was there with}} his wife and children (another child had stayed with Fronto and his wife in Rome). The condition on the northern frontier looked grave. A frontier post had been destroyed, and it looked like all the peoples of central and northern Europe were in turmoil. There was corruption among the officers: Victorinus had to ask for the resignation of a legionary legate who was taking bribes. Experienced governors had been replaced by friends and relatives of the imperial family. Lucius Dasumius Tullius Tuscus, a distant relative of Hadrian, was in Upper Pannonia, succeeding the experienced Marcus <b>Nonius</b> Macrinus. Lower Pannonia was under the obscure Tiberius Haterius Saturnius. Marcus Servilius Fabianus Maximus was shuffled from Lower Moesia to Upper Moesia when Marcus Iallius Bassus had joined Lucius in Antioch. Lower Moesia was filled by Pontius Laelianus' son. The Dacias were still divided in three, governed by a praetorian senator and two procurators. The peace could not hold long; Lower Pannonia did not even have a legion.|$|E
500|$|The {{roles and}} {{popularity}} of the <b>Nonius</b> breed were affected by periods {{of social and political}} upheaval. In 1900 the utilitarian quality and modest appearance of the <b>Nonius</b> horses won the breed the title of [...] "Ideal Horse" [...] at the Paris Exposition Universelle. While the Mezőhegyes Stud continued to hold the main population of <b>Nonius</b> horses, the stud at Debrecen developed their own strain of the breed, beginning in 1948. This variety, which tended to be heavier than many of the Mezőhegyes Nonius', was called Hortobagyi <b>Nonius</b> or the Hortobagy Landrace. The two sub-types were combined into one breed in 1961.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Nonius</b> breed {{owes its}} name to its {{foundation}} sire, though since his male descendants share his name, he is called [...] "Nonius Senior". <b>Nonius</b> was born in 1810 in Calvados, Normandy, France. His sire was named Orion, and, while sources differ on his breeding, he was either a Thoroughbred, a Norfolk Trotter {{or a combination of}} the two. <b>Nonius</b> Senior's dam was a Norman mare, making him an Anglo-Norman horse. He was captured from the French Stud at Rosières-aux-Salines during the Napoleonic Wars and brought to Mezőhegyes in 1816.|$|E
500|$|Close linebreeding {{during the}} breed's {{establishment}} and {{continued use of}} a closed studbook have contributed to a recognizable and reliably-transmitted type in the <b>Nonius.</b> The vast majority are black, dark bay or brown, either unmarked or modestly marked with white. Bay individuals are more common among the <b>Nonius</b> horses from Hortobágy National Park. The breed is also known for the heavy but proportional head with a convex profile called either a ram's head or Roman nose. The breed exhibits traits common to heavy-boned driving and light draft horses: powerful and arched high-set neck, broad and muscular back, open but powerful loin, deep and sloping hindquarters. The chest is broad rather than deep, and is usually more shallow than the hindquarters. The hooves and joints are large and the legs are dry. <b>Nonius</b> horses stand between [...] One of the heaviest warmblood driving horses, the ideal <b>Nonius</b> has a [...] measurement of [...] and a cannon circumference of [...] <b>Nonius</b> horses are also known for a kind, even temperament and great willingness and capacity for work both in harness and under saddle. In addition they are usually easy keepers with high endurance.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{technological advances}} of World War II displaced the <b>Nonius</b> {{as a military}} horse, {{and it was then}} directed towards agriculture instead. However, the depredations of the war severely damaged the breed, {{and by the time the}} war was over, there were only around 50 mares of the breed left. However, the damage that the property, supplies, and livestock of Mezőhegyes suffered during the war were steadily rebuilt up through the 1960s, and by 1954 there were 120 mares at the Mezőhegyes stud alone. Communist Hungary was not supportive of horseback riding, and in the years between 1947 and 1961, more Hungarian horses were killed for meat than were casualties of the war. Attempts to produce sport-oriented horses from <b>Nonius</b> stock were largely unsuccessful, though during the 1970s combined driving emerged as a popular horse-sport at which the <b>Nonius</b> could excel. In 1989 the <b>Nonius</b> Horse Breeders National Association was formed to protect the purebred <b>Nonius</b> horse. In 1999, UNESCO named the Hortobágy National Park to the World Heritage List (WHL), due in part to its history of livestock breeding, including such breeds as the <b>Nonius</b> horse and Mangalitsa pig. In 2000, the State Stud-Farm Estate of Mezöhegyes was added to the UNESCO Tentative List (which makes it eligible to be nominated for the WHL), due to being a [...] "major centre and organisational example of the highest standard horse-breeding and animal husbandry." ...|$|E
500|$|The <b>Nonius</b> (...) is a Hungarian horse breed {{named after}} its Anglo-Norman {{foundation}} sire. Generally dark in color, it is a muscular and heavy-boned breed, similar in type to other light draft and driving horses. The breed was {{developed at the}} Imperial Stud at Mezőhegyes, Hungary by careful linebreeding. Originally bred {{to serve as a}} light draft and utility horse for Hungary's military, the breed became a useful agricultural horse during the 20th century. The depredations of World War II significantly reduced the Nonius' population, and in the decades after the war, a downturn in the usage of horses in Hungary sent many members of the breed to slaughter. Today the breed is bred by preservationists and is used in agriculture, leisure riding, and competitive driving sports. The largest numbers of <b>Nonius</b> horses are still found at Mezőhegyes, with representatives in other eastern European nations as well.|$|E
500|$|Even as a foal he was {{considered}} ugly. At maturity, the light bay stallion stood about [...] high. Whether he possessed all of the conformational traits attributed to him– a list that includes most major failings– is hard to know. The qualities of his descendants suggest that he had, at the very least, a very plain head. [...] "Without special beauty in [...] looks," [...] <b>Nonius</b> at first did not serve many mares at Mezőhegyes. It was not until his offspring began {{to show that they}} were not so unfortunate as their sire, and additionally possessed uncommon endurance and power, that his popularity began to rise. Going forward, his mates at Mezőhegyes were the fashionable daughters of Spanish-Neapolitan stallions, descended from the Arabian-impressed Hungarian stock.|$|E
500|$|They {{are used}} today in {{agricultural}} work, light draft and {{the sport of}} combined driving. The popularity of driving sport in Hungary rose sharply during the 1970s and 1980s. The Combined Driving World Championships are held every 2 years, and the most competitive event features teams of four horses. Of the 6 champions named between 1974 and 1984, all but one were Hungarian. The <b>Nonius</b> is slower and less suitable for other riding sports like dressage and show jumping than lighter horses. Smaller members of the breed with larger amounts of Arabian blood in their ancestry are more sought after as riding horses. The heavier horses are still commonly used for draft work, and are well-adapted to the [...] "heavy terrain" [...] of the Great Hungarian Plain.|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by Jacques André of Book XII shows it contains 58 quotations from named authors, and 293 borrowed but uncited usages: 79 from Solinus; 61 from Servius; 45 from Pliny the Elder. Isidore takes care to name classical and Christian scholars whose material he uses, especially, {{in descending order}} of frequency, Aristotle (15 references), Jerome (10 times), Cato (9 times), Plato (8 times), Pliny, Donatus, Eusebius, Augustine, Suetonius, and Josephus. He mentions as prolific authors the pagan Varro and the Christians Origen and Augustine. But his translator Stephen Barney notes as remarkable that he never actually names the compilers of the encyclopedias that he used [...] "at second or third hand", Aulus Gellius, <b>Nonius</b> Marcellus, Lactantius, Macrobius, and Martianus Capella. Barney further notes as [...] "most striking" [...] that Isidore never mentions three out of his four principal sources (the one he does name being Pliny): Cassiodorus, Servius and Solinus. Conversely, he names Pythagoras eight times, even though Pythagoras wrote no books. The Etymologies are thus [...] "complacently derivative".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>nonius</b> {{was used}} by Tycho Brahe, who {{considered}} it too complex. The method inspired improved systems by Christopher Clavius and Jacob Curtius. [...] These were eventually improved further by Pierre Vernier in 1631, which reduced the <b>nonius</b> to the Vernier scale that includes two scales, one of them fixed and the other movable. Vernier himself {{used to say that}} his invention was a perfected <b>nonius</b> {{and for a long time}} it was known as the “nonius”, even in France. In some languages, the Vernier scale is still named after Nunes, for example [...] in Swedish.|$|E
2500|$|A {{dedication}} from Großbottwar in Baden-Württemberg [...] can be precisely {{dated to}} the year 201 CE by mention of the two consuls, L. Annius Fabianus and M. <b>Nonius</b> Arrius Mucianus: ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{created the}} <b>nonius</b> {{to improve the}} astrolabe's accuracy. [...] This {{consisted}} {{of a number of}} concentric circles traced on the astrolabe and dividing each successive one with one fewer divisions than the adjacent outer circle. [...] Thus the outermost quadrant would comprise 90° in 90 equal divisions, the next inner would have 89 divisions, the next 88 and so on. [...] When an angle was measured, the circle and the division on which the alidade fell was noted. [...] A table was then consulted to provide the exact measure.|$|E
2500|$|The Austro-Hungarian empire {{was known}} for its horse {{breeding}} programs which {{were based on a}} number of imperial stud farms. The role of these farms was to produce farm horses for the citizens, riding and carriage horses for the nobility, cavalry mounts and artillery horses for the military. Although the former empire is also famed for producing the Kladruber and Lipizzaner, prominent among these stud farms were those located at Mezőhegyes and Bábolna. The former was founded in 1785, the latter was purchased by the government in 1789, and both are located in modern-day Hungary. Mezőhegyes produced the <b>Nonius,</b> which was similar to the western Heavy Warmbloods, used for light agricultural work and for pulling artillery wagons. Beginning in the 1840s, Thoroughbred stallions - Furioso and North Star prominent among them - were bred to the <b>Nonius</b> mares to produce strains of more refined cavalry mounts and carriage horses. [...] Bábolna was originally an extension of Mezőhegyes, but in 1816 the administration decided to use only Arabian and Arab-bred stallions to achieve their cavalry goals. Born in Syria in 1830, the part-Arabian horse Shagya became the most famous of these Arabian-bred stallions. He came to Bábolna in 1836 and founded a strain of light cavalry and carriage horses which were taller and heavier than purebred Arabians, but which retained distinct Arabian type. A chestnut Arabian named Gidran followed soon after, crossed on mares who were more Thoroughbred in type. Respectively, these two sires founded the Shagya Arabian and Gidran Anglo-Arabian breeds.|$|E
2500|$|The heavy warmbloods (...) are a {{group of}} horse breeds {{primarily}} from continental Europe. The title includes the Ostfriesen ("East Friesian") and Alt-Oldenburger ("Old-Oldenburger"), Groningen, and similar horses from Silesia, Saxony-Thuringia, and Bavaria. Breeds like the Hungarian <b>Nonius,</b> Kladruber, and Cleveland Bay are also often classed as [...] "heavy warmbloods." [...] They are the ancestors of the modern warmbloods, and are typically bred by preservation groups to fit the pre-World War model of the all-purpose utility horse. Unlike the registries of the sport horses that followed them, many heavy warmblood registries maintain closed or partly closed studbooks. However, external evaluation and performance testing of the breeding stock is still {{a key element in}} these registries. Many of the heavy warmbloods are selected primarily for family-friendly temperaments.|$|E
2500|$|Julia {{died from}} {{malnutrition}} {{some time after}} Augustus' death in 14, but before 15. With her father dead and no sons to take the throne, Julia was left completely {{at the mercy of}} the new emperor, Tiberius, who was free to exact his vengeance. The circumstances of her death are obscure. One theory is that Tiberius, who loathed her for dishonouring their marriage, had her starved to death. Another theory is that upon learning her last surviving son Agrippa Postumus had been murdered, she succumbed to despair. Simultaneously, her alleged paramour Sempronius Gracchus, who had endured 14 years of exile on Cercina (Kerkenna) off the African coast, was executed at Tiberius' instigation, or on the independent initiative of <b>Nonius</b> Asprenas, proconsul of Africa. Julia's daughter Julia the Younger was also exiled in 8 AD on a charge of adultery on the same island as her mother - but actually for involvement in the attempted revolt by her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus - [...] and died in 29 AD after 20 years of exile; she was also forbidden to be buried in Augustus' tomb by his will.|$|E
