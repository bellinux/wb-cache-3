25|$|The newly resettled peasants {{had largely}} failed to secure loans from {{commercial}} banks {{because they did}} not have title over the land on which they were resettled, and thus could not use it as collateral. With no security of tenure on the farms, banks have been reluctant to extend loans to the <b>new</b> <b>farmers,</b> many of whom do not have much experience in commercial farming, nor assets to provide alternative collateral for any borrowed money.|$|E
25|$|Because the Mississippi Delta {{contained}} so much fertile bottomland {{that had}} not been developed before the Civil War, 90 percent of the land was still frontier. After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and raising timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> included many freedmen, who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands by the late 19th century. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.|$|E

25|$|More {{economic}} changes {{emerged in the}} late 2000s when Chinese investors began moving to Saskatchewan and brokering land deals. MaxCrop (a Regina-based agriculture company) is {{a major player in}} these agreements; the organization finds farmland investors among Chinese and South Korean investors and partners them with local farmers who grow crops which are then sold to customers in China. While MaxCrop’s involvement has increased farming activity throughout the province, concerns are emerging about the financial barrier of entry for <b>new</b> <b>farmers.</b> Furthermore, some local farmers have expressed concern that Chinese and South Korean investors may be purchasing land that is not ideal for farming.|$|E
25|$|Early farming {{equipment}} {{relied heavily}} on horses. Labour on the farm could not be performed by farmers alone; cultivation technologies were not sophisticated, so devices such as harrows, carriages and harvest racks were the standard. Steam-powered farming machinery {{began to appear in}} southern Saskatchewan in the 1920s, which created much public attention for farmers using the machines. Despite fascination with the new technologies, the machinery disappeared from Saskatchewan farms during the 1930s; the machines were not economically viable amid the Great Depression. This resulted in a renaissance for horses, and early farming technology returned to regular use. It wasn’t until the 1940s that farming machinery would see a resurgence amid a flourishing post-World War II economy. The average fee for farming equipment was $40,000-$50,000. Ever since that time, farm machinery has been evolving technologically and quickly climbing in price. Today, the necessary farm machines cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This high price creates great difficulty for <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> wishing to enter the industry.|$|E
500|$|According to Wilkinson, in {{the months}} leading up to the alleged kidnapping, Jernigan had come to Wilkinson's office several times {{demanding}} money he claimed he was owed from his prior business dealings with Wilkinson. Wilkinson said he had been making the requested payments, but that when he refused Jernigan's request on April 10, Jernigan presented him with a four-page suicide note, then produced a pistol and told Wilkinson, [...] "I'm going to kill you first." [...] Wilkinson further alleged that Jernigan forced him to drive to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Frankfort, a hotel Wilkinson owned, at gunpoint. The two spent the night at the hotel, and sometime during the night, Wilkinson contacted James Aldridge, president of <b>New</b> <b>Farmers</b> National Bank in Glasgow, Kentucky. Wilkinson, who owned an interest in <b>New</b> <b>Farmers</b> National Bank, told Aldridge he needed $500,000 as soon as possible. The next day, Wilkinson and Jernigan flew to Glasgow aboard a plane operated by Wilkinson Flying Service, another company owned by Wilkinson. Wilkinson said Jernigan threatened to kill employees at the company if Wilkinson attempted to alert them. Aldridge met Wilkinson and Jernigan with the money Wilkinson had requested at the Glasgow Municipal Airport. Upon their arrival, Wilkinson paid Jernigan $500,000 and was released unharmed.|$|E

500|$|As attorney-general, Brownlee {{had played}} a major role in the {{creation}} of the Alberta Wheat Pool. [...] As premier, he continued his support of it. [...] In May 1927 he attended the Second International Cooperative Wheat Pool Conference in Kansas City, where he spoke on the importance of wheat pools in ensuring that farmers received [...] "not occasionally, but with reasonable regularity, the cost of production plus an adequate and substantial return for [...] labor and investment". [...] On his return to Alberta, he participated in a rally to encourage farmers to sign on with the pool; the effort enticed several <b>new</b> <b>farmers,</b> including the manager of the Prince of Wales' ranch, to join. [...] On a July 1927 trip to Europe, he investigated the possibility of marketing Alberta wheat directly to European millers, rather than passing it through multiple grain buyers, exporters, shippers, and importers, but found that European millers feared that buying directly from foreign sources would alienate domestic producers.|$|E
2500|$|Soldiers {{who were}} {{successful}} in gaining such a block of land {{had the opportunity to}} start a farming life in a number of rural activities including as wool, dairy, cattle, pigs, fruit, fodder and grain. [...] These initial land allotments resulted in triumph for some and despair for others. [...] Indeed, specifically following World War I, in some cases these <b>new</b> <b>farmers,</b> unable to cope with the climatic variances of Australia and devoid of the capital to increase stock or quality of life, simply walked off the land back to the large towns and cities from whence they had come.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, {{a county}} task force {{was created to}} {{determine}} if a farmers market could be successful if it were located adjacent to the Eugene Saturday Market. [...] The concept was to offer an open-air venue for local growers to market their produce directly to the public. [...] The Eugene Saturday Market organization would oversee the <b>new</b> <b>farmers</b> market. [...] Based on the task force's recommendation, the county approved the first farmers market in August 1979. [...] It was held on Saturday in a parking lot adjacent to the Saturday Market. [...] The Lane County Farmers Market became an independent organization in 1989. [...] While it has not been as successful financially as the Saturday Market, the farmers market is still open from April through November ever year.|$|E
