Systems are said to be in equilibrium if the small, random exchanges between them (e.g. Brownian motion) do not lead to a net change in energy. This law is tacitly assumed in every measurement of temperature. Thus, if one seeks to decide if two bodies are at the same temperature, it is not <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them into contact and measure any changes of their observable properties in time. The law provides an empirical definition of temperature and justification for the construction of practical thermometers.|$|E

25|$|The Peruvian {{government}} actively {{seeks to}} attract both {{foreign and domestic}} investment in all sectors of the economy. International investment was spurred by the significant progress Peru made during the 1990s toward economic, social, and political stability, but it slowed again after the government delayed privatizations and as political uncertainty increased in 2000. President Alejandro Toledo has made investment promotion a priority of his government. While Peru was previously marked by terrorism, hyperinflation, and government intervention in the economy, the Government of Peru under former President Alberto Fujimori took the steps <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> those problems under control.

25|$|In Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches, an {{entrance}} is a procession {{during which the}} clergy enter into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors.

Over the centuries, these processions have grown more elaborate, and nowadays are accompanied by incense, candles and liturgical fans. In the liturgical theology of the Orthodox Church, the angels are believed to enter with the clergy into the sanctuary, as evidenced by the prayers which accompany the various entrances.|$|E

This was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> dynamism and cohesiveness into an industry, shunned by leaders in the past, ignored by investors who were inhibited {{by the lack of}} incentive to invest in projects which were uncertain of a satisfactory return. The new Minister Hon. J. R.

25|$|When hunter-gathering {{began to}} be {{replaced}} by sedentary food production it became more profitable to keep animals close at hand. Therefore, it became <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> animals permanently to their settlements, although in many cases there was a distinction between relatively sedentary farmers and nomadic herders. The animals' size, temperament, diet, mating patterns, and life span were factors in the desire and success in domesticating animals. Animals that provided milk, such as cows and goats, offered a source of protein that was renewable and therefore quite valuable. The animal’s ability as a worker (for example ploughing or towing), as well as a food source, also had to be taken into account. Besides being a direct source of food, certain animals could provide leather, wool, hides, and fertilizer. Some of the earliest domesticated animals included dogs (East Asia, about 15,000 years ago), sheep, goats, cows, and pigs.|$|E

The {{site of a}} {{training}} centre for aspiring Olympic athletes, in 2008, the city had no world-class level athletic facilities fit for international competition. To get the city ready for the Olympics, the Russian government committed a $12 billion investment package, shared 60%–40% {{between the government and}} private sector. According to some estimates, the investments <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the location up to Olympic standards may have exceeded that of any previous Olympic games. By January 2014 the construction costs had been reported to exceed the $50 billion mark, making it the most expensive Olympic Games in history. According to a report by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, this cost will not boost Russia's national economy, but may attract business to Sochi and the southern Krasnodar region of Russia in the future as a result of improved services.|$|E

25|$|The second Chartist {{petition}} {{was presented}} to Parliament in April 1842. Stalybridge contributed 10,000 signatures. After {{the rejection of the}} petition the first general strike began in the coal mines of Staffordshire. The second phase of the strike originated in Stalybridge. A movement of resistance to the imposition of wage cuts in the mills, also known as the Plug Riots, it spread to involve nearly half a million workers throughout Britain and represented the biggest single exercise of working class strength in 19th century Britain. On 13 August 1842 there was a strike at Bayley's Cotton Mill in Stalybridge, and roving cohorts of operatives carried the stoppage first to the whole area of Stalybridge and Ashton, then to Manchester, and subsequently to towns adjacent to Manchester, using as much force as was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> mills to a standstill. The movement remained, to outward appearances, largely non-political. Although the People's Charter was praised at public meetings, the resolutions that were passed at these were in almost all cases merely for a restoration of the wages of 1820, a ten-hour working day, or reduced rents.|$|E
25|$|Merger with Malaysia did not last: {{within two}} years, on 9 August 1965, Singapore was {{expelled}} from the Federation and became a fully independent republic. This was effected by {{the signing of the}} Independence of Singapore Agreement of 7 August 1965 by Singapore and Malaysia, and the changes consequent to the Agreement were implemented by two Malaysian Acts, the Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 and the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1966; and by two Singapore Acts, the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965 and the Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965. Section 5 of the latter Act provided that the legislative powers of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the supreme ruler of Malaysia, ceased to extend to Singapore, and vested instead in the Head of State (that is, the President of Singapore) and the Legislature of Singapore. Again, all laws were expressed to continue in force with such modifications, adaptations, qualifications and exceptions as might be <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them into conformity with the independent status of Singapore upon separation from Malaysia.

25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two of the most common {{disadvantages}} of standard excess of loss experience rating methods: lack of complete individual claim history and significant changes in the underlying book of business due to shifts in limit profile during the experience period. We develop a methodology to estimate an trend factor by layer of loss based on the unlimited trend factor, the severity distribution and the limit profile. This excess trend factor can then be applied to the nominal losses in the layer, overcoming the problem of having incomplete individual claim detail to exposure rate lower more credible layers. The excess trend is split into its frequency and severity components. We also present a methodology to estimate exposure adjustment factors <b>necessaries</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the experience of excess layer to the projected limit profile distribution. The impact of shifts in limit profile is also analyzed in terms of its frequency and severity components...|$|R

25|$|As a {{first step}} towards the CSME, Haiti was due to enter the trade in goods regime of the Single Market in January 2010 (earlier targets had been for some time in 2009) but could not do so because of the earthquake. Up until that point much work had been done by CROH and its Haitian {{government}} counterpart, the Bureau de Coordination et de Suivi or BCS (Office of Coordination and Monitoring), on the technical work <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the Haitian national tariff {{in line with the}} Caricom Common External Tariff (CET). The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti’s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis in November 2009 and was then put on hold {{as a result of the}} January 2010 earthquake. To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME’s trading regime.|$|E
