40|$|Two {{comprehensive}} {{approaches are}} considered for constructing projection-based reduced-order computational models for linear dynamical systems. The first one reduces the governing equations {{written in the}} descriptor form, using a Galerkin or Petrov-Galerkin projection onto a reduced-order basis or pair of them, respectively. These bases can be constructed by any preferred method such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, Balanced Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, or Moment Matching method. The second approach transforms first the governing equations into their <b>non-descriptor</b> form before applying the same projection-based model order reduction method. For several structural and coupled fluid-structure dynamical systems, {{it is observed that}} the first reduction approach leads to reduced-order models that exhibit significantly better numerical stability and accuracy properties than those resulting from the second one. These observations are reinforced by theoretical results that anticipate and confirm the better stability properties obtained in general when reducing the descriptor rather than <b>non-descriptor</b> form of the equations governing a linear dynamical system.

40|$|Stability {{analysis}} and design for continuous-time proportional plus derivative state observers {{is presented in}} the paper with the goal to establish the system state and actuator fault estimation. Design problem accounts a descriptor principle formulation for <b>non-descriptor</b> systems, guaranteing asymptotic convergence both the state observer error as fault estimate error. Presented {{in the sense of the}} second Lyapunov method, an associated structure of linear matrix inequalities is outlined to possess parameter existence of the proposed estimator structure. The obtained design conditions are verified by simulation using a numerical illustrative example...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} robust stability for uncertain discrete-time interval time-varying delayed descriptor systems using any combinations of quantization and overflow nonlinearities. First, delay-dependent linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition for discrete-time descriptor systems with time-varying delay and quantization/overflow nonlinearities is presented by proper Lyapunov function. Second, it is shown that the obtained condition can be extended into descriptor systems with uncertainties such as norm-bounded parameter uncertainties and polytopic uncertainties by some useful lemmas. The proposed results {{can be applied to}} both descriptor systems and <b>non-descriptor</b> systems. Finally, numerical examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness...|$|E
50|$|The SWD {{has about}} 600,000 {{descriptors}} and 700,000 <b>non-descriptors</b> (synonyms and quasi-synonyms) {{as well as}} synonymous descriptor chains with references to a descriptor. Its growth rate is about 5.5% per year. About three-quarters of the descriptors refer to individual concepts (language identifier, person, entity, title, ethnography etc.) and a quarter are abstract concepts. Linking using hierarchical (about 115,000) and associative (26,000) relations is not very dense, so the SWD cannot {{be viewed as a}} thesaurus (as at mid-2003).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on the {{research}} of the Universal Decimal Classification - a general classification scheme - as a possible base for the thesauri of the special subject field. The research was founded on the printed (English) edition of the UDC tables(1993) applied in the development of the authority file in the Library of the Croatian Academy of Sceinces and Arts (contains UDC notations, descriptors, <b>non-descriptors</b> based on UDC classes or connected with them) and international standard ISO 2788, and is used in two ways – for classification and for subject analysis of documents...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} improving classification-based subject access in a library catalogue. In order to enhance the use of UDC numbers in information retrieval, the authors have represented classification with thesaurus descriptors and implemented this solution in an automated way. In addition, descriptors {{in more than one}} language were used to interface classification. The authors present a solution implemented in a BiblioPhil library system. The standard formats used are UNIMARC for bibliographic and subject authority records (i. e. the UDC-based multilingual thesaurus) with MARCXML support for data transfer. The multilingual thesaurus was built according to the existing standards, the constituent parts of the classification notations being used as the basis for search terms in the multilingual information retrieval. The verbal equivalents, descriptors and <b>non-descriptors,</b> are used to expand the number of concepts and are given in Romanian, English and French. The authors illustrate how this approach saves the time of the indexer and provides more user-friendly and easier access to the bibliographic information. The multilingual aspect of the thesaurus enhances information access for a greater number of online users...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} H∞ control of high index and {{non-regular}} linear differential-algebraic-equation systems is addressed. Based on a generalization of the bounded real lemma (BRL) to index one systems, all linear output feedback controllers in standard, i. e. <b>non-descriptor,</b> state space form solving control the H∞ {{problem can be}} characterized via biaffine matrix inequalities (BMIs). In a second step a congruence transformation and a subsequent change of variables show that certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) necessarily must hold in order to admit a solution of the H∞ control problem. However, these conditions are not sufficient. Necessary and sufficient conditions {{for the existence of}} a controller solving problem are derived as BMIs of reduced order compared to the original control characterization via the BRL. The approach is illustrated by a simple example...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Bluetongue is a {{primarily}} midge-borne devastating hemorrhagic {{viral disease}} of sheep characterized by high {{morbidity and mortality}} resulting severe economic losses to sheep farmers. An epidemiological study was undertaken to assess the crude and specific measures of morbidity, mortality and case fatality against bluetongue in sheep. In this study, a total of 11 bluetongue outbreaks were selected by active and passive surveillances in north-west agroclimatic zone of Tamil Nadu, India. Overall morbidity, mortality and case fatality rates were 6. 15 %, 3. 31 % and 53. 82 % respectively. Morbidity, mortality and case fatality rates were higher in adults than young animals. Morbidity, mortality and case fatality rates were higher in Mecheri breed than Trichy black and <b>Non-descriptor.</b> Difference in disease frequency was not observed between males and females. The present study concludes age and breed predisposing exist in the outbreaks of bluetongue...|$|E
40|$|This {{second edition}} on the "Thesaurus Verpackung - Thesaurus Packaging" has been {{compiled}} from terms encountered during the indexing {{process of the}} database Packaging Science and Technology Abstracts (PSTA) in the Fraunhofer-Institut für Lebensmitteltechnologie und Verpackung (ILV), Munich, since 1960. The terms included in this thesaurus are in both English and German. The descriptors were chosen {{on the basis of}} their conceptual suitability as well as for their impact on information indexing and retrieval and of the current usage in each language. The main rule was that each concept introduced had to be represented by a descriptor in each language. Further terms were given the status of <b>non-descriptors.</b> Packaging Science and Technology is a cross-road between many fields of knowledge. For practical purposes, it was decided to restrict the scope of the thesaurus to the areas of major interest. These areas are: Packaging economics, -science, -institutions (including economics, statistics, laws, standardization, environment and waste recycling); packaging materials;processing and production machinery; packages; packaging accessories; products to be packed; packaging machines; packs; testing and stress loading; transport and storage. These above disciplines are still being explored and thus experience frequent progress. Since it is essential to keep abreast of any developments the Thesaurus will be updated accordingly...|$|R
