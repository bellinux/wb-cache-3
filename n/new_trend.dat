5|$|The game {{received}} considerable {{praise for}} its technically challenging racing and fusion {{of popular culture}} elements. Many critics praised the unique blend of techno music and designer logos in one cohesive futuristic racing universe {{as the beginning of}} a <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> in gaming to tap into popular culture and other arts, which was made possible by the new storage space of the time.|$|E

It is a service, facilitated by a reference librarian, which meets the information needs of users with desired information. Like many other library services, library reference service also has changed with the impact of emerging technologies and in par with changing social needs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss some of these <b>new</b> <b>trends</b> of library reference services. These <b>new</b> <b>trends</b> are divided into four main areas named as: <b>new</b> <b>trends</b> of reference sources, <b>new</b> <b>trends</b> of reference interview, collaborative efforts on reference services, and non-library based information services...|$|R

5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines for this <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing the new social order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian spell {{ended with}} San Lorenzo's first title, beating Nacional of Paraguay in the finals. But another trend was born, as {{once again a}} new {{champion}} was crowned, {{for the third consecutive}} year. San Lorenzo's victory was then followed by another Argentine club's victory, River Plate, winning its third title on 2015. But Atletico Nacional stopped this <b>new</b> <b>trend,</b> by beating Ecuador's Independiente del Valle on a 2-1 aggregate. The Colombian team won their second title after 27 years and one former failure attempt in 1995 against Grêmio, becoming the first pacific team to reach that achievement {{in the history of the}} tournament.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{transition}} of the young bands from being local attractions to touring extensively in the UK, major record labels' A agents still did not recognise the rising <b>new</b> <b>trend.</b> Thus, most new bands signed contracts with small independent labels, which could afford only limited printings of singles and albums and usually offered only national distribution. Many other bands, including Iron Maiden, Def Leppard and Diamond Head, self-produced their first releases and sold them through mail order or at concerts. Saxon {{were the first to}} sign with an internationally distributed label, the French Carrere Records, followed by Def Leppard with Phonogram in August 1979, and Iron Maiden with EMI in December 1979. In early 1980, EMI tested the market with the Neal Kay-compiled album Metal for Muthas and a UK tour of the bands that had contributed to the compilation, eventually signing Angel Witch (who were dropped after the release of their first single) and Ethel the Frog.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} Comnenian period this {{severity}} softened, and emotion, formerly avoided, entered icon painting. Major monuments for this change include the murals at Daphni Monastery (ca. 1100) and the Church of St. Panteleimon near Skopje (1164). The Theotokos of Vladimir (ca. 1115, illustration, right) {{is probably the}} most representative example of the <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> towards spirituality and emotion.|$|E

An additional trend that emerged was the RCM's commitment to military and Olympic coins as well.|$|E
25|$|Some colored {{contact lenses}} {{completely}} cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting and beautifying its natural colour. A <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend {{the appearance of}} the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.|$|E

In later decades, the overskirt was drawn back and pinned up to display the petticoat, which was heavily decorated.|$|E

25|$|A <b>new</b> <b>trend</b> in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is {{done because}} American born English-speakers {{are not aware}} of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the {{individual}} for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban Álvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban Álvarez Cobos, would become Esteban Álvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.|$|E

Some authors, particularly Tahar Fazaa (mainly in تشنشينات تونسية Tšanšīnāt Tūnsīya) and Taoufik Ben Brik (mainly when writing كلب بن كلب Kalb Bin Kalb and كوازاكي Kawāzākī) followed him and used Tunisian Arabic in order to write novels, plays and books in Tunisian Arabic.|$|E
