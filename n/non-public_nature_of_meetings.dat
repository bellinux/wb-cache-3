50|$|Bellarmine University {{is located}} on the Belknap side of the {{boundary}} between that neighborhood and Deer Park; until the 21st century, Deer Park residents had little contact with the university other than its function as a polling place during the elections. As the university has sought to expand its student base and campus, residents residing the closest to the university met with Bellarmine representatives on an ad hoc basis to address areas of concern such as street, rather than campus parking, and the building of a stadium in close proximity to houses on an adjoining street. The ad hoc <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> with Bellarmine ceased in 2005 when there was a push by the university to buy houses on the Bellarmine side of Richmond Drive west of Norris and use them as student housing. This was opposed by Belknap and Deer Park residents and brought before the zoning commission. From this effort, the Good Neighbor Working Group was formed with Bellarmine to ensure their expansion and plans for growth did not adversely affect the integrity of the neighborhood.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report recent {{developments}} on the meeting transcription task, a large vocabulary conversational speech recognition task. Previous experiments showed {{this is a}} very challenging task, with about 50 % word error rate (WER) using existing recognizers. The difficulty mostly comes from highly disfluent/conversational <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>meetings,</b> and lack <b>of</b> domain specific training data. For the first problem, our SWB(Switchboard) system — a conversational telephone speech recognizer — was used to recognize wide-band meeting data; for the latter, we leveraged the large amount of Broadcast News (BN) data to build a robust system. This paper will especially focus on two experiments in the BN system development: model combination and HMM topology/duration modeling. Model combination can be done at various stages of recognition: post-processing schemes such as ROVER can lead to significant improvements; to reduce computation we tried model combination at acoustic score level. We will also show the importance of temporal constraints in decoding, present some HMM topology/duration modeling experiments. Finally, the meeting browser system and meeting room setup will be reviewed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{globalisation}} activists, who {{are opposed}} to cultural uniformity, promote respect for difference as one of their main values. In order to blend this appreciation of diversity with the various factions of the movement, activists have created a new ideal convergence model: the Social Forums. Three main characteristics apply: an inclusive atmosphere with respect for diversity, the organisation of “open spaces” and the non-deliberative <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>meetings.</b> Though activists aim to live by these principles, the model remains no less ideal, because this way of acting it out expresses the values of alternative globalisation utopias and is impossible to recreate in real-world meetings, which as a result both of the behaviour of the parties involved and of structural limitations inherent to the model. Rather than an organisation that encompasses all factions of the alternative globalisation movement, World Social Forums provide platforms for debate and flexible coordination allowing activists to work together in an environment respectful of differences. However, certain aspects of the expansion of these World Social Forums – their increasing size, the growing burden of their organisation, their institutionalisation or internal shortcomings in their democratic process – may pose a threat...|$|R

I will then go on offering an understanding of the prominence <b>of</b> <b>meeting</b> places for parents and their children as a particular shape of parenting support, which comes down to situating this against the background of the traditional picture of parenting support (i. e. indicating why it is noteworthy, what its features are, its promises, and what is implied in its central tenets).

40|$|Despite their pervasiveness and {{significance}} in everyday organisational life, meetings have received comparatively little serious academic attention as organisational phenomena. This paper argues that studying meetings as strategizing episodes {{can add to}} our understanding of the social dynamics of shaping strategy. Drawing on Hendry and Seidl’s (2003) theoretical framework of strategizing episodes as micro-evolutionary mechanisms in the strategy process and based on empirical data <b>of</b> 51 strategic-level <b>meeting</b> observations, the paper elucidates the episodic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> strategic <b>meetings</b> in shaping organizational strategy. In line with perspectives on strategy as a social practice, our study examines meetings as they occur within and contribute to the social dynamics of shaping an organization’s strategic orientations. The findings make three main contributions. First, they contribute to the strategy-as-practice research agenda by explaining how the conduct <b>of</b> <b>meetings</b> is related to consequential strategic outcomes, such as stabilization or change within an organization’s strategy. Second, they generate an empirically-informed taxonomy that shows how serial meetings link to each other, how topics are connected between these meetings, and how meetings have an impact upon wider organizational activities.
