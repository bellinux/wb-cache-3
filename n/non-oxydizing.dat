40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the faced steel {{operating}} rolls for mills of hot rolling. The {{purpose is to}} rise the durability of NShS faced steel operating rolls of hot rolling on the development basis of facing materials and on the improvement basis of facing process of rolls. The depth and the quantity of scoring cracks in the faced layer or rolls depending on the pressure and depending {{on the number of}} heat rotations have been studied. The medium influence around the roll during the heating before the facing on the properties of faced metal has been determined. The new facing materials and the <b>non-oxydizing</b> heating method have been developed conformably to the facing of NShS steel operating rolls of hot rolling. The improved process of roll facing has been introduced at the Novolipetsk Integrated Iron-and-Steel Works. The application fields are the ferrous metallurgy enterprises, where the rolls and other parts of metallurgical equipment are facedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
30|$|This is {{the major}} {{excretion}} way in the brain. The hydroxylation of cholesterol to 24 -hydroxycholesterol (24 -OHC) is catalyzed by cholesterol 24 -hydroxylase (encoded by CYP 46 A 1, which {{is a member of}} the cytochrome p 450 family). Unlike <b>non-oxydized</b> cholesterol, oxysterols such as 24 -hydroxycholesterol can cross lipophilic membranes such as the brain blood barrier (BBB) at a much faster rate than cholesterol itself (Lange et al., 1995; Meaney et al., 2002). However, the expression of this enzyme is restricted to certain types of neurons in the brain, such as pyramidal cells of the cortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Lund et al., 2003; 1999; Lütjohann et al., 1996), suggesting that these cells are particularly sensitive to excess of cholesterol. Immunocytochemical staining of cultured neurons showed that CYP 46 A 1 is located primarily in somata and dendrites of neurons, but not in axons or presynaptic terminals (Ramirez et al., 2008). There is little expression of cholesterol 24 -hydroxylase in glial cells in the brain (Ramirez et al., 2008). This indicates that the major cholesterol turnover takes place in neurons, not in astrocytes.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree {{grades of}} {{polypropylene}} (PP) and two grades of polyethylene (PE) were gamma-irradiated with 25 kGy integral dose in air atmosphere and investigated using X-band {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR). All the spectra exhibited a mixture of free radicals, the absolute spin concentration of which was obtained from EPR signal simulations and intensity calibration using references of known spin concentrations. The free radicals were identified and their concentrations were related to both formulation and crystallinity of the polymer. The recombination of each species was monitored versus temperature. The concentration decay versus time concentration was monitored and simulated as a mixture of zero or first order mechanism for HDPE and of one for the PP polymers. In the highly crystalline High Density Polyethylene HDPE, gamma-irradiation produces mainly alkyl radicals (R-center dot) and some alkyloxyl (RO center dot) formed in low mobility phases where dioxygen has poor accessibility. Heating at 330 K destabilizes the alkyloxyl that disappears while allylic radicals (R-CH=CH-CH 2 center dot) show up as a fingerprint of beta-scission. At 290 K in HDPE, the radical concentration decays rather rapidly according to a single exponential decay. A residual concentration of allyl and alkyl radicals (zero order mechanism) is assigned to radicals located in the largest crystallized zones of very weak molecular mobility. In contrast, low density PE or PP exhibit mostly oxidised radicals of alkylperoxyl (R-OO center dot) type that are rather stable in PP (time constant tau similar to 70 h), the decay of the <b>non-oxydized</b> part is much faster (tau similar to 2 h) in PP. The higher concentration of radicals in PP than in HDPE (tau similar to 8 h) is then attributed to the oxidised radicals while highly stable radicals (zero order mechanism) are consistent with a low density material...|$|R
