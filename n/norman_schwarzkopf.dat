5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City and moved on to the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|The {{final scene}} at Globex {{contains}} several references to action and James Bond films. The episode title and many references {{are from the}} Bond film You Only Live Twice, {{as well as an}} allusion to A View to a Kill. A character modeled after Sean Connery's Bond is tackled by Homer and killed after a parody of the laser scene from Goldfinger. Miss Goodthighs from the 1967 James Bond parody Casino Royale makes an appearance in the episode and can be seen attacking a character modeled after U.S. Army general <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf.</b>|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
50|$|In October 1990, the {{regiment}} deployed to Southwest Asia {{in support of}} Operation Desert Shield. Along with {{other elements of the}} 3rd Armored Division, {{the regiment}} helped to create the illusion that the main force of the coalition forces would enter Iraq by coming up the Wadi Al-Batin. This feint was part of General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf's</b> Hail Mary plan.|$|R
50|$|In the Gulf War <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf's</b> supply expert {{was then}} Major General Pagonis, a short {{energetic}} Greek-American. Pagonis {{was actually the}} first American to arrive in Saudi Arabia, hours after {{it was decided to}} send troops. Lacking a hotel room, he had slept two nights {{in the back of his}} rented Chevrolet near the port of Dammam. He would be promoted to Lieutenant General during the war, the only promotion to Lieutenant General given during the entire event.|$|R
50|$|Sulivan was {{commissioned}} into the Royal Artillery in 1966 and transferred into the Blues and Royals in 1980. He {{served as the}} only non-US member of General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf's</b> strategic planning team during the Gulf War. He was appointed Commander of 7th Armoured Brigade in 1991, Principal Staff Officer to the Chief of the Defence Staff in 1993 and Director-General for Doctrine and Development in 1994. He went on to be Chief of Staff for the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps in 1996 and General Officer Commanding 4th Division in 1998 before he retired in 2001.|$|R
5|$|During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 {{flights and}} about 4,100 flight hours, {{with a mission}} {{availability}} rate of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy surface-to-air missiles, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. U.S. Army General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that {{played a crucial role}} in the war. In the aftermath of the war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch. The AV-8Bs launched from amphibious assault ships in the Persian Gulf, and from forward operating bases such as Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{the academy}} {{produced}} General of the Armies John J. Pershing. West Point was the alma mater of many notable World War II generals, Henry H. Arnold, Omar Bradley, Mark Wayne Clark, Robert L. Eichelberger, James M. Gavin, Leslie Groves, Douglas MacArthur, George S. Patton, Joseph Stilwell, Maxwell D. Taylor, James Van Fleet, Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV, and Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. {{the highest ranking}} General to be killed in combat during World War II, with many of these graduates also serving in commanding roles in the Korean War. During the Vietnam War, notable graduates general officers included Creighton Abrams, Hal Moore, and William Westmoreland. West Point also produced some famous generals and statesmen of recent note including John Abizaid, Stanley A. McChrystal, Wesley Clark, Alexander Haig, Barry McCaffrey, <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> Jr., Brent Scowcroft, Lloyd Austin, and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, retired General David Petraeus.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 23/24 February, in {{accordance}} with General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf's</b> plan for the ground assault called [...] "Operation Desert Sabre", VII Corps raced east from Saudi Arabia into Iraq in a maneuver later nicknamed the [...] "Hail Mary." [...] The Corps had two goals: to cut off Iraqi retreat from Kuwait, and to destroy five elite Republican Guard divisions near the Iraq-Kuwait border that might attack the Arab and Marine units moving into Kuwait to the south. Initial Iraqi resistance was light and scattered after the breach, and the 2nd ACR fought only minor engagements until 25 February.|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} [...] "Prodigal Soldiers," [...] James Kitfield recounted McCaffrey's [...] "left hook" [...] attack plan. McCaffrey {{commanded}} [...] "two entire Army corps deep into Iraqi territory. If successful, and no army in history had ever moved {{a force that}} size over 300 miles on the time line General <b>Norman</b> J. <b>Schwarzkopf</b> was reciting, the move would flank the Republican Guard divisions in Kuwait and cut off all avenues of retreat ... The briefing left McCaffrey slightly stunned. He {{was part of the}} flanking force, and his mind was already starting to race over a logistics problem the war colleges would call a potential war-stopper, yet he had one overriding thought: We're not going to fight a war of attrition, or a limited war. It was a revelation. He saw now that the Army was going to play to its strengths and the enemy's weakness. By God, we learned. We learned (from the lessons of Vietnam)." ...|$|R
5|$|Typically {{operated}} {{from small}} aircraft carriers, large amphibious assault ships and simple forward operating bases, AV-8Bs {{have participated in}} numerous military and humanitarian operations, proving themselves versatile assets. U.S. Army General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the Gulf War. The aircraft took part in combat during the Iraq War beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in Operation Odyssey Dawn in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage {{of time spent in}} critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II, with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1990, the U.S. {{intervened in}} the Middle East with Operation Desert Storm. During that intervention, Fort Lewis {{deployed}} 34 active and 25 reserve component units to Saudi Arabia. I Corps {{also contributed to}} the command structure, with the I Corps Commander, LTG Calvin A. H. Waller and the Deputy I Corps Commander, MG Paul R. Schwartz, assisting General H. <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> the Commander of the American Forces. I Corps expanded its contingency missions and became a quick-response corps. For several months, I Corps was the nation's worldwide contingency corps, while the XVIII Airborne Corps was engaged in the Gulf War. This caused a good deal of activity on Fort Lewis, as the post restructured itself to support the corps' new mission, and to insure that it had a smooth, rapid departure in case they were needed anywhere in the world. This duty was returned to XVIII Airborne Corps upon its return to the United States. The corps then began to convert to a permanently structured, no-mobilization contingency corps and was placed under the operational control of the United States Army Forces Command. This entailed the addition of a number of active component corps units.|$|E

Numerous military and political leaders such as Mao Zedong, Võ Nguyên Giáp, and <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> have drawn inspiration from the work.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} did {{not begin}} fund-raising until August 2002. Just how much money the foundation needed was unclear, with some sources claiming $35 million but others $60 million. One of the first fund-raising efforts involved {{the sale of a}} gold-plated commemorative medallion priced at $29.95 each. To urge the public to donate, Pope herself paid for advertisements which featured General H. <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> poet Maya Angelou, and National Football League star Michael Strahan. On Veterans Day in 2002, the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation donated $2 million to the project. The same day, the Disabled American Veterans said its chapters would also begin fund-raising for the memorial. Shortly thereafter, the DVLMF launched a direct mail fund-raising effort as well.|$|E
500|$|Herbert <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> Jr. ( [...] ; August 22, 1934December 27, 2012) was a United States Army general. While {{serving as}} Commander-in-chief, United States Central Command, he led all {{coalition}} {{forces in the}} Gulf War.|$|E
500|$|Schwarzkopf {{was born}} Herbert <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> Jr. on August 22, 1934 in Trenton, New Jersey, to Herbert <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> Sr. and Ruth Alice (née Bowman). His {{father was a}} 1917 {{graduate}} of the United States Military Academy and veteran of World War I. His mother was a housewife from West Virginia who was distantly related to Thomas Jefferson. The senior Schwarzkopf later became the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, where {{he worked as a}} lead investigator on the 1932 Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. In January 1952, the younger Schwarzkopf's birth certificate was amended to make his name [...] "H. Norman Schwarzkopf", reportedly because his father detested his first name. The younger Schwarzkopf had two older sisters, Ruth Ann and Sally Joan.|$|E
500|$|<b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> was {{described}} by childhood friends as active and assertive, protective of his sisters and a skilled athlete. He spent his childhood attached to his father, who subsequently became the narrator for the Gang Busters radio program. When <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> was eight years old, his father returned to the military amid World War II. His continuous absence made home life difficult, particularly for his wife. As a 10-year-old cadet at Bordentown Military Institute, near Trenton, he posed for his official photograph wearing a stern expression because – as he said afterwards – [...] "Some day when I become a general, I {{want people to know}} that I’m serious." [...] In 1946, when <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> was 12, he moved with his father to Tehran, Iran. In Iran, Norman learned shooting, horseback riding, and hunting. Schwarzkopf developed a lifelong interest in Middle Eastern culture. The family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947, following a new military assignment for Herbert Schwarzkopf. The senior Schwarzkopf visited Italy, Heidelberg, Frankfurt, and Berlin, Germany during his military duties, and the younger Schwarzkopf accompanied him. By 1951 he had returned to Iran briefly before returning to the United States. Herbert Schwarzkopf died in 1958. From a young age, Norman wanted to be a military officer, following his father's example.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant General Guy C. Swan {{noted that}} SAMS {{graduates}} were indispensable in Europe {{after the fall}} of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. They were expected to [...] "re-engineer the decades of planning that had gone into the GDP [...] almost overnight". Swan stated that this was [...] "the first true test of SAMS on a large scale". SAMS graduates served in Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, and were [...] "remembered most famously in the early days for producing the 'Jedi Knights' employed by Gen. <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> in developing the famous 'left hook' ". SAMS graduates also served in roles beyond the initial planning, with 82 graduates participating in diverse theater tasks by February 1991. As a result, US Army leadership regarded SAMS as a source of [...] "superb planners".|$|E
500|$|General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf</b> {{said this}} was the funniest episode of Cheers. Don Leighton from Superior Telegram called this episode the {{greatest}} and said the Final Jeopardy! moment was hilarious.

Hot Springs Village Voice called Cliff's Final Jeopardy! moment a classic example of his mishaps caused by his own [...] "know-it-all nature". Andrew Razeghi, in his book Hope, called this episode [...] "one of the most memorable episodes" [...] of Cheers, found Cliff's response to the Final Jeopardy! clue neither right nor wrong and an example of divergent thinking, and called Cliff a poster child of Joy Paul Guilford. Former Jeopardy! contestant Ken Jennings, in his book [...] Brainiac, considered this episode of all Jeopardy!-related episodes essential as other episodes that focus on characters who either are trapped in an elevator or have two dates on the same night.|$|E
500|$|Commonwealth {{citizens}} not {{subjects of}} the Queen and foreigners may be made Honorary Members. Queen Elizabeth II has established the custom of awarding an honorary GCB to visiting heads of state, for example Gustav Heinemann, and Josip Broz Tito (in 1972), Ronald Reagan (in 1989), Lech Wałęsa (in 1991), Censu Tabone, President of Malta, in 1992, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, George H.

2500|$|In 1954, Moore {{returned}} to West Point and served {{for three years}} as an instructor in infantry tactics. While serving as an instructor, Moore taught then-Cadet <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> who called Moore one of his [...] "heroes," [...] and cites Moore as the reason he chose the infantry branch upon graduation. Schwarzkopf later became a general in the U.S. Army and led the U.N. coalition forces in the Persian Gulf War against Iraq. During this assignment, Moore took a personal interest in the battles between the French Army forces and the Việt Minh at Điện Biên Phủ in Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invasion}} showed {{problems with}} the U.S. government's [...] "information apparatus," [...] which Time described as still being in [...] "some disarray" [...] {{three weeks after the}} invasion. [...] For example, the U.S. State Department falsely claimed that a mass grave had been discovered that held 100 bodies of islanders who had been killed by Communist forces. Major General <b>Norman</b> <b>Schwarzkopf,</b> deputy commander of the invasion force, said that 160 Grenadian soldiers and 71 Cubans had been killed during the invasion; the Pentagon had given a much lower count of 59 Cuban and Grenadian deaths. Ronald H. Cole's report for the Joint Chiefs of Staff showed an even lower count.|$|E
