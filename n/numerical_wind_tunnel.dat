40|$|A {{methodology}} for numerically simulating the flow conditions in closed-circuit <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is {{developed as a}} contribution to the general philosophy of incorporating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> design and testing and to CFD validation studies. The methodology is applied to the full-scale Jules Verne climatic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> in which experimental data have been obtained. Due to the specific features of this closed-circuit <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> the conventional CFD modeling approach, in which only the flow in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> test section is modeled, is inadequate. To obtain accurate results the entire <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> has to be modeled. In the <b>numerical</b> closed-circuit <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> the conventional flow inlet and outlet are replaced by a single "fan boundary condition". Special attention is given to the theoretical background and the practical implementation of this type of boundary condition in the CFD model. The numerical model is validated for the case of an empty <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and for the case in which a block-type building is placed in the test section. It will be shown that this methodology can generally reproduce the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> measurements of mean velocities with an error equal to or less than 10 % despite the occurrence of multiple flow separations upstream of the test section. This provides perspectives for the future use of this methodology as a tool for <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> design and testing and for CFD validation purposes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Within {{the context}} of {{atmospheric}} dispersion modelling of Radon and airborne particles originating from near-surface area sources an appropriate turbulence parameterisation must be provided {{in order to determine}} realistically the near-surface airborne pollutant concentration {{in the vicinity of the}} emission. This question was investigated by means of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiments combined with numeric dispersion modelling. The calculations were based on commonly used approaches for atmospheric dispersion modelling, i. e.

Large Eddy Simulation was performed at a low wind speed of 7 m/s in a <b>numerical</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> model with dimensions similar to the NASA Ames Wind Tunnel (24. 4 m x 36. 6 m). An ANSYS CFD Fluent solver based on the dynamic Smagorinsky-Lilly model was employed to simulate the flow surrounding the wind turbine placed inside the <b>numerical</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> For validation purposes, the aerodynamic characteristics of the blade were compared with the published experimental data of the NREL Phase VI. A good agreement was found between the experimental and the numerical results for the surface pressure distributions along the blade. It was observed that in the near-wake the turbulence intensity was a maximum of 12. 12 % at a distance of three rotor diameters downstream, after which a gradual decrease in the turbulence intensity was observed due to the wake instability. In the far-wake region, the turbulence intensity showed a tendency to increase, due to the presence of counter-rotating helical vortices determining the dynamics of far-wake. The system of vortices in the near-wake becomes unstable and breaks down due to the wake instability at a distance of approximately five rotor diameters downstream of the wind turbine. The vortex breakdown was used to define the boundary between the near and far-wake regions. The collapsed spiral wake was found to spread in all directions in the far-wake resulting in the formation of the two counter-rotating vortices which caused the gradual increase of turbulent intensity. The results and related discussion of the turbulent wake characteristics are presented in the current article. Amanullah Choudhry, Jang-Oh Mo, Maziar Arjomandi and Young-Ho Le...|$|E
