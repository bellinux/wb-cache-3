40|$|The quality, {{accuracy}} and reliability of the tests performed by <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> are essential aspects that help to guarantee the certification {{carried out by the}} Veterinary Services, as well as to support sanitary programmes, prevention and restraint of emerging diseases and the certification of the sanitary status of a country, zone or compartment and international trade. It is obvious that although a region may have important human resources and infrastructure, not all countries of the region may have the same level of resources. Regardless of the need to reinforce those aspects related to infrastructure and equipment, there is a constant need for training human resources. The conclusions and recommendations of the First Global Conference on OIE Reference Laboratories and Collaborating Centres, held in Florianopolis in 2006, have shown that this OIE Reference Laboratory Network should assist and support the <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> of the Veterinary Services.

Seventeen <b>National</b> <b>Reference</b> <b>Laboratories</b> for Salmonella (NRLs-Salmonella) and 15 EnterNet laboratories (ENLs) participated in the study.

In general, no problems were encountered with the typing of the O antigens. However, some laboratories had problems with typing the H antigens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed data showing that standardisation of this technique would be required to allow for comparison between laboratories.
