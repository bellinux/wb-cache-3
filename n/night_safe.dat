One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred {{thousand}} black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was {{at a place called}} Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together {{at the bottom of a}} steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at <b>night</b> <b>safe</b> within the walls at Agra.|$|E

50|$|Only in {{the north}} was the terrain {{favourable}} to attack; here the Atlas Mountains stopped near the eastern coast, leaving a large area on the north-west coast unprotected. Defensive lines {{in the north}} could deal with approaching forces, while the Mareth Line made the south secure. In between, {{there were only a}} few easily defended passes through the Atlas Mountains. Tunisia has two big deep water ports at Tunis and Bizerte, only a few hundred miles from Italian supply bases in Sicily. Ships could deliver supplies at <b>night,</b> <b>safe</b> from RAF patrols and return the next night, while Libya was a full-day trip, making supply operations vulnerable to daylight air attacks. In Hitler's view, Tunisia could be held indefinitely, upsetting Allied plans in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superstructure}} had {{a slight}} camber that permits periodic tightening of the deck via bolt fixings along the outer girders. The bridge had steel balustrades comprising steel stanchions supporting two circular hollow section rails and ironbark lightpoles along its length.The portals at each end (which still exist) are finely detailed monumental Art Deco structures comprising substantial pylons spanned by a deep spandrel facing landward, and more modestly detailed rectangular frames facing bayward. The pylons have banded rusticated bases on concrete pedestals, with central slot windows with decorative grilles on three sides, surmounted by stepped vertical elements. The spandrel is also banded, and has a rectangular central panel with the words [...] "Hornibrook Highway" [...] fashioned in raised brass lettering. The portals contain toll facilities, comprising a small office and strong room with <b>night</b> <b>safe</b> {{in the base of}} the pylons at each end. Externally these rooms are framed by Art Deco relief patterns. On the approach to the bridge the portals are preceded by smaller free-standing pylons either side of the road.|$|E

50|$|After seeing Newcomb and Tekesta safely into Kerama Retto, Beale resumed duty with TF 54 {{providing}} gunfire {{support for}} the troops on Okinawa. Though call fire remained one of the warships primary missions during her 12 weeks of service in the Ryūkyūs, the frequency and intensity of the Japanese aerial counterstrokes diverted her attention incessantly from that assignment to air defense. Antiair warfare also intruded upon her other major role at Okinawa, service in the ubiquitous antisubmarine screen. In providing protection from both submarines and aircraft, Beale divided her time between the gunfire support units and the ships that retired each <b>night</b> to <b>safer</b> waters {{some distance from the}} shores of Okinawa.|$|R
40|$|Chevron sign is {{the visual}} {{guidance}} {{system to be}} installed at the location with poor sight distance to help the drivers clearly recognize the road alignment and curve day and <b>night</b> for <b>safe</b> driving. Thus should retroreflection performance of chevron sign fail {{to meet the requirements}} on foggy road, it’s not able to provide the drivers with the information on alignment ahead. This paper hence is intended to analyze the retroreflection performance depending on visible distance at foggy condition. Consequently, the shorter the visible distance in foggy weather the less the retroreflection performance of chevron sign. Particularly it failed to satisfy the performance requirement when visible distance was 271 m or less...|$|R
50|$|Weirdos Comedy Club, or Weirdos as it’s {{commonly}} referred to, {{was formed by}} Adam Larter as an experimental <b>night</b> and a <b>safe</b> place to try out riskier or more alternative material than usual circuit comedy.

They have been compared to the 80's alternative comedy group The Comic Strip.|$|R
50|$|Of {{foremost}} {{notice is}} Swift's {{invention of the}} electric rifle, a gun which fires bolts of electricity. The electric rifle can be calibrated to different levels of range, intensity and lethality; it can shoot through solid walls without leaving a hole, and is powerful enough to kill a rampaging whale, as in their steamer trek to Africa. With the electric rifle, Tom and friends bring down elephants, rhinoceroses, and buffalo, and save their lives several times in pitched battle with the red pygmies. It also can discharge a globe of light that was described as being able to maintain itself, like ball lightning, making hunting at <b>night</b> much <b>safer</b> {{in the dark of}} Africa. In appearance, the rifle looked very much like contemporary conventional rifles.|$|R
50|$|World War II {{submarines}} {{had to run}} surfaced most of the time, {{and could}} not stay submerged for more than about 72 hours before having to surface to recharge batteries. But by 1944, U-boats dared not surface in daylight, because they would be spotted by patrolling aircraft. Patrols from escort carriers covered even {{the middle of the}} Atlantic. Surfacing at <b>night</b> was <b>safer,</b> because <b>night</b> flight operations from escort carriers were considered too dangerous. The best the escort carriers could do was substitute extra fuel tanks for depth charges on a Grumman TBF Avenger, so the plane could take off at sunset, fly around all night, and land at dawn. The U-boats would not know the plane was unarmed, and would not risk staying surfaced.|$|R

60|$|During {{the short}} {{absence of the}} Earl of Gloucester, the Empress was closely besieged in Oxford by the King; and {{provisions}} beginning to fail, she was in cruel apprehensions of falling into his hands. This gave her occasion to put in practice the only talent wherein she seemed to excel, which was that of contriving some little shift or expedient to secure her person upon any sudden emergency. A long season of frost had made the Thames passable upon the ice, and much snow lay on the ground; Maud with some few attendants clad all in white, to avoid being discovered from the King's camp, crossed the river at midnight on foot, and travelling all <b>night,</b> got <b>safe</b> to Wallingford Castle, where her brother and young son Henry, newly returned from France, arrived soon after, to her great satisfaction: but Oxford, immediately upon the news of her flight, surrendered to the King.|$|R

50|$|Chapter 10 (The Night) — Interposed between Leo's {{story is}} another tale {{referring}} to Douglas' family. It starts out relatively uneventfully, with Tom running to Mrs. Singer's store to get ice cream {{at nine o'clock}} {{on the same night}} for him and Douglas. However, by nine-thirty, Douglas has not returned, which causes his worried mother to venture to the ravine with Tom. Tom, despite the darkness of the <b>night,</b> feels <b>safe</b> because he is holding his mother's hand and also because he has little understanding of Death. His sense of security, however, vanishes when he feels his mother's hand tremble and realizes that she is afraid, like him. The ensuing revelation that apparently unfazed grown-ups feel loneliness and pain too unnerves him and makes him aware of the darkness surrounding them. Just before he feels overwhelmed, Douglas and his friends return, breaking the spell of aloneness. Tom later tells Douglas that the ravine would not belong in Leo's Happiness Machine, thus contrasting the pleasures humans wish for with the realities they receive instead.|$|R

It is a soft liquid yodeling, which the male bird uses to call the scattered flock together. One who walks in the woods at sunset sometimes hears it from a tangle of grapevine and bullbrier. If he has the patience to push his way carefully through the underbrush, he may see the beautiful Bob on a rock or stump, uttering the softest and most musical of whistles. He is telling his flock that here is a nice place he has found, where they can spend the <b>night</b> and be <b>safe</b> from owls and prowling foxes.|$|R
