5|$|The game {{originally}} was envisioned as {{a sequel to}} Remedy's previous game, Alan Wake. The game's focus was shifted to time travel, as Microsoft wanted a new intellectual property with interactive storytelling. The team consulted scientists while creating the fictional science in this game. While the video game portion was developed internally by Remedy and directed by studio veteran Sam Lake, the TV side of the game was developed by Lifeboat Productions and directed by Ben Ketai. Shawn Ashmore, Aidan Gillen and Lance Reddick portrayed important roles in the game. The game uses a new engine developed by Remedy, the <b>Northlight</b> engine, and a technology called Digital Molecular Matter.|$|E

[...] A majority of Inside Man was scanned on a <b>Northlight</b> film scanner, while the interrogation scenes had to be scanned on a Spirit DataCine, as the negatives proved [...] "too dense for the <b>Northlight</b> to perform the task." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{utilizes}} a new in-house engine {{called the}} <b>Northlight</b> Engine. To represent {{the idea of}} [...] "broken time" [...] and have a detailed destruction system, the team created lots of environments which put the player character {{in the midst of}} destruction, utilizing technologies ranging from geometric distortion waves to Thinking Particles. The team also used Digital Molecular Matter, a technology developed by Pixelux that allows structures and objects to react in the game the same way they would in reality. According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to [...] "simulate complex scenarios on a scale that hasn't been possible before" [...] and is crucial to the game's development. The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair. They also created a new global illumination system for indirect lighting. The game's resolution foundation was 720p, but Remedy attempted to raise it to 1080p by using temporal reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Many of the d'Aulaires' early books {{depict the}} scenery and folktales of Norway: Ola, Children of the <b>Northlights,</b> East of the Sun and West of the Moon. Later their {{attention}} shifted to their adopted {{country and they}} produced books about American folk heroes such as Pocahontas, Benjamin Franklin, and Buffalo Bill.|$|R
6000|$|What was snow-bearded Odin, trow, The mighty hunter long ago, Whose {{horn and}} hounds the peasant hears Still when the <b>Northlights</b> shake their spears? Science hath answers twain, I've heard; Choose which you will, nor hope a third; [...] 90 Whichever box the truth be stowed in, There's not a sliver left of Odin. Either {{he was a}} pinchbrowed thing, With {{scarcely}} wit a stone to fling, A creature both in size and shape Nearer than we are to the ape, Who hung sublime with brat and spouse By tail prehensile from the boughs, And, happier than his maimed descendants, The culture-curtailed independents, [...] 100 Could pluck his cherries with both paws, And stuff with both his big-boned jaws; Or else the core his name enveloped Was from a solar myth developed, Which, hunted to its primal shoot, Takes refuge in a Sanskrit root, Thereby to instant death explaining The little poetry remaining.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{engine shed}} was closed in 1893, {{and a new}} eight-road standard GWR pattern shed {{along the lines of}} those at Salisbury and Exeter—with <b>northlight</b> pattern roof—was constructed under the initial code NA. The coaling stage was a non-standard wooden trussed lean-to affair, with the coaling ramp level with the yard, while the approach roads where the locomotives were refueled some [...] below yard level. This made adding an ash shelter later during World War II especially easy. The single [...] standard over-girder pattern turntable was installed in 1926.|$|E
2500|$|The {{generation}} of poets {{that grew up}} in the postwar period included Douglas Dunn (born 1942), whose work has often seen a coming to terms with class and national identity within the formal structures of poetry and commenting on contemporary events, as in Barbarians (1979) and <b>Northlight</b> (1988). His most personal work is contained in the collection of Elegies (1985), which deal with the death of his first wife from cancer. Tom Leonard (born 1944), works in the Glaswegian dialect, pioneering the working class voice in Scottish poetry. Liz Lochhead (born 1947) also explored the lives of working-class people of Glasgow, but added an appreciation of female voices within a sometimes male dominated society. She also adapted classic texts into Scots, with versions of Molière's Tartuffe (1985) and The Misanthrope (1973/2005), while Edwin Morgan translated [...] Cyrano de Bergerac (1992).|$|E
2500|$|The {{generation}} of poets {{that grew up}} in the postwar period included Douglas Dunn (b. 1942), whose work has often seen a coming to terms with class and national identity within the formal structures of poetry and commenting on contemporary events, as in Barbarians (1979) and <b>Northlight</b> (1988). His most personal work is contained in the collection of Elegies (1985), which deal with the death of his first wife from cancer. Tom Leonard (b. 1944), works in the Glaswegian dialect, pioneering the working class voice in Scottish poetry, although what has been described as his finest work [...] "A priest came on at Merkland Street" [...] is in English. Like his friend Leonard, Aonghas MacNeacail (Angus Nicolson, b. 1942), amongst the most prominent post-war Gaelic poets, was influenced by new American poetry, particularly the Black Mountain School. Liz Lochhead (b. 1947) also explored the lives of working-class people of Glasgow, but added an appreciation of female voices within a sometimes male dominated society. The 1980s and 1990s saw {{the emergence of a new}} {{generation of}} Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson (b. 1953), Robert Crawford (b. 1959), Carol Ann Duffy (b. 1955), Kathleen Jamie (b. 1962) and Jackie Kay (b. 1961). Dundonians Paterson and Crawford have both produced esoteric work, which includes Paterson's ironically self-aware verse and Crawford's a metaphorically colourful re-imagining of Scottish history. Kathleen Jamie has explored female aspirations, drawing on her experiences growing up in rural Renfrewshire and Jackie Kay has drawn on her experiences as a black child adopted by a working class Glasgow family. Glasgow-born Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
