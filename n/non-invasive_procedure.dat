25|$|UD {{requires}} {{the establishment of}} an extracorporeal circulation through its unique AV loop with two pre-existing arterial and central venous lines in ICU patients. When the saline indicator is injected into the AV loop, it is detected by the venous clamp-on sensor on the loop before it enters the patient’s heart's right atrium. After the indicator traverses the heart and lung, the concentration curve in the arterial line is recorded and displayed on the COstatus HCM101 Monitor. Cardiac output is calculated from the area of the concentration curve using the Stewart-Hamilton equation. UD is a <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedure,</b> requiring only a connection to the AV loop and two lines from a patient. UD has been specialised for application in pediatric ICU patients and has been demonstrated to be relatively safe although invasive and reproducible.|$|E
500|$|Ultrasonography of leg veins is a risk-free, <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedure</b> {{that uses}} {{ultrasound}} technology to give {{information about the}} anatomy, physiology and pathology of both the superficial and the deep venous systems, (SVS) and (DVS). It is indicated mainly {{on the study of}} two [...] pathologies: venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. As with heart ultrasound (echocardiography) studies, venous ultrasonography requires an understanding of hemodynamics in order to give useful examination reports. In chronic venous insufficiency, sonographic examination is of most benefit; in confirming varicose disease, making an assessment of the hemodynamics, and charting the progression of the disease and its response to treatment. It has become the reference standard for examining the condition and hemodynamics of the lower limb veins.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Strandness' work, {{the only}} {{vascular}} imaging available to physicians {{would have been}} arteriograms, x-rays read from radiopaque dyes injected directly into the bloodstream.

Although arteriograms are sometimes still used, most physicians today rely upon the <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> and real-time information provided by duplex ultrasound scans.|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> for {{predicting}} pulmonary arterial pressure {{was investigated in}} 370 patients with chronic obstructive lung diseases and in 73 with fibrosing alveolitis in a combined study at nine centres in six European countries. Measurements included forced expiratory volume in one second, arterial blood gas tensions, standard electrocardiogram, radiographic dimensions of pulmonary artery, right ventricle dimensions by M mode echocardiography, and myocardial scintigraphy with thallium- 201; and certain clinical signs were also used. No single variable was correlated closely enough to allow accurate prediction of pulmonary arterial pressure. Four methods were used to incorporate several variables into mathematical functions for predicting pulmonary arterial pressure. In patients with chronic obstructive lung disease multiple stepwise regression explained 49 % {{of the variance in}} pulmonary arterial pressure but was not useful for prediction. Discriminant analysis allowed patients to be allocated to bands of pulmonary arterial pressure, as did two non-parametric procedures, in which decision trees were established using either the Kolmogoroff-Smirnoff statistic or Fisher's exact test. Patients with a pulmonary arterial pressure of 30 mm Hg or more were identified with a sensitivity of 83 % and a specificity of 91 %. The non-parametric tests gave better results than discriminant function. A further 54 patients were studied to validate the functions. Of these, 90 % with a pulmonary arterial pressure above 20 mm Hg were correctly identified, and 80 % of those with a pulmonary arterial pressure above 29 mm Hg. Similar results were obtained in subjects with fibrosing alveolitis. These mathematical functions allow the use of combinations of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedures</b> to select from populations at risk of pulmonary hypertension those in whom direct measurement is required. The mathematical functions are capable of further development by incorporation of variables from newer <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{human use}} for {{diagnostic}} purposes, long-term video-EEG monitoring {{is a relatively}} safe procedure compared to other invasive brain-monitoring techniques. However, despite long-term video-EEG monitoring being a generally <b>non-invasive</b> <b>procedure,</b> there still exists the potential for adverse events to occur. These adverse events can mostly prevented with proper test administration. Should an adverse event occur, increased time of hospitalization or death are not likely.|$|E
