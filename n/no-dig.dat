5000|$|<b>No-dig</b> {{gardening}} is a non-cultivation {{method used}} by some organic gardeners. The origins of <b>no-dig</b> gardening are unclear, and may be based on pre-industrial or nineteenth-century farming techniques. Masanobu Fukuoka started his pioneering research work in this domain in 1938, and began publishing in the 1970s his Fukuokan philosophy of [...] "Do Nothing Farming", which is now acknowledged by some as the tap root of the Permaculture movement. Two pioneers of the method {{in the twentieth century}} included F. C. King, Head Gardener at Levens Hall, South Westmorland, in the Lake District of England, who wrote the book [...] "Is Digging Necessary?" [...] in 1946 and a gardener from Middlecliffe in the UK, A. Guest, who in 1948 published the book [...] "Gardening Without Digging". The work of these gardeners was supported by the Good Gardeners Association in the UK. <b>No-dig</b> gardening was also promoted by Australian Esther Deans in the 1970s, and American gardener Ruth Stout advocated a [...] "permanent" [...] garden mulching technique in Gardening Without Work and <b>no-dig</b> methods in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>no-dig</b> {{method is}} sheet {{mulching}} wherein a garden area {{is covered with}} wetted paper or cardboard, compost and topped off with landscape mulch.|$|E
50|$|In permaculture, sheet {{mulching}} is {{an agricultural}} <b>no-dig</b> gardening technique {{that attempts to}} mimic natural forests' processes. When deployed properly and {{in combination with other}} permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive, and low maintenance ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Holmgren noted Stewart Brand’s {{works as}} an early {{influence}} to permaculture. Other early influences include Ruth Stout and Esther Deans, who pioneered <b>no-dig</b> gardening, and Masanobu Fukuoka who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating no-till orchards and gardens and natural farming.|$|E
50|$|Vacuum {{excavation}} hire providers Pier (UK) {{work with}} utility and civil engineering companies throughout the UK to provide safer <b>no-dig</b> excavation. Projects include relocating underground utility lines to accommodate wider road lanes and filter lanes, and street works to provide essential maintenance of street lighting.|$|E
50|$|Foodtubes {{plans to}} use <b>no-dig</b> trenchless {{technology}} to install pipelines throughout the city, which encompasses a large array of techniques that involve installing underground pipes with little damage or intrusion to the surface. Current plans involve 100 km of pipeline circuits and 400 terminals to and from retailers.|$|E
50|$|He married Irene, {{with whom}} he wrote a cookery book Cook what you grow (1940). He had two sons Ramsay and Jeremy. His son Ramsay {{continues}} to promote his <b>no-dig</b> gardening approach, and a demonstration plot may be seen at Capel Manor College in Enfield {{in conjunction with the}} Good Gardeners' Association as of 2008.|$|E
50|$|<b>No-dig</b> methods allow {{nature to}} carry out {{cultivation}} operations. Organic matter such as well rotted manure, compost, leaf mold, spent mushroom compost, old straw, etc., is added directly to the soil surface as a mulch at least 5-15 centimeters (2-6 in) deep, which is then incorporated {{by the actions of}} worms, insects and microbes. Worms and other soil life also assist in building up the soil's structure, their tunnels providing aeration and drainage, and their excretions bind together soil crumbs. This natural biosphere maintains healthy conditions in the upper soil horizons where annual plant roots thrive. <b>No-dig</b> systems are said to be freer of pests and disease, possibly due to a more balanced soil population being allowed to build up in this undisturbed environment, and by encouraging the buildup of beneficial rather than harmful soil fungi. Moisture is also retained more efficiently under mulch than on the surface of bare earth, allowing slower percolation and less leaching of nutrients.|$|E
5000|$|Esther Deans {{wrote the}} books <b>No-Dig</b> Gardening and Leaves of Life. She {{actively}} travelled {{to teach about}} this gardening method, cooking and promoting raised gardens for those with special needs. She also taught about the necessity to maintain excellent water quality. Deans continued gardening {{until the age of}} 95. Around this time, Harper Collins publishers held a special honorary event for her in their Ryde offices as Esther had become Australia's most published author. As Deans grew older, she was assisted by Lucinda Bartram who helped her carry on the tradition of teaching <b>no-dig</b> gardening methods to others. Between the mid 1990s and 2009 Bartram, from Bondi and then Randwick, helped Deans reach the public and maintained the prolific 'no-dig' flowerbeds kept by Deans around her nursing apartment in the northern Sydney suburb of Waitara. The women shared many years co-teaching 'no-dig' gardening techniques to school children and freely sharing their knowledge together at garden fairs until 2009.|$|E
50|$|The pipes {{are also}} used in lining and trench-less technologies, the {{so-called}} <b>no-dig</b> applications where the pipes are installed without digging trenches without any disruption above ground. Here the pipes {{may be used to}} line old pipe systems to reduce leakage and improve water quality. These solutions are therefore helping engineers to rehabilitate antiquated pipe systems. Excavation is minimal and the process is carried out quickly below ground.|$|E
50|$|A <b>no-dig</b> {{system is}} easier than digging. It is a long term process, and is reliant upon having {{plentiful}} organic matter to provide mulch material. It {{is also helpful to}} remove any perennial weed roots from the area beforehand, although their hold can be weakened by applying a light-excluding surface layer such as large sheets of cardboard or several thicknesses of spread out newspaper before adding the compost mulch. The newspaper or cardboard should be thoroughly wet to help it lie flat and keep it from blowing away until the overlying material is added.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{previously}} mentioned trencheless <b>no-dig</b> technology, Foodtubes pipelines are relatively economically friendly. The company estimates that {{construction of the}} Foodtubes system will cost approximately $5 million USD per kilometer of pipeline. The current production cost for a four-lane highway is $28 million per kilometer. For the current plan {{in the city of}} Croydon, construction costs are estimated at £400 million with estimated profits (from money saved) of £80 million per year. Thus, a Foodtubes system in a city such as Croydon would pay for itself in approximately 5 years.|$|E
50|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, mulch is a protective cover {{placed over the}} soil. Any material or combination {{can be used as}} mulch, such as stones, leaves, cardboard, wood chips, gravel, etc., though in permaculture mulches of organic material are the most common because they perform more functions. These include absorbing rainfall, reducing evaporation, providing nutrients, increasing organic matter in the soil, feeding and creating habitat for soil organisms, suppressing weed growth and seed germination, moderating diurnal temperature swings, protecting against frost, and reducing erosion. Sheet mulching is an agricultural <b>no-dig</b> gardening technique that attempts to mimic natural processes occurring within forests. Sheet mulching mimics the leaf cover that is found on forest floors. When deployed properly and in combination with other Permacultural principles, it can generate healthy, productive and low maintenance ecosystems.|$|E
40|$|The <b>no‐dig</b> {{technique}} {{has been proven}} in Europe and Japan as a successful means of constructing underground utilities and drainage works through densely populated areas without causing unacceptable disturbances, by eliminating the conventional open‐cut method. Although this conventional method causes detrimental impacts on traffic flow, pedestrians and motorists, {{as well as on}} the environment, it is commonly employed in Hong Kong for various utility activities. Despite this, the advanced <b>no‐dig</b> technique, which can tackle the problem, remains unpopular. Past records reveal that in Hong Kong the technique had only been applied to the construction and maintenance of utilities to a very limited extent. It is useful to identify the factors impeding its widespread application. This paper reviews the causes that preclude the extensive applications of <b>no‐dig</b> technique to utility works in Hong Kong. The prospect of promoting such a technique in the territory in the future is also investigated. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>No-dig</b> {{gardening}} is {{a method}} of growing crops without turning the soil. Organic matter is added continuously {{in the form of}} mulch, which is decomposed and incorporated into the soil by the microorganisms. When plants photosynthesize they convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, some of which are excreted through the plant roots and fed to the soil microbes. Bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes {{and other members of the}} soil food web convert the carbohydrates into stable forms of carbon, known as humus. The flora and fauna of the soil provide the plants with nutrients and water. The mycorrhizal fungi acts as the plants extended roots, transporting minerals to the plant which the plant roots are unable to obtain by themselves. Digging the soil disturbs the sensitive web of life underground, and can destroy the soil structure and its ability to hold water and nutrients. The purpose of this paper is to research and describe how <b>no-dig</b> gardeners prepare and maintain their organic vegetable gardens. Five gardeners have been interviewed. The results show that the gardeners use different mulches and manures depending on what is available locally. To prepare new beds most of the gardeners start by covering the ground and then layering organic matter on top of the cover. The first years require more maintenance, but as the soil improves over time there is less need for watering, weeding and manures. It can be concluded that <b>no-dig</b> gardening can be done in different ways, the only general rules being that the soil should be disturbed as little as possible and that soil should never be left bare. <b>No-dig</b> gardening aids the carbon sequestration and builds healthy soil, making it a sustainable way to produce food.

40|$|The {{research}} of hydraulic properties of pipes to be relayed in repair bays {{or to be}} <b>no-dig</b> recovered is a constituent part of renovation approach. The designers {{do not have any}} information on hydraulic properties of new protective materials and have to use the hydraulic calculations procedures, strength and hydraulic data submitted by pipe manufacturers that may not be regarded as objective arguments towards selection of pipeline material. Role of experimental hydraulic studies is increasing therewith. One must have information on hydraulic properties of both pipes and repair materials (e. g. polymer covering, new types of polymer pipes, etc.) to analyze the situation. Two polymer pipes {{that can be used for}} trenchless renovation are considered and analyzed: corrugated polypropylene pipe DN 98 and bare pipe DN 105 made from unplasticized polyvinyl chloride.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} excavation technology for repairing damaged underground pipes, such as sewer pipes, various trenchless (excavation free or <b>no-dig)</b> technologies has been proposed and tried, but they have some drawbacks such as high cost and inconvenience of operation. In this study, the rehabilitation process of underground pipes with glass fiber fabric polymer composites using Resin Transfer Molding (RTM), which overcomes the problems of present trenchless technologies has been developed through the axiomatic design approach. For the reliable and faultless operation, all the problems and situations that may occur during the real construction has been taken into account at every stage of the design process. The developed process requires shorter operation time and lower cost with smaller and simpler operating equipments than conventional trenchless technologies. From the investigation, {{it has been found}} that the developed repair technology with appropriate process parameters determined by design axioms has many advantages over conventional methods.

40|$|With {{the urban}} rapid development, it is {{necessary}} to build a variety of public facilities including underground lifelines. However, due to the existing heavy traffic, it is difficult to obtain additional space for open-cut installation of pipelines. Therefore, the <b>No-Dig</b> method was developed and applied. <b>No-Dig</b> method often encounters difficult geological problems, which makes the excavation in difficulty and thus affecting the construction schedule. Taichung area is majorly covered by gravel alluvium, in which the strata contains large gravels. Those large size gravels often result in excessive wear and increase in construction cost. In this paper, we took samples from the launch shaft of pipe-jacking projects in Taichung and carried out sieve analyses. Then we transformed the size distribution into borehole data by the newly derived formula. The obtained borehole data was applied to the T-PROGS geostatistic analysis. The purpose of the geostatistic analysis is to building a 3 D geological model by the data from pipe-jacking shaft, then we can obtain the geological and size distribution parameters along the pipe-jacking alignment. In this study, the analysis was performed for different scenerios and the impact of material changes on the pipe jacking rate. The results show that the change of gravel particles larger than 20 cm is highly correlated with pipe jacking rate. In addition, we also tried to use the image analysis to replace the large scale sieving test. Through the image software ”Image J”, we carried out the image sieve analysis, and compared with the size distribution from the original sieving test. And the results suggest that it is feasible to apply the image sieve analysis to replace the in situ sieve analysis. 隨著都市與工業快速發展，需興建各種地下化維生管線之公共設施，但基於現有都市交通壅擠、地下維生管線日益複雜，增設管線空間取得不易，因此免開挖工法便因應而生。免開挖工法經常遭遇到困難地質問題，使得開挖不易進而影響施工進度。台中地質屬於卵礫石沖積層，地層中含許多大型卵礫石，常造成推進過程機頭過度磨耗，造成施工本增加，本研究針對台中之推進工程之地質問題進行研究。 本研究利用現地工程案例推進坑進行地質材料取樣並進行篩分析，再透過自行推導之公式修正轉換為鑽孔柱狀圖數據後，輸入GMS之子程式T-PROGS進行分析。分析之目的在於以工作井之數據來建立三維地質模型，進而求取推進過程中可能遭遇之地質及粒徑條件，分析各種建模狀況，並透過與實際工程案例比較，探討其內部材料分佈對推進速率之影響，結果顯示，粒徑大於 20 公分之材料其變化趨勢與推進速率有高度相關性。 此外，本研究簡單的測試利用於推進坑取得之開挖璧影像，透過影像軟體ImageJ擷取顆粒後進行影像篩分析，觀察比較其結果與真實現地篩分析之差別，討論差異所在，並探討以影像篩分析取代大型篩分析之可行性，結果顯示以面積單位做完篩分析之過篩單位較符合真實現地篩分析粒徑分布。誌謝	I 摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 目錄	IV 表目錄	VII 圖目錄	VIII 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 3 1. 3 研究方法	 4 1. 4 論文架構	 5 第二章 文獻回顧	 6 2. 1 地質統計學簡介	 6 2. 1. 1 地質統計學之相關文獻	 6 2. 2 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論簡介	 7 2. 2. 1 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論相關文獻	 8 2. 3 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之簡介	 10 2. 3. 1 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之相關文獻	 10 第三章 研究方法	 13 3. 1 現地取樣及篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 1 大型篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 2 試驗流程	 14 3. 2 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據值	 15 3. 2. 1 一維有效粒徑	 15 3. 2. 2 二維及三維有效粒徑推導	 15 3. 2. 3 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據	 18 3. 3 T-PROGS分析	 21 3. 3. 1 T-PROGS分析理論	 21 3. 3. 2 T-PROGS 分析流程	 27 3. 4 影像篩分析	 29 第四章 篩分析分析結果	 30 4. 1 大型篩分析試驗結果	 30 4. 2 粒徑分佈轉換鑽孔數據與修正粒徑分佈結果	 30 第五章 T-PROGS分析結果與討論	 32 5. 1 自行建模敏感性模擬	 32 5. 1. 1 考慮空間觀點之比較結果	 32 5. 1. 2 考慮推進機具管徑之比較結果	 34 5. 1. 3 考慮整體觀點之比較結果	 35 5. 1. 4 結果討論	 36 5. 2 實際案例之分析探討	 38 5. 2. 1 實際案例分析結果	 39 5. 2. 2 實際案例應用與推進率關係之比較	 39 5. 2. 3 結果討論	 40 5. 3 利用影像軟體進行篩分析	 41 5. 3. 1 分析簡介	 41 5. 3. 2 影像篩分析結果	 43 5. 3. 3 結果討論	 43 第六章 結果討論	 45 6. 1 結論	 45 6. 2 建議	 47 參考文獻	 4...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{the information on}} a promising technology for trenchless repair named Swagelining, which supposes pulling into the old pipeline the new polymer with its preliminary thermo-mechanical compression and further straightening. The coauthors present {{the results of the}} calculations determining the thickness of the polyethylene pipes after compression and straightening in the old pipeline depending on the initial diameter in case of different ratio of the diameter to the wall thickness (SDR) and the dynamics of the changes in hydraulic performance after repair work on the pipeline using the method Swagelining. The concept of the energy saving potential is formed in addition to a <b>no-dig</b> repair for pressure piping systems, water supply, and its magnitude. On the basis of the research results, the authors formulate the principles of the energy efficiency potential after the implementation of the trenchless technology of drawing the old pipeline with new polymer pipes with their preliminary thermo-mechanical compression and subsequent area enlargement. The technology Swagelining is described and the authors develop a mathematical model that illustrates the behavior of the pipeline in the process of shrink operations. Such parameters are analyzed as changing the diameter of the pipeline at thermo-mechanical compression, the hydraulic parameters of the new (polymer) and old (steel) pipelines, energy savings on one-meter length of the pipeline. The calculated values of the electric power economy on the whole length of the pipeline repair section with a corresponding flow of transported waters. The characteristics and capabilities of the technology of trenchless renovation Swagelining allows achieving simultaneously the effect of resource saving (eliminationof the defects and, as a consequence, of water leakage) and energy saving (reduction in the water transportation cost). A numerical example of the old steel pipeline renovation shows the calculated data, which proves the efficiency of the considered technology. The calculation results can be used as base material for designers when selecting the final decision of the alternative at reconstruction of dilapidated pipelines by Swagelining using a wide range of polymer pipes with the corresponding value of the SDR...|$|E
