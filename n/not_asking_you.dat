500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to refrain from your action, but I {{want to tell you that}} the allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{suggestions}} that renaming efforts stem from egotism or personal pique, Stallman has responded that his interest {{is not in}} giving credit to himself but to the GNU Project: [...] "Some people think that it's because I want my ego to be fed. Of course, I'm <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to call it 'Stallmanix'." [...] Stallman has admitted to irritation, although he believes it to be justified in response to seeing [...] "an idealistic project stymied and made ineffective, because people don't usually give it the credit for what it has done," [...] concluding [...] "If you're an idealist like me, that can ruin your whole decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2013 Cohen, {{speaking}} to The Guardian, made {{an appeal to}} the famous street artist Banksy. Hoping that Banksy's influence could help save 5 Pointz, he said [...] "We’re <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to give us money, but your words could help. Why don’t you put a comment out?”. This {{was in the midst of}} Banksy's highly publicized month-long residency in New York City, during which he released a new piece each day somewhere in the city and posted clues to its whereabouts on his website. There was no response from Banksy until October 31, the final day of his residency, when the message posted on his website which accompanied his last piece read, [...] "Thanks for your patience. It's been fun. Save 5pointz. Bye." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of Lopez's image, Andrew Barker of Variety observed: [...] "Despite a {{carefully}} cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles [...] "I'm Real" [...] and [...] "Jenny From the Block". She managed the perilous transition from actress to music star without ever seeming to pick {{either as a}} primary gig. She established herself as an oft-provocative sex symbol while her demeanor made it abundantly clear that she's <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to come hither." [...] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez as overexposed. She wrote: [...] "Forgive yourself if you are seeing Jennifer Lopez in your sleep. She is everywhere." [...] Holloway noted her image to be [...] "a dash of ghetto fabulousness" [...] and [...] "middle-class respectability" [...] for mass appeal. Entertainment Weekly observed a change in her public profile upon joining American Idol in 2011, writing: [...] "Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth [...]" [...] Lopez is considered an icon of popular culture. Television presenter Ray Martin describes her as a [...] "showbiz phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|Founders of Women for the Wall {{have stated}} that they support {{alternative}} prayer at the Robinson's Arch section of the Kotel. They have requested meetings with leaders of Women of the Wall, who have declined. W4W leaders state that their objection is to the imposition of alternative prayer and associated political agendas on traditional women, plus their desire to confront and shock them, at Judaism's holiest site [...] [...] "Don't forget, Women FOR the Wall is <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to change. They are asking you not to change them." [...] Ronit Peskin has stated concerning traditional women, [...] "We want to come and pray peacefully, and you (The Women of the Wall group that insist on praying in the traditional women's section and not at Robinson's Arch) are disrupting the prayers of other women around you." [...] Leaders of W4W have condemned any show of verbal or phsycal violence by orthodox Jews against WoW and their supporters. The ongoing efforts of W4W to role model peaceful, silent prayer, plus their calls to the orthodox to refuse to respond to provocations have decreased heated reactions from the orthodox camp; The Forward described the gathering at the Kotel on 4 October 2013 (Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan) [...] "the calmest prayer service in months".|$|E

2500|$|On November 19, 2006, Governor Romney led a rally {{against the}} legislature's delaying tactics {{in front of}} the Massachusetts State House. Romney said: [...] "The issue before us is not whether {{same-sex}} couples should marry. The issue before us today is whether 109 legislators will follow the constitution." [...] He said he would ask a justice of the SJC to order the initiative placed on the ballot because the legislators were refusing to fulfill their constitutional obligations. The next day he sent the 109 legislators a copy of the state constitution with a letter underscoring the document's provision that the legislators sitting as a constitutional convention shall vote on initiatives: [...] "Not 'may' vote ... not 'could' vote ... not 'perhaps' vote ... It's very clear." [...] His reference was to the clause: [...] "final legislative action in the joint session ... shall be taken only by call of the yeas and nays". He filed the lawsuit as one member of a group of private citizens on November 24, citing 5 occasions in 24 years in which the legislature failed to vote on valid initiatives. Other plaintiffs included Ray Flynn and officials of VoteOnMarriage.org and the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. Named as defendants were the Massachusetts Secretary of State, who oversees the preparation of election ballots, William F. Galvin, and the President of the Massachusetts Senate who chairs joint sessions of the legislature, Senator Travaglini. After a 20-minute hearing on November 30, Associate Justice Judith A. Cowin ordered an expedited hearing before the full SJC on December 20. At that hearing both sides agreed that the SJC could not enforce an order against the legislature. An attorney for the plaintiffs said: [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> to tell the Legislature how to do their business. We're only asking you to declare what their constitutional obligations are." [...] An Assistant Attorney General representing the legislature countered that the voters were free to replace the legislators at the next election.|$|E
