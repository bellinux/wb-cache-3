5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: why would Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E

Some transliteration schemes find its inclusion necessary for showing spirantization or for historical reasons.

Where objective measurement is desired, light levels can be quantified by field measurement or mathematical modeling, with results typically displayed as an isophote map or light contour map. Authorities have also taken a variety of measures for dealing with light pollution, depending on the interests, beliefs and understandings of the society involved. Measures range from doing <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>to</b> implementing strict laws and regulations about how lights may be installed and used.|$|E

[...] This annoyed Tremaine, and Isaac Asimov, who gave Wollheim a story for Cosmic Stories, later recalled Tremaine telling him that [...] "any author who donated stories to Wollheim, and thus contributed to the destruction of competing magazines who paid, should be blacklisted in the field". [...] Asimov was sufficiently upset that he later obtained token payment from Wollheim so that he could assert he had been paid for his story.|$|E

Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

Polanyi further {{asserted that}} all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science. Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of [...] "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'". Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments {{similar to those found}} in religion.|$|E

She suggested rather that her psychosis returned {{as a result of}} the Haldol having been discontinued by her doctor two weeks earlier.

In her speech, King also criticized {{a group of black}} pastors in her home state of Georgia for backing a bill to amend that state's constitution to block gay and lesbian couples from marrying. Scott King is quoted as saying [...] "Gay and lesbian people have families, and their families should have legal protection, whether by marriage or civil union.

2500|$|According to Avi Primor, {{president}} of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, Grass was the only important German cultural figure who had refused {{to meet with him}} when he served as Israeli ambassador to Germany. Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one would imagine) had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> do with his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not see it that way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E

Several women of social standing were listed as patronesses such as the Duchess of Buccleuch, Dowager Marchioness of Salisbury, Dowager Countess Harcourt, Lady Emily Pusey, Lady Eyre and Lady Mackintosh. At this meeting Richard Martin contradicted the impression held in public circles that he had founded the Society: [...] "I have <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> do with it," [...] he said [...] "it is quite a child of Mr Broome's and he has acted the part of a good father to it." [...] Broome also sought that year to develop an anti-vivisection position and requested written advice from several medical practitioners concerning the efficacy of surgical or laboratory experiments on animals and received letters that did not support vivisection.|$|E

2500|$|After the Reactionaries disbanded, Boon and Watt formed Minutemen in January 1980. Watt {{has said}} their name had <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} brevity of their songs; rather, it was derived partly from the fabled minutemen militia of colonial times and partly to lampoon a right-wing reactionary group of the 1960s that went by that name. In the {{documentary}} We Jam Econo, Watt also states that the name was a play on [...] "minute" [...] ( [...] ). After a month with no drummer, during which Boon and Watt wrote their first songs, the band rehearsed and played a couple of early gigs with local welder Frank Tonche on drums. The group had originally wanted George Hurley to join, but he had joined a hardcore punk band called Hey Taxi! with Michael Ely and Spider Taylor after the Reactionaries disbanded. Tonche quit the group, citing a dislike of the audience the band initially drew, and Hurley took over as drummer in June 1980. (Early rehearsal recordings with Tonche on drums later became the georgeless EP.) Their first live gig was as an opening band for Black Flag.|$|E

Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've got, and if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has <b>nothing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E
