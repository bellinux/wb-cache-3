40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the sharing economy—through {{the use of the}} Internet and real time {{reputational}} feedback mechanisms—is providing a solution to the lemons problem that many regulators have spent decades attempting to overcome. Section I provides an overview of the sharing economy and traces its rapid growth. Section II revisits the lemons theory as well as the various regulatory solutions proposed {{to deal with the problem}} of asymmetric information. Section III discusses the relationship between reputation and trust and analyzes how reputational incentives affect commercial interactions. Section IV discusses how information asymmetries were addressed in the pre-Internet era. It also discusses how the evolution of both the Internet and information systems (especially the reputational feedback mechanisms of the sharing economy) addresses the lemons problem. Section V explains how these new realities affect public policy and concludes that asymmetric information is not a legitimate rationale for policy intervention in light of technological changes. We also argue that continued use of this rationale to regulate in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> protection might, in fact, make consumers worse off. This has ramifications for the current debate over regulation of the sharing economy...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} {{the phenomenon of}} unbranding. Unbranding occurs when a firm chooses to discontinue its use of a brand that has developed negative associations among <b>consumers</b> in favor <b>of</b> a new brand, often in hopes of escaping the consequences of inferior products or illegal activity. Companies like AIG, Blackwater, Philip Morris, and WorldComm have all employed this strategy in recent years. Unbranding represents a striking departure from branding orthodoxy, which stresses the maintenance of brand equity through the gradual evolution of a brand. After examining the factors that prompt firms to take the radical step of eliminating an established brand, this Article considers two legal regimes for restraining unbranding in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> protection. The first is trademark law. Despite the fit between the potential harms <b>of</b> unbranding, namely <b>consumer</b> confusion and increased search costs, and the established rationales for trademark protection, this Article concludes that trademark doctrine is structurally incapable of fully addressing the threat of unbranding because of its focus on inter-brand confusion. The second and more promising approach relies on the rubrics of false and deceptive advertising. Both section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act and section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act provide a legal basis for targeting unbranding. Ultimately, this Article concludes that because consumers lack standing and competitors often lack sufficient incentives to sue under the Lanham Act, the FTC is best positioned {{to protect against the}} harms of unbranding...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project used Functional Measurement {{to examine how}} the brand <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> products impacts intended purchasing decisions. Thirty undergraduate students tested actual products from three different product categories (crayons, tissues, and tortilla chips). Each product category consisted of three different brands; one with high brand value, one with medium, and one with low brand (generic) value. For each brand, there were five conditions: 1) the product with the correct brand name; 2) the product with a switched brand name; 3) the product with another switched brand name; 4) the product alone with no brand name; and 5) the brand name alone with no product. Participants were unaware that products had been switched. After trying each product, participants rated their likelihood to purchase on a 9 -point Likert scale: 1 being "definitely would not buy" and 9 being "definitely would buy. " Results revealed that perceptions of quality were dependent on both perceived product quality and brand name. Unexpectedly, results also showed that {{the strength of the}} brand equity effect is dependent on product type, e. g., chips showed the strongest brand effect. For most product categories, main effects and interactions were significant. Functional measurement analyses revealed that brand name effects were independent of product quality. In conclusion, the brand name associated with a product led people to evaluate quality of that product as either higher or lower depending on the strength <b>of</b> the brand <b>name...</b>|$|R
