However, their findings cannot be properly presented in traditional media, which lack these core attributes. Creating a presentation tool that captures this environment poses unique challenges, namely related to poor viewing accessibility.

Playful mapping practices and the shift from the map as form of representation to the map as interactive, if not ludic, interface for navigation point to-wards the performativity of our engagement with the map as tool to think with, as well as tool to do with. In this contribution I will take up the pro-posals for considering playful mapping (Perkins 2009; Lammes 2013) and a ludification of culture (Raessens 2010) and extend on my argument about <b>navigational</b> <b>interfaces</b> and navigation as performative practice (Verhoeff 2012) and consider how, through the centrality of these practices, the map is the interface for a subject-centered, deictic and haptic engagement with space.

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{findings}} of an in-depth observational study of reading and within-document navigation and add to these findings {{the results of a}} second analysis of how people read comparable digital materials on the screen, given limited navigational functionality. We chose periodicals as our initial foil since they represent a type of material that invites many different kinds of reading and strategies for navigation. Using multiple sources of evidence from the data, we first characterize readers’ navigation strategies and specific practices as they make their way through the magazines. We then focus on two observed phenomena that occur when people read paper magazines, but are absent in their digital equivalents: the lightweight navigation that readers use unselfconsciously when they are reading a particular article and the approximate navigation readers engage in when they flip multiple pages at a time. Because page-turning is so basic and seems deceptively simple, we dissect the turn of a page, and use it to illustrate the importance and invisibility of lightweight navigation. Finally, we explore the significance of our results for <b>navigational</b> <b>interfaces</b> to digital library materials...|$|R
5000|$|While the {{hierarchical}} database model structures data as a tree of records, with each record having one parent record and many children, the network model allows each record to have multiple {{parent and child}} records, forming a generalized graph structure. This property applies at two levels: the schema is a generalized graph of record types connected by relationship types (called [...] "set types" [...] in CODASYL), and the database itself is a generalized graph of record occurrences connected by relationships (CODASYL [...] "sets"). Cycles are permitted at both levels.The chief argument in favour of the network model, in comparison to {{the hierarchical}} model, was that it allowed a more natural modeling of relationships between entities. Although the model was widely implemented and used, it failed to become dominant for two main reasons. Firstly, IBM chose to stick to the hierarchical model with semi-network extensions in their established products such as IMS and DL/I. Secondly, it was eventually displaced by the relational model, which offered a higher-level, more declarative interface. Until the early 1980s the performance benefits of the low-level <b>navigational</b> <b>interfaces</b> offered by hierarchical and network databases were persuasive for many large-scale applications, but as hardware became faster, the extra productivity and flexibility of the relational model led to the gradual obsolescence of the network model in corporate enterprise usage.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of automatically modifying the user's viewpoint orientation {{for the purpose of}} enhancing the navigation experience. We concentrate on outdoor virtual environments where the terrain is uneven as well as certain cases of indoor flat environment floors, respectively on environments where focus-drawing objects and different types of obstacles exist. Most natural environments present these properties and virtual environments that are based on natural environments are in abundance. The navigational adjustments are introduced as response to environment stimuli such as slope changes, the emergence of visibility rays to focus objects or as navigational difficulty events occur after encounters with nonoversteppable obstacles. A scheme is presented that facilitates the viewpoint orientation feature. Conceptually, the viewpoint orientation is a method of partially and temporarily decoupling the head movements from the navigation direction. Virtual environments in general and their encoding in VRML, X 3 D, Java 3 D as well as other scenegraphs are analyzed to reveal bottlenecks in current scenegraphs that make the implementation of such automatic adjustments from difficult to impossible, needing custom navigational code where possible. Different scenarios are presented, where these adjustments can prove useful by speeding up the navigation and providing a higher quality, richer experience. Additional to relevant literature, further experiments are necessary to analyze the effect of automatic view adjustments on the user's immersiveness experience and direction sense (path finding), experiments which could be carried out using custom <b>navigational</b> <b>interfaces</b> incorporating head movement extensions separated from the navigational data, extensions proposed in this [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Building {{large and}} complex Web {{applications}} {{is a difficult}} task. It involves graphical <b>interfaces,</b> <b>navigational</b> structures, business models and rules, software architecture and technologies, and many other aspects such as mobile communication. Furthermore, Web applications should be developed with short time. To deal with the extreme complexity, a good solution is to decouple different parts and aspects in Web applications. Decoupling gives also better possibility for reuse and parallel development, which in themselves are a clear way to reduce application development time. In this paper we examine two aspects in Web application development: software architecture and application-specific design, and explore techniques {{that can be used}} in these two fields to improve reuse and achieve shorter time-to-market. For software architecture, a component-based Web architecture is built step by step to remove the tight coupling between a Web application’s different parts. For application design, many mature design methods exist. We introduce the object-oriented hypermedia method OOHDM [1] and the aim is to explain how different concerns are addressed in this method independent of software architecture and implementation. Treating conceptual, <b>navigational</b> and <b>interface</b> design as separate concerns provides not only a sound ground for Web application evolution but also a basis for reuse and shorter development time. In the end, we combine the benefits of the component-based Web architecture and the three different concerns in OOHDM [1]. The resulting architecture maximises opportunities for reuse and parallel development. As a consequent, time-to-market is reduced...|$|R

Some proposals {{that have been made}} to resolve some of these inadequacies are reviewed. Then, we outline and justify an Entity Relationship based three level schema architecture which addresses several OO data modelling inadequacies, viz. the lack of support for the notion of relationship in the OO approach, the lack of support for external schemas, the inability to judge the quality of an OO schema and the lack of a reasonable approach to resolve inheritance conflicts in class hierarchies. ...|$|E

We next focus on the problem of design reuse in Web applications. After a short review the state of the art of object-oriented application frameworks we present the rationale for a slightly different approach focusing on design reuse instead of code reuse.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} performance estimation for shared-nothing parallel database systems. It estimates system throughput for a given benchmark or set of queries, and can exercise different data placement schemes to determine the data layout which provides the best throughput value. 1 Introduction Performance estimation is a valuable technique for the design and tuning of parallel database systems. It allows alternative design choices to be tested easily and cheaply and can highlight potential performance problems in designs long before any construction costs are incurred. A number of approaches {{have been developed to}} estimate performance using measures such as throughput or response time to handle a particular workload on some parallel database architectures. An example is APE (Adaptive Performance Evaluator) [1], which was designed to serve as the cost evaluation component for the query optimiser on DBS 3 [2]. It includes four parts: KERNEL (a multi-environment cost evaluator of query execution plans), PROF (a statistical profiler of applications), SPEC (a <b>navigational</b> user <b>interface</b> for environment specification) and PERF (a graphical interface). APE uses an analytical model to estimate the response time for query execution.
