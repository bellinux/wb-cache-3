5|$|After {{listening}} to the song, Barber was inspired to create a video around the Beatles' appearance on Sullivan's show based on the song's musical structure, but André 3000 had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 {{and came up with}} the idea of reversing the British Invasion, by having the American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed in two days in August 2003 on a sound stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.|$|E

She stated: [...] "I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote." [...] Following Barack Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive.

500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

They didn’t do a study! They arbitrarily found 59 studies that other people had done [...] combined them all." ...|$|E

2500|$|After High Court judges {{ruled in}} 2016 that {{parliamentary}} approval must be sought for activation of Article 50, the leading headline on the Mails front page read [...] "Enemies of the people". The paper's front page and other coverage drew much {{criticism from the}} legal world, {{as well as from}} high-ranking politicians. On its website, the Mail described one of the judges as [...] "openly gay." [...] Critics accused the Mail of unnecessarily highlighting the judge's sexual orientation due to anti-gay motives. The Mail later removed the description. One law professor commented: [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> kind of invective against judges, either here or abroad, in the national media." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Carpenter {{had seen}} Dennis Dun in Year of the Dragon and liked {{his work in}} that film. He met the actor twice before casting him {{in the role of}} Wang Chi only a few days before {{principal}} photography. The martial arts sequences were not hard for Dun who had [...] "dabbled" [...] in training as a kid and done Chinese opera as an adult. He was drawn to the portrayal of Asian characters in the movie as he said, [...] "I’m seeing Chinese actors getting to do stuff that American movies usually don’t let them do. I’ve <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> type of role for an Asian in an American film".|$|E

After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems. This subject was already known to the students from the lectures of professor Delarue. But what Lyapunov taught us was new to me and I had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>this</b> material in any textbook. All antipathy to the course was immediately blown to dust. From that day students would show Lyapunov a special respect." ...|$|E
