In December 2012, Burger King entered into a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> with Beboca Ltd., a franchisee in Panama and Costa Rica. The <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> establishes a new entity, BK Centro America (BKCA), that will be the new master franchise for Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama; BKCA will responsible for the overseeing of development of Burger King in these countries. Additionally, BKCA will provide logistics support, advertising and purchasing assistance not only those countries, but others in Burger King's Latin American and Caribbean development area.|$|E

5|$|It was in {{this context}} that Abu Taghlib is first {{mentioned}} in 964, when his father had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The two {{companies}} attempted {{to reach a}} <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> for ten months before it fell through in January 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films {{on their own and}} collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the distribution fee. More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles (2004) and Cars (2006). Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant prepayment of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, VAT made a loss of 746,000 marks. In 1949, VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators; it produced 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a devaluation of the Finnish mark.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, {{who were supposed to}} bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} moves {{were also}} made in other global markets during 2012. The African market saw a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> with Grand Parade Investments of South Africa to enter Africa's largest economy, with restaurants opening in 2013. In Europe, Burger King {{returned to the}} French market in 2012 with an agreement with multinational operator Autogrill, a move that has met with some excitement in the country. The chain left the country in 1997, closing its 22 franchised and 17 corporate locations after a poorly executed entry into the market that left it unable to compete against McDonald's and local chain Quick. The partnership with Autogrill is a move to consolidate Burger King's presence in travel plazas along major highways in France, Italy, Poland and other European nations.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E

The second agreement is the Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum and was signed by then-U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and then-Economics and Trade Minister Joseph Deiss. The last agreement is the revised Operative Working Arrangement on Law Enforcement Cooperation on Counterterrorism and was signed by U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and then-Swiss Justice Minister Christoph Blocher.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, O'Donnell and Timken began {{talks with}} the Coast Guard Museum Association about selling the station to a {{third-party}} investor associated with the Association. The sale was originally to be effective {{at the end of}} 2014, but was delayed because the Redevelopment Agency never issued a formal certificate of completion for the 1975 sale and renovations. Since the Agency was dissolved in 2008, the City Council issued the certificate in early January 2015, allowing the sale the proceed. On January 12, the Council released the station from the 1960s urban renewal plan as part of an agreement with O'Donnell and Timken to ease the sale process. The <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> also included stipulations for historic preservation of the building, and allowed – but not required – its continued use as a train station. On January 29, 2015, Union Station Development sold the station to the New London RR Company – a holding company owned by James Coleman Jr., chairman of the Association – for $3 million. Coleman brought in a restaurant serving locally sourced food for the first floor, and intends to renovate the second floor for use by museum-related tenants.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, {{the owners}} decided {{to opt out}} of the 1993 arrangement, per the {{agreement}} with the players, with the termination to follow a year with no salary cap in 2010. By the CBA's expiration in March 2011, the NFLPA and the NFL had not yet come to terms on a <b>new</b> <b>agreement.</b> The owners were expected to lock out the players upon termination of the agreement. However, the NFLPA filed papers to decertify as a union on March 11, 2011, and filed an antitrust suit to enjoin the lockout with lead plaintiffs quarterbacks Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. U.S. District Court judge Susan Richard Nelson granted the players' request to end the owners' lockout on April 25. The league asked Nelson to stay the order while they appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals; Nelson refused. On April 29, the Eighth Circuit granted the league a temporary stay of Nelson's ruling; the league reinstated the lockout the same day. The Eighth Circuit vacated Nelson's ruling on July 8, affirming the legitimacy of the lockout. During the lockout, players were barred from using team facilities and contacting team coaches; many organized their own workout regimens.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{introduced legislation}} to reform funding {{arrangements for the}} health system, {{with the intention of}} giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent of funding for primary care and GP services. In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede a proportion of their GST revenue to the Federal Government in order to fund the new arrangement. The <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> was supported by all state premiers and chief ministers and signed on 2 August.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and teams can knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The <b>new</b> <b>agreement,</b> as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations with Pelagius {{about the}} status of the Church in the Kingdom of Cyprus {{concluded}} with an agreement in October 1220. One of Alice's demands was for Greek Orthodox priests to be exempt from taxation. She also persuaded the pope, who had ordered the abolition of the Orthodox hierarchy on the island, to permit the appointment of Orthodox suffragan bishops in the four Roman Catholic dioceses. In time, the agreement was revised, as the Cypriot noblemen opposed the payment of a tithe (as prescribed by the agreement). The Holy See had also demanded that the estates the nobles had seized from the Orthodox Church be restored to the Catholic clerics. However, this <b>new</b> <b>agreement,</b> reached in 1222, neither freed the noblemen from the tithe nor prescribed the restoration of Church property.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E

5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being out of service during the January–February cold spell, when batteries and rectifiers would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing by the manufacturer. At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken out of service, and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the NHL's {{collective}} bargaining agreement (CBA) expiring in September, teams reassigned players on two-way or entry-level contracts to minor league affiliates. The Canucks assigned 27 players, including Christopher Tanev, Eddie Lack, Zack Kassian and 2012 second-round draft pick Alexandre Mallet to the Chicago Wolves, while first round pick Brendan Gaunce was sent to his junior team, the Belleville Bulls. When the CBA expired on September 15, the NHL enforced a lockout until a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> could be reached. Canucks management posted {{a message from the}} team to the fans stating that they would continue with community initiatives throughout the lockout, which they hoped would be resolved as soon as possible, and thanked fans for their loyalty and patience.

The King County Council called for a <b>new</b> <b>agreement</b> to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network.
