5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> chasing fads, {{though she}} {{is well aware of}} them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough cut of the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch. From this, they created a number of pieces that they felt could be {{cross-faded}} at various points in the final cut of the film. They were <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet {{leadership}} viewed {{events in}} Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country {{could lead to}} the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets {{for such a long time}} that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.|$|E

5|$|Within the week, {{they had}} a working game written in Adobe Flash's ActionScript 2. The two agreed to {{complete}} it out as a game they could release on Steam though with no expectations of sales. Completion of the game from the prototype to the finished state took about 3 months with part-time development. During this time, they discovered there were several limitations on the {{size and scope of}} both Flash and ActionScript that limited how much they could do with the game, but continued to use the tools as to release the title. McMillen said that because they were <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about sales, they were able to work with Valve to release the game without fears of censorship or having to seek an ESRB rating. Releasing through Steam also enabled them to update the game freely, several times on its initial release, an aspect that they could not do with other consoles without significant cost to themselves. They did release without significant end-user testing, as it would have taken several hundreds of users to go through all the various combinations of items that a player could collect, and McMillen recognized they had released the title with their buyers being playtesters for them. A week after the Steam release, McMillen released a demo version via the website Newgrounds. Merge Games produced a physical edition that included the game, soundtrack, and a poster, for stores in the United Kingdom in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Federer then {{played the}} Estoril Open. In his only {{previous}} appearance in 2008, {{he won the}} title, when Davydenko retired in the final. However, he lost in the semifinals this year to Albert Montañés in straight sets, after which Federer said he was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> by his current form, while Nadal expressed surprise at his rival's loss.|$|E
25|$|Acuff's {{nomination}} caused {{great concern}} for E.H. Crump, {{the head of}} a Memphis Democratic Party political machine that had dominated Tennessee state politics for nearly a quarter-century. Crump was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> so much about losing the governor's office—in spite of Acuff's name recognition—but did worry that Acuff would draw large crowds to Republican rallies and bolster other statewide candidates. While Acuff did relatively well and helped reinvigorate Tennessee's Republicans, his opponent, Gordon Browning, still won with 67 percent of the vote.|$|E

25|$|He died at {{the mission}} on 3 September 1870. While in Warrnambool in 1867, Dick-a-Dick was {{introduced}} to Christianity by Lawrence and appeared strongly affected by the life of Jesus. He was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about the trip to England as he knew the captain had prayed for a safe arrival. Just before his death, he confessed his faith in Christianity and was baptised on 30 July 1870. Minutes before his death, Dick-a-Dick claimed to have seen the face of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Major General Phạm Văn Phú, the II Corps commander, {{was given}} {{adequate}} warnings {{of the impending}} attacks, but was <b>not</b> <b>worried.</b> He thought the true objective was Pleiku or Kon Tum and that Buôn Ma Thuột was a diversion. The town was therefore lightly defended and communists outnumbered defenders by more than 8:1. The battle for Buôn Ma Thuột began on March 10 and ended only eight days later. Reinforcements were flown in, but were dismantled and fled in chaos.|$|E
25|$|Ackerson was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> {{with the}} album being perfect; for example, when Pierre forgot {{to record a}} lyric at the studio, he {{recorded}} it on his computer {{and sent it to}} Ackerson, who simply added reverb and mixed it into the recording. The band at the time considered their work on Go a step further than anything they had done prior, which included hiring a live string ensemble to perform. The band finished 16–17 songs, using 11 for the album and the remainder for B-sides and bonus tracks.|$|E

25|$|Friends {{and family}} say Bethany {{did her best}} to keep in contact with them. But due to Bethany's busy life, {{balancing}} her classes in what was to be her final semester at GMU with a full-time job, they had gotten used to not hearing from her for several days at a time, so they were <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> as February 2011 began without any news from her. However, later in the month several of her friends called her mother, Kim Nelson, saying that they had received messages from her via her Facebook account that did not seem to them to have come from Bethany.|$|E
25|$|On October 16, 1994, Juliá and Poloway {{attended}} the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. After the opera, {{he was supposed}} to meet Marcos Zurinaga, a Puerto Rican filmmaker who directed Juliá in the Argentine/Puerto Rican coproduction Tango Bar. Juliá began feeling intense abdominal pain and had to be taken by ambulance to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, Long Island. He was initially <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> by the issue, reviewing the script for his intended role in Desperado from his hospital bed, but his condition worsened. Later that night, Juliá suffered an unexpected stroke. He fell into a coma on October 20, 1994 and was put on life support. Four days later, on October 24, 1994, Juliá died due to terminal complications from the stroke.|$|E
25|$|The erasures were {{sporadic}} and haphazard, {{with only}} the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished {{and it may be}} that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign and, her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.|$|E

Norwegian stated that they were <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about competition from Ryanair, and announced that they would continue with flights to the Mediterranean, Eastern Europe and domestically. However, they would not start the announced services to Amsterdam and London, and instead concentrate their growth at Gardermoen. The company stated that they made 3% of their revenue at Rygge. On 9 September, the ministry increased the air movement ceiling to 21,000 movements per year. On 24 November, Ryanair announced that they would establish a base at Rygge in March 2010. The airline would start services to Århus, Berlin, Dublin, Weeze, Eindhoven, Gdańsk, Kraków, La Rochelle, Málaga, Munich, Palma de Mallorca, Paris, Riga, Wrocław, Valencia and Venice. In December, the company announced further routes to Faro and Zadar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of 22 July a most {{important}} meeting took place: the one between the King and Mussolini, who wanted to report about the outcome of Feltre. The content of the conversation is unknown, but according to Badoglio, {{it is possible that}} Mussolini calmed down the King's fears, promising him to disengage Italy from the war by September 15. These two months of delay {{can be explained by the}} fact that, on the one hand, Bastianini had begun contacts with the Allies which would need some time to proceed; on the other, Mussolini needed some time to justify himself and Italy before the world for his betrayal. Apparently the King agreed with him, as this would explain why the Duce was <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> at all about the outcome of the Grand Council meeting. In fact, without the aid of the King, a coup d’etat was destined to fail. Anyway, at the end of the meeting the two men reached two quite different conclusions: while Mussolini was convinced that the King was always at his side, Victor Emmanuel was disappointed after telling him in vain that he should resign. The King was forced now to consider the putsch seriously, as he knew that Bastianini was trying to contact the Allies, while Farinacci, the fascist hardliner, was organizing a putsch to depose him and Mussolini and bring Italy under direct German control. The real decision was taken after knowing that the Grand Council had approved Grandi's OdG.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the many}} {{elements}} in the dream sequences have meaning, {{with the exception of}} the Cheese Man. Whedon explains: [...] "...the Cheese Man—meaningless. Why?

He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Youkilis's error-less streak {{at the end}} of {{the regular}} season was 190 games; while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16, 2007, playoff game against the Cleveland Indians, postseason games are not {{included}} in the record.
