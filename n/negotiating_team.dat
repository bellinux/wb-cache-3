Rudd's <b>negotiating</b> <b>team,</b> armed with Robinson's endorsement, was still far from ready—they left Kimberley only on 15 August—but Moffat, {{travelling}} from Shoshong in Bechuanaland, was ahead of both expeditions. He reached Bulawayo in late August to find the kraal filled with white concession-hunters. The various bidders attempted to woo the king {{with a series of}} gifts and favours, but won little to show for it.|$|E

Despite strict rules from the Soviets about photography at the signing ceremony, Seaborg snuck a tiny camera past the Soviet guards to take a close-up photograph of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev as he signed the treaty.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of these limits to the Free State's sovereignty, and because the Treaty {{dismantled}} the Republic declared by nationalists in 1918, the Sinn Féin movement, the Dáil and the IRA were all deeply split over whether to accept the Treaty. Éamon de Valera, the President of the Republic was the most prominent leader of those who rejected the Treaty. Among other things, he objected to the fact that Collins and the <b>negotiating</b> <b>team</b> had signed it without the authorisation of the Dáil Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|Italy {{had called}} on the PLO to {{publicly}} declare {{if they had any}} involvement.

At Port Said, Egypt, these two joined the PLO representative from Cairo – Zohdi al-Qoudra. (It is unknown if Arafat was ignorant of Abbas involvement or if he was sent to insure the incident would end quickly).|$|E
25|$|Certainly a man {{of fierce}} pride, his pride was {{tempered}} {{by a sense of}} humour that included a keen sense of the absurd in his own situation. While mastermind of a clandestine military, he remained a public figure. When official head of the Free State government, he continued to cooperate in the IRA's secret operations. He was capable of bold, decisive actions on his own authority, which caused friction with his colleagues, his falling out with Cathal Brugha, for example; but at critical junctures he could also bow to majority decisions which were profoundly disadvantageous and dangerous to his own interests (such as his appointment to the Treaty <b>negotiating</b> <b>team).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Negotiating</b> <b>teams</b> {{were placed}} on standby and Maltese {{military}} arrived at Malta International Airport.

It was subsequently revealed that the weapons used by the two hijackers, named as Suhah Mussa and Ahmed Ali, were replicas.|$|R

25|$|In mid-September 1994, with U.S. troops {{prepared}} to enter Haiti by force for Operation Uphold Democracy, President Bill Clinton dispatched a <b>negotiating</b> <b>team</b> {{led by former}} President Jimmy Carter to persuade the authorities to step aside and allow {{for the return of}} constitutional rule. With intervening troops already airborne, Cédras and other top leaders agreed to step down. In October, Aristide was able to return. The Haitian general election, 1995 in June 1995 saw Aristide's coalition, the Lavalas (Waterfall) Political Organization, gain a sweeping victory, and René Préval, a prominent Aristide political ally, elected President with 88% of the vote. When Aristide's term ended in February 1996, this was Haiti's first ever transition between two democratically elected presidents.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2010 general election, Huhne {{became a}} member of the Liberal Democrats' key <b>negotiating</b> <b>team</b> {{alongside}} Danny Alexander, David Laws and Andrew Stunell that brokered the agreement to go into a governing coalition with the Conservatives.

There had been some speculation that Huhne might be appointed as Home Secretary, as he had been the Liberal Democrat spokesman for Home Affairs in the preceding three years, although this post went to the Conservative Theresa May. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} weeks of the {{negotiations}} were spent in formal sessions. Upon the request of Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, the two delegations began informal negotiations, in which only two members of each <b>negotiating</b> <b>team</b> were allowed to attend. On the Irish side, these members were always Collins and Griffith, while on the British side, Austen Chamberlain always attended, though the second British negotiator would vary from day to day. In late November, the Irish delegation returned to Dublin to consult the cabinet according to their instructions, and again on 3 December. Many points still had to be resolved, mainly surrounding the form of an oath to the monarch, but it was clear to all the politicians involved by this stage that a unitary 32-county Irish Republic was not on offer.|$|E
