25|$|Since the 1980s, ACORN has {{conducted}} large-scale voter registration drives, focusing primarily on registering poor and minority citizens. During the 2008 election season, ACORN gathered over 1.3 million voter registration forms in 21 states. Some of these registration forms were flagged by ACORN's internal auditors for review by election officials. Project Vote estimated that 400,000 registrations collected by ACORN were ultimately rejected, {{the vast majority}} for being duplicate registrations submitted by citizens. (This is also a common problem at government voter registration services, according to reports on the <b>National</b> <b>Voter</b> Registration Act by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission). An unknown number of registrations were fraudulent, but Project Vote estimated {{that only a few}} percent were, based on past years and samples from some drives in 2008. No official in states where voter registration drives were conducted has documented substantial numbers of fraudulent registrations. Project Vote estimated that 450,000 of the registrations collected by ACORN represented first-time voters, while the remainder were address changes submitted by citizens updating their addresses.|$|E
500|$|Brunner {{has made}} several {{specific}} efforts to alleviate {{some of the}} past voting difficulties. 2008 was the first Ohio election that permits absentee voting {{as a matter of}} preference without any justification for need. [...] This resulted in a record number of absentee ballots. [...] Additionally, voting machine redistribution has been closely studied with the hope of alleviating long waits in problem areas. [...] Redistribution is based on past turnout, new registrations, any recent purges under the <b>National</b> <b>Voter</b> Registration Act, and the number of ballot issues in the district. [...] Each precinct has been supplied with sufficient paper ballots to accommodate 25% number of voters who voted in the previous presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|In August, {{he and two}} of {{his daughters}} made a $360 flight to Newton to meet the county clerk before {{attending}} the county Republican Ice Cream Social. Two days later he flew to Wichita, at a cost of $524, to be the keynote speaker at the Sedgwick County Republican Party fundraising picnic. He spoke there about Republican party partisan issues. He was unable to reserve the Beechcraft to fly to Washington, D.C., for a hearing and deposition on a lawsuit which he had joined in support of Brian Newby, whom he had helped get appointed as the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) director. Kobach had previously appointed Newby to oversee Johnson County, Kansas elections. The day after his hire, without having provided public notice or notification to the three-person commission, Newby unilaterally changed a <b>national</b> <b>voter</b> registration form to require residents of Kansas, Georgia and Alabama to provide proof of citizenship. Kobach and a staff member's [...] commercial flights and other expenses cost $6,594. Rep. Ward criticized Kobach's use of the state plane to promote <b>national</b> <b>voter</b> ID policies, an action he contended was intended to “suppress votes" [...] as Kobach had done in Kansas. He added, [...] "The state plane...is an important tool to get around in a big state, ...but it should be for a public purpose." [...] State Senate Democratic Minority Leader Anthony Hensley said Kobach should reimburse Kansas for trips to Republican Party events, characterizing claims that the political functions coincided with official business was “probably just a ruse.” ...|$|E
40|$|We use {{a simple}} {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} monetary union where myopic discretionary fiscal policies generate excessive debt accumulation in steady state and inefficiently delayed debt adjustment following a shock. We advocate {{the adoption of a}} flexible debt targeting approach. By setting a long-term debt target and by raising the political cost associated to deviations from the optimal pace of debt reversal following a shock¸ institutional design induces the fiscal policymaker to implement unbiased discretionary responses to shocks. Since the power to discipline fiscal policymakers rests in the hands of <b>national</b> <b>voters,</b> this outcome can be achieved by increasing the transparency of the decision-making process, where <b>national</b> <b>voters</b> understand the long-term consequences of fiscal policies. In practice, we call for clearer and more focused supervision tasks for the European Commission and for a more active role of national Parliaments whenever a disagreement arises between the Commission and a national government. ...|$|R

2500|$|... "A Voteless People is a Hopeless People" [...] was {{initiated}} as a National Program of Alpha during the 1930s by the Alpha Omicron chapter (Johnson C. Smith University), when many African Americans {{had the right}} to vote but were prevented from voting because of poll taxes, threats of reprisal, and lack of education about the voting process. Voter education and registration have since remained a dominant focus in the fraternity's planning. In the 1990s the focus has shifted to promotion of political awareness and empowerment, delivered most often through use of town meetings and candidate forums.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to conducting voter registration drives, ACORN {{has worked to}} remove systemic obstacles to voter registration. In 2006, it brought a lawsuit {{in federal court in}} Ohio against the Ohio Secretary of State, at that time Ken Blackwell, and the Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. ACORN alleged that, during the period that included the 2004 United States election voting controversies, the defendants had committed multiple violations of the <b>National</b> <b>Voter</b> Registration Act of 1993. The district court dismissed the case, but that decision was reversed in 2008 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. After extensive fact discovery in 2009, the parties agreed to a settlement, under which the defendants agreed to implement several measures to facilitate registration of low-income voters to bring the state into compliance with the National Voting Rights Act. The Dayton Daily News characterized the settlement as [...] "accepting the thrust of [...] complaint." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fraternity's Nu Mu Lambda {{chapter of}} Decatur, Georgia, held a voter {{registration}} drive in DeKalb County, Georgia in 2004, from which [...] Secretary of State Cathy Cox rejected all 63 voter registration applications {{on the basis}} that the fraternity did not follow correct procedures, including obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive. [...] Nu Mu Lambda filed Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox {{on the basis that}} the Georgia Secretary of State's long-standing policy and practice of rejecting mail-in voter registration applications that were submitted in bundles and/or by persons other than registrars, deputy registrars, or the individual applicants, violated the requirements of the <b>National</b> <b>Voter</b> Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) by undermining voter registration drives. A Senior U.S. District Judge upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, which also found private entities have a right under the NVRA, to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.|$|E

50|$|The {{first elected}} MMP {{representative}} was ACT Party leader Richard Prebble, controversially elected in 1996 after National Party leader Jim Bolger indicated that <b>National</b> <b>voters</b> should give their electorate vote to Prebble {{rather than to}} National's candidate Mark Thomas, in order for ACT to get into parliament. Prebble would eventually become the third representative from Wellington Central in three elections to face defeat after a single term in office. Labour's Marian Hobbs held the seat from 1999, when she defeated Prebble, until 2008, when she retired. Grant Robertson retained Labour's hold on the seat in 2008 and has held the seat since.|$|R
