5|$|In January 1937, {{ownership}} of WAAB was consolidated {{with that of}} another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial. Yankee flagship WNAC had been an affiliate of CBS Radio, changing affiliation to NBC Red later in 1937 when CBS purchased WEEI in that city. The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the Mutual affiliate roster. WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of The Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK. Within a few years, this new Ohio participant {{would become one of}} the network's central members, a shareowner in Mutual. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with <b>NBC</b> <b>and</b> 5 with CBS. The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind <b>NBC</b> <b>and</b> CBS, however, {{and the fact that the}} lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of <b>NBC</b> <b>and</b> CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E
