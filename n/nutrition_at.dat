5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and <b>nutrition.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} patients’ visits <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> {{polyclinic}} is relatively low whereas {{the need of}} <b>nutrition</b> consultation <b>at</b> hospital polyclinic is high. Visits <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> polyclinic generally come from referrals of doctors at hospital polyclinics. The number of visits greatly depends on doctors referring patients to nutrition polyclinic. Low visit <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> polyclinic {{is due to the}} absence of socialization of nutrition service. It is necessary to conduct socialization of nutrition service by dissemination of information to outpatients and advocacy to stakeholders, especially doctors, who are expected to refer patients to nutrition polyclinic to increase visit. Objectives: To find out the effect of nutrition service advocacy and socialization to the number of visits <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> polyclinic of Raden Mattaher Hospital, Jambi. Methods: The study was a quasi-experimental using one group with pre-test and post-test design. Respondents of the study were doctors working in polyclinics and outpatients. There were 32 respondents of advocacy group and 180 respondents of socialization group. Data obtained were the number of patients’ visits analyzed statistically using Wilcoxon range test. Data of diagnostic types of patients having nutrition consultation were analyzed descriptively. Results: Advocacy of nutrition service to doctors and socialization to patients could increase visits of patients <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> polyclinic. There were significant increase of patients’ visits <b>at</b> <b>nutrition</b> polyclinic and visits based on diagnosis (p< 0. 05). A new type of diagnosis referred to nutrition polyclinic after intervention was found. Conclusion: Advocacy given to respondents who had made referral to nutrition polyclinic and socialization given to patients could increase the number of patients visiting nutrition polyclinic...|$|R
500|$|A {{few studies}} have {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake is linked to an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of <b>Nutrition</b> <b>at</b> the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E

A meta-analysis in 2014 finds that [...] "current evidence does not clearly support cardiovascular guidelines that encourage high consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids and low consumption of total saturated fats". This meta-analysis was called [...] "seriously misleading" [...] by Walter Willet, chair of the Department of <b>Nutrition</b> <b>at</b> Harvard, who explained that the paper contained major errors and omissions, most notably that the foods used to replace saturated fats were other unhealthy foods like refined sugars and starches.|$|E
2500|$|Stir frying {{has been}} {{promoted}} as healthy and nutritious. Writers extolled the quick cooking at high heat for retaining color, texture, and nutritional value. [...] A study {{by researchers at the}} Department of Food Science and <b>Nutrition</b> <b>at</b> Zhejiang University compared the effects of boiling, steaming, and stir frying on bamboo shoots. Boiling and steaming decreased the amount of protein, soluble sugar, ash, and total free amino acids by more than one third. Stir-frying bamboo shoots increased their fat content by 528.57% due to the addition of oil, but retained more of the anti-oxidant capacities. With 78.9% retention, stir frying preserved significantly more vitamin C than boiling. Taking into consideration the total retention of antioxidants, the study concluded that stir frying is the method best suited for bamboo shoots. Similar results were found for stir frying red peppers.|$|E

2500|$|When Bouis joined IFPRI, {{most experts}} in the field {{considered}} calorie intake to be the principal benchmark for nutritional status. The issue of micronutrient malnutrition, or hidden hunger, was not yet widely understood. Research that Bouis and Lawrence Haddad carried out in the Philippines from 1984 to 1990 indicated that mineral and vitamin intake, not calorie intake, was the primary constraint to improving nutrition outcomes and reducing micronutrient deficiencies. Recognizing that low-income smallholder farmers, {{a large proportion of the}} population in most developing countries, could not afford nutritionally-dense, diverse diets, Bouis sought a way for staple crops, such as beans, rice, and wheat, to [...] provide more micronutrients. He hypothesized that crops bred to include higher levels of iron, zinc or vitamin A could substantially improve <b>nutrition</b> <b>at</b> a relatively low cost and could conveniently reach remote rural households. This concept eventually came to be known as biofortification.|$|E

Director of pediatric <b>nutrition</b> <b>at</b> the University of Alabama at Birmingham Frank Franklin has argued that since low calories and low protein are the {{main causes of death}} for approximately 5 million children annually, insect protein formulated into a ready-to-use therapeutic food similar to Nutriset's Plumpy'Nut could have potential as a relatively inexpensive solution to malnutrition. In 2009, Dr. Vercruysse from Ghent University in Belgium has proposed that insect protein can be used to generate hydrolysates, exerting both ACE inhibitory and antioxidant activity, which might be incorporated as multifunctional ingredient into functional foods. Additionally, edible insects can provide a good source of unsaturated fats, thereby helping to reduce coronary disease.|$|E
