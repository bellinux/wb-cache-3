Much of his curriculum was likely designed by priest Piotr Skarga, much respected by Sigmismund III. Władysław studied for several years in the Kraków Academy, and for two years, in Rome.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the development, the {{implementation}} and the evaluation of a formal mentorship program in the Lambton County Board of Education. The program involved a series of in-service sessions for both the mentor and the <b>new</b> <b>teacher.</b> The data showed certain outcomes with the mentored groups. Firstly, the administrators reported a greater level of staff cohesion with the mentored teachers. Secondly, the administrators expressed less need for interactions with the mentored teachers. All areas reflected a shift towards a more positive perception of parental reactions, preservice preparation of the <b>new</b> <b>teacher,</b> stress levels and discipline concerns. In the <b>new</b> <b>teacher</b> data there were significant findings for the mentored group in the levels of stress reported by the <b>new</b> <b>teacher,</b> the amount of personal time available {{and the perception of}} administrative support for the <b>new</b> <b>teacher.</b> All areas reflected a positive shift to more satisfaction and greater personal and professional rewards with the mentored teacher group.

25|$|Among {{the most}} {{pressing}} problems facing education reformers was the scarcity of qualified teachers, {{which has led to}} a serious stunting of educational development. In 1986 there were about 8 million primary- and middle-school teachers in China, but many lacked professional training. Estimates indicated that {{in order to meet the}} goals of the Seventh Five-Year Plan and realize compulsory 9-year education, the system needed 1 million <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> for primary schools, 750,000 <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> for junior middle schools, and 300,000 <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> for senior middle schools. Estimates predict, however, that the demand for teachers will drop in the late 1990s because of an anticipated decrease in primary-school enrollments.|$|E

25|$|The Ministry of Education {{recruited}} 20,000 <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> in 2005 {{and continued}} to implement teacher trainings.

25|$|Dialogue journal {{writing has}} become an {{important}} component of professional development for teachers in both pre-service teacher training programs at universities and in in-service workshops and coaching. It might take place between the professor and a class of prospective teachers in a teacher preparation program; between prospective or <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> and experienced teachers they are working with, as a mentoring and coaching opportunity; or between prospective and practicing teachers. Those who use and study these approaches have found that these professional conversations promote reflection on oneself as a teacher and between teachers as they reflect on their practice. Some research focuses on the types of responses and interactions that are effective for promoting teacher learning. With use of the Internet, these interactions can take place among educators around the world.|$|E

However, the data gathered by the Department of Education shows that during the opening of classes (June 2013), the shortages in classrooms was pegged at 19, 579, 60 million shortages when it came to textbooks, 2.5 million shortages with regard to chairs, and 80, 937 shortages of water and sanitation facilities. Furthermore, 770 schools in Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao were considered overcrowded.

25|$|During both {{world wars}} {{the site was}} used as a {{military}} hospital, with up to 200 beds and more than 5000 patients receiving treatment between 1941 and 1945. In 1943, the Board of Education had begun to consider the future of education, following reforms that would inevitably come after the war ended. It was estimated that with the raising of the school leaving age, following the 1944 Education Act, about 70,000 <b>new</b> <b>teachers</b> would be needed annually, almost ten times as many as before the war. In 1944 a report was produced by the Board of Education on the emergency recruitment and training of teachers, and it was decided that there were to be several new training colleges set up. These colleges were to be staffed by lecturers seconded from local authorities, with mature students selected from the national service. The City of Manchester was no exception, and a search was undertaken for suitable accommodation for a new emergency training college. In 1945, the theological college, which was no longer required by the Wesleyans, was leased to the Manchester Education Authority, and the new emergency training college was officially opened on 31 January 1946, with Alfred Body as the first principal.|$|E
