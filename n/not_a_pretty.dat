Offers to play at colleges started coming in and her popularity grew largely {{by word of mouth}} and through women's groups or organizations. Zango and Goldenrod, two music distributors specializing in women's music, started carrying DiFranco's music. In general they sold music to independent music stores and women's book stores. In 1995 Righteous Babe Records signed with Koch International for DiFranco's release of <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> Girl. Her records could then be found in large and small record stores alike.|$|E

An aural blitzkrieg whose chorus climaxes {{with the}} lines, 'The final swing {{is not a}} drill/It's how many people I can kill,' {{it is filled with}} brutal images and blaring guitars, all {{propelled}} at the breathless pace of thrash metal." [...] Considine would later say that the album's music [...] "so accurately sums up the controlled panic of combat that the Army itself has been using Slayer songs to psych its troops for military maneuvers in the Saudi desert". Mike Stagno from SputnikMusic said that the album was a well-received return by Slayer. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne said that listening to Seasons in the Abyss was [...] "like listening to a single speed-metal song—the world's longest". In 2017, it was ranked 31st on Rolling Stones [...] "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".|$|E

[...] A reviewer for The New York Times wrote of it in 1903: [...] "If nothing else makes Mr. London's book popular, {{it ought to be}} rendered so by the complete way in which it will satisfy the love of dog fights apparently inherent in every man." [...] The reviewer for The Atlantic Monthly wrote that it was a book: [...] "untouched by bookishness...The making and the achievement of such a hero [...] constitute, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> story at all, but a very powerful one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ani cites her anti-corporate ethos for {{the main}} reason she decided to start her own label. This has allowed her a {{considerable}} degree of creative freedom over the years, including, for example, providing all instrumentals and vocals and recording the album herself at her home on an analog 8-track reel to reel, and handling much of the artwork and packaging design for her 2004 album Educated Guess. She has referenced this independence from major labels in song more than once, including [...] "The Million You Never Made" [...] (<b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pretty</b> Girl), which discusses the act of turning down a lucrative contract, [...] "The Next Big Thing" [...] (Not So Soft), which describes an imagined meeting with a label head-hunter who evaluates the singer based on her looks, and [...] "Napoleon" [...] (Dilate), which sympathizes sarcastically with an unnamed friend who did sign with a label.|$|E

[...] "We say it's a modern American Western— two gunslingers who ride into town, fight the bad guys, kiss the girl and ride out into the sunset again. And we were always talking {{from the very beginning}} that if you're going to have cowboys, they need a trusty horse." [...] He originally intended for the car to be a '65 Mustang, but his neighbor convinced him to change it to a '67 Impala, since [...] "you can put a body in the trunk" [...] and because [...] "you want a car that, when people stop next to it at the lights, they lock their doors." [...] Kripke has commented, [...] "It's a Rottweiler of a car, and I think it adds authenticity for fans of automobiles because of that, because it's <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> ride. It's an aggressive, muscular car, and I think that's what people respond to, and why it fits so well into the tone of our show." ...|$|E
