5000|$|The need {{to convey}} {{information}} using displacement has been suspected {{to have been}} the evolutionary pressure leading to language development in humans, as outlined by Derek Bickerton in Adam's Tongue. The pressure of such need is present in species with a foraging strategy that presents the challenge of directing members of its group to a food source too large to be utilized singly or in small numbers, requiring recruitment of assistance. It's only when you fully appreciate what displacement means, how the absence of displacement is not just a casual feature of ACSs but a crucial defining feature of pre-human minds, that you can start getting the complete picture. [...] Bickerton, page 217 The unique environmental <b>need</b> <b>selecting</b> for a communication system capable for displacement in humans or our direct ancestors is not identified, but hypotheses include Bickerton's theory of small groups finding large herbivore carcasses, and needing the assistance from other small groups of humans to defend against other dangerous scavengers (large cats, hyenas) competing for the same source of food. Language development most certainly did not stop there—since otherwise bees or ants would have comparable communication systems to ours—but this is where it likely began, giving our ancestors the ability to take communication out of the here and now.|$|E

Services can be evaluated based on functional and non-functional criteria: the former represent the operation that the service provides, the latter criteria that differentiate functionally equal services. This chapter presents three closely related items addressing the problem of differentiating functionally equal services to find the most appropriate one in any given situation: (1) a generic and extensible model for non-functional properties, (2) a method for ranking services, and (3) an algorithm for selecting services that are part of larger execution chains. The method is evaluated, and the needs are exemplified with some motivating examples...|$|E
40|$|Personal grief rituals are {{beneficial}} {{in dealing with}} complicated grief, but challenging to design, as they require symbolic objects and actions meeting clients’ emotional needs. We report interviews with ten therapists with expertise in both grief therapy and grief rituals. Findings indicate three types of rituals supporting honoring, letting go, and self transformation, with the latter being particularly complex. Outcome also point to a taxonomy of ritual objects for framing and remembering ritual experience, and for capturing and processing grief. Besides symbolic possessions, we identified other types of ritual objects including transformational and future-oriented ones. Symbolic actions include creative craft of ritual objects, respectful handling, disposal and symbolic play. We conclude with theoretical implications of these findings, and a reflection on their value for tailored, creative co-design of grief rituals. In particular, we identified several implications for designing grief rituals which include accounting for the client’s <b>need,</b> <b>selecting</b> (or creating) the most appropriate objects and actions from the identified types, integrating principles of both grief and art/drama therapy, exploring clients’ affinity for the ancient elements as medium of disposal in letting go rituals, {{and the value of}} technology for recording and reflecting on ritual experience...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{construct}} a design for probabilistic sampling of reporting physicians in sentinel networks. MethodsWe performed a multi-stage sample selection study. Data on {{primary care physicians}} and their patients {{were obtained from the}} Madrid Health Institute for 2005. The geographical unit of reference was the basic health area. A factorial analysis was performed on the basis of demographic, socio-cultural and socio-occupational variables. A cluster analysis was conducted to group the 247 basic health areas into homogeneous strata, which were then tested using a discriminant analysis. The general practitioners and pediatricians needed in each stratum were selected by simple random sampling. The representativeness of the population monitored by the selected physicians was studied with respect to the population of Madrid. ResultsFactorial analysis yielded five factors. Using these, 14 strata were obtained, which were shown to be homogeneous and mutually different by discriminant analysis. The minimum population that needed to be monitored consisted of 146, 946 adults and 24, 518 children, proportionally distributed among the respective strata. Eighty-eight general practitioners and 32 pediatricians were selected, who respectively covered populations of 154, 610 and 31, 336 persons representative of the general population. ConclusionsObtaining samples through suitable designs improves the accuracy of the information gathered by health sentinel networks in epidemiologic surveillance. Ensuring the representativeness of the study population vis-à-vis the general population is essential; cluster analysis and simple random sampling are methods that meet this <b>need.</b> <b>Selecting</b> physicians by means of probabilistic methods enables the accuracy of estimates to be ascertained...|$|E
40|$|The native {{nature of}} high {{dimension}} low {{sample size of}} gene expression data make the classification task more challenging. Therefore, feature (gene) selection become an apparent <b>need.</b> <b>Selecting</b> a meaningful and relevant genes for classifier not only decrease the computational time and cost, but also improve the classification performance. Among different approaches of feature selection methods, however most of them suffer from several problems such as lack of robustness, validation issues etc. Here, we present a new feature selection technique that takes advantage of clustering both samples and genes. Materials and methods We used leukemia gene expression dataset [1]. The effectiveness of the selected features were evaluated by four different classification methods; support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear discriminate analysis. The method evaluate the importance and relevance of each gene cluster by summing the expression level for each gene belongs to this cluster. The gene cluster consider important, if it satisfies conditions depend on thresholds and percentage otherwise eliminated. Results Initial analysis identified 7120 differentially expressed genes of leukemia (Fig. 15 a), after applying our feature selection methodology {{we end up with}} specific 1117 genes discriminating two classes of leukemia (Fig. 15 b). Further applying the same method with more stringent higher positive and lower negative threshold condition, number reduced to 58 genes have be tested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the method (Fig. 15 c). The results of the four classification methods are summarized in Table 11. Conclusions The feature selection method gave good results with minimum classification error. Our heat-map result shows distinct pattern of refines genes discriminating between two classes of leukemia...|$|E

Objetivo: Elaborar un diseño de muestreo probabilístico de los médicos notificadores en redes centinelas sanitarias. Métodos: Estudio de muestreo multietápico. La información sobre los médicos de Atención Primaria y la población atendida procede del Instituto Madrileño de Salud para 2005. La unidad geográfica de referencia fue la Zona Básica de Salud. Partiendo de variables demográficas, socioculturales y sociolaborales, se realizó un análisis factorial. Se hizo un análisis de clusters para agrupar las 247 Zonas Básicas de Salud en estratos homogéneos. Como comprobación se realizó un análisis discriminante. Se seleccionaron los médicos necesarios en cada estrato mediante muestreo aleatorio simple. Se estudió la representatividad de la población vigilada con respecto a la población de Madrid. Resultados: Se extrajeron 5 factores mediante análisis factorial. Se obtuvieron 14 estratos, que el análisis discriminante demostró homogéneos y distintos entre sí. Se determinó que era necesario vigilar una población mínima de 146. 946 adultos y 24. 518 niños, distribuidos proporcionalmente en cada estrato. Se seleccionaron 88 médicos de familia y 32 pediatras, que cubrían unas poblaciones de 154. 610 y 31. 336 personas, representativas de la población general. Conclusiones: La obtención de muestras con un adecuado diseño asegura la validez de la información generada por redes centinelas sanitarias en la vigilancia epidemiológica. Debe buscarse la representatividad de la población estudiada con respecto a la población general. El análisis de clusters y el muestreo aleatorio simple son métodos que responden a esta necesidad.
