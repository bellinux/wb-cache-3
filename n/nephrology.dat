5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the International Society of <b>Nephrology</b> (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E

25|$|Kidney {{disease is}} an {{abnormal}} structure, function or {{process in the}} kidney(s). Nephrosis is non-inflammatory nephropathy and nephritis is inflammatory kidney disease. <b>Nephrology</b> is the speciality that deals with kidney function and disease. Medical terms related to the kidneys commonly use terms such as renal and the prefix nephro-. The adjective renal, meaning related to the kidney, is from the Latin rēnēs, meaning kidneys; the prefix nephro- is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, nephros (νεφρός). For example, surgical removal of the kidney is a nephrectomy, while a reduction in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Frerichs {{made many}} {{contributions}} to medical science, and is especially {{known for his}} research of kidney and liver diseases. He published the first German textbook of <b>nephrology,</b> and performed microscopic research of Bright's disease. He {{was the first to}} identify the three primary stages of Bright's disease and how the condition leads to fibrosis and atrophy. Frerichs gave the first clinical description of progressive familial hepatolenticular degeneration (now known as Wilson's disease), and also discovered the presence of leucine and tyrosine in urine involving yellow atrophy of the liver. He also described the anatomical changes that place in liver cirrhosis and malaria perniciosa.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, an NP is a {{registered}} nurse with a graduate degree in nursing. Canada recognizes them in the following specialties: primary healthcare NPs (PHCNP) and acute care NPs (ACNP). NPs diagnose illnesses, prescribe pharmaceuticals, order and interpret diagnostic tests, and perform procedures in their scope of practice. PHCNPs work in places like community healthcare centers, primary healthcare settings and long term care institutions. The main focus of PHCNPs includes health promotion, preventative care, treatment and diagnosis of acute illnesses and injuries, and overseeing and managing chronic diseases. ANCNPs are specialized NPs who serve a specific population of patients. They administer care to individuals who are acutely, critically or chronically ill patients. ANCNPs generally work in in-patient facilities that include neonatology, <b>nephrology,</b> and cardiology units.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Nephrology</b> {{training}} {{can be accomplished}} through one of two routes. [...] The first being through an internal medicine pathway leading to an Internal Medicine/Nephrology specialty, and sometimes known as [...] "adult nephrology". [...] The second pathway being through Pediatrics leading to a speciality in Pediatric <b>Nephrology.</b> [...] In the United States, after medical school adult nephrologists complete a three-year residency in internal medicine followed by a two-year (or longer) fellowship in <b>nephrology.</b> [...] Complementary to an adult nephrologist, a pediatric nephrologist will complete a three-year pediatric residency after medical school or a four-year Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residency. [...] This {{is followed by a}} three-year fellowship in Pediatic <b>Nephrology.</b> [...] Once training is satisfactorily completed, the physician is eligible to take the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) or American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine (AOBIM) <b>nephrology</b> examination. Nephrologists must be approved by one of these boards. To be approved, the physician must fulfill the requirements for education and training in <b>nephrology</b> in order to qualify to take the board's examination. If a physician passes the examination, then he or she can become a <b>nephrology</b> specialist. Typically, nephrologists also need two to three years of training in an ACGME or AOA accredited fellowship in <b>nephrology.</b> Nearly all programs train nephrologists in continuous renal replacement therapy; fewer than half in the United States train in the provision of plasmapheresis. Only pediatric trained physicians are able to train in pediatric <b>nephrology,</b> and internal medicine (adult) trained physicians may enter general (adult) <b>nephrology</b> fellowships.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Nephrology</b> (from Greek nephros [...] "kidney", {{combined}} with the suffix -logy, [...] "the study of") is a specialty of medicine and pediatrics that concerns itself with the kidneys: the study of normal kidney function and kidney problems, the preservation of kidney health, and the treatment of kidney problems, from diet and medication to [...] renal replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation). Systemic conditions that affect the kidneys (such as diabetes and autoimmune disease) and systemic problems that occur {{as a result of}} kidney problems (such as renal osteodystrophy and hypertension) are also studied in <b>nephrology.</b> A physician who has undertaken additional training to become an expert in <b>nephrology</b> may call themselves a nephrologist or renal physician.|$|E
