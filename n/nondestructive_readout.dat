40|$|We {{report on}} the {{implementation}} of an Associative Capacitive Network (ACN) based on the <b>nondestructive</b> capacitive <b>readout</b> of two Complementary Resistive Switches (2 -CRSs). ACNs are capable of performing a fully parallel search for Hamming distances (i. e. similarity) between input and stored templates. Unlike conventional associative memories where charge retention is a key function and hence, they require frequent refresh cycles, in ACNs, information is retained in a nonvolatile resistive state and normal tasks are carried out through capacitive coupling between input and output nodes. Each device consists of two CRS cells and no selective element is needed, therefore, CMOS circuitry is only required in the periphery, for addressing and read-out. Highly parallel processing, nonvolatility, wide interconnectivity and low-energy consumption are significant advantages of ACNs over conventional and emerging associative memories. These characteristics make ACNs one of the promising candidates for applications in memory-intensive and cognitive computing, switches and routers as binary and ternary Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) and intelligent data processin...|$|R

Until now, devices and device concepts were mostly based on mobile domain walls in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. A less explored path is to make use of polar domain walls in nonpolar ferroelastic materials. Indeed, while the polar character of ferroelastic domain walls has been demonstrated, polarization control has been elusive. Here, we report evidence for the electrostatic signature of the domain-wall polarization in nonpolar calcium titanate (CaTiO 3). Macroscopic mechanical resonances excited by an ac electric field are observed as a signature of a piezoelectric response caused by polar walls. On the microscopic scale, the polarization in domain walls modifies the local surface potential of the sample. Through imaging of surface potential variations, we show that the potential at the domain wall can be controlled by electron injection. This could enable devices based on <b>nondestructive</b> information <b>readout</b> of surface potential...|$|R

By applying a <b>nondestructive</b> capacitive <b>readout</b> procedure the complementary resistive switches implement reconfigurable associative capacitive networks.

In this study, we demonstrate the electrical manipulation of individual prominent representatives of such atomic solid-state defects, namely, the negative charge state of single nitrogen-vacancy defect centers (NV^{−}) in diamond. We experimentally demonstrate, deterministic, purely electrical charge-state initialization of individual NV centers. The NV centers are placed in the intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode structure that facilitates the delivery of charge carriers to the defect for charge-state switching. The charge-state dynamics of a single NV center were investigated by time-resolved measurements and a <b>nondestructive</b> single-shot <b>readout</b> of the charge state. Fast charge-state switching rates (from negative to neutrally charged defects), which are greater than 0. 72 [*]±[*] 0. 10 [*][*]μs^{− 1 }, were realized. Furthermore, in no-operation mode, the realized charge states were stable for presumably much more than 0. 45  s.

40|$|MRI has {{recently}} been presented as a <b>nondestructive</b> in vivo <b>readout</b> to report perfusion capacity in biomaterials planted on the CAM in the living chick embryo in ovo. Perfusion capacity was assessed through changes in T 1 relaxation pre- and post-injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent, Gd-DOTA (Dotarem®). Hence local contrast agent concentration was dependent on perfusion, vascular permeability, and extravascular compartment size. In the present study we, therefore, explore intravascular SPIO particles of the FeraSpin® series to deliver a more direct measure of vascularization in a 3 D polymer DegraPol® scaffold. Furthermore, we present contrast enhancement upon SPIOs of different particle size, namely FeraSpin® series XS, M, XXL and Endorem® for comparison, and hence different efficiency on T 1 and T 2, and study respective dose-effects. No signal change was observed within the egg yolk, consistent with the SPIO remaining in the vasculature. Consequently, T 1 positive signal enhancement (reduction in T 1) and T 2 negative contrast (reduction in T 2) were observed only in the vasculature and hence were restricted mainly {{to the surface of}} the CAM at the interface to the biomaterial. Furthermore, the effect upon T 2 appears stronger than in T 1 with all SPIOs investigated and at blood concentrations between 0. 46 mM to 4. 65 mM. Comparison of different concentrations shows larger T 1 enhancement at the highest dose, as expected. Vessel structures in and around the scaffold as seen in MRI were corroborated by histology. Different particle sizes show reduced T 1 effect with larger particles, yet the effect on T 2 was less apparent. In sum, SPIO-enhanced MRI provides measures for vascularization nondestructively in biomaterials connected to the CAM, based on intravascular contrast enhancement in T 1 and T 2, in ovo in the living chick embryo. Small SPIOs provide the best efficiency for that purpose, and contrast enhancement is most prominent in T 2...|$|R

In the previous operation method, although the difference in output voltage ΔV_O between positive P_r^+ and negative P_r^- remanent polarization memory states was adequate for the first reading time, the <b>nondestructive</b> <b>readout</b> for the P_r^- state was seriously degraded due to the generation of nonreturning domains. In order to solve this issue, a P_r^ 0 memory state was used instead of the previous P_r^- memory state. The P_r}^ 0 state was induced by applying a pulse combined with a positive voltage V_W^+ and a negative voltage (V_W^-). V_W^+ was to reset the previously written memory states, and V_W^- was to control the amount of remanent polarization. In addition, in order to extinguish perfectly the nonreturning domains, a negative voltage V_R^- was applied for data reading, following a positive voltage V_R^+, where V_R^+ was determined for clear decoding. The appropriate heights of the writing and reading voltages were determined individually {{from the viewpoint of}} good <b>nondestructive</b> <b>readout</b> and large ΔV_O.

40|$|Spins {{confined}} in quantum dots are a leading candidate for solid-state quantum bits {{that can be}} coherently controlled by optical pulses. There are, however, many challenges to developing a scalable multibit information processing device based on spins in quantum dots, including the natural inhomogeneous distribution of quantum dot energy levels, the difficulty of creating all-optical spin manipulation protocols compatible with <b>nondestructive</b> <b>readout,</b> and the substantial electron-nuclear hyperfine interaction-induced decoherence. Here, we present a scalable qubit design and device architecture based on the spin states of single holes {{confined in}} a quantum dot molecule. The quantum dot molecule qubit enables a new strategy for optical coherent control with dramatically enhanced wavelength tunability. The use of hole spins allows the suppression of decoherence via hyperfine interactions and enables coherent spin rotations using Raman transitions mediated by a hole-spin-mixed optically excited state.
