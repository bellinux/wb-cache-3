The films were deposited using 2. 45 GHz electron cyclotron resonance plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique from mixtures of precursors argon, nitrous oxide, and silane at deposition temperature 90 deg C. The deposition pressure and <b>nitrous</b> oxide-to-silane <b>gas</b> flow rates ratio have been found to have a pronounced influence on the composition of the films. When the deposition pressure was varied for a given <b>nitrous</b> oxide-to-silane <b>gas</b> flow ratio, the amount of silicon and nitrogen increased with the deposition pressure, while the amount of oxygen decreased. For a given deposition pressure, the amount of incorporated nitrogen and hydrogen decreased while that of oxygen increased with increasing <b>nitrous</b> oxide-to-silane <b>gas</b> flow rates ratio. For <b>nitrous</b> oxide-to-silane <b>gas</b> flow ratio of 5, we obtained films which contained neither chemically bonded nor nonbonded nitrogen atoms as revealed by the results of infrared spectroscopy, backscattering spectrometry, and nuclear reaction analysis.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} N-nitrosamines in the known in-creased cancer risk of rubber workers, air concentrations of such carcinogens were measured by area sampling or personal monitoring in 19 factories.

The mean concentration was usually {{in the range of}} 1 — 10 /ig/m 3. Several other nitrosamines could be detected in certain production bran-ches. In retail shops and storage rooms of tyres NDMA and NMOR were found. Most rubber chemicals based on amines are contaminated with N-nitrosamines, but this contamina-tion cannot explain the air concentrations of nitrosamines found. The occurrence of nitrosamines mainly depends upon their formation during production of rubber and rubber pro-ducts from used vulcanisation accelerators based on amines and the presence of nitrosating agents, such as diphenylnitrosamine (retarder A) and of <b>nitrous</b> <b>gases,</b> in pro-ducts or production areas. Elimination of one or both precur-sors for nitrosamine formation resulted in significant reduc-tion of airial contamination of nitrosamines.

40|$|A LiMn 2 O 4 (LMO) {{containing}} three-dimensional composite cathode {{was prepared}} by impregnation of carbon fiber paper with the oxide precursor sol. The sol {{consisted of the}} corresponding metal acetates, instead of nitrates {{in order to prevent}} the evolution of <b>nitrous</b> <b>gases</b> during the calcination. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) served as chelating agent, which allows for a homogeneous distribution of the metal ions in the sol. Carbon fiber paper was soaked with the precursor sol and dried repeatedly up to the desired filling grade. After gelation of the precursor sol, the gel was converted to LMO at 450 °C. At this temperature transformation of the amorphous gel into crystalline LMO was completed and in the same time it was possible to retain the carbon backbone without significant material damage. The carbon fiber matrix serves as the three-dimensional support for the LMO particles and current collector in the oxide/carbon composite. Microstructural characterization of the LMO/carbon composites revealed that LMO crystals were deposited directly onto the carbon fibers {{as well as in the}} voids between the fibers which results in a homogeneous distribution of active material throughout the cathode's bulk. Electrochemical properties of the composite cathodes were investigated as a function of the number of sol impregnation steps. It was noted that the specific capacity of the cathode increases with the number of fillings. Moreover, the irreversible capacity regarding the first charge/discharge cycles was greatly reduced.
