25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book is but {{a small part of the}} work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended in the interests of the city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E

[...] Regarding her religious affiliation, she has described herself as Jewish and celebrates both Christmas and Hanukkah, but has stated that she dislikes it when celebrities thank God or Jesus in their award acceptance speeches.|$|E

500|$|While {{promoting}} 2014's The Endless River, Nick Mason named A Saucerful of Secrets as his favourite of Pink Floyd's studio albums. “I {{think there}} are ideas contained there that we have continued to use {{all the way through}} our career,” he says. “I think [...] was a quite good way of marking Syd ’s departure and Dave ’s arrival. It’s rather <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it on one record, where you get both things. It’s a cross-fade rather than a cut.” ...|$|E
500|$|Construction of {{the library}} by EllisDon began shortly thereafter. Following {{excavation}} and blasting for the underground car park, the foundation was poured in 2012. In May 2014, the library hosted a tour for journalists and officials from all levels of government. Halifax mayor Mike Savage stated that the new library is [...] "not simply something that’s <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.</b> It is important and critical {{to the future of}} our city. Because more than ever, for a city to succeed, we need to be invested in the knowledge economy. We need to ensure that our citizens have access to all forms of learning.” ...|$|E
500|$|Maria Doyle Kennedy was {{a member}} of the Irish quartet band The Black Velvet Band before she was cast as Commitmentette singer Natalie Murphy. Doyle Kennedy said, [...] "It was an accident. I didn't go to drama school or {{anything}} and I learned on the job. And it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the chance to pretend to be other people." [...] Michael Aherne, who plays The Commitments' pianist Steven Clifford, was an employee for the Dublin Corporation and took a three-month leave of absence to make the film. Glen Hansard, the lead singer of The Frames, was cast as Outspan Foster, the band's guitarist.|$|E

500|$|During the {{recording}} of the episode, Hader ad-libbed calypso scat singing, which series creator Loren Bouchard cited as an [...] "amazing [...] when a person comes in and ad-libs music." [...] Bouchard further stated: [...] "There's something so musical about it and he's clearly so talented, but it's also silly and in character. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your cake and eat it, too." [...] Hader's singing is incorporated into a scene in the episode where Mickey sings while making a hole in Bob's basement wall, and is later reprised in the episode's end credits. The same scene sees Mickey attempting {{to cover up the}} hole with a Big film poster, which serves as a reference to the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Every {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen. According to Pemberton, [...] "Because each episode is so wildly different {{there was nothing}} really linking them {{other than the fact}} they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an object that you could hide and just have there on every set." [...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace. However, there is also a [...] "second" [...] hare. While it is not visible in the partially completed crossword shown {{at the end of the}} episode, the crossword published in The Guardian contains a nina spelling ONELEPUS, Lepus being the generic name for hares.|$|E
500|$|Bob Mould of Hüsker Dü, one of Grohl's idols, {{was brought}} in to do vocals in a song Grohl {{conceived}} as a duet with him, [...] "Dear Rosemary". Mould also played guitar on the track, even though Vig's plans had him just singing. Grohl's and Smear's former Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic appeared in [...] "I Should Have Known" [...] as Grohl thought [...] "it would be <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> him come down and share the experience" [...] and that the song would be enhanced by his bass and accordion-playing." [...] "Miss the Misery" [...] features Fee Waybill of The Tubes, a personal friend of Grohl who said that the frontman invited him because [...] "the background vocal sounded like him". Other guest musicians included three members of the expanded touring band, keyboardist Rami Jaffee, violinist Jessy Greene and percussionist Drew Hester.|$|E

6000|$|Breckenridge {{smiled a}} little, {{but his voice}} was sympathetic. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I am glad, on my own account, too. It's <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the chances {{with you when you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> reckon with men of the kind we are going to meet, but I shall not be sorry when this trouble's through. It is my first attempt at {{reforming}} and a little of it goes a long way with me. I don't {{know that there is a}} more thankless task than trying to make folks better off than they want, or deserve, to be." ...|$|R
500|$|Carter also {{directed}} the episode; initially, the episode {{was supposed to}} have been helmed by another individual, but no one was ever selected. At the last minute, Carter took on the role. Due to time constraints, Carter was writing whole parts of the script while the episode was being filmed. Many of the cast and crew were pleased with Carter's directing. Gillian Anderson said that she thought [...] "Chris has directed some of our best episodes. He's very even tempered, and he's quiet and gentle and quite <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> as a director, because that energy can't help but pervade the rest of the set [...] He's got a clear vision, and he's good at communicating that." [...] Annabeth Gish noted that Carter's directing was [...] "very meticulous" [...] and that he [...] "knows exactly what he wants".|$|E
500|$|Michael {{compared}} {{his relationship}} to Holly {{to that of the}} protagonists in the 1989 romantic comedy, When Harry Met Sally.... "Company Picnic" [...] writer Jennifer Celotta said the final scene with Jim and Pam reacting to her pregnancy while the cameras film from outside the hospital room was an homage to a scene in the British version of The Office. In that scene, Tim Canterbury proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley in a meeting room, but Tim turns off his microphone first so the cameras pick up only their reactions and no sound. Celotta said of the scene, [...] "We are all big fans of the moment that Tim takes off his mic and tells Dawn how he feels. Such an intimate moment that, to me, it feels like it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it just be theirs." ...|$|E
500|$|Smash Hits {{rated the}} album 8 out of 10 {{and called it}} [...] "quite human and {{therefore}} the most enjoyable of the lot". In {{a review of the}} 1999 re-release of the album, Vincent L. of Krinein Magazine praised the entire record because it contains [...] "catchy tracks and joyful melodies". Napster's Nicholas Baker liked the album's composition and concluded [...] "this LP {{is not so much a}} guilty pleasure as an essential point in electropop history." [...] Metro Pulses Anthony Nownes found the tunes [...] "punchy, memorable" [...] and [...] "accessible", concluding his review with [...] "If all rock records sounded like this—shiny and slick and highly processed—the world would be terrible. But a few Trevor Horns—people who use studio technology the way a curious and playful child uses a room full of fictile toys—are <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> around." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, in 1999 Speed reprised {{the role}} of Natalie Price, four years after her initial departure. Her return was {{prompted}} by her friend and EastEnders co-star Ross Kemp, who initiated contact between her and producer Matthew Robinson. Speed commented [...] "I have changed. I've grown up and I'm more confident. I've had more life experiences. I've had bad times, lived in different places. I'm a bit more grown up and settled now. And as I've grown older I appreciate that it's much <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a regular job. When EastEnders asked me back, I thought, `Cool, I can pay the mortgage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{the same}} it was <b>nicer</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Ho-o-la-a pay for it. In a way, you see, Roscoe is doing it, {{because it was}} his {{judgment}} I trusted to when I made the investment." [...] She gazed slowly about her, her eyes taking in, not merely the beauty and comfort and repose of all they rested on, but the immensity of beauty and comfort and repose represented by them, scattered in similar oases all over the islands. She sighed pleasantly and observed: [...] "All our husbands have done well by us with what we brought them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whatever happens," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "you won't fail me. I'm often {{frivolous}} and selfish, but it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> know I <b>have</b> somebody I can trust." ...|$|R
500|$|São Paulo goalkeeper Rogério Ceni {{was named}} as {{man of the}} match and also won the Golden Ball as the best player of the competition.

[...] Goalscorer Mineiro was equally overjoyed with the victory stating: [...] "It is the happiest moment in my career." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{coaching}} situation had been settled, Gillis next {{turned his attention}} back to trading Luongo. The Canucks were hoping to make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure what to say or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it was <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{a friendship with}} recording artist Miley Cyrus in 2013, Gregory E. Miller from the New York Post noted that the media and general public would continue [...] "following her every move". Ferreira commented that [...] " [...] obviously way bigger and all eyes [...] on her, but I feel like we're kind of going through a similar thing where everyone's {{trying to say that}} we're trying to make ourselves objects, but really, everyone else is making it more like that—sensationalizing sex and reading into things. It's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> someone that gets it." [...] Ferreira had also generated a minor controversy after appearing topless on the cover for Night Time, My Time, to which she responded [...] "there's nothing about that photo that's pornographic; we came on this earth nude." [...] Ferreira is also a feminist, which has influenced her work; she has said [...] "I feel like I'm doing a bad job of being a feminist if I'm not making someone angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Music {{critics were}} divided on [...] "Alive". Chuck Taylor of Billboard stated that: [...] "Remember that 'Oh, my' feeling {{the first time}} you heard Madonna sing her first ballad, 'Crazy for You'? It's déjà vu with 'Alive'." [...] According to Taylor, Lopez instills a [...] "vulnerable spirit of romanticism" [...] in the track. He wrote that Lopez [...] "does her best" [...] with the song, a [...] "regal ballad". He called [...] "Alive" [...] a [...] "bold new terrain" [...] for Lopez, [...] "an artist who is heralded more for her videogenics than her voice." [...] Taylor wrote that [...] "it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> top 40's leading staple artist diversify her {{portfolio}} with a musical summer fling that will maintain programmers' and fans' love affair with Lopez". He stated that the radio remix of [...] "Alive" [...] is [...] "made more luxurious" [...] {{with the addition of a}} [...] "cascade of fluttering strings".|$|E
500|$|In 1980, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art put on {{a two-month}} {{retrospective}} of over 40 of Grant's films. In 1982, he was honored with the [...] "Man of the Year" [...] award by the New York Friars Club at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He turned 80 in 1984; Peter Bogdanovich noticed that a [...] "serenity" [...] had come over the actor. Grant was in good health until suffering a mild stroke in October that year. In {{the last few years}} of his life, he undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show, A Conversation with Cary Grant, in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. He made some 36 public appearances in his last four years, from New Jersey to Texas, and found his audiences changed from elderly film buffs to enthusiastic college students discovering his films for the first time. Grant admitted that he thought the appearances were [...] "ego-fodder", remarking that [...] "I know who I am inside and outside, but it's <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the outside, at least, substantiated".|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found it <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, and he told me how he was gonna shoot it so I could really play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
5000|$|Orthodox rabbi Shmuley Boteach wrote [...] "For people like...Nasr..., an imam like Fadlallah {{who wants}} to kill Americans and Israelis but who is {{unexpectedly}} <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> women <b>has</b> taken a giant leap forward from the Dark Ages, deserving respect and praise.
