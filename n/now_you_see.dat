25|$|Not {{only did}} it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, but the new <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} format meant that episodes of <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It {{were no longer}} {{self-contained}} and could straddle between episodes, and an episode could end with a game in progress {{that would have to}} be continued on the next program. Also, if a champion won the jackpot in the Solo Game and retired, the opponent he/she had defeated in the Championship Round came back to play again in the Championship Round of the following game.|$|E
25|$|In the Solo Game, the {{champion}} was given sixty seconds to find ten {{words on a}} brand new board. The champion viewed the board on a telestrator screen. On the original <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It, the Solo Game board was the same one used in the Semi-final/Qualifying Round and the screen was embedded in Jack Narz's podium. On the revival series, a separate podium was used and, as {{in the rest of}} the show, the board was computer-generated.|$|E

25|$|In <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E
25|$|On both series, the Solo Game's jackpot {{started at}} $5,000. For each {{unsuccessful}} {{playing on the}} original <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It, the jackpot increased by $1,000 and, if the pot reached $25,000, it froze there until it was won. Any contestant that won the Solo Game retired immediately as champion and the loser of the final round became the champion-designate for the next show/match (depending on the format; as noted above the change resulted in games that straddled episodes). A contestant was not limited as champion otherwise; champions played until they were defeated or won the Solo Game.|$|E

Initially, it did well against Alex Trebek's American debut on NBC (The Wizard of Odds) but, three months later, NBC gave Trebek a new show called High Rollers at that slot and <b>Now</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> It began to struggle while the producers altered the format several times. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Studio 33, currently home to The Price Is Right. Some episodes used Studio 41, {{which at the time}} was the stage of CBS's Tattletales.|$|E
