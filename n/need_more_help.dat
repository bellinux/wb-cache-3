25|$|For many {{children}} with CP, parents are {{heavily involved in}} self-care activities. Self-care activities, such as bathing, dressing, grooming, can be difficult for children with CP as self-care depends primarily on use of the upper limbs. For those living with CP, impaired upper limb function affects almost 50% of children and is considered the main factor contributing to decreased activity and participation. As the hands are used for many self-care tasks, sensory and motor impairments of the hands make daily self-care more difficult. Motor impairments cause more problems than sensory impairments. The most common impairment is that of finger dexterity, which {{is the ability to}} manipulate small objects with the fingers.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} health and needs of {{extremely}} obese women aged over 65 years receiving home care in Europe. Study design: A cross-sectional assessment study based on the Aged in Home Care (AdHOC) project recruited 2974 women aged 65 or over who were receiving home care at 11 sites in European countries. Extreme obesity was defined as ‘Obesity of such a degree as to interfere with normal activities, including respiration’. Main outcome measures: Resident Assessment Instrument for Home Care (RAI-HC version 2. 0); Activity of Daily Living Scale; Instrumental Activity of Daily Living Scale; the Minimum Data Set Cognitive Performance Scale; and a health profile. Results: One hundred and twenty women (4. 0 %) were extremely obese. They were younger than their thinner counterparts, with a median age of 78. 3 versus 83. 3 years, and they more often had multiple health complaints and <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>help</b> with mobility outside the home. The extremely obese had received home care longer than the non-extremely obese (median 28. 7 versus 36. 6 months). Extremely obese women also <b>needed</b> <b>more</b> <b>help</b> with personal care than the other group and, due to lower age, they were less cognitively impaired. Conclusions: Extreme obesity {{is a problem that}} increasingly affects home care of elderly women...|$|R

She escapes unharmed {{with help from the}} spirits). Miyori's mom offers to take her back to Tokyo so they can live together. Miyori is not very interested in this offer as she knows her mother's habits and general selfish character. During the night, Miyori calls a meeting of the spirits to ask them for help finding the eagles, but none of them have any idea how to find them. On a suggestion, she turns to the spirit of the wind (Fukurin) for help, and he in turn agrees to ask any eagles he comes across to consider living in the forest. The next day, Miyori's mom heads home but not before repeating her offer; which Miyori turns down saying that unless her mother gets back together with her father, she won't consider it. Her mother agrees to at least talk to her father (while in the manga she's much less sympathetic and says since Miyori is her daughter, she won't be able to survive in the country).|$|E
5000|$|Jesus first {{appears in}} the fifth episode of the season, [...] "Go Getters", where he {{attempts}} to comfort Maggie and Sasha (who are hiding in the Hilltop from Negan) on their lost loved ones. Gregory decides {{that the two of}} them must leave and when Jesus disagrees, Gregory states he is free to go with them. Sasha later tells Jesus that he should be in charge of the community, though he insists that he just tries to help, Sasha tells him he might have to do more. When the Hilltop is attacked by walkers let in by the Saviors, Jesus helps Sasha fend them off (once again showing off his impressive skills in hand-to hand combat) while Maggie destroys the car system drawing them in. The next day, Jesus continues to argue with Gregory as he refuses to turn away Maggie (who is pregnant) as well as Sasha as the two helped save them. When Simon, one of the head Saviors, arrives at the Hilltop, Gregory attempts to turn over the two, but is foiled by Jesus hiding them elsewhere. When confronted about it, Jesus tells him they are all staying and though he doesn't want to be in charge, Gregory won't be either. The episode ends with Jesus sneaking aboard one of the Savior's trucks in order to find Negan where he discovers Carl Grimes already there, bent on killing Negan. Jesus briefly {{appears in the}} following episode [...] "Sing Me a Song", as he and Carl continue towards the Sanctuary. Jesus uses syrup from the supply shipment to mark a trail for them before suggesting they jump out and continue following on foot as [...] "it's not the fall that gets you. It's fighting it." [...] He then rolls from the truck only to see Carl did not follow him, much to Jesus's amusement. He is later seen on top of a truck as Carl leaves the Sanctuary. He is then seen in [...] "Hearts Still Beating" [...] where he finds Daryl inside the Sanctuary and helps him escape. Jesus is later seen watching Daryl and Maggie reunite with their friends and walks beside them as they go to plan for their fight against the Saviors. The following episode [...] "Rock in the Road" [...] shows Rick and Jesus failing to convince Gregory to fight the Saviors. They do find several members of the community who come forward to volunteer their help. As the group discusses strategies for beating the Saviors, Rick states they <b>need</b> <b>more</b> <b>help,</b> Jesus tells them he knows a group who can help. To this end he brings them to the Kingdom, a flourishing community that are also forced to serve the Saviors. Jesus is shown to be well known there and is on good terms with their leader, King Ezekiel. When Ezekiel refuses to join their fight, Jesus leaves with the others and later returns to the Hilltop with Sasha. [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Jesus bonding with Maggie and revealing more of his past to her (including that he grew up in a corporal camp and that he is gay) and stating that she and Sasha help him feel more at home. He provides Sasha with a layout of the Sanctuary to help with her plans to kill Negan (though he disagrees with her decision). Jesus is later confronted by Gregory who states he has been shirking his scavenging/scouting duties and has too many people in his trailer. When Gregory mentions that he should show more respect or something may happen with the Saviors constantly coming around, Jesus quickly sees Gregory is threatening him. Gregory denies it, but also claims that he takes care of his friends and {{that the two of them}} are not friends. In [...] "Something They Need", Jesus is part of the group Rick takes to a community called Oceanside with the intent of stealing their weapons. Their plan succeeds, but Jesus appears to be conflicted about their actions.|$|E
