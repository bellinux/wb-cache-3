5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare elements, due to the difficulties in separating the elements it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> late 1800s that the element was isolated.

5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase urbanisation leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Barnes was first-choice as an opener with Arthur Morris {{throughout}} the Test series, {{although it was}} <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Third Test {{that they had a}} first-wicket partnership of any substance.

5|$|In the 1920s {{there were}} serious {{shortages}} {{of goods and}} housing.

5|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> {{voyage of}} Henry Hudson, an Englishman {{who worked for}} the Dutch East India Company, that the area was mapped.

5|$|Protease {{inhibitory}} {{activity in}} blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, but it was <b>not</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated.
