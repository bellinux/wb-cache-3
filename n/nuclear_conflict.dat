5|$|Enemies & Allies is a 2009 {{novel by}} American science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson. The book {{is set in}} the 1950s, {{in the midst of the}} Cold War, and follows Superman and Batman. Though {{suspicious}} of each other, they confront Lex Luthor who stages an international <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict</b> and spreads fear of an alien invasion so that he can sell advanced weapons to governments. Themes used in the novel, reflective of the 1950s era, include alien invasion films, nuclear threats, and Cold War paranoia.|$|E

A total of 90 B61 nuclear bombs are hosted at the Incirlik Air Base, 40 of which are allocated for use by the Turkish Air Force in case of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict,</b> but their use requires the approval of NATO.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict</b> was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
25|$|The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament {{was founded}} in 1957 {{in the wake of}} {{widespread}} fear of <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict</b> and the effects of nuclear tests. In the early 1950s Britain had become the third atomic power, after the USA and the USSR, and had recently tested an H-bomb.|$|E
25|$|Palo Verde was of such {{strategic}} importance, due to {{a variety}} of its features, that it and Phoenix were documented by the former Soviet Union as target locations in the event of <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict</b> during the Cold War. In March 2003, National Guard troops were dispatched to protect the site during the launch of the Iraq war amidst fears of a terrorist attack.|$|E
50|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the resultant end of the Cold War, the threat of a major nuclear war between the two nuclear superpowers was generally thought to have declined.

40|$|The {{period from}} 1980 to 1985 marked the largest peacetime {{military}} build-up in United States history. During this period, defense appropriations increased approximately 50 percent in real terms.

50|$|Regional <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{could also}} inflict {{significant}} {{damage to the}} ozone. A 2008 study found that a regional nuclear weapons exchange could create a near-global ozone hole, triggering human health problems and impacting agriculture {{for at least a}} decade. This effect on the ozone would result from heat absorption by soot in the upper stratosphere, which would modify wind currents and draw in ozone-destroying nitrogen oxides. These high temperatures and nitrogen oxides would reduce ozone to the same dangerous levels we now experience below the ozone hole above Antarctica every spring.|$|R

50|$|Living like a spy, Dominic {{eventually}} {{winds up}} in Switzerland {{towards the end of}} the war, where he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic’s existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflicts</b> can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the “Other” confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse.|$|R

40|$|IMPF: 01. 73 The plant nucleus is {{a highly}} ordered and dynamic structure, with a {{considerable}} level of variation between species in terms of genome size, genome organisation, chromosome territories and patterns associated with developmental changes. Diploids naturally represent the simplest state of affairs, but in the plant world more than 70 % of species {{may have been involved}} in polyploidisation events at some stage during their evolution. Autopolyploids have multiple sets of chromosomes from a single species, and aside from the complexities of meiosis we may expect them to accommodate their polysomic state as well as their disomic relatives. Allopolyploids are at the other extreme, with multiple sets of chromosomes from 2 or more species, embedded in the cytoplasm of the maternal parent following hybridisation, and this presents the nucleus of nascent allopolyploids with certain zones of conflict. Nature has found ways to make the accommodation, and recent developments in molecular analysis have now opened a window for the experimenter to view the process of this adjustment, and to see how rapidly it takes place and what processes are involved. The nature of the resolution of <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflicts</b> in diploid hybrids and in allopolyploids is discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|In 1949, China {{closed the}} border between Nubra and Xinjiang, {{blocking}} old trade routes. In 1955 China began to build roads connecting Xinjiang and Tibet through this area. It also built the Karakoram highway jointly with Pakistan. India built the Srinagar-Leh Highway during this period, cutting the journey time between Srinagar and Leh from 16 days to two. The route, however, remains closed {{during the winter months}} due to heavy snowfall. Construction of a 6.5km tunnel across Zoji La pass is under consideration to make the route functional throughout the year. The entire state of Jammu and Kashmir continues to be the subject of a territorial dispute between India, Pakistan and China. Kargil was an area of conflict in the wars of 1947, 1965 and 1971 and the focal point of a potential <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict</b> during the Kargil War in 1999.|$|E
25|$|As {{anthropogenic}} {{greenhouse gas}} emissions reduce {{the stability of the}} global climate, abrupt climate change could become more intense. The impact of an asteroid or comet larger than about 1km diameter has the potential to block the sun globally, causing impact winter. Particles in the troposphere would quickly rain out, but particles in the stratosphere, especially sulfate, could remain there for years. Similarly, a supervolcanic eruption would reduce the potential of agricultural production from solar photosynthesis, causing volcanic winter. The Toba super volcanic eruption approximately 70,000 years ago may have nearly caused the extinction of humans (see Toba catastrophe theory). Again, primarily sulfate particles could block the sun for years. Solar blocking is not limited to natural causes as nuclear winter is also possible, which refers to the scenario involving widespread nuclear war and burning of cities that release soot into the stratosphere that would stay there for about 10 years. The high stratospheric temperatures produced by soot absorbing solar radiation would create near-global ozone hole conditions even for a regional <b>nuclear</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
