25|$|In May 2011, {{the debate}} over Nestlé's {{unethical}} marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written {{an open letter to}} the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, Bureau Veritas was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina’s compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree in Lao PDR. The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a <b>non-conformance,</b> and Bureau Veritas recommended that the Nestlé’s Policy and Procedures Manual on the Marketing of breastmilk substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the Lao PDR Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization {{was in the process of}} developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.|$|E

40|$|During {{manufacturing}} and in-service of the outlet guide vanes various irregularities on the vane surface can occur. These irregular shapes are surface <b>non-conformances</b> {{in the form}} of welds, traces or repairs of various forms. Improvement of the aerodynamic performance of the guide vanes requires understanding of the impact of these technological features on the flow field and aerodynamics. Experimental study is performed in a linear cascade facility at Chalmers University. In focus of current work are <b>non-conformances</b> in form of welding traces. The model welding traces were placed at different locations on the suction side of the vane. The influence of these <b>non-conformances</b> on the cascade aerodynamics is evaluated and validation of CFD results obtained by the k-ε realizable and k-ω SST turbulence models is performed...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{variability}} {{is likely}} {{the primary cause}} of a large scatter in the life of gas turbine hot-section components. This research deals with schemes to improve robust-ness through tolerancing input parameters in ranges of the distributions which make <b>non-conformances</b> more likely. The need for probabilistic analysis to investigate this problem is substantiated due to differences which arise when input parameters vary at different levels, for example the engine-to-engine and blade-to-blade level. Specifically, the importance of blade-to-blade level input parameters relative to engine-to-engine level input parameters becomes increasingly important for larger numbers of blades in a row. A framework for cal-culating the potential number of prevented <b>non-conformances</b> and the corresponding cost savings associated with various tolerancing schemes is presented.

40|$|Processes are the {{backbone}} {{for business and}} need to be managed well. Processes have been in the focus since 1990 's when Michael Hammer released an article about re-engineering the processes. Available material published afterwards focuses on process management through mapping and improvement of the process. Responsibility charting is seen as important aspect increasing the knowledge regarding the roles among the participants. This study examines the interdependence of process maps and responsibility charts. By comparing different options available it is indicated how process management needs to take into account both process mapping and responsibility charting in order to achieve the overall understanding of the process. In the literature there are not studies combining these and comparing different tools available. Several options from the process mapping point of view are examined to identify the differences. From responsibility assignment aspect the RA(S) CI tool is in focus as it is the most in depth tool. The key contribution of this study is the analysis of alternative methods, resulting in a tool com-parison. Advantages and disadvantages are identified for process mapping solutions with the di-mensions coming from the RA(S) CI charting. Findings are applied to a case study, where one pro-cess is defined with process flowchart map, SIPOC tool and responsibility charting. This is done to improve the understanding of the process. Case Company have recognized challenges due to participants not knowing the whole chain involved in the process and what each piece of information does in the following phases. Aim is to offer a process related solution which minimizes the costs arising from the <b>non-conformances,</b> lack of process and responsibility knowledge. Qualitative understanding of the process in question is gathered through interviews, participant observation, templates and instructions. Created material leads {{to a better understanding of}} the process among the participants, this de-creases misunderstandings and <b>non-conformances.</b> When the number of <b>non-conformances</b> de-creases it has the same effect on the financial losses caused by them. Both can be measured through a system available in the Case Company. In addition to process mapping and responsibility charting, study could be extended by combining the Lean Six Sigma and TIMWOOD theories into the process. These would improve the process onwards and result in changes in the current mappings...|$|R

40|$|GKN Aerospace is {{the first}} tier {{supplier}} to the global aviation industry and produces products with a great complexity and quality. However, GKN is as many other producing companies confronted with internal reoccurring problems in the manufacturing. Reoccurring problems consume resources in terms of material and time for the employees. This case study was made with the purpose to identify possible improvement areas for the problem solving process at GKN {{in order to make}} it more robust. GKN are aware of that they have reoccurring <b>non-conformances</b> in manufacturing, they are measured, but the level is quiet constant. Through interviews, survey and review of internal documents the researchers found that there is room for improvement for the information collected and documentation. The initial documentation of <b>non-conformances</b> is sometimes poor. In addition, the problem characterisation made in the documentation template PPL is occasionally performed poorly, lacking useful information. The following root cause analysis has sometimes shortcomings in the method of breaking down the causes to identify the root cause. The literature study made suggests a more extensive way of working with the root cause analysis tool 5 Why, compared to how GKN works today. By studying the prerequisites to identify the root cause the authors found some possibilities for improvements. More time is needed for problem solving. Currently the time is insufficient, 95 % of the Production Engineers agree upon this. Further, the Operators must be more incorporated in the problem solving to understand the purpose of performing a good problem solving. They need to get proper education on the subject in addition to their expertise. In general the thesis concerns the understanding of how information is used and affects the problem solving as a whole. At GKN training is needed to emphasize the importance of problem characterization, to be able to identify root causes for problems. What GKN gains on illuminating focus on the problem characterization, the problem descriptions and the root cause analysis with improved prerequisites, is that GKN improves the process of identifying root causes of problems and thereby can avoid reoccurring <b>non-conformances...</b>|$|R
