5|$|Since Leyte was out {{of range}} of Kenney's {{land-based}} aircraft, MacArthur was dependent on carrier aircraft. Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on Tacloban, where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on Nashvilles bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit. Over the next few days, the Japanese counterattacked in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, resulting in a near-disaster that MacArthur attributed to the command being divided between himself and Nimitz. Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. Heavy monsoonal rains disrupted the airbase construction program. Carrier aircraft proved to be <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese to pour troops into Leyte. Adverse weather and tough Japanese resistance slowed the American advance, resulting in a protracted campaign.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E

25|$|While an {{advocate}} for private support of science research, Conn has also argued that continued public funding is critical, and he has noted that government funding of basic science is about fifteen times that of philanthropy. “Philanthropy is <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> for government funding.

25|$|During 2009, {{there was}} {{additional}} criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at Otago University. They argue that CIRs are <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of representative democracy, such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions. Current New Zealand Prime Minister John Key also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.|$|E

25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, there is <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> for the {{threaded}} standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff {{is essentially a}} hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw {{through a hole in}} the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which tends to make this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|E

500|$|Although Lindwall {{was able}} to run between the wickets during Australia's innings, {{he did not take}} the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey {{replaced}} him. However, Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not approach Bradman to object to Harvey's presence on the field. O'Reilly said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way [...] "incapacitated" [...] and that the English captain [...] "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" [...] when <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> was justified.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} & determine premium petroleum demand in Indonesia, focusing on the period of 1980 - 1995. Employing a logarithmic model this study also measures price-elasticity, income-elasticity, and the cross-elasticity of premium petrol with lubricants. It is found that the demand is inelastic towards income, inelastic towards price, and that lubricants arc strong complementariness for premium petrol. Thus {{it can be concluded}} that premium petrol is a normal good (neither superior nor inferior), a relatively basic need with little or <b>no</b> <b>substitutes</b> and its demand is complementary with the demand or lubricants. Since premium petrol is a basic need for Indonesian people Government with almost <b>no</b> <b>substitutes,</b> the should not take rash steps that would cause the price of petrol apparent that if Indonesia would like to re 4 uce the consumption of premium petrol, price policies would not be very effective as price-elasticity is low. Non-price policies, eg., introduction of alternative energy, would probably be more potent...|$|R

500|$|England thus {{started their}} second innings still 344 runs in arrears.

Fingleton called Harvey [...] "by far the most {{brilliant}} fieldsman of both sides". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. O'Reilly said Lindwall had demonstrated his mobility during his innings, was in no way [...] "incapacitated" [...] and that the English captain [...] "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" [...] when <b>no</b> <b>substitute</b> was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton's judgement of Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far.
