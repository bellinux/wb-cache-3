5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more than an extravagant <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the interior of the building.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decline}} in the 1890s, the logging of native timber {{expanded}} into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral sheep and dairy farming, which continues to be a mainstay of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the Department of Conservation as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{results from}} the large, {{randomized}} study to prospectively evaluate reamed intramedullary <b>nails</b> <b>in</b> patients with tibial fractures (SPRINT) trial suggested a benefit for reamed intramedullary <b>nail</b> insertion <b>in</b> patients with closed tibial shaft fractures largely based on cost-neutral autodynamizations and a potential advantage for unreamed intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>in</b> open fractures. We performed an economic evaluation to compare resource use and effectiveness of reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing using a cost-utility analysis...|$|R

5|$|The Smoking Man seeks Gibson Praise, who is {{undergoing}} brain surgery {{at that very}} moment. Mulder and Scully head to the home where the alien gestated, finding an alien's <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the wall. The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At the nuclear power plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, {{which is why it}} is in the nuclear power plant. Inside they find organic material on the ground and cooling pipes.|$|E
25|$|The case is {{important}} both in U.S. antitrust law and film history. In the former, {{it remains a}} landmark decision in vertical integration cases; in the latter, {{it is seen as}} the first <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin of the old Hollywood studio system.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the curved}} {{shape of the}} nail, the {{tensioning}} device rests on the higher middle of the nail by applying upward pressure {{to the sides of}} the <b>nail.</b> <b>In</b> studies of diabetics, who need to avoid surgery when possible, nail bracing was found to be effective at providing immediate, as well as long-term, relief.|$|E

25|$|His {{resignation}} {{over the}} technicalities {{of how and}} when to bring in the local government reforms which the British Labour government was pushing for was probably the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the political coffin of Terence O'Neill, who resigned in the aftermath of his failure to achieve a good enough result in the Northern Ireland general election, 1969.|$|E
25|$|Later, in 1934, a {{match between}} Buller's team and Almack's Club was played, in which Almack's used ideas taken from Culbertson. Almack's won, {{knocking}} another <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin of Buller's system. The consequence was that direct and entirely natural bidding {{went out of}} favour, never to return. In the future, even natural bidding systems used detailed agreements and conventions.|$|E
25|$|In the end, the Conservatives won {{the most}} {{votes in the}} 1896 {{election}} (48.2% of the votes, in comparison to 41.4% for the Liberals). However, they captured {{only about half of}} the seats in English Canada, while Laurier's Liberals won a landslide victory in Quebec, where Tupper's reputation as an ardent imperialist was a major handicap. Tupper's inability to persuade Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau to return to active politics as his Quebec lieutenant was the <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin for the Conservatives' campaign in Quebec.|$|E

There are plenty of Power-Ups to save your hide, or drive the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> your enemy's coffin. There are Boons to earn, which grant you magical powers. You can form Guilds and challenge other Guilds for domination of the harbors, bays and islands of the Caribbean. And to keep things interesting, the world of play is ever changing, as more areas to explore are unlocked and new treasures are discovered.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Vampiro (accompanied by The Misfits) and Steve Williams. The match started {{back and forth}} until Williams sent Vampiro off the top turnbuckle. The Misfits came in, and Williams fought them off. Williams {{continued}} to attack Vampiro, and the referee disqualified him after Williams refused to stop. Vampiro won the match, and earned a match with Oklahoma, which started immediately after. Oklahoma had the advantage after Williams' attacks. Vampiro fought back with an ura-nage, and beat him down with The Misfits. Vampiro pinned him after a <b>Nail</b> <b>in</b> the Coffin to win the match.|$|E
25|$|By 1997, the {{bulletin}} had simplified {{its name to}} Ten Capital News. The 1990s had been a decade of soft ratings for Network Ten {{and the legacy of}} CTC's 'Channel 7' glory days had long been forgotten. Owners Southern Cross Broadcasting tapped the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin of the locally produced news bulletin in 2001 blaming declining audience and the expense of upgrading equipment for digital broadcasting. The axing, in the same year as Prime cancelled its half-hour local bulletin in Canberra, sparked an Australian Broadcasting Authority investigation into regional television news. No news bulletins were restored as a result.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, a {{piece of}} acacia wood was located between the bones {{and the head of}} the nail, presumably to keep the {{condemned}} from freeing his foot by sliding it over the nail. His legs were found broken, possibly to hasten his death. It is thought that because in Roman times iron was rare, the nails were removed from the dead body to conserve costs. According to Haas, this could help to explain why only one nail has been found, as the tip of the <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> question was bent in such a way that it could not be removed.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1987 Dennis Condrey left Jim Crockett Promotions, {{abandoning the}} Midnight Express {{when they were}} {{scheduled}} to appear at an event in Los Angeles as he changed his plane ticket to go elsewhere in order {{to drop out of}} sight. Manager Jim Cornette brought in a man that Bobby Eaton was familiar with, having feuded with him extensively in Memphis – Stan Lane. When Lane joined Eaton to form the new Midnight Express it put the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the coffin of the Fabulous Ones, ending their 5-year run. Keirn, meanwhile, would run a wrestling school in Florida, which he trained future superstars like Mike Awesome, Dennis Knight, Diamond Dallas Page, and Dustin Rhodes, to name a few.|$|E
25|$|After {{analyzing}} {{hundreds of}} designs, and finally {{coming up with}} what {{was believed to be}} the best design, Bostich finally released the <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> 2005 and labeled it the Sheather Plus. Even though the new nail was stronger than most nails, the barbs, which added the much needed strength to the nail's holding power, weakened the strength of the joint by opening the hole too far. This caused the joint to be sloppy and wobbly, so the team went {{back to the drawing board}} where the final feature was added to the nail. To compensate for the extra width of the nail hole, due to the ring shanks, Sutt decided to add a thicker screw-shank to the portion of the nail directly under the head. This addition thickened the top portion of the nail giving it a tighter joint, as well as enhancing its overall holding power.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{provinces of}} Mali freed themselves {{one by one}} giving rise to 5 small kingdoms. The most prominent of them were brought together to {{form the basis of}} the Bambara kingdoms of Segu and Kaarta. Mali itself was reduced to a small kingdom around Kaabu and Kita. By 1600 the Denianke controlled all the area from the Sahel to Futa Jallon and over the upper Senegal. They would also take the coveted Bambuk goldfields and the important commercial town of Diakha on the Bafing River. The battle of Jenne put the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the empire's coffin. A victory at Jenne might well have saved the empire, keeping the tribes united under a strong and proven leader. But Mansa Mahmud IV retired to the remains of his kingdom and with his death, the realm was split up among his three sons. A unified Mali simply ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E
25|$|Next, Mohun Bagan were {{up against}} a fairly {{confident}} Shillong Lajong side who had entered the semi finals upsetting Kolkata giants East Bengal 4–3 on aggregate. The first 30 minutes of the semi final was a closely contested tie. It took a moment of individual brilliance from Sony Norde in the 40th minute to open the scoring for Bagan. His long range effort rebounded of Lajong goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Jeje Lalpekhlua grabbed onto the opportunity as he toed {{the ball into the}} net. This goal opened the scoring flood gates for Mohun Bagan. In the final stages of the first half Bikramjit Singh scored a screamer from a Cornell Glen pass to put Mohun Bagan 2–0 ahead. After the restart Jeje Lalpekhlua completed his hat-trick by scoring in the 51st and 56th minute. At the fag end of the match young star Azharuddin Mallick put the final <b>nail</b> <b>in</b> the Lajong coffin to secure a comprehensive 5–0 victory for the Mariners.|$|E
