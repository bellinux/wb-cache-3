40|$|A {{selective}} {{spectrophotometric method}} for {{the determination of}} rosoxacin (ROS), a 4 -quinolone antimicrobial agent, has been developed and validated. The method {{was based on the}} reaction of ROS with alkaline sodium nitroprusside (SNP) reagent at room temperature forming a red colored chromogen measured at 455 nm. The conditions affecting the reaction (SNP concentration, pH, color-developing time, temperature, diluting solvent and chromogen stability time) were optimized. Under the optimum conditions, good linear relationship (r= 0. 9987) was obtained between the absorbance and the concentration of ROS in the range of 20 - 50 microg ml(- 1). The assay limits of detection and quantitation were 2. 5 and 8. 4 microg ml(- 1), respectively. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of bulk drug and laboratory-prepared tablets; the mean percentage recoveries were 100. 1 +/- 0. 33 and 101. 24 +/- 1. 28 %, respectively. The results were compared favourably with those obtained by the reported method; {{no significant difference in the}} accuracy and precision as revealed by the accepted values of t- and F-tests, respectively. The robustness and ruggedness of the method was checked and satisfactory results were obtained. The proposed method was found to be highly selective for ROS among the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The reaction mechanism was proposed and it proceeded in two steps; the formation of <b>nitroferrocyanide</b> by the action of sodium hydroxide alkalinity on SNP and the subsequent formation of the colored nitrosyl-ROS derivative by the attack at position 6 of ROS...|$|E
