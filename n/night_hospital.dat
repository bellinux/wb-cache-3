40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a <b>night</b> <b>hospital</b> nursing service for elderly people suffering from dementia; in particular, to establish the appropriateness of night support for this group and their carers. The study developed as a result of previous work that demonstrated that some carers requested "inpatient" admission for their relative/friend because of the stress of providing support and supervision at night. The research methods involved an evaluative structure - process - outcome, quality assurance and case study approach. An operational policy for the service was drawn up, as were nursing standards (process). The service was evaluated over a two year period. Patient outcomes were measured using a visual analogue scale at intervals over six months to identify behavioural changes. Similarly, carers' feelings of anxiety and coping ability relating to their caring role were measured. Changes in patient behaviour and carer anxiety and felt ability to cope were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. Carers were interviewed to elicit the effects their relatives' attendance at CREST had on their day to day lives. Changes in the use of community care services as a result of CREST were also identified. The sample consisted of 38 patients and their informal carers. Nursing activity was observed using non-participant observation to establish both the type of activity and peak work load periods. The results demonstrate that CREST had a positive outcome in terms of supporting patients' carers and that patients' behaviour did not change significantly while attending the <b>night</b> <b>hospital.</b> This latter result has been interpreted as a positive outcome in that people suffering from dementia can be expected to deteriorate over time. In conclusion it is anticipated that the results of this study have significance for planning nursing services for the care group involved and should assist in identifying the number and grade of staff needed to deliver optimum care at night to elderly people with dementia. Recommendations for changes in the operational policy have been made which will assist managers in planning new services. The research suggests that new nursing services for this group in the health authority will be more closely related to the individual needs of patients and their carers than has been achieved hitherto. This strategy should lead to fewer patients needing long term in-patient care...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze {{feasibility}} of day surgery in breast cancer patients with breast conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy. Material and Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial comparing day surgery with one <b>night</b> <b>hospital</b> stay in breast cancer patients with breast conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy. A total of 40 patients with 3 -cm tumor and clinically N 0 were randomized to one night stay group and 38 patients to day surgery group. Within discharge, patients and their relatives were given questionnaires in order to evaluate their experience regarding the duration of hospital stay. Results: Randomized groups were similar regarding patient age and tumor stage. A total of 18 (47 %) day surgery group patients were discharged the same day. The most common reason for overnight hospital stay was axillary clearance, 9 (24 %). None of the patients in the day surgery group, but 2 patients in the overnight hospital stay group had re-operation due to complications. Perception and preference results were analyzed both according to randomization and actual treatment groups. Patients in both groups had rather similar experiences on the first postoperative day. Also, spouse's or relative's perception after discharge was similar in both groups. Conclusion: Day surgery was well received by the patients and their relatives. Day surgery appears as feasible in patients with breast conservation and sentinel node biopsy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Warfarin is an oral {{anticoagulant}} (OAT) that needs active management to ensure therapeutic range. Initial management is often carried {{out as an}} inpatient, though not requiring inpatient facilities. This mismatch results in financial costs which could be directed more efficaciously. The extent of this has previously been unknown. Here we aim to calculate the potential number of bed nights which may be saved among those being dose optimized as inpatients and examine associated factors. Methods A 6 week prospective audit of inpatients receiving OAT, at Cork University Hospital, was carried out. The study period was from 11 th June 2007 to 20 th July 2007. Data was collected from patient's medications prescription charts, medical record files, and computerised haematology laboratory records. The indications for OAT, the patient laboratory coagulation results and therapeutic intervals along with patient demographics were analysed. The level of potentially avoidable inpatient nights in those receiving OAT in hospital was calculated and the potential cost savings quantified. Potential avoidable bed nights were defined as patients remaining in hospital {{for the purpose of}} optimizing OAT dosage, while receiving subtherapeutic or therapeutic OAT (being titred up to therapeutic levels) and co-administered covering low molecular weight heparin, and requiring no other active care. The average cost of â¬ 638 was taken as the per <b>night</b> <b>hospital</b> stay cost for a non-Intensive Care bed. Ethical approval was granted from the Ethical Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals, Cork, Ireland. Results A total of 158 patients were included in the audit. There was 94 men (59. 4 %) and 64 women (40. 6 %). The mean age was 67. 8 years, with a median age of 70 years. Atrial Fibrillation (43 %, n = 70), followed by aortic valve replacement (15 %, n = 23) and pulmonary emboli (11 %, n = 18) were the commonest reasons for prescribing OAT. 54 % had previously been prescribed OAT prior to current admission. It was confirmed that, there are potentially avoidable nights in patients receiving OAT. The majority of this group were those being commenced on OAT for the first time (p = 0. 00002), in the specialities of Cardiology, Cardiothoracic surgery and Care of the Elderly. The potential number of bed nights to be saved is 13 per week for the hospital or 1. 1 bed nights per 10, 000 general hospital admissions. These were predominantly weekday nights. The estimated cost of avoidable inpatient OAT dose optimization was approximately â¬ 8300 per week. Conclusion With rising costs and the increasing demands for acute hospital beds, alterations to inpatient management for this group of patients should be considered. Alternatives include increasing the size of current anticoagulation clinics, introduction of POCT (point of care testing) devices and increased GP management. POCT can be justified based upon the publication by Gardiner et al, who showed that 87 % of patients find self testing straightforward, 87 % were confident in the result they obtained using the devices and 77 % preferred self testing. </p...|$|E

40|$|English NHS {{inpatient}} surveys consistently identify {{that noise}} at <b>night</b> in <b>hospitals</b> {{and its impact}} on patients' sleep is a persisting problem that needs addressing. To identify how noise at <b>night</b> in <b>hospital</b> affects patients on general wards and the range of interventions aimed at reducing the problem, a systematic mapping of the literature was undertaken. All primary studies and relevant literature published January 2003 âJuly 2013 were included. Key issues identified in the literature included noise levels and causes, impact on patient experience, and lack of staff awareness. Interventions to reduce noise were targeted at staff education, behaviour modification, care organisation and environmental solutions. The scoping suggested that when compared with specialist units, there is little evidence on effective interventions reducing disturbance from night-time noise on general wards. The available evidence suggests a whole systems approach should be adopted to aid quality sleep and promote recovery...|$|R

40|$|Part-time {{hospitalization}} {{for persons}} with psychiatric disorders is underdeveloped, underutilized and often poorly understood, but should be encouraged {{in view of the}} unsatisfactory living conditions of patients discharged from hospital who still require care, the reductions in psychiatric impatient populations and numbers of beds, the increasing costs of health services and the current fiscal restraints. Day and <b>night</b> <b>hospitals</b> can provide an alternative to inpatient or outpatient treatment, rehabilitation for the long-term patient or treatment for the patient in transition from inpatient to outpatient status. The day hospital can also provide a diagnostic setting. Such programs help preserve the patient's position in the family and the community, minimize the ill effects of hospitalization, and lower capital and operating costs of the psychiatric services. Awareness by medical and paramedical services of the value of these programs would increase their utilization.
