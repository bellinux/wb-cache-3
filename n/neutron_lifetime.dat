50|$|For every 1000 {{neutrons}} {{released by}} fission, a small number, typically {{no more than}} about 7, are delayed neutrons which are emitted from the fission product precursors, called delayed neutron emitters. This delayed neutron fraction, {{on the order of}} 0.007 for uranium, is crucial for the control of the neutron chain reaction in reactors. It is called one dollar of reactivity. The lifetime of delayed neutrons ranges from fractions of seconds to almost 100 seconds after fission. The neutrons are usually classified in 6 delayed neutron groups. The average <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime</b> considering delayed neutrons is approximately 0.1 sec, which makes the chain reaction relatively easy to control over time. The remaining 993 prompt neutrons are released very quickly, approximately 1 μs after the fission event.|$|E
5000|$|In {{steady state}} operation, nuclear {{reactors}} operate at exact criticality. When {{at least one}} dollar of reactivity is added above the exact critical point (where the neutron production rate balances the rate of neutron losses, from both absorption and leakage) then the chain reaction does not rely on delayed neutrons. In such cases, the neutron population can rapidly increase exponentially, with a very small time constant, known as the prompt <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime.</b> Thus {{there is a very}} large increase in neutron population over a very short time frame. Since each fission event contributes approximately 200 MeV per fission, this results in a very large energy burst as a [...] "prompt critical spike". This spike can be easily detected by radiation dosimetry instrumentation and [...] "criticality accident alarm system" [...] detectors that are properly deployed.|$|E
5000|$|Fission {{reactions}} and subsequent neutron escape happen very quickly; {{this is important}} for nuclear weapons, where {{the objective is to}} make a nuclear core release as much energy as possible before it physically explodes. Most neutrons emitted by fission events are prompt: they are emitted effectively instantaneously. Once emitted, the average <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime</b> (...) in a typical core is on the order of a millisecond, so if the exponential factor [...] is as small as 0.01, then in one second the reactor power will vary by a factor of (1 + 0.01)1000, or more than ten thousand. Nuclear weapons are engineered to maximize the power growth rate, with lifetimes well under a millisecond and exponential factors close to 2; but such rapid variation would render it practically impossible to control the reaction rates in a nuclear reactor.|$|E

40|$|When {{performing}} k-eigenvalue solutions with KENO-V. a, {{two different}} prompt <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetimes</b> are estimated - a system <b>lifetime</b> and a <b>neutron</b> generation time. The meaning {{of these two}} lifetimes has been ascertained by comparing values of various neutron lifespans/lifetimes predicted by MCNP and DANTSYS based on the neutron-balance theory. The system lifetime in KENO-Va corresponds to the unweighted removal lifetime calculated by both MCNP and DANTSYS. The unweighted removal lifetime is the average time between removal events resulting from a neutron absorption or a neutron leakage. The generation time in KENO-V. a corresponds to the fission lifespan calculated by MCNP, where the fission lifespan in MCNP represents the average time for a newly born neutron to cause another fission. As such, the generation time in KENO-Va does not represent the generation time that appears in the point kinetic model. The generation time in the point kinetic model is the adjoint-weighted removal lifetime divided by k{sub eff}, which is identically equal to the adjoint-weighted neutron production rate. In small bare systems operating {{in the vicinity of}} delayed critical, the difference between the adjoint-weighted neutron generation time and the fission lifespan can be as small as a few percent. However, in reflected systems, the difference between these two quantities can be several orders of magnitude. In conclusion, the prompt neutron generation time predicted by KENO-Va corresponds to the fission lifespan of a prompt neutron in a given system. The fission lifespan is the average time from birth-to-fission and, in general, is not a good approximation for the adjoint-weighted neutron generation time that appears in the point-kinetic model...|$|R
5000|$|Fortunately, the {{effective}} <b>neutron</b> <b>lifetime</b> is {{much longer than}} the average lifetime of a single neutron in the core. About 0.65% of the neutrons produced by 235U fission, and about 0.20% of the neutrons produced by 239Pu fission, are not produced immediately, but rather are emitted from an excited nucleus after a further decay step. In this step, further radioactive decay {{of some of the}} fission products (almost always negative beta decay), is followed by immediate neutron emission from the excited daughter product, with an average life time of the beta decay (and thus the neutron emission) of about 15 seconds. These so-called delayed neutrons increase {{the effective}} average lifetime of neutrons in the core, to nearly 0.1 seconds, so that a core with [...] of 0.01 would increase in one second by only a factor of (1 + 0.01)10, or about 1.1: a 10% increase.
