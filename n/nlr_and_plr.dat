40|$|AbstractAcute {{appendicitis}} (AA) is {{not uncommon}} during pregnancy but {{can be difficult to}} diagnose. This study evaluated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in addition to conventional diagnostic indicators of the disease to diagnose AA during pregnancy. Age, gestational age, white blood cell (WBC) count, Alvarado scores, C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocyte count, <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were compared among 28 pregnant women who underwent surgery for AA, 35 pregnant women wrongly suspected as having AA, 29 healthy pregnant women, and 30 nonpregnant healthy women. Mean WBC counts and CRP levels were higher in women with proven AA than in those of control groups (all p <  0. 05). Among all the groups, the median <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were significantly different in women with proven AA (all p <  0. 05). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine cut-off values for WBC count, CRP, lymphocyte count, <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR,</b> and multiple logistic regression analysis showed that <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> used with routine methods could diagnose AA with 90. 5 % accuracy. Used in addition to routine diagnostic methods, <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> increased the accuracy of the diagnosis of AA in pregnant women...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundSeveral {{inflammatory}} biomarkers, {{especially a}} high preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR), {{are known to}} be indicator of poor prognosis in several cancers. However, very few studies have evaluated the significance of the <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We evaluated the association of the preoperative <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> with clinicopathological characteristics in patients with PTC. MethodsThis study included 1, 066 female patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for PTC. Patients were stratified into 4 quartiles by preoperative <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR.</b> And the combination of preoperative <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> was calculated on the basis of data obtained value of tertile as follows: patients with both an elevated PLR and an elevated NLR were allocated a score of 2, and patients showing one or neither were allocated a score of 1 or 0, respectively. ResultsThe preoperative <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 45 years and in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The PLR was significantly higher in patients with tumor size > 1 cm (P= 0. 021). When the patients were categorized into the aforementioned four groups, the group with the higher preoperative PLR was found to have a significantly increased incidence of lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P= 0. 018). However, there are no significant association between the combination of preoperative <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> and prognostic factors in PTC patients. ConclusionThese results suggest that a preoperative high PLR were significant associated with lateral LNM in female patients with PTC...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Peritonitis is an {{important}} problem for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. It has been demonstrated that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) increase nonspecifically in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) without infection. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) have been recently investigated as a new alternative inflammatory parameter to distinguish infections and other inflammatory events {{in a number of}} studies. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> in bacterial PD peritonitis. MATERIAL and METHODS: In this study, we evaluated 40 peritonitis episodes that we treated. <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were calculated from the same blood sample at the beginning and after the treatment of peritonitis. The same parameters were evaluated for 20 control subjects. RESULTS: Classical inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR; <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> decreased with the successful treatment of peritonitis, and levels of these parameters were significantly different between the periods (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Both <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> are valuable markers to follow the course of peritonitis and response to the treatment of peritonitis in correlation with conventional inflammation markers of infection. <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> are also more simple to calculate and cheaper parameters than classical markers...|$|E
40|$|The {{peripheral}} blood neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) {{have been reported}} to correlate with the prognosis of many malignancies. This study evaluated the prognostic value of pretreatment <b>NLR,</b> LMR, <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A retrospective analysis of clinical and pathological data of 140 NPC patients without distant metastasis during initial treatment was conducted to identify correlations between <b>NLR,</b> LMR, <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> <b>and</b> clinicopathological features, overall survival, and progression-free survival. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to reveal the independent factors affecting the prognosis of NPC patients. NLR was associated with T staging, N staging, and overall clinical stage grouping of the NPC patients (P< 0. 05). NLR ≥ 2. 28, LMR < 2. 26, <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> ≥ 174 were significantly associated with a relatively short overall survival (P< 0. 05). In addition, NLR ≥ 2. 28 was significantly associated with a relatively short progression-free survival (P< 0. 05). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent prognostic factor in NPC.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the role of red cell distribution width (RDW), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (<b>NLR),</b> <b>and</b> platelet–lymphocyte ratio (<b>PLR)</b> in the diagnostic phase of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). We screened 248 consecutive patients who were admitted to the emergency service with PE foremost in the differential diagnosis. Based on spiral computed chest tomography, the patients were divided into two groups. There were 112 confirmed cases of acute PE and 138 patients without PE. Blood samples were obtained within 2 hours of presentation and before starting any medication. There were no significant differences between the PE and the non-PE groups with respect to sex, age, frequency of disease, serum creatinine, sodium, and potassium (p >  0. 05 for all). <b>NLR,</b> RDW, <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were higher in patients with PE than those without PE. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, d-dimer, and troponin levels were also higher in patients with PE. RDW values were positively correlated with troponin levels (r =  0. 147, p =  0. 021). There were no correlations between RDW <b>and</b> <b>NLR,</b> <b>PLR,</b> or d-dimer. NLR had a highly positive correlation with PLR (r =  0. 488, p  18. 9 predicted acute PE with a sensitivity of 20. 7 % and a specificity of 93. 4 %.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: To {{investigate}} {{the significance of}} neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in vestibular neuritis. Study Design: Retrospective, case-control study. Methods: The study subjects were patients who received treatment for vestibular neuritis between January 2009 and December 2013, and a control group composed of 70 age-and sex-matched healthy subjects who received laboratory testing {{as part of a}} routine health checkup. The subjects underwent a complete blood cell count and counts of the various cell sub-types to compare <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> in the vestibular neuritis patients and controls. The associations between laboratory test results and values of the vestibular function test and clinical information were examined. In addition, a subgroup analysis according to the duration of spontaneous nystagmus was performed. Results: The mean <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> values of the patient group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Although caloric test outcomes and hospitalization period were not significantly correlated with blood profiles, the duration of dizziness needing antivertiginous drugs was positively correlated with <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (P=. 021, P=. 020, respectively). In addition, NLR was negatively correlated with the length of time between symptom start and blood sampling (P=. 005). The <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> value of patients with nystagmus for more than 5 days were significantly higher than those of patients whose nystagmus ceased within 5 days. Conclusions: This is the first report to evaluate the significance of <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> in vestibular neuritis. <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> should be taken into consideration as simple and reliable parameters for predicting the cause and severity of the disease...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the prognostic value of the pretreatment and post-treatment albumin level, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in subtypes of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). A retrospective analysis of 62 patients with GBS treated between 2011 and 2015 in Dicle University Hospital, Turkey, was carried out. The pretreatment and post-treatment albumin, <b>NLR,</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> were documented, together with acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), acute motor axonal neuropathy, motor sensory axonal neuropathy, and Hughes&# 8217; scores. Post-treatment albumin levels in GBS were significantly reduced, and albumin level was negatively correlated with the Hughes scores. Elevated pretreatment NLRs and PLRs were significantly associated with AIDP. There were no correlations between the Hughes scores, <b>NLR,</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR.</b> The results point to a negative correlation between albumin levels and GBS disability and suggest that the <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> may be promising blood biomarkers of AIDP...|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 32 {{patients}} with GIP were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were assessed {{according to the}} GPS, <b>NLR,</b> <b>PLR,</b> PI, <b>and</b> PNI. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables associated with mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also performed. Overall survival rates (in-hospital mortality) were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and differences in survival rates between groups were compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis of significant variables revealed NLR (HR 1.257, 95 % CI 1.035 – 1.527, P =  0.021) <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (HR 1.004, 95 % CI 1.001 – 1.007, P =  0.016) {{at the time of}} admission to the intensive care unit to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality. AUC analysis revealed Sequential Organ Failure Assessment-Glasgow Coma Scale (SOFA-GCS) (0.73) to be superior to <b>NLR</b> (0.57) <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (0.58) for predicting mortality, and a high SOFA-GCS score was associated with reduced overall survival (P <  0.05).|$|R

30|$|<b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> {{were found}} to be {{superior}} to other inflammation-based prognostic scores in predicting the mortality of patients with GIP. <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> are based primarily on the physiological link between neutrophilia and lymphopenia with systemic inflammation. Jilma et al. [4] studied changes in white blood cell types after inflammation and reported a 300 % increase in circulating neutrophils, 96 % decrease in monocytes, and 85 % decrease in lymphocytes 4 to 6  h after inflammation. Below, we discuss the literature surrounding NLR and the prognostic capabilities of NLR for GIP.|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> had a {{positive}} predictive value of 38.5 % and a negative predictive value of 84.2 %, suggesting that <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> may be more useful for ruling out mortality, rather than predicting it. <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> can be obtained easily, cheaply, and rapidly and can provide relevant information for necessary interventions within the first few hours of hospital admission. As discussed earlier, {{studies have shown that}} NLR predicts bacteremia better than other infection markers [1] and an NLR >[*] 7 was reportedly an independent predictor of mortality in patients with bacteremia [2]. In another study, the initial NLR measured at ED admission was independently associated with 28 -day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [8]. However, these previous studies did not assess associations between inflammation-based prognostic scores, including the GPS, NLR, PLR, PNI, and PI, and mortality in patients with GIP. Our results are informative in this respect.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the diagnostic efficacy of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil-to-monocyte ratio (NMR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD) and non-CD controls. These ratios were all derived from complete blood counts. Two hundred and six participants including CD inpatients and non-CD controls were retrospectively enrolled. We found statistically higher <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> and lower LMR in CD patients than in non-CD controls (all P< 0. 01). However, NMR was not different between the two groups (P= 0. 18). In addition, NLR, PLR, and LMR were associated with CRP and ESR.

40|$|Background: Variations in {{systemic}} {{inflammatory response}} biomarker levels {{have been associated}} with adverse clinical outcome in various malignancies. This study determined the prognostic significance of preoperative neutrophil:lymphocyte (NLR), platelet:lymphocyte (PLR) and monocyte:lymphocyte (MLR) ratios in endometrial cancer. Methods: Clinicopathological and 5 -year follow-up data were obtained for a retrospective series of surgically treated endometrial cancer patients (n= 605). Prognostic significance was determined for overall (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Receiver-operator characteristic and log-rank functions were used to optimise cut-offs. NLR, PLR and MLR associations with clinicopathological variables were determined using non-parametric tests. Results: Applying cut-offs of ≥ 2. 4 (NLR), ≥ 240 (PLR) and ≥ 0. 19 (MLR), <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (but not MLR) had independent prognostic significance. Combining <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> scores stratified patients into low (NLR-low and PLR-low), intermediate (NLR-high or PLR-high) and high risk (NLR-high and PLR-high) groups: multivariable hazard ratio (HR) 2. 51; P< 0. 001 (OS); HR 2. 26; P< 0. 01 (CSS) for high vs low risk patients.

In this study, we aimed at delineating the relationship between SSNHL and the inflammation markers <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR.</b> MATERIALS and METHODS: This study was performed with 102 patients diagnosed with SSNHL and 119 sex- and age-matched controls. All sub-jects {{in the study and}} the control group had their complete blood count (CBC) results, which were evaluated retrospectively to calculate <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> values. All patients underwent an audiological examination on the 1 st, 3 rd, 10 th, and 30 th days of the hearing loss. All patients received 1 mg/kg IV prednisolone treatment in tapered amounts to be completed in 15 days. Based on the improvements seen in the audiograms, the patients were divided into two groups: responders and non-responders to treatment.

40|$|Background: The {{peritoneum}} is {{the preferred}} site of metastasis from several primary malignancies, and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) {{is one of the}} most significant negative prognostic indicators in patients with metastatic disease. A survival benefit has been observed for patients with PC from colorectal, ovarian, and gastric carcinomas treated by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) followed by intraoperative hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). In patients undergoing this treatment modality, the strongest determinant of outcome is the residual tumor extension after CRS. Unfortunately, PC can be difficult to diagnose preoperatively by imaging studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of computed tomography (CT) and 18 F- 2 -deoxy-fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scanning in detecting the presence and the extent of PC in patients with various advanced malignancies. Patients and Methods: A group of 47 patients (median age 61. 4 ± 11. 5 years) with advanced or recurrent cancers (colorectal= 26, ovarian= 21, gastric= 8, pseudomyxoma peritonei= 3) scheduled for CRS and HIPEC underwent preoperative CT and PET/CT. The results were expressed as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy. The negative (<b>NLR)</b> <b>and</b> positive (<b>PLR)</b> likelihood ratio were also obtained.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 140 patients with UUTUC who underwent radical nephroureterectomy from January 2005 to December 2011. We plotted receiver operating characteristic curves of <b>NLR,</b> <b>PLR,</b> <b>and</b> LMR for the diagnosis of tumor recurrence. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method and log-rank test. Independent risk factor analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that NLR was superior to <b>PLR</b> <b>and</b> LMR as a predictive factor in patients with UUTUC undergoing radical nephroureterectomy. Univariate analysis revealed that NLR (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 001), PLR (P= 0. 01 and P< 0. 001), and LMR (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 001) were significantly associated with disease-free survival and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> LMR as independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (P= 0. 035 and P= 0. 002) and PFS (P= 0. 005 and P= 0. 002), respectively.

Patients and methods: Of 434 consecutive HR- nonmetastatic breast cancer patients treated between 2004 and 2010 in the Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, 318 eligible cases with complete data {{were included in the}} present study. Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to determine the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to test the usefulness of <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR.</b> Results: Univariate analysis indicated that both elevated <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (both P< 0. 001) were associated with poor OS. The utility of NLR remained in the multivariate analysis (P< 0. 001), but not PLR (P= 0. 104). The analysis results for DFS were almost the same as OS. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant association between increased <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (P< 0. 001 and P= 0. 011) and poor survival in triple-negative breast cancer. However, for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 -positive breast cancer, only NLR was significantly associated with OS in the multivariate analysis (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: The present study indicates that both increased <b>NLR</b> <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> are associated with poor survival in HR- breast cancer patients. Meanwhile, NLR is independently correlated with OS and DFS, but PLR is not. Keywords: inflammatory markers, breast cancer, surviva...|$|E

Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and methods: From 2009 - 2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled {{in the study and}} analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings.

The prognostic significance of several inflammatory indicators, including neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CRP/Alb ratio), lymphocyte–monocyte ratio (LMR), and neutrophil–platelet score (NPS), {{were found to}} be correlated with prognosis in several cancers. However, the prognostic role of these inflammatory biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma has not been evaluated. This study enrolled 122 Ewing patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was generated to determine optimal cutoff values; areas under the curves (AUCs) were assessed to show the discriminatory ability of the biomarkers; Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves; and Cox multivariate survival analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors. The optimal cutoff values of CRP/Alb ratio, <b>NLR,</b> <b>PLR,</b> <b>and</b> LMR were 0. 225, 2. 38, 131, and 4. 41, respectively. CRP/Alb ratio had a significantly larger AUC than <b>NLR,</b> <b>PLR,</b> LMR, <b>and</b> NPS. Higher levels of CRP/Alb ratio (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 41, P= 0. 005), GPS (HR 2. 27, P= 0. 006), NLR (HR 2. 07, P= 0. 013), <b>and</b> <b>PLR</b> (HR 1. 85, P= 0. 032) were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. As the biomarkers had internal correlations, only the CRP/Alb ratio was involved in the multivariate Cox analysis and remained an independent prognostic indicator. The study demonstrated that CRP/Alb ratio, GPS, <b>and</b> <b>NLR</b> were effective prognostic indicators for patients with Ewing sarcoma, and the CRP/Alb ratio was the most robust prognostic indicator with a discriminatory ability superior to that of the other indicators; however, <b>PLR,</b> LMR, <b>and</b> NPS may not be suitable as prognostic indicators in Ewing sarcoma.
