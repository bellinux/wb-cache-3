5|$|Modern plant breeders develop <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, {{be higher}} yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of crop diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of crop rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of crop on a plot of land one year, and planting a different crop on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the socioeconomic factors which influence the profitability and adoption of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns, and to recommend suitable measures to enhance the crop diversification program in Mahaweli System B, Sri Lanka. The adoption of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns is determined by a number of interrelated and mutually reinforcing factors. Hence, a multidisciplinary approach is used in this study to apprehend the different attributes of the <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns and farmers' decision making environment. The analytical methods include Marginal Cost-Benefit Analysis, Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Factor Analysis and Logit Probability Model. The results from the different techniques are generally in close agreement and complement each other. Results of the Marginal Cost- Benefit Analysis indicates that an increase in current crop yields and output prices may be necessary to increase the profitability of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns to a recommendable level. Analysis of the farmers' beliefs suggests that adopters of the <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns have more positive beliefs towards the profitability and adoption of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns when compared to nonadopters. Factor Analysis shows that there is a wide variation between the adopters and non-adopters, and also across the different locations with respect to farm-level variables. The analysis demonstrated that the information provided by 17 selected farm-level variables may be explained by four factors; namely, management factor, social factor, farm resource factor and farm stability factor. The variables highly loaded with the stability factor (number of years of residence, amount of loan obtained for farming, irrigation condition and percentage of rice produced allocated for consumption) are closely associated with the adoption rate. A logit probability model indicates that availability of farm loans significantly increases the probability of the adoption of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns. The study results show that the crop yield, output prices, availability of farm loans and farmer beliefs, are the dominant factors which influence the adoption of <b>new</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns...|$|R

25|$|South Carolina did {{not have}} a {{monopoly}} of the British market, but the demand was strong and many planters switched to the <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> when the price of rice fell. Carolina indigo had a mediocre reputation because Carolina planters failed to achieve consistent high quality production standards. Carolina indigo nevertheless succeeded in displacing French and Spanish indigo in the British and in some continental markets, reflecting the demand for cheap dyestuffs from manufacturers of low-cost textiles, the fastest-growing sectors of the European textile industries at the onset of industrialization.|$|E
25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of a <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E

A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
25|$|Classical plant {{breeding}} uses deliberate interbreeding (crossing) of closely or distantly related individuals to produce <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce traits/genes from one variety or line {{into a new}} genetic background. For example, a mildew-resistant pea may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, {{the goal of the}} cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, (backcrossing). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding.|$|E
25|$|Since AM fungi are biotrophic, {{they are}} {{dependent}} on plants {{for the growth of}} their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.|$|E

25|$|Normally, {{the extra}} payment of the premium would be {{compensated}} for by the profits {{to be made by}} selling the first of the <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of tea. In 1866 there was a problem - the first cargo of tea had arrived over two weeks earlier in the steam auxiliary ship Erl King, a ship that was not considered part of the race. The tea merchants were committed to a payment when their tea would sell at a loss. To add to this, the first two tea clippers had signalled off Deal early on the morning of 6 September, followed by a third (Serica) at 1:00 pm. These three ships would create a glut of new season tea, so prices were bound to fall further.|$|E
25|$|Although, in Cuba, many composers {{have written}} both {{classical}} and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed {{most of the}} night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on most musicians have kept their careers {{on one side of}} the invisible line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, a <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of classical musicians came onto the scene. The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who made significant innovations in classical guitar, and is currently the director of the Havana Symphonic Orchestra. His directorship in the early 1970s of the Cuban Institute of Instrumental and Cinematographic Arts (ICAIC) was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the nueva trova movement.|$|E
25|$|However {{inconsistency}} and successive {{back and}} ankle injuries have {{prevented him from}} cementing {{his place in the}} Indian team. His career statistics are better in ODI cricket than in Test cricket, but with 144 ODI wickets at an average of 30.54 his average is higher(lesser the best) than all three of his main competitors for fast bowling places in the Indian team – Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, who all have bowling averages below 30. The <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of fast bowlers like Munaf Patel, RP Singh and Ishant Sharma also add to the competition. Nevertheless, Nehra completed recovery from a bowel injury in March 2006 and tried to make a comeback into the Indian team.

25|$|The 1980s was {{the decade}} in which Australia began to truly {{dominate}} world rugby league. Along {{with the emergence}} of State of Origin football came a <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of superstar players who would lead Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as Peter Sterling, Mal Meninga, Wayne Pearce, Brett Kenny, Eric Grothe and Wally Lewis came to prominence on the 1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as 'the Invincibles', when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at Boothferry Park. The score was only 10–4 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.|$|E
25|$|Tea was {{introduced}} from China to Europe in the 17th century, but, as a luxury item, was not transported in significant quantities until the 19th century. China {{was the main}} centre of production {{until late in the}} 19th century. The British East India Company's monopoly of the tea trade from China to Britain ceased in 1834. This opening to competition meant that faster ships were needed, as merchants vied to be first in the market with each <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of tea. Unlike the slower East Indiamen that had carried tea during that company's monopoly, the tea clippers were designed for speed. Those that had achieved particularly fast passages could usually command a higher freight (the price paid to transport the cargo) than others. Tea wholesalers would mention in advertisements which ship had carried the different batches being sold. It was often the case that tea that was loaded early in China was of somewhat poorer quality than that which became available a few weeks later in the season. Yet this was what was carried by the first ships home and sold to the public with the cachet of a fast passage.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, at age 17, Escalante {{joined the}} punk rock band The Vandals, {{becoming}} their first permanent drummer. He would remain the sole constant {{member of the}} band {{throughout the rest of}} their career. They released their debut EP Peace thru Vandalism in 1982 through Epitaph Records. In 1984 Escalante and the other band members appeared in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia and released their first album When in Rome Do as the Vandals. In 1987 they appeared in another Spheeris film, Dudes. By 1989 Escalante had moved from the drums into the bass guitar position, and fluctuations in the band's membership had left him as the only member remaining from the original recording lineup. In order to continue the band, he and vocalist Dave Quackenbush set about finding new members, recruiting guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and drummer Josh Freese. In 1990 this lineup released the album Fear of a Punk Planet, establishing themselves amongst an emerging <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> of southern California punk rock bands. This lineup would remain consistent {{throughout the rest of the}} band's career and would release numerous albums, tour extensively, and form their own record label.|$|E
