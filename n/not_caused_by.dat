5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, which is <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> {{bioluminescence}} {{but by the}} scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department of Social Services was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E

5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices.

He believed early on that damage to the skin was <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an omission is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an omission.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the air currents meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

50|$|The {{disorder}} {{is characterized by}} a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, which may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, or catatonic behavior. The symptoms must <b>not</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder or mania in bipolar disorder. They must also <b>not</b> be <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a drug (such as amphetamines) or medical condition (such as a brain tumor). The term bouffée délirante describes an acute nonaffective and nonschizophrenic psychotic disorder, which is largely similar to DSM-III-R and DSM-IV brief psychotic and schizophreniform disorders.|$|R
5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great {{financial}} {{demand on}} Edward's subjects. Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted {{in the years}} 1294–97, raising over £200,000. Along with this came the burden of prises (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt. The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was <b>not</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made. At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration. Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope. When the clergy, {{with reference to the}} bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry. Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit. By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed clerical taxation in cases of pressing urgency.|$|E
