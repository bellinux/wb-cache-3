5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} <b>non-reusable,</b> and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production teams can correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E

Burning should be carried out at least daily.|$|E
50|$|Use of {{anonymous}} functions {{is a matter}} of style. Using them is never the only way to solve a problem; each anonymous function could instead be defined as a named function and called by name. Some programmers use anonymous functions to encapsulate specific, <b>non-reusable</b> code without littering the code with a lot of little one-line normal functions.|$|E
50|$|Reuse means {{suitable}} to use again or for further use. It {{is the quality}} or state of being to be reusable. What cannot be reduced they should try to reuse.

50|$|The {{eventual}} cost of such {{a vehicle}} {{is the subject of}} intense debate since even the best estimates disagree whether a scramjet vehicle would be advantageous. It is likely that a scramjet vehicle would need to lift more load than a rocket of equal takeoff weight in order to be equally as cost efficient (if the scramjet is a <b>non-reusable</b> vehicle).|$|E
50|$|Some {{conventional}} construction {{methods and}} materials are {{difficult or impossible}} to deconstruct and should be avoided when designing for deconstruction. The use of nails and adhesives significantly slows down the deconstruction process and {{has a tendency to}} ruin otherwise reusable materials.

50|$|Unlike the J-2 engine {{used on the}} S-IVB stage, the H-1 was a single-start engine. It {{could be}} fired {{multiple}} times—and engines were usually subject to two or more static test firings before a mission to flight-qualify them—but {{it could not be}} restarted in flight, because some components required for the startup sequence were <b>non-reusable.</b> In particular, the turbopumps were initially driven by a Solid Propellant Gas Generator (SPGG), which was essentially a small solid rocket, and had to be replaced after each firing.|$|E

50|$|Inks {{that are}} visible {{for a period}} of time without the {{intention}} of being made visible again are called disappearing inks. Disappearing inks typically rely on the chemical reaction between thymolphthalein and a basic substance such as sodium hydroxide. Thymolphthalein, which is normally colorless, turns blue in solution with the base. As the base reacts with carbon dioxide (always present in the air), the pH drops below 10.5 and the color disappears. Pens are now also available that can be erased simply by swiping a special pen over the original text. Disappearing inks have been used in gag squirtguns, for limited-time secret messages, for security reasons on <b>non-reusable</b> passes, for fraudulent purposes, and for dress-making and other crafts where measurement marks are required to disappear.|$|E

Finally, the craft was used to make orbit adjustments and was undocked and de-orbited on 8 February, burning up during re-entry over the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|Space {{capsules}} {{have typically}} been smaller than 5 m in diameter, {{although there is}} no engineering limit to larger sizes. As the capsule is both volumetrically efficient and structurally strong, it is typically possible to construct small capsules of performance comparable in all but lift-to-drag ratio to a lifting body or delta wing form for less cost. This has been especially pronounced {{in the case of the}} Soyuz manned spacecraft. Most space capsules have used an ablative heat shield for reentry and been <b>non-reusable.</b> The Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle appears likely, as of December 2005, to be a ten-times reusable capsule with a replaceable heat shield. There is no limit, save for lack of engineering experience, on using high-temperature ceramic tiles or ultra-high temperature ceramic sheets on space capsules.|$|E
