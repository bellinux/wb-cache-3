5|$|Autism {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example the vaccine hypotheses, which have been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified</b> (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.|$|E
5|$|If {{signs of}} {{disturbance}} are present {{for more than}} a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified,</b> while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition. Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified.</b> It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E

It requires the HTML document to be well-formed but does <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specify</b> the required XML format. Typically, iXBRL is implemented within HTML documents, which are displayed or printed by web browsers without revealing the XBRL metadata inside the document. The specification does, however, provide a normative schema which requires that any schema-valid iXBRL document should be in XHTML format.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the ability}} of the bill to bind the British {{government}} in the 2015-20 Parliament to holding such a referendum, a parliamentary research paper noted that:The Bill simply provides for a referendum on continued EU membership by the end of December 2017 and does <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specify</b> the timing, other than requiring the Secretary of State to bring forward orders by the end of 2016. ... If no party obtained a majority at the general election due in 2015, there might be some uncertainty about the passage of the orders in the next Parliament.|$|R

"The Bill simply {{provides}} for a referendum on continued EU membership {{by the end of}} December 2017 and does <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specify</b> the timing, other than requiring the Secretary of State to bring forward orders by the end of 2016. These orders would need both Houses to agree to the detailed rules for the poll and the date. If no party obtained a majority at the next general election due in 2015, there might be some uncertainty about the passage of the orders in the next Parliament. Unless the orders are passed, it would not appear possible to hold the referendum, since the day and the conduct of the poll would not have received parliamentary assent." ...|$|R
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified</b> (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E

5000|$|Li Renfu {{was said}} to be from the same Tuoba clan as the late-Tang Dynasty warlord Li Sigong (né Tuoba Sigong), the first Dangxiang {{military}} governor of Dingnan, and therefore was ethnically Dangxiang. [...] His relationship to Li Sigong was not clear from the traditional Chinese sources—the Old History of the Five Dynasties indicated that he also took the Tang Dynasty imperial clan surname of Li when Li Sigong was granted that surname for his contribution in Tang's defeat of the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, but did <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specify</b> their relationship; the New History of the Five Dynasties indicated a lack of knowledge, on the apart of its editors, as to their relationship; while the Zizhi Tongjian indicated that he was a cousin of Li Yichang, who succeeded Li Sigong's younger brother and successor Li Sijian, but whose relationship to Li Sigong was somewhat uncertain as well as different sources differed as to their relationship. [...] (The description in the History of Song of Li Renfu as being one generation below Li Yichang appeared to be clearly erroneous given that Li Renfu's sons also used the generational character of [...] "Yi" [...] in their names.) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{deletion}} of the subsets of autistic spectrum disorder (namely, Asperger's syndrome, classic autism, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative {{disorder and}} pervasive developmental disorder <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified)</b> was also implemented, with specifiers {{with regard to}} intensity (mild, moderate and severe). Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, with three levels: 1 (requiring support), 2 (requiring substantial support) and 3 (requiring very substantial support).|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{definition of}} a reference range (usually referred to if <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified)</b> originates in what is most prevalent in a reference group taken from the general (i.e. total) population.

However, there are also optimal health ranges (ranges that appear to have the optimal health impact) and ranges for particular conditions or statuses (such as pregnancy reference ranges for hormone levels).|$|E
25|$|Although {{compulsive}} buying {{falls under}} the category of Impulse-control disorder – <b>Not</b> <b>Otherwise</b> <b>Specified</b> in the DSM-IV-TR, some researchers have suggested that it consists of core features that represent impulse-control disorders which includes preceding tension, difficult to resist urges and relief or pleasure after action. The efficiency of Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Compulsive Buying is not truly determined yet however common techniques for the treatment include exposure and response prevention, relapse prevention, cognitive restructuring, covert sensitization, and stimulus control.|$|E
50|$|Circumscription {{was later}} used by McCarthy to formalize the {{implicit}} assumption of inertia: things do <b>not</b> change unless <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified.</b> Circumscription {{seemed to be}} useful to avoid specifying that conditions are not changed by all actions except those explicitly known to change them; {{this is known as}} the frame problem. However, the solution proposed by McCarthy was later shown leading to wrong results in some cases, like in the Yale shooting problem scenario. Other solutions to the frame problem that correctly formalize the Yale shooting problem exist; some use circumscription but in a different way.|$|R

25|$|During {{his trial}} for murder, defence {{witnesses}} provided evidence that Luka Magnotta {{had been diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia as a teenager. Defence expert Dr. Joel Watts testified that Magnotta showed signs of episodic schizophrenia (undifferentiated type), histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality traits and paraphilia <b>not</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>specified.</b> The prosecution revealed that Magnotta had been using illegal drugs during his teenage years which led to symptoms that mimicked schizophrenia and that Magnotta has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder by Crown expert Dr. Joel Paris at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal in April 2012. Dr. Renée Roy, the forensic psychiatrist who has been treating Magnotta at Rivières-des-Prairies Detention Centre since November 2012, through his preliminary hearing and right up to the murder trial, diagnosed Magnotta with borderline personality disorder with histrionic features. Dr. Gilles Chamberland, another Crown expert who was not able to interview Magnotta, diagnosed Magnotta with anti-social, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder. A number of psychiatrists over the years noted that Magnotta displayed antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic traits. The prosecution accused Magnotta of pretending to be schizophrenic since his defence pleaded diminished responsibility due to alleged schizophrenia.|$|E

30|$|However, {{there is}} little {{literature}} studying the universal two-child policy’s impact on financial operation of pension fund, nor further studying the fertility intention. This paper sets the actuarial model to analyze the impact of universal two-child policy on population aging and financial operation of pension fund. This paper not only simulates the impact of different fertility intention on financial operation of pension fund but also compares the effects of universal two-child policy with selective two-child policy. Comprehensively evaluating the universal two-child provides empirical evidence for the policy implementation, as well as reference for policy guidance.

30|$|SPC, biotin-DSPE (synthesized {{according}} to previous report [30]), and cholesterol were dissolved in absolute ether {{to prepare the}} organic phase, into which the aqueous phase, insulin citric acid-Na 2 HPO 4 buffer solution (pH  4.0, if <b>not</b> <b>specified</b> <b>otherwise),</b> was added dropwise following ultra-sonication to prepare the W/O emulsion. The organic solvent in the emulsion was then evaporated toward a rota-evaporator under 0.05 - to 0.06 -MPa pressure at a rotating speed of 50  rpm at 30 °C until glutinous gel formed. Afterwards, citric acid-Na 2 HPO 4 buffer with pH  3.8 was instilled to hydrate the lipidic gel until a homogeneous dispersion was formed. Finally, the dispersion was homogenized through an ultrasound cell cracker (SCIENTZ IID, Scientz Biotechnology, Ningbo, China) to obtain insulin-loaded BLPs.
