40|$|We have {{compared}} {{the level of}} expression of the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35 S promoter and the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> promoter when fused to a common reporter gene. A cassette containing the neomycin phosphotransferase (type II) coding sequence followed by the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> 3 ' nontranslated region was used for transcriptional and translational evaluation of the two different promoters. These chimeric genes were introduced into petunia plants and the copy number of the gene, the steady state level of NPTII transcript and the levels of NPTII enzyme activity were determined. In this paper, we report that the NPT II transcript levels are on the average 30 fold higher in plants containing CaMV 35 S promoter and leader sequences than in plants containing the same reporter gene but <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> promoter and leader sequences. Similarly, plants containing the CaMV 35 S promoter {{had an average of}} 110 fold higher levels of NPTII enzyme activity than those containing the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> promoter.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first functional map of a promoter expressed {{from the plant}} chromosome. We have constructed a series of overlapping deletion mutants within the region upstream of the Ti-plasmid encoded <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> (nos) gene.

The maximum length of sequence upstream of the transcription initiation point required to express wild type levels of <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> is 88 bp. Within this region, the "CAAT" box is essential for maximal activity; deletion of this sequence reduced apparent nos expression by over 80 %.

Unexpectedly, in all nine primary transformants tested the wild-type nos expression was virtually completely suppressed. In contrast, plants transformed with the control vector DNA, which differed only in the absence of the partial nos gene, did not show any inhibition of nos expression. Progeny plants were analyzed for the stability of the gene-silencing phenotype. All of the progeny that carried both the wild-type and partial nos genes had no detectable <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> activity. In addition, wild-type nos mRNA could not be detected in these plants. In most plants in which the wild-type gene was segregated away from the partial nos gene, wild-type levels of activity were detected. Although DNA methylation has been shown to be correlated with a decrease in promoter activity in plants, none of the progeny appeared to carry a methylated nos promoter.

40|$|Opine synthases are enzymes {{produced}} in dicotyledonous plants {{as the result}} of a natural gene transfer phenomenon. Agrobacteria contain Ti plasmids that direct the transfer, stable integration and expression of a number of genes in plants, including the genes coding for octopine or <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase.</b> This fact was used as the basis for the construction of a number of chimeric genes combining the 5 ' upstream promoter sequences and most of the untranslated leader sequence of the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> (nos) gene with the coding sequence of two bacterial genes: the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (APH(3 ') II) gene of Tn 5 and the methotrexate-insensitive dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR MtxR) of the R 67 plasmid. The APH(3 ') II enzyme inactivates a number of aminoglycoside antibiotics such as kanamycin, neomycin and G 418. Kanamycin, G 418 and methotrexate are very toxic to plants. The chimeric NOS-APH(3 ') II gene, when transferred to tobacco cells using the Ti plasmid as a gene vector, was expressed and conferred resistance to kanamycin to the plant cells. Kanamycin-resistant tobacco cells were shown to contain a typical APH(3 ') II phosphorylase activity. This chimeric gene can be used as a potent dominant selectable marker in plants. Similar results were also obtained with a NOS-DHFR MtxR gene.

This region is part of the Mesoamerican center of origin for maize (Zea mays L.), and the genetic diversity that is maintained in open-pollinated landraces is recognized as an important genetic resource of great cultural value. The presence of transgenes in landraces was significant because transgenic maize has never been approved for cultivation in Mexico. Here we provide a systematic survey of the frequency of transgenes in currently grown landraces. We sampled maize seeds from 870 plants in 125 fields and 18 localities in the state of Oaxaca during 2003 and 2004. We then screened 153, 746 sampled seeds for the presence of two transgene elements from the 35 S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus and the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> gene (<b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> terminator) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. One or both of these transgene elements are present in all transgenic commercial varieties of maize.

These promoter-gene constructs were introduced into wounded Nicotiana stems, leaf pieces, and cucumber seedlings by A. tumefaciens infection. Shoots were observed in the infection site on all responding genotypes of Nicotiana plants infected with the 35 S promoter construct (35 S—ipt), whereas only 41 % responded similarly to infection with the unmodified gene. Furthermore, shoots were observed 19 days after infection with the 35 S—ipt gene but not until 28 to 45 days with the unaltered ipt gene. Shoots were more numerous (> 40) on galls incited by 35 S—ipt and were up to 6 times taller than shoots induced by the native gene. On Cucumis (cucumber), shoots were observed only on galls incited by the 35 S—ipt construct. These galls were on the average 7. 5 times larger than those incited by the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> promoter construct (NOS—ipt) or the unmodified ipt gene. Zeatin and zeatinriboside concentrations averaged 23 times greater in the 35 S—ipt transformed shoots than in ones transformed with the native ipt gene.

After treatment with 5 AzaC doses from 0. 3 mM to 1. 0 mM, approximately 25 % of the plants produced detectable amounts of nopaline, indicating that the nos gene was reac-tivated. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the empty donor site left by Ac transposition, we demonstrated that 5 AzaC also activates Ac excision in the transgenic plants. Approximately 13 % of the 5 AzaC treat-ed plants (doses from 0. 1 mM to 1. 0 mM) were shown to have empty donor sites due to Ac excision. None of the plants cultivated in the absence of 5 AzaC showed evidence for Ac transposition or reactivation of the nos gene. Fur-ther analysis using Southern blot indicate that some de-methylation ocurred in the genome of individual plants.

For OsSHR 1 ::GUS vector construction, the promoter of OsSHR 1 was amplified by PCR and digested {{at the site of}} Hin d III and Kpn I, then inserted into pBI 101.3. The primers used in PCR were TCAAAGCTTCATAACATATGGATCAATACAAAC and TCAGGTACCTAAGCAACGGCGACGAGGAGGA. Construct containing GUS reporter controlled by promoters of OsPIN 1 c, OsPIN 1 b and OsPIN 2 were constructed before (Wang et al. [2009]). These constructs were transformed into the Wild-type (Nipponbare) via Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105.|$|E
40|$|An {{infectious}} plum pox potyvirus cDNA clone {{was constructed}} placing {{a copy of}} the full-length sequence of the virus genome between an enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and a <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> termination signal. Stabilization of the clone and faster growth of bacteria, in addition to higher plasmid yield, followed a modification consisting of the insertion of an intron which interrupted the viral open reading frame at the P 3 region. This intron-containing clone was infectious when inoculated into plants after undergoing in vivo transcription and splicing. Particle bombardment delivery of the cDNA greatly increased the efficiency of plant infection. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Granule-bound starch synthase [GBSS; EC 24. 1. 21] {{determines the}} {{presence}} of amylose in reserve starches. Potato plants were transformed to produce antisense RNA from a gene construct containing a full-length granule-bound starch synthase cDNA in reverse orientation, fused between the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and the <b>nopaline</b> <b>synthase</b> terminator. The construct was integrated into the potato genome by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. Inhibition of GBSS activity in potato tuber starch was found to vary from 70 % to 100 %. In those cases where total suppression of GBSS activity was found both GBSS protein and amylose were absent, giving rise to tubers containing amylose-free starch. The variable response of the transformed plants indicates that position effects on the integrated sequences might be important. The results clearly demonstrate that in tubers of potato plants which constitutively synthesize antisense RNA the starch composition is altered...|$|E
