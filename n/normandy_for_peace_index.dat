In 2009, Transparency International ranked the nation in last place on its annual Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), a metric that purports to show the prevalence of corruption in a country's public sector. In mid-2010, the Institute <b>for</b> Economics and <b>Peace</b> also ranked Somalia in the next-to-last position in between war-afflicted Iraq and Afghanistan on its Global <b>Peace</b> <b>Index.</b>|$|R

It also accused Somali officials of collaborating with pirates, UN contractors of helping insurgents, and the Eritrean government of still supporting rebel groups in southern Somalia despite earlier sanctions imposed on the former. Somalia's government and local businessmen, as well as United Nations officials and the Eritrean government all emphatically rejected the report's claims.|$|R

Created by the Institute <b>for</b> Economics and <b>Peace,</b> {{the creators of}} the Global <b>Peace</b> <b>Index,</b> {{it is said to}} be the first in a series of National sub-divisions by their peacefulness. The USPI was created first due to plentiful data and a large amount of diversity between states <b>for</b> level of <b>peace.</b> The United States ranked 88/158 on the Global <b>Peace</b> <b>index</b> <b>for</b> 2012.

The UK index was released in April 2013 and provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012.

The UK <b>Peace</b> <b>Index</b> also provides an analysis of the socio-economic factors associated with peacefulness, as well as an estimate of the economic benefits that would flow from increases in peace.|$|R
30|$|The second layer {{measures}} each state’s political instability. Using {{information from}} the Fund <b>for</b> <b>Peace’s</b> Failed States <b>Index,</b> states are grouped into five categories: failing, fragile, troubled, moderate, and stable [59]. The Fund <b>for</b> <b>Peace</b> ranks states based on the following conditions: mounting demographic pressures, massive movement of refugees or internally displaced persons, vengeance-seeking group grievances, chronic and sustained human flight, uneven economic development, poverty or sharp/severe economic decline, legitimacy of the state, progressive deterioration of public services, {{violations of human rights}} and rule of law, security apparatus, rise of factionalized elites, and intervention of external actors. While we acknowledge the limitations of the categories and data sources used by the Fund <b>for</b> <b>Peace,</b> <b>for</b> the purposes of this map political instability is used as a proxy for understanding a state’s ability to effectively manage the extraction, production, consumption, and export of its food, water, energy, and mineral resources. Note that the mechanisms above are close to these indicators, though our scope is closer on the resource nexus.|$|R

50|$|In May 2007, the Global <b>Peace</b> <b>Index</b> (GPI) was {{launched}} {{in an attempt to}} measure the relative ranking of peacefulness around different countries around the world. Today, the Global <b>Peace</b> <b>Index</b> is maintained the Institute <b>for</b> Economics and <b>Peace,</b> and is conducted on an annual basis. The index primarily measures three different categories to determine the level of peace in the world. These levels look at the overall security, crime levels, and the build up of military forces. By measuring levels of peace, the hope is that a greater general awareness and attention is given towards making the world a more peaceful place.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is no real}} {{consensus}} on {{the definition of a}} [...] "failed state"; the subjective nature of indicators that are used to measure state failure have led to an ambiguous understanding of the term. Some scholars focus on the capacity and effectiveness of the government to determine if a state is failed or not. Other indices such as the Fund <b>for</b> <b>Peace’s</b> Fragile States <b>Index</b> underline the democratic character of state institutions in order to determine its level of failure. Finally, other scholars focus their argument on the legitimacy of the state, {{on the nature of the}} state, on the growth of criminal violence in a state, on the economic extractive institutions, or on the states’ capacity to control its territory. Robert H. Bates refers to state failure as the [...] "implosion of the state", where the state transforms [...] "into an instrument of predation" [...] and the state effectively loses its monopoly on the means of force.|$|R
