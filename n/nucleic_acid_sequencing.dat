Part of this work was done in collaboration with his wife, Celia. The emphasis of his research then shifted towards the mRNA encoding antibodies where he was able to provide the first evidence for the existence of a precursor for these secreted polypeptides that contained a signal sequence. The development of the hybridoma technology coupled to advances in <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequencing</b> then allowed Milstein to chart the changes that occurred in antibodies following antigen encounter. He demonstrated the importance of somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin V genes in antibody affinity maturation. In this process, localised mutation of the immunoglobulin genes allows the production of improved antibodies which make a major contribution to protective immunity and immunological memory. Much of his work in recent years was devoted to characterising this mutational process with a view to understanding its mechanism and, indeed, he contributed a manuscript for publication on this topic less than a week before he died.|$|E

The foundation of the method is a novel <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequencing</b> library construction method that stably cross-links cDNA amplicons within biological samples. Sequencing data is then generated through an intensive interleaved microscopy and biochemistry protocol and subsequent image processing and bioinformatics.

FISSEQ {{is an example of}} an extremely dense form of in-situ nucleic acid readout: every letter along the RNA chain is read. Thus, barcodes for FISSEQ can be packed into a short string of DNA, as short as 15-20 nucleotides long for the mouse brain or 5 nucleotides for targeted cancer gene panels.|$|E

The Cumberland dusky salamander is one of five members of this complex and has been found at several sites in Tennessee on the Cumberland Plateau. The most northerly of these is near Wartburg in Morgan County and the most southerly is on the southern side of the Cumberland Plateau near Tracy City in Grundy County.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{biological}} techniques {{become more}} and more popular, as they are applied to many kinds of applications, authentication protocols, biochemistry, and cryptography. One of the most interesting biology techniques is deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> and using it in such domains. Hiding secret data in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> becomes an important and interesting research topic. Some researchers hide the secret data in transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments where it doesn't mention to modify the original sequence, but others hide data in non-transcribed deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid,</b> non-translated ribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> regions, or active coding segments. Unfortunately, these schemes either alter the functionalities or modify the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences.</b> As a result, how to embed the secret data into the deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> without altering the functionalities and to have the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> be able to be retrieved is worthy of investigating. This paper applies reversible information hiding scheme on deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> by using the reversible contrast mapping technique. The reversible property makes the secret data hidden in anywhere in deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> without altering the functionalities because the original deoxyribo <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> can be recovered exactly in our scheme...|$|R
