5|$|On {{the night}} of 20 June, two armed Protestant corps coming from Montbéliard and Neuchâtel were {{travelling}} to Besançon. However, some of the troops from the Neuchâtel group decided to abandon the battle, as their request for extra pay had been denied. The other soldiers continued upstream. The remaining soldiers from Neuchâtel {{got into a fight}} with the inhabitants of Morteau; after a fierce battle, they were forced to retreat. After waiting for the group from Neuchâtel, which could not be found, Capitaine Paul de Beaujeu decided to continue with the plan. By midnight, the soldiers had reached Palente, and they hid in the forests of Chalezeule while establishing a plan of attack. With the help of a dozen small boats laid end-to-end, the soldiers crossed the Doubs. To continue the attack, the soldiers would <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of the townspeople.|$|E

He says that they cannot defend against the ogre army {{on their own and}} they <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of Gaston's kingdom and that Belle will have to marry Gaston to obtain their help. Gaston arrives and proposes to Belle, and Belle reluctantly agrees, as she believes {{it is the only way}} to save the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Sacagawea was {{pregnant}} with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–05. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers {{who might be able}} to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter because they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, and they knew they would <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of Shoshone tribes at the headwaters of the Missouri.|$|E

25|$|The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio {{that serve}} as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have {{forbidden}} Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined {{to be a great}} leader as well. To return safely, she will now <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild and a Healer. Story believes Heep to be her Guardian; Heep asks Farber, a West Coast émigré turned film critic, to help him figure out the others' identities. Working off movie tropes, Farber misadvises Heep, leading him to a flawed conclusion that Dury is the Symbolist, the smokers are the Guild, and Bell is the Healer.|$|E
500|$|After being re-elected, Bush {{signed into}} law a Medicare drug benefit program that, {{according}} to Jan Crawford, resulted in [...] "the greatest expansion in America's welfare state in forty years;" [...] the bill's costs approached $7trillion. In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about sixmillion to tenmillion children. It was to be funded {{by an increase in}} the cigarette tax. Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care, and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{governing}} leftist parties went to {{the polls}} divided. The political right, on the other hand, formed the Union of the Right (...) which incorporated CEDA, agrarian parties and traditionalists. It stood on a three-point programme: religious and social reforms would be examined and rolled back where needed; agrarian reform would be reversed; political prisoners would be released. These parties threw vast resources into their campaign, with ten million leaflets, 300,000 posters, radio and cinema addresses and aerial propaganda drops. They called upon Catholics to defend order and religion against the bourgeois Republic. The Radical Party campaigned primarily against the Socialists, since they would <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of the political right if in government. They used mass-appeal slogans such as 'Republic, order, freedom, social justice, amnesty' and were confident following successes at municipal level in 1933. Anarchists such as the CNT-FAI called for absention: politicians were 'vultures', who must be overthrown by revolution. If the right were to win the election, there would be an uprising, they promised. Thus, anarchists should avoid voting for the left, since overthrowing the government would be preferable. Abstention was [...] supported by Benito Pábon and Miguel Abós.|$|E

Dying, broken and bloody, he is healed by Roma, who fixes the arcane circuitry in his costume to match his body's frequencies. She also removes the [...] "blunder factor" [...] she had secretly cast over him (a curse she had cast ensuring that he would <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of the entire team until he saw the innate value in it). The evil members of R.C.X. are cleared out in a joint effort by Excalibur and the members of an internal mutiny.|$|E
2500|$|Other studies provide {{evidence}} that adoptive relationships can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes, [...] "...adoptive parents enrich their children's lives {{to compensate for the}} lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption." [...] Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because they favor them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Keaton began {{studying}} acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. She initially studied acting under the Meisner technique, an ensemble acting technique first {{evolved in the}} 1930s by Sanford Meisner, a New York stage actor/acting coach/director {{who had been a}} member of The Group Theater (1931–1940). She has described her acting technique as, [...] " [...] only as good as the person you're acting with ... As opposed to going it on my own and forging my path to create a wonderful performance without the help of anyone. I always <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of everyone!" [...] According to Jack Nicholson, [...] "She approaches a script sort of like a play in that she has the entire script memorized before you start doing the movie, which I don't know any other actors doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harding {{is first}} {{recorded}} in May 1751 {{when he played}} for All-England v Kent at the Artillery Ground. [...] All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution. [...] Although he had been picked as a bowler, he and [...] "A N Other" [...] (an unnamed Chertsey player) opened All-England's second innings and scored 51 for the first wicket, which is like a double century partnership nowadays. [...] Harding apparently made 50 of these himself and had one hit {{out of the ground}} and against a house on Bunhill Row opposite. [...] He was given four for this mighty effort. [...] You could only score six if you were actually able to run that many and to do that you would <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of overthrows.|$|E
2500|$|Callas's {{relationship}} with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her {{season at the}} Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's La traviata and in Macbeth, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of Medea in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of [...] "Bing Fires Callas" [...] appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled, [...] "That night, {{she came to the}} theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of every one of you.' Well, she proceeded to give a performance [...] that was historical." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § XXI. We need not, however, {{hope to be}} able to imitate, {{in general}} work, any of the subtly {{combined}} curvatures of nature's highest designing: on the contrary, their extreme refinement renders them unfit for coarse service or material. Lines which are lovely in the pearly film of the Nautilus shell, are lost in the grey roughness of stone; and those which are sublime in the blue of far away hills, are weak in the substance of incumbent marble. Of all the graceful lines assembled on Plate VII., we shall do well to be content with two of the simplest. We shall take one mountain line (e g) and one leaf line (u w), or rather fragments of them, for we shall perhaps not want them all. I will mark off from u w the little bit x y, and from e g the piece e f; both which appear to me likely to be serviceable: and if hereafter we <b>need</b> <b>the</b> <b>help</b> of any abstract lines, we will see what we can do with these only.|$|E
