50|$|Other migrant {{groups were}} limited in number by the <b>National</b> Origins <b>quota</b> system, which {{designated}} <b>national</b> <b>quotas</b> based on census ratios from 1890. These ratios heavily favored Western European nations and older migrant groups, {{such as the}} English, Irish, and Germans. The ratios attempted to limit the rising number of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. The <b>National</b> Origins <b>quota</b> system provided limited family reunification {{as a means for}} chain migration and placed a preference on naturalization. If an immigrant became a U.S. citizen, he or she had the ability obtain non-quota visas for more family members, but as a resident that number was capped annually. Additionally, the Immigration Act of 1924 formally opened the door to chain migration from the entire western hemisphere, placing that group under non-quota status.|$|R
40|$|The European Union sugar policies, {{in place}} for over 49 years, {{underwent}} a first major reform in 2005, yielding to mounting pressures coming from the EU 2004 enlargement, the recent EBA initiative to least developed countries and the recent WTO-panel ruling on EU sugar export subsidies. The reform package consists of lowering administrative prices as well as modifying the structure of production quotas leading to lower sugar production and bringing down subsidized export to within WTO limits. However, these reforms do not address other components of the EU sugar policies such as non-preferential tariffs, <b>quota</b> <b>reallocation</b> across regions, or opening up the competitive structure of the EU sugar industry. This {{makes it difficult to}} assess the economic and trade implications of the reform package. This paper offers a dual-modeling approach to examine the impact of the EU sugar policy reform on sugar production and prices in the EU, and the trade implications for third countries with particular distinction between preferential and non-preferential exporters.

40|$|The {{marketing}} of table eggs, broiler hatching eggs, chickens, and turkeys in Canada {{is limited by}} federal and provincial supply management (SM) legislation through production <b>quotas.</b> The respective <b>national</b> regulatory agencies {{in each of these}} industries allocate, among the provinces, growth in <b>national</b> <b>quotas</b> called "overbase. " Federal legislation stipulates that the allocation of overbase among provinces must take into account the principle of comparative advantage (CA) of production. None of the agencies pertaining to the feather industry has ever identified and applied CA in <b>national</b> <b>quota</b> allocation decisions. To fill this void, we modify the "revealed comparative advantage" approach developed by Balassa and Bowen to identify CA and develop a provincial agricultural CA index to assign overbase allocations among provinces. Overbase quota allocations should shift toward the agriculturally intensive Prairie provinces that have a CA in the Canadian feather industry and away from the nonagricultural industry-intensive provinces. Our method of SM overbase quota allocation is consistent with the objectives of Canadian SM legislation. " Copyright (c) 2008 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{commercial}} trade in three reptile species harvested for different purposes in western Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) for international markets: (1) Tokay geckos, Gekko gecko, traded for medicinal uses, (2) Javan filesnakes, Acrochordus javanicus, harvested for skins, and (3) Asiatic softshell turtles, Amyda cartilaginea, harvested for meat; each species is also exploited for the pet trade, but to a lesser extent. All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, {{but there is a}} national harvest and export quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the quota allocated by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1. 2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the <b>national</b> <b>quota</b> of 50, 000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD / year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005 – 6) was estimated at around 300, 000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30, 000 from Sumatra, exceeding the <b>national</b> <b>quota</b> of 200, 000 individuals / year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD / year. The trade in A. cartilaginea was monitored in three cities in North Sumatra and Riau in 1999 : 200 – 450, 000 individuals were traded in 1998 and 1999, greatly exceeding the <b>national</b> <b>quota</b> of 10, 000, with a monetary value for exporters in excess of ten million USD / year.
