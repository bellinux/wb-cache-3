5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves {{in order to be}} regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
25|$|Before ERISA, some {{defined benefit}} pension plans {{required}} decades of service before an employee's benefit became vested. It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> plan to provide no benefit {{at all to}} an employee who left employment before the specified retirement age (e.g. 65), regardless {{of the length of}} the employee's service.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{many were}} bought by boroughs (burghs). In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> borough to {{purchase}} the heerlijkheden around {{it in order to}} gain control and ownership of the surrounding land and the resulting economic advantages. Boroughs were themselves not part of the manorial system: the countryside and villages were governed by lords, whereas boroughs were self-governing.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the species, the {{gestation}} period is 35-58 days. The average litter is 3-4 newborns for larger species and 5-6 <b>for</b> smaller ones. <b>As</b> with many animals, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> adult male hedgehog to kill newborn males.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{electronics}} student, {{on hearing}} {{some of the}} specs of these devices, to conclude {{that they could not}} have been capable of reproducing speech. Yet they do, and with a sound that can not be mistaken for anything else.|$|R
50|$|Only the {{designated}} registrar may modify or delete information about domain names {{in a central}} registry database. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> end user to switch registrars, invoking a domain transfer process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies.|$|R
25|$|At {{any given}} year -should the Indios {{make it to the}} PRBL tournament playoffs- {{attendance}} to the team's baseball park and post-game celebrations tend to be particularly high because they usually coincide with the celebration of the patron saint feasts (fiestas patronales) for the city of Mayagüez; it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> championship game to coincide with Candlemas (2 February) or Candlemas Eve.|$|E
25|$|When {{the weather}} gets colder, {{and the water}} {{temperature}} drops below 15 C (60 F), smallmouth will often migrate in search of deeper pools in which they enter a semi-hybernation state, moving sluggishly and feeding very little until the warm season returns. The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked and it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smallmouth to travel 12 miles {{in a single day}} in a stream, creek or river. The overall migration can exceed 60 miles.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> noble {{to amass}} {{a number of}} heerlijkheden. Queen Beatrix is a modern-day example of a noblewoman who holds the titles to many heerlijkheden. In {{addition}} to her primary titles, she is the Erfvrouwe and Vrijvrouwe of Ameland and the Vrouwe of Baarn, Besançon, Borculo, Bredevoort, Bütgenbach, Daasburg, Geertruidenberg, Heiloo, Upper and Lower Zwaluwe, Klundert, Lichtenvoorde, Loo, Montfort, Naaldwijk, Niervaart, Polanen, Steenbergen, Sint Maartensdijk, Sint Vith, Soest, Ter Eem, Turnhout, Willemstad and Zevenbergen.|$|E
5000|$|Fisher told {{a hunting}} mate {{that he was}} {{renewing}} his commitment to his faith and marriage because he [...] "could not live without his family", possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent.|$|R
50|$|Control points {{should be}} close together, large and very easy (f.ex. trail junctions). The path should be along linear features, like trails, roads and stone walls. No compass needed. No route choice necessary. The most common {{complaint}} {{is that the}} white course was too hard. It's <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> 8-year-old {{to be doing the}} course on their own. Especially the first controls should be easy.|$|R
25|$|Acoustic 5-string violins are {{becoming}} more common, and it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> electric violin to have 5, 6, 7 or more strings. The typical solid body also accommodates the extra tension caused by more strings without stressing the instrument too much. The extra strings are usually a low C string <b>for</b> 5-strings, <b>a</b> low C and low F <b>for</b> 6, and <b>a</b> low C, F and B for 7.|$|R
25|$|Only one {{engine was}} {{produced}} {{before the end}} of the war, as the factory was busy with the vibration and other problems with the Arab engine, and it was very nearly cancelled. As was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Sunbeam engine, it was only ever fitted to a single aircraft for trials, a Short 184 seaplane, and never went into production. After the war and Sunbeam's financial problems in the war-surplus glutted aero-engine market, they were offered to the less-critical powerboat market, again not an unusual move for Sunbeam. 840 had been ordered during the war, but only 13 were delivered before cancellation of the order.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{important}} and certainly most popular night of Selichot in the Ashkenazi tradition is the first night, when many women and girls as well as men and boys attend the late-night service on Saturday night. In some communities, the hazzan wears a kittel and sings elaborate melodies. In some congregations, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> choir to participate in this first night's service. In the Eastern Ashkenazic tradition, this night also has more Selichot than any other night prior to Rosh Hashanah eve. The other nights are more sparsely attended and those services are often led by a layperson, rather than a trained musician, and with melodies that are less elaborate than the first night.|$|E
25|$|In what {{is viewed}} as the largely secular nature of Japanese culture has {{resulted}} in heavy usage of themes, symbols, and characters taken {{from a variety of}} religions, including Christianity and Japanese Shinto. This tends to be problematic when JRPGs are exported to Western countries where the topics of religion and blasphemy remain sensitive, such as the United States. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> JRPG to exhibit elements that would be controversial in the West, such as Xenogears or Final Fantasy Tactics featuring antagonists that bear similarities to the Abrahamic God and the Catholic Church, respectively; and Nintendo has made efforts in the past to remove references such as these prior to introducing their games into the North American market.|$|E
2500|$|The Akita is {{generally}} seen as territorial about its property, {{and can be}} reserved with strangers. It is sometimes described as feline in its actions; it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Akita to clean its face after eating, to preen its kennel mate, and to be fastidious in the house. [...] They {{are known to be}} intolerant of other dogs of the same sex, as stated in the AKC breed standard.|$|R
5000|$|Infiltration and {{exfiltration}} in mountainous terrains {{in summer}} {{as well as}} in winter conditions. This requires experience and knowledge of orientation, meteorology, and mountaineering skills. This type of environment, with often-harsh winter conditions, requires training with specialized equipment as well as tactical skills and knowledge about communication possibilities and limitations specific to mountain terrains. Traversing on skis during the night with heavy loads is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> SF operator.|$|R
6000|$|The ape-man {{knew that}} he might expect an {{immediate}} attack {{on the part of}} that particular surviving bull-ape who felt himself best fitted to contend for the kingship of the tribe. [...] Among his own apes he knew that it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> entire stranger to enter a community and, after having dispatched the king, assume the leadership of the tribe himself, together with the fallen monarch's mates.|$|R
25|$|Richthofen was now {{performing}} {{the duties of}} a lieutenant colonel (a wing commander in modern British Air Force terms), although he remained a captain. The system in the British army was for an officer to hold the rank appropriate to his level of command, if only on a temporary basis, {{even if he had}} not been formally promoted. In the German army, it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wartime officer to hold a lower rank than his duties implied; German officers were promoted according to a schedule and not by battlefield promotion. For instance, Erwin Rommel commanded an infantry battalion as a captain in 1917 and 1918. It was also the custom for a son not to hold a higher rank than his father, and Richthofen's father was a reserve major.|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dust trail to linger in the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|Critical to Pan Am's {{success as}} an airline was the {{proficiency}} of its flight crews, who were rigorously trained in long-distance flight, seaplane anchorage and berthing operations, over-water navigation, radio procedure, aircraft repair, and marine tides. During the day, {{use of the}} compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure; at night, all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation. In bad weather, pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns, making successful landings at fogged-in harbors by landing out to sea, then taxiing the plane into port. Many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates. A Pan Am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic, steadily gaining his licenses and working {{his way up the}} flight crew roster to navigator, second officer, and first officer. Before World War II it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> captain to make engine repairs at remote locations.|$|E
50|$|Credible boxers Attell fought {{near the}} end of his career {{included}} Frankie Britt, and Johnny Kilbane in March 1911, who would fight Abe Attell for the featherweight championship one year later. He fought the lesser known Patsy Brannigan and Ad Zotte several times. Tellingly, though <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> aging boxer in the era, Attell lost nineteen of twenty-four bouts between February 7, 1912, and October 30, 1916, {{near the end}} of his boxing career.|$|R
50|$|Archivists {{are often}} {{educators}} as well; it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> archivist employed {{at a university}} or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or outreach programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as exhibitions, promotional events, or even media coverage.|$|R
25|$|In captivity, {{they can}} be seen to be {{constantly}} playing, vocalizing, and swimming around each other. They show a great deal of curiosity towards humans and frequently approach the windows in the tanks to observe them. Belugas may also playfully spit at humans or other whales. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> aquarium handler to be drenched by one of his charges. Some researchers believe spitting originated with blowing sand away from crustaceans at the sea bottom.|$|R
500|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pivotal {{battle of}} this era to be {{difficult}} to document. Similar difficulties exist with the Battle of Waterloo or battles of the War of 1812 in North America, while [...] the Battle of Borodino offers its own particular challenges to accuracy. Modern historian Adam Zamoyski noted: [...] "No other campaign in history has been subjected to such overtly political uses." ...|$|E
500|$|Volvopluteus gloicephalus is a saprotrophic {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} {{on the ground}} in gardens, grassy fields, both in and outside forest areas, and on accumulations of vegetable matter like compost or woodchips piles. It has also been reported fruiting in greenhouses. In China, it grows in bamboo thickets. It usually fruits in groups of several basidiocarps {{but it can also be}} found growing solitary. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> season of [...] "spectacular" [...] fruiting to be followed by several years with no appearance of the mushroom.|$|E
500|$|As cadets {{progress}} through the program, they are given additional responsibility for scheduling, teaching, guiding and commanding the other cadets in their units. They also assist their senior staff in executing the Cadet Program. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cadet officer to command an encampment of hundreds of junior Cadets. Cadets are given many opportunities to lead and to follow; they may hold leadership positions at squadron and wing activities, and are often involved in planning these activities. Cadets may complete paperwork, command other cadets, and teach at weekly meetings and at weekend and summer events. The U.S. Congress stated in the Recruiting, Retention, and Reservist Promotion Act of 2000 that CAP and similar programs [...] "provide significant benefits for the Armed Forces, including significant public relations benefits".|$|E
5000|$|Dandolo's {{blindness}} {{appears to}} have been total. Writing thirty years later, Geoffrey de Villehardouin, who had known Dandolo personally, stated, [...] "Although his eyes appeared normal, he could not see a hand in front of his face, having lost his sight after a head wound." [...] In the Middle Ages it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> elderly person to become blind as a result of cataracts. However, all sources for Dandolo's blindness remark on the clarity of his eyes.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{characteristic}} answer, but Weston {{was satisfied with}} it. He had discovered that if {{the men of the}} Pacific Slope were occasionally a trifle assertive and what he called flamboyant in their conversation, they nevertheless, as a rule, meant just what they said. It is, of course, <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> imaginative person to describe what he intends to do in dramatic periods, but while some people are wisely content with that, the western bushman generally can be depended on to carry out the purpose.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} of a speaker is presided over by the Clerk of the House. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> election to be contested. If there are two candidates, members vote in the lobbies for their preferred candidate. In the case of three or more candidates, a roll-call vote is conducted and the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated, with the process continuing (or reverting to a two-way run-off) until one candidate has a majority. Members may vote {{only if they are}} present in person: no proxy votes are permitted.|$|R
500|$|Between 1953 and 2003, the {{championship}} was normally earned in round-robin regular-season play among all conference members, although in earlier years league teams did not typically play every possible ACC opponent. The league did not employ tiebreaking procedures, such as head-to-head results, {{to determine a}} single champion, and thus it was <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> season to end with [...] "co-champions." [...] With a 2004 expansion of the league to include Miami and Virginia Tech, round-robin play became impossible due to an NCAA limit {{on the number of}} games a team may play during the season and the unwillingness of the league to hold more than eight conference games per season per team. NCAA rules also forbade a championship game due to the league having only 11 members.|$|E
500|$|Breeding females {{begin to}} build their nests {{in the spring and}} {{construct}} domed structures composed of spider webs, fine grasses, thistle-down, and vegetable-down, typically [...] tall and [...] thick. Each nest has a small entrance on one side and they are normally placed in thick shrubs close to the ground. A clutch of 3–4eggs is generally laid anywhere from September to January, with incubation lasting around 14days. The white-winged fairywren generally breeds in the spring in the southwest of Western Australia, but is more opportunistic in arid regions of central and northern Australia, with breeding recorded almost any month after a period of rainfall. Incubation is by the breeding female alone, while the breeding male (a brown or blue male) and nest helpers aid in feeding the nestlings and removing their fecal sacs. The newly hatched nestlings are altricial, gaping immediately for food, and developing downy feather tracts and opening their eyes by the third or fourth day. Nestlings remain in the nest for 10–11days, and fledglings continue to be fed for 3–4weeks following their departure from the nest. Fledglings then either stay on to help raise the next brood or move to a nearby territory. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pair bond to hatch and raise two broods in one breeding season, and helpers tend to lessen the stress on the breeding female rather than increase the overall number of feedings. Like other fairywrens, the white-winged fairywren is particularly prone to parasitic nesting by the Horsfield's bronze cuckoo (Chalcites basalis). Parasitism by the shining bronze cuckoo (C. lucidus) and black-eared cuckoo (C. osculans) is rarely recorded.|$|E
2500|$|The goalkeeper has {{the main}} role in {{blocking}} shots against the goal {{as well as}} guiding and informing their defense of imposing threats and gaps in the defense. The goalkeeper is also the [...] "quarterback", {{as he or she}} usually begins the offensive play. It is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> goalie to make the assisting pass to a goal on a break away.|$|E
50|$|The Information Governance Maturity Model {{will assist}} an {{organization}} in conducting a preliminary evaluation of its recordkeeping programs and practices. Thoughtful {{consideration of the}} organization's practices should allow users to make an initial determination of the maturity of their organization’s information governance. Initially, it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> organization to be at differing levels of maturity for the eight principles. It {{is also important to}} note that the maturity model represents an initial evaluation. In order to be most effective, a more in-depth analysis of organizational policies and practices may be necessary.|$|R
2500|$|Fisher told {{a hunting}} mate {{that he was}} {{renewing}} his commitment to his faith and marriage because he [...] "could not live without his family", possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce. According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> individual traumatized by divorce while an adolescent. In the weeks before her death, Mary told several friends {{that she was going}} to divorce Fisher. According to a neighbor of theirs, they had a loud argument on April 9, at 10:30pm, approximately ten hours before their house blew up in an explosion.|$|R
50|$|Boilies and {{luncheon meat}} are {{generally}} avoided by roach {{because they are}} too large for roaches to swallow. It is a schooling species, and it is <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> individual to be caught and released many times during a single session. Sometimes, a larger specimen can be waiting outside the shoal. Roach are infamous {{for their ability to}} throw the hook during retrieval, which perpetuates the idea that larger roach are notoriously difficult to bank. The maximum recorded weight for the species in Britain is 4 lb. Any fish over a pound is regarded as a specimen individual.|$|R
