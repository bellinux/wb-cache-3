5|$|Colt's {{first two}} {{business}} ventures were producing firearms in Paterson, New Jersey and making underwater mines; both ended in disappointment. But his business expanded rapidly after 1847, when the Texas Rangers ordered 1,000 revolvers during the American war with Mexico. During the American Civil War, his factory in Hartford supplied firearms {{both to the}} <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South.</b> Later, his firearms were prominent during the settling of the western frontier. Colt died in 1862 {{as one of the}} wealthiest men in America.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both from the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from a war between the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E
5|$|SH-58 was {{originally}} {{a part of}} US-164. When US-164 was decommissioned in 1930, {{a section of the}} road in Major County that was left without a designation became SH-58.

5|$|Around {{the year}} 1850, the Kalapuya {{numbered}} between 2,000 and 3,000 and were distributed among several groups. These figures are only speculative; {{there may have}} been as few as eight subgroups or as many as 16. In that time period, the Clackamas' tribal population was roughly 1,800. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the Chinook population was nearly 5,000, though not all of the Chinook lived on the Willamette. The Chinook territory encompassed the lower Columbia River valley and significant stretches of the Pacific coast on both the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> side of the Columbia's mouth. At times, however, the Chinook territory extended even farther south in the Willamette Valley. The total native population was estimated at about 15,000.|$|E
5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct taxes than the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E

The City Corporation also objected, concerned about potential damage to buildings close to the route caused by subsidence as was experienced during {{the construction of the}} C The Dean and Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral objected, concerned about the risks of undermining the cathedral's foundations. Sir Joseph Bazalgette objected that the tunnels would damage the city's sewer system.

5|$|To {{the east}} of the house a series of {{terraces}} leads down to the Fish Pond. The retaining walls {{at the southern end of}} the upper terrace are listed at GradeII, as are the retaining walls at the end of the upper terrace and the steps leading down to the middle terrace. Stretching along the middle terrace is a long rectangular pool containing a three fountains. The retaining walls of this pool are listed at GradeII, as are the railings on the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> side of the terrace. On each side of the pool are two compartments framed by yew hedges. Between these compartments, on each side, is a statue by Raymond Smith.

5|$|While the Chinese {{were making}} a {{concentrated}} attack against the South Korean front, the North Korean forces that had infiltrated the UN rear were cutting the South Korean withdrawal route. In {{the days before the}} Chinese Third Phase Campaign, the KPA II Corps established a major roadblock to the north of Hoengsong with an estimated strength of 10,000 soldiers, which blocked the retreat of the ROK III Corps. In response, the ROK II Corps and the US 2nd Infantry Division conducted a siege operation against the roadblock from both the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south,</b> and the roadblock was forced open by January 2. Although the UN forces managed to eliminate a North Korean division at the roadblock, the ROK II Corps was nearly destroyed during the fighting, and it was disbanded on January 10.|$|E

5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides of}} other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during the}} auto trail era, the modern US23 also {{coincided with the}} east branch of the Dixie Highway {{and part of the}} Lower Peninsula section of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway. The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he {{developed}} the Lincoln Highway. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> after the American Civil War. At the urging of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US23 north of Standish. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. In Michigan, it also followed US23 north of Standish.|$|E

5|$|Madhavan {{is one of}} the few {{actors in}} India who garners pan-Indian appeal, with his success in {{establishing}} himself in the <b>North</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Indian film industries, seeing him receive multiple offers as a brand ambassador. Furthermore, it has led to producers offering him lead roles in bilingual films such as the English-Malayalam crossover film Nothing But Life and the Hindi-Tamil projects, Yavarum Nalam and Irudhi Suttru. Moreover, most of his Tamil films are dubbed into Telugu, where he has created a box office market without appearing in a single straight Telugu film as a lead actor. Madhavan holds a significant female fan following, which developed after his romantic roles in Alaipayuthey and Minnale. Madhavan has also been active in keeping in contact with fans, maintaining a fan email account, a Facebook fan page and a Twitter account as well as being one of the first actors of Tamil films to turn blogger with entries in the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south.</b> A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a barrier to the reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both the <b>north</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
