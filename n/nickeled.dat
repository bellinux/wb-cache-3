2500|$|In 1852 the Hartschiere got new uniforms {{with white}} supra vests over their jackets and helmets {{instead of the}} former caps, made of <b>nickeled</b> tin and gilded cast brass.

40|$|The general {{population}} may {{be exposed to}} <b>nickel</b> in ambient air, food, and water. General populations may also be exposed through inhalation of cigarette smoke. Widespread exposure may occur through dermal contact with coins and jewelry containing <b>nickel</b> alloys or <b>nickel</b> plating. Occupational Populations Occupational exposure to <b>nickel</b> may occur by dermal contact or by inhalation of aerosols, dusts, fumes, or mists containing <b>nickel.</b> Dermal contact may also occur with <b>nickel</b> solutions, such as those used in electroplating. Occupational exposure to <b>nickel</b> will be highest for those involved in production, processing, and use of <b>nickel.</b> Operations with the highest airborne concentrations of <b>nickel</b> are those involved in grinding, welding, and handling powders. Toxicokinetics In humans, about 20 – 35 % of inhaled <b>nickel</b> deposited in the lungs is absorbed into the bloodstream. About 27 % of <b>nickel</b> in drinking water is absorbed in humans; much less <b>nickel</b> (about 1 %) is absorbed from food.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study {{the influence of the}} occupational <b>nickel</b> exposure on the concentration of <b>nickel</b> in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine. Plasma, urine and biopsy specimens of nasal mucosa from 318 <b>nickel</b> workers, 15 retired <b>nickel</b> workers and 57 non-exposed controls were analyzed for <b>nickel</b> by atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that <b>nickel</b> exposure led significantly to raised <b>nickel</b> concentration in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine both in active and retired <b>nickel</b> workers. The average <b>nickel</b> concentration in the nasal mucosa was highest in workers exposed to the highest atmospheric <b>nickel</b> concentration, inhaled as <b>nickel</b> subsulphide and oxide dust. Workers exposed to aerosols of <b>nickel</b> chloride and sulphate at a lower atmospheric <b>nickel</b> concentation had, on the other hand, the highest mean <b>nickel</b> concentration in plasma and urine. The mucosal, plasma and urine <b>nickel</b> concentration were significantly corre lated to duration of <b>nickel</b> exposure.
