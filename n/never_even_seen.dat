25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed instruction manuals had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon that not only did few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not even know that it existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastian Coe, former Olympic gold {{medalist}} {{and chairman of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics Organising Committee, was at the stadium during the 4 × 400 m women's relay and described the audience's cheers for the racers as [...] "potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who'd <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, {{but it has to be}} done." ...|$|E

This ending, along with some selfish and anti-community {{behavior}} on the part of Qiu Ju and her husband expresses the difficulty of regarding the film as a simple fight against injustice. Rather, it shows the limitations of modern legal approaches in villages where old-style human relations underlie social life.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressures}} {{of these kids}} mirror those of a major league baseball team on any given day. On most days these kids are playing in front of crowds of 45,000 people who are hanging onto their every pitch. This is more fans than some major league teams can only dream about having in their own stadiums. Most of the star pitchers are throwing about 200 pitches on short rest {{which is something that}} you will <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>see</b> anymore in the major leagues.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] {{arrived in}} Britain late in 1907 having <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> a match played {{under the new}} Northern Union laws. They {{undertook}} a week's intensive coaching in Leeds to bring them up to speed, and after playing a number of touring matches the first true rugby league test was played, with the team going down 8–9 to Wales in Aberdare on 1 January 1908. The All Golds gained revenge however, defeating the full Great Britain side {{in two of the}} three Test matches, which were played at Leeds, Chelsea and Cheltenham; a surprising choice of venues given rugby league's northern base. The tour was a great success, and gave a much needed boost to the game in Britain, which was struggling financially against the rise of association football.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, she closes her eyes. She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
2500|$|As {{intended}} by Ribbentrop, the narrow time limit for {{acceptance of the}} [...] "final offer" [...] {{made it impossible for}} the British government to contact the Polish government in time about the German offer, let alone for the Poles to arrange for a Polish plenipotentiary envoy to arrive in Berlin that night, thereby allowing Ribbentrop to claim that the Poles had rejected the German [...] "final offer". As it was, a special meeting of the British cabinet called to consider the [...] "final offer", they declined to pass on the message to Warsaw under the grounds this was not a serious proposal on the part of Berlin. The [...] "rejection" [...] of the German proposal was one of the pretexts used for the German aggression against Poland on 1 September 1939. The British historian D.C. Watt wrote [...] "Two hours later, Berlin Radio broadcast the sixteen points, adding that Poland had rejected them. Thanks to Ribbentrop, they had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> them". On 31 August, Ribbentrop met with Ambassador Attolico to tell him that Poland's [...] "rejection" [...] of the [...] "generous" [...] German 16-point peace plan meant that Germany had no interest in Mussolini's offer to call a conference about the status of Danzig. Besides the Polish [...] "rejection" [...] of the German [...] "final offer", the aggression against Poland was justified with the Gleiwitz incident and other SS-staged incidents on the German–Polish border.|$|E
5000|$|Testament {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the few critics {{who got the}} opportunity to see it. Testament currently maintains an 86% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews. Critic Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film a rare four stars out of four, and was highly enthusiastic about the film. Ebert said that the film was powerful and made him cry, even after the second time he watched it. Ebert wrote: [...] "The film is about a suburban American family, and what happens to that family after a nuclear war. It is not a science-fiction movie, and it doesn't have any special effects, and there are no big scenes of buildings blowing over or people disintegrating. We <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>see</b> a mushroom cloud. We <b>never</b> <b>even</b> know who started the war. Instead, [...] "Testament" [...] is a tragedy about manners: It asks how we might act toward one another, how our values might stand up, {{in the face of an}} overwhelming catastrophe." ...|$|R

The Confederate colonel was therefore powerless to return him. Nevertheless, the presumed murder of Alsman was viewed as part of a pattern of extralegal behavior regarded by Porters enemies as typical of his command, tolerated if not encouraged by the Rebel leader.|$|R
5000|$|Bluewater has {{received}} criticism from some former contract workers, content creators and bloggers {{alleging that the}} company is notorious for hiring young talent without ever paying them for their work. Rich Johnston's report at Bleeding Cool states, [...] "The company uses a number of free creators, working for no money at all, seeking exposure, who later wonder if they've been taken for a ride - especially if the work <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>sees</b> publication." [...] Bluewater Productions founder Davis issued a statement saying, [...] "Bluewater does not engage or condone any such underhanded or untoward activity and refutes each and every allegation made against the company and me personally. Much of the perceived conflict comes from a handful of creatives who became disenchanted over the terms of their signed agreements and mistakenly believe they are owed compensation." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 28 July—the {{day before}} the accident—Forrestal was resupplied with {{ordnance}} from the ammunition ship USS Diamond Head. The load included sixteen 1000-lb AN/M65A1 [...] "fat boy" [...] bombs (so nicknamed because of their short, rotund shape), which Diamond Head had picked up from the Naval Base Subic Bay and were intended for the next day's second bombing sortie. Some of the batch of AN-M65A1s Forrestal received {{were more than a}} decade old, having spent a portion of that exposed to the heat and humidity of Okinawa or Guam, eventually being improperly stored in open-air Quonset huts at a disused ammunition dump on the periphery of Subic Bay Naval Base. Unlike the thick-cased Mark 83 bombs filled with Composition H6, the AN/M65A1 bombs were thin-skinned and filled with Composition B, an older explosive with greater shock and heat sensitivity. Composition B also had the dangerous tendency to become more powerful (up to 50% by weight) and more sensitive if it was old or improperly stored. Forrestal's ordnance handlers had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>seen</b> an AN/M65A1 before, and to their shock, the bombs delivered from Diamond Head were in terrible condition; coated with [...] "decades of accumulated rust and grime" [...] and still in their original packing crates (now moldy and rotten); some were stamped with production dates as early as 1953. Most dangerous of all, several bombs were seen to be leaking liquid paraffin phlegmatizing agent from their seams, an unmistakable sign that the bomb's explosive filler had degenerated with excessive age, and exposure to heat and moisture.|$|E

60|$|Stephen Smith, who has {{hitherto}} {{been hidden}} from {{us by the}} darkness, was {{at this time of}} his life but a youth in appearance, and barely a man in years.

When I sent my men from Dorey to Amberbaki, they heard exactly the same story--that the rarer sorts were only found several days' journey in the interior, among rugged mountains, and that the skins were prepared by savage tribes who had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> been <b>seen</b> by any of the coast people.|$|R

40|$|From {{a general}} point of view, {{the concept of}} random {{variable}} is clearly fundamental {{to the field of}} statistics. Yet most introductory texts make almost no use of this idea, and those that do often use it in a way which creates problems in more advanced work. Moore (1995) relegates discussion of random variables to an optional section (Section 4. 2), so that many students will <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>see</b> the phrase. Those that do see it, however, are likely to be quite confused because Moore uses the term in two very different ways. The first of these indicates that a statistic is a random variable, and this certainly makes sense in light of the definition of random variable used by Moore (1995, 250) : “ [...] . a variable whose value is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon”. However, in the examples presented in Section 4. 2, Moore also suggests that data values can be associated with the random variable idea. The first example focuses on a distribution of grades in a class, with a grade represented by a numeric value, while the second deals with the distribution of the household size variable. Moore makes the connection to the random variable idea by observing that if students are selected randomly one after the other (or households in the second example), the grade observed for...|$|R

I obey orders, but I never see them carried out. I <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>see</b> the captives. They have done no harm, or, at most, one of their number has tried to escape, for which they are not to be blamed. I always have them shot, whether that is the mode of execution ordered or not. It is a soldier's death, and the one I should choose myself, and so that they are dead it can matter little to the sultan how they die. If they were all shot, {{as soon as they were}} taken, I should not think so much of it; but after being held captive for years, and compelled to work, it seems to me that their lives should be spared. As far as giving up my own life is concerned, I would willingly do it at the orders of the sultan, but these executions make me ill. I lose my appetite for weeks afterwards. Let us talk of something else." ...|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Jonathan Miller {{said of the}} U.S. Xbox 360 version: [...] "NBA 2K7 is a very {{impressive}} basketball title. The critically acclaimed gameplay has been improved, especially the defensive AI, yet other areas like defense still need some work. This game is as deep as sports games go, offering not only a great franchise mode but a wealth of options you may <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>see.</b> There are so many options that the game is great for hardcore simulation fans and arcade streetball fans alike. If you like basketball, you can't help but enjoy NBA 2K7. Moving forward, 2K needs to make player faces look like human beings, improve some suspect clock AI {{on the part of}} the CPU, and work on making on-the-ball defense fun. Still, this is a damn good basketball game and your best option on the 360 this season." [...] Mike Reilly of Game Revolution praised the Xbox 360 version's visuals, gameplay, depth, game modes, sound, online features, and realistic animations, but criticized the menus, calling them [...] "Confusing". [...] "NBA 2K7 is a pleasure to play, or just watch," [...] Reilly said. [...] "The load of modes and options will keep you easily entertained until next season, and the new animations and context-sensitive controls add a never-before-seen layer of realism, even if you have seen everything else before. If you have the cash, this is an easy bucket." ...|$|R
