Understanding the changing nature of knowledge workers in an industry-level analysis is helpful to formulate industry policy. This study aims to investigate the changing of knowledge workers in Taiwan 20 manufacturing industries during 1988 - 2005. Empirical results are shown as follows. First, there is a trend shift from non-knowledge workers to knowledge workers in all manufacturing industry. Second, based on the shift-share analysis, the within-industry effect on increasing knowledge workers is more than the between-industry effect, especially in electric & electronic machinery industry. Finally, both technological progress and international trade factors positively affect increasing knowledge workers, and the effect of the former is more than that of the later, based on regression analysis of fixed effect model...|$|R

40|$|The {{commercial}} aircraft manufacturing industry is {{starting a process}} of delocalization from developed to developing countries. From its original strongholds in the United States, Western Europe and Canada, it is now moving towards the largest <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>countries</b> of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The technology transfer channels include investment by multinational corporations, participation in global value chains, and outsourcing by large prime contractors based in North America and Western Europe. The process through which technological learning occurs has been studied in economics as international knowledge spillovers. In management, similar processes have been studied under outsourcing and global value chains. Drawing hypotheses from theory, the paper analyzes the patterns of trade, foreign direct investment and outsourcing in the global aircraft manufacturing industry. The evidence amassed shows that through these mechanisms, North American and Western European aircraft industries risk now losing their dominance to the developing countries. - multinational corporations, aircraft industry, modularity, value chain, spillovers...|$|E
40|$|Microeconomic {{reforms to}} raise Australia’s export {{competitiveness}} and to attract investment have lost momentum and political commitment. Australia’s international competitiveness ranks {{far below the}} big industrial economies and the more dynamic of the <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>countries</b> of the Asia-Pacific region. One important ingredient in Australia’s poor international competitiveness is high transaction cost. These costs were allowed to grow throughout a long era of protection, which was protection from the discipline of world-market competition. The costs of transacting business in Australia will only be lowered if the importance of institutions in determining these costs is explicitly acknowledged – {{along the lines of}} what is now taught by the “new institutional economies” – and if policy makers and the public engage in comprehensive institutional innovation. After many of the obvious microeconomic reforms were implemented in the 1980 s, a second round of reform is needed. This second round must to aim at those sectors and institutions that are not at the frontline of international competition, but that have great influence over business cost levels and hence the competitiveness of Australian exporters. Future economic growth and job creation in Australia will depend on it. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the degree to}} which the taste similarity (Linder) hypothesis explains trade patterns between the 'Four Tigers' East Asian <b>New</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Countries</b> (NICs), and their major OECD markets (and suppliers). The tests cover the period 1965 - 90, during which trade between these countries expanded at unprecedented rates. The tests employ an extensive disaggregated data set including all manufactured exports from the East Asian NICs to various major OECD markets. A new measure of trade intensity is employed, thus correcting a potentially critical bias affecting previous studies in this area. The results tend to support the applicability of the taste - differential (Linder) model as an important explainer of the changing pattern of trade for this sample of trade partners. The findings are generally consistent with other intertemporal studies (which 'neutralize' spatial effects on trade, such as Kennedy, T. and McHugh, R., Southern Economic Journal, 46 (3), 898 - 903, 1980); and support Hanink, D. (Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, 126 (2), 257 - 67, 1990) hypothesis that the Linder hypothesis may provide a relatively good explanation of trade for countries above some per capita income threshold, and for Linder's original (An Essay on Trade and Transformation, John Wiley, New York, 1961), and Grey, H.

40|$|The paper {{demonstrates}} that contemporary international migration is a constitutive {{part of the}} globalisation process. After defining the concepts of globalisation and the globalisation of migration, the author discusses six key themes, linking globalisation and international migration (“global cities”, the scale of migration; diversification of migration flows; globalisation of science and education; international migration and citizenship; emigrant communities and new identities). First, in accordance with Saskia Sassen’s analysis, the author rejects the wide-spread notion that unqualified migrants have lost an (important) role in »global cities«, i. e. in the centres of the new (global) economy. Namely, the post-modern service sector cannot function {{without the support of}} a wide range of auxiliary unqualified workers. Second, a critical comparison with traditional overseas mass migration to the USA at the turn of the 19 th and 20 th centuries indicates that present international migration is, perhaps, less extensive – however it is important to take into consideration various limitations that previously did not exist, and thus the present migration potential is in really greater. Third, globalisation is more evident in a diversification of the forms of migration: the source area of migrants to the New World and Europe has expanded to include new regions in the world; new immigration areas have arisen (the Middle East, <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>countries</b> of the Far East, South Europe); intra-regional migration has intensified. Forth, globalisation is linked to an increased migration of experts and the pessimistic notion of a brain drain has been replaced by the optimistic idea of a brain gain. Fifth, contemporary international migration has been associated with a crisis of the national model of citizenship. Sixth, the interlinking of (migrant) cultural communities regardless of distance and the physical proximity of cultural centres (the deterritorialisation of identity), as well as a hybridisation of cultural patterns, bring into question old notions of separate cultures in delimited areas. To sum up, the discussion of the mentioned themes supports the fundamental thesis of the paper, i. e. that international migration is a constitutive part of the process of globalisation...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{transformation}} {{patterns are}} examined {{to search for}} a systematic breakdown in the historical relationship between rising GDP and rising industrial labour force shares. Some older industrialised countries have considered focusing on knowledge and skill intensive activity as a new 2 ̆ 7 engine of growth 2 ̆ 7 in response to industrial employment decline, and stagnating incomes. Such new economic activity anticipates trade with industrialising countries, whose incomes would rise with industrialisation. This relationship is dependent on the persistence of labour-intensive specialisation in industrialising countries. Three trends might prevent prolonged specialisation: increased international competitiveness, rising capital-intensity in production, and international economic specialisation. Each of these is hypothesised to reduce <b>new</b> <b>industrial</b> labour force sizes and pay, thus reducing demand, and the multiplier effects of industrial activity. An examination of international industrial labour force levels, industrial GDP share, and GDP per capita over time indicates that industrial labour forces are smaller over time, and receive proportionally less of the income produced by this sector. Instead, labour in industrialising countries enters the service sector, whose GDP share is declining. A specific comparison of older <b>industrial</b> <b>countries</b> with <b>newer</b> post-industrial (deindustrialising) countries indicates that the industrial experience of the older <b>industrial</b> <b>countries</b> may have been unique, and that the role of industry in national and personal income growth is changing...|$|R
