25|$|On 27 May 2016, the Constitutional Court of Latvia {{overturned}} {{an administrative}} court decision which refused an application to register a same-sex {{marriage in the}} country. A Supreme Court press spokeswoman said that the court agrees with the administrative court that current regulations do not allow for same-sex marriages to be legally performed in Latvia.

Furthermore, {{it would have been}} impossible to conclude whether the applicants' rights were violated or <b>not</b> <b>unless</b> their claim is accepted and reviewed in a proper manner.

According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the most common way of obtaining recognition of burgher arms is by inclusion in the annually published Scandinavian Roll of Arms (Skandinavisk Vapenrulla), which was first published in 1963 and currently includes over 400 Swedish family coats of arms, along with arms from the other Scandinavian countries. Upon submission to the Swedish Heraldry Society, burgher arms are reviewed by the Swedish Collegium of Arms, whose decisions are published in the Scandinavian Roll of Arms. Approximately 3000 burgher arms are known today in Sweden. Swedish law protects [...] "arms of the nobility as well as civic bodies, while burgher arms are <b>not</b> , <b>unless</b> registered as a logotype." ...|$|E

[...] When American radio host Howard Stern mocked a Mortal Kombat fan who admitted that he masturbates to Mileena, Matt Helgeson of Game Informer called the latter [...] "insane" [...] as [...] "onanism and Mileena should not mix."

At the wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, he attempted to insist on a superior place to that of Prince Albert. The 50-years-younger prince settled things with what Albert described as a [...] "strong push", and carefully wrote his name on the certificate under the Queen's, so close to his wife's as to leave no space for the King's signature. The King apparently held no grudge, as he invited the Prince for a stroll in the park. When Albert demurred {{on the grounds that they}} might be jostled by crowds, the King replied, [...] "When I lived here I was quite as unpopular as you are and they never bothered me." [...] Shortly after the wedding, the King injured himself in a fall, with Albert writing to his brother, [...] "Happily he fell over some stones in Kew and damaged some ribs." [...] This injury spared him further contact with Victoria and Albert. During his visit, the King found time to take his place as Duke of Cumberland in the House of Lords. Victoria recorded in her journal that the King had stated when asked if he would speak in the Lords, [...] "No, I shall <b>not,</b> <b>unless</b> the Devil prompts me!" [...] The Queen also recorded that though King Ernest greatly enjoyed listening to the debates, he did not himself speak.|$|E

2500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{historically has}} been viewed as a private family matter that need not involve government or criminal justice intervention. Before the early 1970s, police in the United States favored a [...] "hands-off" [...] approach to domestic violence calls, with arrest only used as a last resort. At the time, domestic violence cases were typically classified as misdemeanor assault cases. During the 1970s, many U.S. jurisdictions did not authorize the police to make arrests in any misdemeanor assault, whether it involved a domestic partner or <b>not,</b> <b>unless</b> the assault occurred in the officer's presence. [...] A 1978 court order in New York City mandated that arrests only be made in cases of serious violence, thus officers instead made effort to mediate family disputes.|$|E

2500|$|Radix sort is an {{algorithm}} that sorts numbers by processing individual digits. n numbers {{consisting of}} k digits each are sorted in O(n · k) time. [...] Radix sort can process digits of each number either {{starting from the}} least significant digit (LSD) or starting from the most significant digit (MSD). [...] The LSD algorithm first sorts the list by the least significant digit while preserving their relative order using a stable sort. Then it sorts them by the next digit, and so on from the least significant to the most significant, ending up with a sorted list. While the LSD radix sort {{requires the use of}} a stable sort, the MSD radix sort algorithm does <b>not</b> (<b>unless</b> stable sorting is desired). [...] In-place MSD radix sort is not stable. [...] It is common for the counting sort algorithm to be used internally by the radix sort.

Hence the question no longer is as to whether perpetual peace is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must act on the supposition of its being real." [...] The presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was then a practical concern, for [...] "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does <b>not,</b> <b>unless</b> it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams..." ...|$|E
