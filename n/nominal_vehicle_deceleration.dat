Historically, safety monitoring has typically been carried out using accident data, though given the rarity of such events it is difficult to quickly detect change in accident risk at a particular site.

The method developed in this paper uses <b>vehicle</b> speeds and <b>decelerations</b> collected using standard in-situ loops and tubes, to determine conflicts using <b>vehicle</b> <b>decelerations</b> and to assess the possibility of automatic safety monitoring at Pelican crossings. Information on signal settings, driver crossing behaviour, pedestrian crossing behaviour and delays, and pedestrian-vehicle conflicts was collected synchronously through a combination of direct observation, video analysis, and analysis of output from tube and loop detectors.

40|$|Introduction {{of active}} safety systems {{has led to a}} {{significant}} increase of passenger car safety. However, statistics on road accidents show that further improvements of active systems would be necessary. This paper presents a dynamical model of the engine-car-brakes system that is used to simulate <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration</b> and calculate the risk of injuries. The model is used to quantify the performance of {{active safety systems}} during specific collision scenarios in which several vehicle cruising speeds and different values of distance from the obstacle that causes the active system activation are considered.

However, about 3, 600 people dead and 265, 000 people injured because of almost 187, 000 road accidents that occurred in Italy during 2012 prove that much {{still needs to be}} done. The new opportunities offered by mechatronics push R&D towards active safety systems, such as antilock braking system (ABS), traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC). Active safety systems are very interesting because they act before the collision event in order to avoid/limit the accident effects and, therefore, they contribute also to increase the effectiveness of any co-existing passive safety system.

To deal with safety threats most probably caused by the vehicle collisions in unsignalized intersections, concept of vehicle infrastructure cooperation provides a perspective and challenging solution to enable sufficient information interaction by V 2 V and V 2 I communication, which make it feasible to avoid collisions more autonomously. In vehicle collision avoidance scheme, decision making of vehicle braking control is crucial for emergent situations when safety alerts are not reacted by the driver. In this paper, a novel cooperative vehicle collision avoidance method based on particle swarm optimization is proposed, with an integrated fitness updating criteria considering both safety interval and relative continuity of <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration.</b> With a simulation analysis approach, the proposed collision avoiding solution is validated in a real road oriented scenario, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages to reduce collision and achieve safety assurance under cooperative vehicle infrastructure environment...|$|R

Speed adaptation is defined as the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration</b> to the speed of a slower moving preceding vehicle. Over-acceleration is defined as the vehicle acceleration occurring even if the preceding vehicle does not drive faster than the vehicle and the preceding vehicle additionally does not accelerate. In Kernerâs theory, the probability of over-acceleration is a discontinuous function of the vehicle speed: At the same vehicle density, probability of over-acceleration in free flow is greater than in synchronized flow. When within a local speed disturbance speed adaptation is stronger than over-acceleration, an F â S phase transition occurs. Otherwise, when over-acceleration is stronger than speed adaptation the initial disturbance decays over time. Within a region of synchronized flow, a strong over-acceleration is responsible for a return transition from synchronized flow to free flow (S â F transition).|$|R

In confirmation of prevalent perception, simulation-bascd results indicate that an NCAP test against a rigid barrier is a good representation of a collision between two similar cars approaching each other at a speed of 56. 3 kmph (35 mph) {{both in terms of}} peak deceleration and intrusions. However, analyses carried out for collisions between two incompatible vehicles, such as an Intrepid or Neon against a C 1500, point to the inability of the NCAP tests in representing the substantially higher intrusions in the front upper regions experienced by the cars, although peak decelerations in cars arc comparable to those observed in NCAP tests. In an attempt to improve the capability of a front NCAP test to better represent real-world crashes between incompatible vehicles, i. e., ones with contrasting ride height and lower body stiffness, two modified rigid barriers are studied.

During the deceleration, the time of peak deceleration occurred earlier in drivers with weak stereo vision. Stopping distance was greater in those lacking in stereo vision. A lack of stereo vision was associated with a more prudent brake behaviour, in which the driver took into account a larger safety margin. This compensation might be caused either by an unconscious adaptation of the human perceptuo-motor system, or by a systematic underestimation of distance remaining {{due to the lack of}} stereo vision.

July 27 - 29, 1998 This report {{documents the}} results of a series of tests in which several different types of performance-based brake testers (PBBTs) were compared side-by-side (i. e. a round robin test) in their ability to accurately measure brake forces (BFs) and wheel loads (WLs) of commercial vehicles (CVs), and to then predict the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration</b> capability for a 32. 2 km/hr on-road stopping test. The PBBTs consisted of five roller dynamometers (RD), two flat plate (FP) testers, and one breakaway torque tester (BTT). A PBBT that can also meet a set of functional specifications could be used for law enforcement by safety inspectors once performance-based criteria are codified. In the test program, specific ratios of BF to WL were imposed on both a 5 -axle combination tractor semi-trailer and a two-axle straight truck, in both the fully laden and unladen conditions. In each loading condition, the overall vehicle braking capability was set to achieve a proposed minimum requirement of 0. 4 g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. In addition, the brakes on specific individual wheels were set to provide a BF/WL of 0. 25 and 0. 35, for a steer and a non-steer wheel, respectively. The vehicles were also instrumented to record stopping distances and decelerations from on-road stopping tests performed from 32. 2 km/hr. In general, nearly all of the PBBTs were able to accurately measure the CVs' brake forces. Only one of the FP-type testers experienced erratic performance during the round robin. In contrast several of the PBBTs had difficulty in reporting the accurate gross vehicle weight. In some cases, particularly with the portable PBBTs the reported wheel loads for axles 2 and 4 (the lead axle on the tandem set) of the 5 -axle vehicle were very high, leading to an under-prediction of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>deceleration</b> capability. Calibration checks of the PBBT weighing mechanisms indicated that all could meet the functional specifications. As such, it was concluded that accounting for the redistribution of axle loads due to the vehicle suspension and the geometry of the PBBT ramp would require special test procedures or remote entry of vehicle or axle weights for use in law enforcement.
