25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier.

25|$|At 29, McQueen got a {{significant}} break when Frank Sinatra removed Sammy Davis, Jr., {{from the film}} <b>Never</b> <b>So</b> Few after Davis supposedly made some mildly negative remarks about Sinatra in a radio interview, and Davis' role went to McQueen.

25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was <b>never</b> <b>so</b> explicit again. It seems he was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E

She wrote, [...] "they will stick at nothing, be it <b>never</b> <b>so</b> wicked, if it will promote their interest... there may be foul play intended."

500|$|Writing for The New York Times, John Rockwell {{felt that}} it was an example of U2 {{stretching}} their range, saying [...] "the inclusion of musical idioms [...] <b>never</b> <b>so</b> overtly explored before on a U2 record, especially the gospel chorus of 'One Tree Hill'". Colin Hogg of The New Zealand Herald called it [...] "a remarkable musical centrepiece", believing it to be the best song on the album. Colm O'Hare of Hot Press said it was [...] "arguably the most poignant, emotionally-charged song U2 have ever recorded." [...] He added that it was the [...] "least instrumentally adorned song on the album, resplendent in a feeling of space and openness." [...] McGuinness called it one of his favourite U2 songs.|$|E
500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois.

Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". Collins {{said in an interview with}} Playboy that he was, at that point, <b>never</b> <b>so</b> mad in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.|$|E
500|$|Churchill resumed court {{life with}} enthusiasm. In July 1683 {{he was sent}} to the Continent to conduct Prince George of Denmark to England for his {{arranged}} marriage to the 18-year-old Princess Anne, the Duke of York's younger daughter. Anne lost no time in appointing Sarah – of whom she had been passionately fond since childhood – one of her Ladies of the Bedchamber. Their relationship continued to blossom, so much so that years later Sarah wrote – [...] "To see [...] was a constant joy; and to part with [...] for <b>never</b> <b>so</b> short a time, a constant uneasiness... This worked even to the jealousy of a lover". For his part, Churchill treated the princess with respectful affection and grew genuinely attached to her, assuming – in his reverence to royalty – the chivalrous role of a knightly champion. From this time forward the Churchills were increasingly detached from James's Catholic inner circle and more noticeably associated with the Princess.|$|E

Wood wrote, [...] "I feared {{everything}} would come to a standstill, for I had <b>never</b> <b>so</b> much as engaged an extra player without having discussed it with him first". Newman's assistant, W. W. Thompson, took over as manager of the orchestra and the concerts, but at this crucial point Chappells withdrew financial support for the Proms. After lengthy negotiations, the BBC took over from Chappells in 1927 as sponsor. The Proms were saved, and the hall continued to play host to celebrity concerts {{throughout the rest of the}} 1920s and the '30s, some promoted by the BBC, and others as hitherto by a range of choral societies, impresarios and orchestras. As Chappells owned the title [...] "New Queen's Hall Orchestra", the resident orchestra had to change its name once again and was now known as Sir Henry J. Wood's Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was <b>never</b> <b>so</b> assiduous {{a student}} of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were. It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his {{overriding}} ambition was to be a composer. From this point he concentrated on composition. His works from the period include the songs [...] "Un grand sommeil noir" [...] and [...] "D'Anne jouant de l'espinette" [...] to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot, [...] and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four-hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole. At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie, who was earning a living as a café pianist. Ravel {{was one of the first}} musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent. Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them [...] "of inestimable value".|$|E
