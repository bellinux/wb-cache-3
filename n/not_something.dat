5|$|During her training, {{she worked}} with the {{district}} nurses, visiting families in the Melbourne's less affluent suburbs. Her ambition {{was to become a}} doctor who improved the lives of women and children. Women of her own social class did not normally work after they married, so marriage was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> she had intended. In 1919, with the war over, she wrote to Ned urging him to complete his Rhodes Scholarship studies before returning to Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Perón's death was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> the military could accept.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{declined}} {{offers to}} perform in the 1970s; {{he explained that he}} did not like to travel, and that the requirement for a career-minded musician to play concerts was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that he wanted to follow. He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, Descent into the Maelstrom, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and <b>not</b> <b>something</b> in which they should interfere. The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution abroad. Chief among them were the Prince Condé, his son, the Duke de Bourbon, and his grandson, the Duke d'Enghien. From their base in Koblenz, immediately over the French border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army.|$|E
5|$|The five {{processes}} formed what Aristotle {{called the}} soul: it was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> extra, {{but the system}} consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and <b>not</b> <b>something</b> in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this Declaration of Pilnitz threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In this War of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797).|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe, such as Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, viewed the {{revolution}} in France as an event between the French king and his subjects, and <b>not</b> <b>something</b> in which they should interfere. As the rhetoric grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted von Neumann to follow him into {{industry}} and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. Von Neumann and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This was <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that von Neumann had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.|$|E
