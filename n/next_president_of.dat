25|$|By 1920, Carranza {{had become}} {{president}} of Mexico, but found himself opposed by Obregón and others.

Obregón deposed Carranza and became the <b>next</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> Mexico. For the 1924 presidential elections, Obregón chose to succeed himself Plutarco Elias Calles, who was also a revolutionary leader from Sonora. This effectively ended the war, but hostilities had again destroyed the Sonoran economy. From 1920 to the early 1930s, four Sonorans came to occupy the Mexican presidency: Adolfo de la Huerta, Obregón, Calles and Rodríguez.|$|E

25|$|On 2 June 2010, Hatoyama {{announced}} his resignation before a party meeting and officially resigned two days later.
