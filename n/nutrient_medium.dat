5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce {{a thick layer of}} mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell is affected by the amino acid glycine which is present in the <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> peptone.|$|E

The bacteria can be recovered from the person only {{during the first three}} weeks of illness, rendering culturing and DFA useless after this period, although PCR may have some limited usefulness for an additional three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Endospores {{can stay}} dormant {{for a very}} long time. For instance, endospores were found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs. When placed in {{appropriate}} medium, under appropriate conditions, they were able to be reactivated. In 1995, Raul Cano of California Polytechnic State University found bacterial spores in the gut of a fossilized bee trapped in amber from a tree in the Dominican Republic. The bee fossilized in amber was dated to being about 25 million years old. The spores germinated when the amber was cracked open and the material from the gut of the bee was extracted and placed in <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b> After the spores were analyzed by microscopy, it was determined that the cells were very similar to Bacillus sphericus which is found in bees in the Dominican Republic today.|$|E

40|$|Phosphate-solubilizing {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} from acid soil from Cikopomayak. Microbiological assay {{showed that the}} bacteria were Gram negative, rod-shaped, and lacked red pigment on Pikovskaya medium. Isolate A synthesized red pigment on <b>nutrient</b> agar <b>medium,</b> while isolate B formed slightly red pigment on <b>nutrient</b> agar <b>medium</b> {{as well as on}} Voges Proskauer medium. The ratio of clearing zone to colony for isolate A and B were approximately 2. 1 and 1. 9, respectively. Biochemical assays showed that both isolates A and B utilized glucose, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, glycerol, mannose, urea, indole, and produced catalase, but neither produced amylase and oxidase. The bacteria are identified as Serratia marcescens. The ability to solubilize phosphate decreased or was even lost when subcultured on <b>nutrient</b> agar <b>medium.</b> However, the ability to solubilize phosphate was recovered gradually with the addition of phosphate. The results presented here suggest that the ability to solubilize phosphate and to synthesize the red pigment may be inversely correlated...|$|R
500|$|A cyst of {{the genus}} Azotobacter is the resting form of a {{vegetative}} cell; however, whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive, the cyst of Azotobacter does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors. Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions, which include a certain value of pH, temperature, and source of carbon, the cysts germinate, and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division. During the germination, the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell. Microscopically, the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts, which is detected with phase contrast microscopy. Germination of cysts, a slow process, takes about 4–6 h. During germination, the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin, which were located in the intima (the innermost layer). Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine, which has a characteristic horseshoe shape. This process is accompanied by metabolic changes. Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source, the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours. The synthesis of proteins and RNA, [...] occurs in parallel, but it intensifies only after five hours after {{the addition of the}} carbon source. The synthesis of DNA and nitrogen fixation are initiated 5 h after the addition of glucose to a nitrogen-free <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Infected human {{red blood}} cells are {{incubated}} in a culture dish or flask at 37°C together with a <b>nutrient</b> <b>medium</b> and plasma, serum or serum substitutes. A special feature of the incubation is the special gas mixture of mostly nitrogen (93% nitrogen, 4% carbondioxide, [...] 3% oxygen) allowing the parasites to grow at 37°C in a cell incubator. An alternative to gasing the cultures with the exact gas mixture, {{is the use of}} a candlejar. The candlejar is an airtight container in which the cultures and a lit candle are placed. The burning candle consumes some of the oxygen and produces carbon dioxide (...) , which acts as a fire extinguisher. Carbon dioxide content in fresh air varies between 0.036% and 0.039%, at an app. 5% [...] concentration the candle stops burning. The number of parasites increased by a factor 5 approximately every 48 hours (= one cycle). The parasitemia can be determined via blood film, to keep it within the wanted limits, the culture can be thinned out with healthy {{red blood cells}}.|$|E

40|$|Campylobacter (C.) jejuni is a causative {{agent of}} gastro-enteritis. Growth of this Gram {{negative}} bacterium {{is restricted to}} {{a limited number of}} environmental conditions. Under conditions where growth of C. jejuni is not possible, e. g. at temperatures below 30 degrees C, C. jejuni can remain viable for a certain period of time, but its culturability decreases. In this study we examined the effect of this loss of culturability on the infectivity in cell-lines. We hypothesised that if non-culturable cells affect the process of infection then the infectivity per culturable cell used in the infection assay is not constant, whereas if only culturable cell are infectious then the infectivity per culturable cell is. C. jejuni was stored for 40 days in nutrient poor and <b>nutrient</b> rich <b>medium</b> at three temperatures. During this period we monitored its culturability, viability and infectivity. A decrease in culturability in time was observed. At low temperature (4 degrees C) and in <b>nutrient</b> poor <b>medium</b> cells remained culturable for longer periods than at higher temperatures (12 degrees C, 25 degrees C) or in <b>nutrient</b> rich <b>medium.</b> Non-culturable cells remained viable, as determined by tetrazolium chloride staining. The absolute level of adhesion and invasion showed a decrease in time. At low temperatures and in <b>nutrient</b> poor <b>medium</b> cells retained their capability to adhere and invade longer than at higher temperatures or in <b>nutrient</b> rich <b>medium.</b> While the absolute level of adhesion and invasion decreased, the infectivity per culturable cell added seemed to increase during the first 5 days of storage at 4 degrees C. This result confirmed our hypothesis that non-culturable C. jejuni can affect the process of infection. However, the result can also be explained by the presence of a limited number of bindingsites for C. jejuni in our testmodel. This suggested existence of bindingsites has great importance for the research into the influence of non-culturable cells on the infectivity. If non-culturable cells are not infectious but can block bindingsites, then they can play a protective role by competing with the culturable cells for the limited number of bindingsites...|$|R

30|$|Transport of {{bacteria}} through porous medium {{has been an}} important issue for the purpose of bioaugmentation scheme {{as well as for the}} prediction of movement of pathogenic microorganisms in aquifer systems.
