Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The <b>Netherland</b> produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E

5|$|In {{its role}} {{supporting}} colonization of New <b>Netherland,</b> the West India Company had {{an executive board}} of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony.

His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy, including the original settlement of Manhattan Island, New Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Many wars were fought {{during the}} 17th century between the slave trading {{companies}} for {{areas that were}} economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company. The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613. The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New <b>Netherland.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Swedish West India Company {{established}} a colony on the Delaware River in 1638, naming it New Sweden.

The Dutch recaptured the colony in July 1673 during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, but gave {{it back to the}} English under the Treaty of Westminster in exchange for Suriname. The Duke of York never governed the colony himself: he instead appointed governors, councils, and other officers to run the government. Richard Nicolls served as the first governor of New York.|$|E

50|$|In 1629, Samuel Godin and Samuel Blommaert sent {{agents of}} the Dutch West India Company to {{negotiate}} with the local Nanticoke tribe to purchase land on Cape Henlopen near present-day Lewes, Delaware. With the support of New <b>Netherland's</b> colonial leadership at New Amsterdam, a new colony named Zwaanendael was established on the purchased land in 1631 by David Pietersz de Vries. The colony proved to be very short-lived, as conflicts with the Nanticoke led to it being wiped out within a year. A second attempt at establishing a colony at that location in 1632 was soon abandoned.|$|R
5|$|Unfortunately for the West India Company, {{the infant}} colony of New <b>Netherland</b> languished, the {{cautious}} Dutch people having very little inclination to emigrate to wild and uncultivated lands {{in which no}} substantial inducements were present. While the economic situation of the colony in the late 1620s {{could be considered a}} relatively good showing for a colony only newly started in a wilderness, its slow success was hardly sufficient to create much excitement among the directors of the West India Company. Within a few years, the Company realized that special measures which would afford a stimulus to colonization were indispensable.|$|E

5|$|With {{a capital}} of seven million florins, the West India Company was granted {{exclusive}} authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions {{of the two}} Americas, {{as well as the}} coast of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope.

50|$|Melyn {{returned}} in 1650 aboard the Nieuw Nederlandsche Fortuyn (New <b>Netherland's</b> Fortune) {{to resume his}} attempt to colonize Staten Island, along {{with a group of}} about 70 persons. His feud continued with Director-General Stuyvesant, who had him arrested and imprisoned without trial or hearing in 1655. During Melyn's imprisonment, there was another Indian uprising known as the Peach Tree War which destroyed the Staten Island colony. It was soon after this disaster that Cornelis Melyn and family left for the English New Haven Colony, where he took an oath of allegiance to the English crown April 7, 1657. In 1659, he agreed with the West India Company to relinquish his right of Patroonship of Staten Island.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Netherland's</b> first {{national}} legislation related to animal welfare {{came in the}} 1886 Criminal Code, which made maltreatment of non-human animals a crime. Because the maltreatment of animals was regarded as an offense against public morality, public cruelty towards animals was penalized more heavily. The Supreme Court later interpreted [...] "maltreatment" [...] as [...] "deliberately cruel treatment", which significantly reduced the ability to prosecute animal cruelty (for instance, a street vendor who killed cats by smashing them against the street was acquitted {{on the grounds that}} he intended to get their skins and therefore was not deliberately treating them with cruelty). The interpretation of [...] "maltreatment" [...] was broadened again in 1920.|$|R
5|$|Murat and Bertrand {{conducted}} reconnaissance {{between the}} area bordering the Tyrol and the Main as Savary, {{chief of the}} planning staff, drew up detailed road surveys of the areas between the Rhine and the Danube. The left wing of the Grande Armée would move from Hanover in northern Germany and Utrecht in the <b>Netherland</b> to fall on Württemberg; the right and center, troops from the Channel coast, would concentrate along the Middle Rhine around cities like Mannheim and Strasbourg. While Murat was making demonstrations across the Black Forest, other French forces would then invade the German heartland and swing towards the southeast by capturing Augsburg, a move {{that was supposed to}} isolate Mack and interrupt the Austrian lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|Stuyvesant High School {{is named}} after Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch {{governor}} of New <b>Netherland</b> before the colony was transferred to England in 1664. The school was established in 1904 as a manual training school for boys, hosting 155 students and 12 teachers. In 1907, it moved from its original location at 225 East 23rd Street to a building designed by C. B. J. Snyder at 345 East 15th Street. The building, built in 1905 for $1.5 million, housed the Stuyvesant campus for the next 85 years. The school became renowned for excellence in math and science, and enrollment continued to grow so that by 1919, admission began to be restricted based on scholastic achievement. Stuyvesant went on a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students, with some students attending {{in the morning and}} others in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{most troubling}} aspect of colonizing the patroonships was enlisting the {{required}} number of colonists, {{so that the}} failure {{of many of the}} other proposed patroonships may in part be attributed to this fact. The patroons still dealt with the issues of a cautious people not caring to venture to an undeveloped world. As an owner of extensive lands in the sandy Gooi and of family estates in the not much more fruitful Veluwe, where several relatives were landowners and struggled to subsist on meager means, Van Rensselaer had an advantage — his agents needed to employ little persuasion to induce some Gooiers and Veluwers to migrate to more fruitful regions where the farming would be less difficult. In addition, he could depend on the indirect support of his nephew Wouter van Twiller, who had been appointed Director of New <b>Netherland</b> in 1632, and with whom he engaged in friendly correspondence at a time when Dutch directors opposed the patroons in every way. In 1634 he collaborated with Michael Reyniersz Pauw, the patroon of Pavonia on shipping cattle.|$|E

We can recover the full 48 -bit key of the MiFare algorithm in 200 seconds on a PC, given 1 known IV (from one single encryption). The security of this cipher is therefore close to zero. This is particularly shocking, given the fact that, according to the Dutch press, 1 billion of MiFare Classic chips are used worldwide, including many government security systems...|$|R
