The resulting Schmitt trigger circuit gives additional <b>noise</b> <b>immunity</b> and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as , , , [...] and [...] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network. When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{conventional}} way {{to analyze}} the robustness of an SRAM bit cell is to quantify its <b>immunity</b> to static <b>noise.</b> The static <b>immunity</b> to disturbances like process and mismatch variations, bulk noises, supply rings variations, temperature changes is well characterized {{by means of the}} Static Noise Margin (SNM) defined as the maximum applicable series voltage at the inputs which causes no change in the data retention nodes. However, a significant number of disturbance sources present a transient behavior which is ignored by the static analysis but has to be taken in consideration for a complete characterization of the cell’s behavior. In this paper, a metric to evaluate the cell robustness in the presence of transient voltage noise is proposed based on determining the energy of the noise signal which is able to flip the cell’s state. The Dynamic Noise Margin (DNM) metric is defined as the minimum energy of the voltage noise signal able to flip the cell.

The logo recognition operation faces many challenges such as having to recognize logos that might be scaled, rotated, translated and added with noises. Different types of logo’s shapes further add to the complex nature of this problem. Approach: We developed a logo recognition system that comprises of three phases: Preprocessing, feature extraction and features matching. For feature extraction, we adopted a region-based Angular Radial Transform (ART) to extract the features from logo’s shapes. We used the Euclidian Distance (ED) as a similarity measure parameter for the features matching. Results: We tested the system that used the ART as feature extraction method on a large logo database of 2730 images to investigate the effect of several deformations and noise on recognition performance.
