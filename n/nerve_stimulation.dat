40|$|In this study, rats {{were put}} into {{traumatic}} brain injury-induced coma and treated with median <b>nerve</b> electrical <b>stimulation.</b> We explored the wake-promoting effect, and possible mechanisms, of median <b>nerve</b> electrical <b>stimulation.</b> Electrical stimulation upregulated the expression levels of orexin-A and its receptor OX 1 R in the rat prefrontal cortex. Orexin-A expression gradually increased with increasing stimulation, while OX 1 R expression reached a peak at 12 hours and then decreased. In addition, after the OX 1 R antagonist, SB 334867, was injected into the brain of rats after traumatic brain injury, fewer rats were restored to consciousness, and orexin-A and OXIR expression in the prefrontal cortex was downregulated. Our findings indicate that median <b>nerve</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> induced an up-regulation of orexin-A and OX 1 R expression in the prefrontal cortex of traumatic brain injury-induced coma rats, which may be a potential mechanism involved in the wake-promoting effects of median <b>nerve</b> electrical <b>stimulation...</b>|$|R

5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|Spinal polio, {{the most}} common form of paralytic poliomyelitis, results from viral {{invasion}} of the motor neurons of the anterior horn cells, or the ventral (front) grey matter section in the spinal column, which are responsible for movement of the muscles, including those of the trunk, limbs, and the intercostal muscles. Virus invasion causes inflammation of the nerve cells, leading to damage or destruction of motor neuron ganglia. When spinal neurons die, Wallerian degeneration takes place, leading to weakness of those muscles formerly innervated by the now-dead neurons. With the destruction of nerve cells, the muscles no longer receive signals from the brain or spinal cord; without <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation,</b> the muscles atrophy, becoming weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and finally completely paralyzed. Maximum paralysis progresses rapidly (two to four days), and usually involves fever and muscle pain. Deep tendon reflexes are also affected, and are typically absent or diminished; sensation (the ability to feel) in the paralyzed limbs, however, is not affected.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to transcutaneous electrical <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation,</b> TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve causes an {{increase}} in inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) neural activities. If central respiratory oscillation is generated by an attractor-cycle process, {{an increase}} in its activity {{can be caused by}} a centrifugal perturbation of state. We evaluated this hypothesis by comparing the respiratory oscillator's phase responses to carotid sinus <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulations</b> in cats to the phase responses of an attractor-cycle oscillator, the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol (BvP) equations, subjected to centrifugal perturbations. We recorded phrenic activity in seven anaesthetized, vagotomized, glomectomized, paralysed and servo-ventilated cats. Carotid sinus <b>nerve</b> (CSN) <b>stimulation</b> with 0. 5 – 0. 8 s electrical pulse trains increased the immediate cycle period and delayed the onset of breaths after stimulation in a highly predictable manner, with the exception that strong stimuli (25 Hz, 0. 25 – 0. 90 V) caused unpredictable responses when given at the I-E or the E-I transitions. The resetting plots exhibited focal gaps corresponding to these unpredictable responses, {{and the size of the}} gaps increased with increases in the strength of CSN stimulation. Type 0 resetting was not achieved despite the large perturbations in rhythm induced by CSN stimulation. Centrifugal perturbations of the BvP oscillator resulted in phase responses which were similar to those found in the animal experiments. The BvP cycle had two critical phases at which phase resetting was highly irregular and neighbouring state trajectories were highly divergent. The resetting plots had focal gaps that increased in size with increases in the strength of perturbation. The gaps did not represent true discontinuity because at higher computational resolution the resetting plots appeared to be steep but smooth portions of topological Type 1 resetting curves. These studies support the concept that brief carotid sinus <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulations</b> cause a transient outward displacement of the central respiratory state away from its attractor cycle, in contrast to the unidirectional displacements that accompany midbrain reticular or superior laryngeal <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulations.</b> The findings define particular geometrical relationships between oscillatory state trajectories of the rhythm generator and perturbed state trajectories induced by inputs to the oscillator. These relationships provide a framework for developing and testing the validity of neural models of the respiratory oscillator...|$|R

25|$|Surgery may {{be carried}} out if {{conservative}} measures alone are not sufficient to control incontinence. There are many surgical options, and their relative effectiveness is debated {{due to a lack}} of good quality evidence. The optimal treatment regime may be a both surgical and non-surgical treatments. The surgical options can be considered in four categories: restoration and improvement of residual sphincter function (sphincteroplasty, sacral <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation,</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation,</b> correction of anorectal deformity), replacement / imitation of the sphincter or its function (anal encirclement, SECCA procedure, non-dynamic graciloplasty, perianal injectable bulking agents), dynamic sphincter replacement (artificial bowel sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty), antegrade continence enema (Malone procedure), and finally fecal diversion (e.g. colostomy). A surgical treatment algorithm has been proposed. Isolated sphincter defects (IAS/EAS) may be initially treated with sphincteroplasty and if this fails, the person can be assessed for sacral <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation.</b> Functional deficits of the EAS and/or IAS (i.e. where there is no structural defect, or only limited EAS structural defect, or with neurogenic incontinence) may be assessed for sacral <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation.</b> If this fails, neosphincter with either dynamic graciloplasty or artificial anal sphincter may be indicated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{validate}} {{a method}} for assessing urethral sphincter muscle function by recording rises in intraurethral pressure during repetitive pudendal <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulations.</b> METHODS: A supine urethral pressure profile at rest was performed on 12 stress-continent and 28 stress-incontinent patients during repetitive pudendal <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulations</b> applied near the ischial spine, and the intraurethral pressure increases were calculated for each third of the urethral functional length. RESULTS: No significant difference in intraurethral pressure increases was seen between continent and stress-incontinent women. On the various regression curves, the intraurethral pressure increases showed a significant correlation with maximal urethral closure pressure values at rest and at stress (r = 0. 36 to 0. 54) and with the patient's age (r = 0. 46), but not with pudendal nerve conduction times to the urethral sphincter on either side (r = 0. 14 and 0. 19). CONCLUSIONS: This method (1) measures intraurethral pressure increases that correlate well with the anatomic location of the urethral sphincter muscle, (2) shows {{there is no significant}} difference between them in continent and stress-incontinent patients, except in patients with a low-pressure urethra, and (3) demonstrates that they correlate well with the maximal urethral closure pressure and the patient's age, but not with pudendal motor latencies to the urethral sphincter.
