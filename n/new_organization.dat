In 1979 a <b>new</b> <b>organization,</b> Championship Auto Racing Teams, had set up the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s. The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{movement}} grew to encompass three major age groups for boys (Cub Scout, Boy Scout, Rover Scout) and, in 1910, a <b>new</b> <b>organization,</b> Girl Guides, was created for girls (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and Girl Scout, Ranger Guide).

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Louis in 1979, the Horch family sold the Master Building to a real estate investor, Sol Goldman, {{who was then the}} city's largest private landlord.

The conversion was completed in 1988 when that company transferred control to a <b>new</b> <b>organization,</b> Master Apartments, Inc.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{eighteen}} {{years after the}} rift formed in the American women's rights movement, Stone proposed a merger of the two groups. Plans were drawn up, and, at their annual meetings, propositions were heard and voted on, then passed to the other group for evaluation. By 1890, the organizations resolved their differences and merged to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stone was too weak with heart problems and respiratory illness to attend its first convention but was elected chair of the executive committee. Stanton {{was president of the}} <b>new</b> <b>organization,</b> but Anthony, who had the title of vice president, was its leader in practice.|$|E

The band's first members were recruited by Loving from community ensembles that performed in the small towns of Luzon, {{some of whom were}} former musicians in Spanish Army bands. Auditions for the ensemble were fierce; 300 clarinetists, for instance, tried out for just eight billets.|$|E
5|$|While at Digital, Kotok {{recognized}} the Web's potential, {{and helped to}} found the World Wide Web Consortium.

5|$|Although {{produced}} by Universal Pictures, The Brute Man was distributed by Producers Releasing Corporation, {{one of the}} smaller film studios from Hollywood's Poverty Row. In 1945, Universal merged with the company International Pictures, and the <b>new</b> <b>organization</b> adopted a policy against developing any more B movies, including Westerns, horror films, serials and movies running 70minutes or less. This resulted in the firing of numerous production personnel members and the sale of several already-developed films, including The Brute Man. The sale was also perpetuated in part by the death of star Rondo Hatton. He {{died as a result of}} his acromegaly on February2, 1946, about eight months before The Brute Man was first screened, making it his final film. Universal feared releasing the film so soon after his death would lead to accusations that the studio was exploiting the illness that ultimately killed Hatton. Now embarrassed by the film, the studio was anxious to sell it.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>New</b> {{government}} <b>organizations</b> face a {{range of}} challenges in establishing themselves during and after their initial creation. Without proper consideration, these challenges can hamper organizational development or even cause it to collapse altogether. This paper seeks to identify these challenges in order to explore {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of <b>new</b> <b>organizations</b> and to investigate how best to use this knowledge to ensure the successful development of <b>new</b> <b>organizations.</b> This will be accomplished through the discussion of past experiences and the exploration of literature on organizational development. Research points to a set of key criteria that help to reinforce organizations over the course of their development, mitigate potential threats, and establish organizations both internally and within their broader environment. These criteria include the development of a clear organizational objective, support from other institutions, exceptional leadership, and effective use of time. The best practices established here may serve as a framework for the development of <b>new</b> <b>organizations</b> in the future...|$|R

5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of this group of scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the <b>new</b> <b>organization.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a Specified Radioactive Waste Final Disposal Act {{called for}} {{creation}} of a <b>new</b> <b>organization</b> to manage high level radioactive waste, and later that year the Nuclear Waste Management Organization of Japan (NUMO) was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. NUMO is responsible for selecting a permanent deep geological repository site, construction, operation and closure of the facility for waste emplacement by 2040. Site selection began in 2002 and application information was sent to 3,239 municipalities, but by 2006, no local government had volunteered to host the facility. Kōchi Prefecture showed interest in 2007, but its mayor resigned due to local opposition. In December 2013 the government decided to identify suitable candidate areas before approaching municipalities.|$|E
5|$|In June 1853 Bennett {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} as a soloist with orchestra {{in his own}} Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a <b>new</b> <b>organization,</b> the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist Arabella Goddard (Davison's wife) in Bennett's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which Richard Wagner conducted, Bennett was elected {{to take over the}} conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's Emperor Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.|$|E

5|$|Social {{life during}} the Song was vibrant. Citizens {{gathered}} to view and trade precious artworks, the populace intermingled at public festivals and private clubs, and cities had lively entertainment quarters. The spread {{of literature and}} knowledge was enhanced by {{the rapid expansion of}} woodblock printing and the 11th-century invention of movable-type printing. Technology, science, philosophy, mathematics, and engineering flourished {{over the course of the}} Song. Philosophers such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused with Buddhist ideals, and emphasized a <b>new</b> <b>organization</b> of classic texts that brought out the core doctrine of Neo-Confucianism. Although the institution of the civil service examinations had existed since the Sui dynasty, it became much more prominent in the Song period. The officials who gained power by succeeding in the exams became a leading factor in the shift from a military-aristocratic elite to a bureaucratic elite.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{has been}} a {{principal}} in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation. In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth with after-school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the <b>new</b> <b>organization</b> came just {{before the start of}} the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg, Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and raised more than $80,000 for charity. According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program. The foundation spent 12% of its 2006 budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. The foundation ceased operations that year. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008.|$|E
