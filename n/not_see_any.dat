At the end of training camp, Sipe won the job, and Gault was cut. He {{was picked up by}} the San Diego Chargers in late August. He competed with Wayne Clark for the backup quarterback job for a short time, and did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> playing time for the Chargers before his release. He also spent time with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League, but did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> playing time with them. He later noted that he was unable to adjust to the game of Canadian football, as he was unable to throw a spiral due to the football being shorter and fatter.|$|E

5|$|The oldest form of {{astronomy}}, optical or visible-light astronomy {{extends from}} approximately 400 to 700 nm. Positioning an optical telescope in space {{means that the}} telescope does <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> atmospheric effects (see astronomical seeing), providing higher resolution images. Optical telescopes are used to look at stars, galaxies, planetary nebulae and protoplanetary disks, amongst many other things.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E

5|$|Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships, the Wittelsbachs were {{withdrawn}} from active service after {{the advent of}} the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They were assigned to the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. The ships were based in Kiel and placed under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt. In early September 1914, the ships conducted a result-less sweep into the Baltic against the Russian navy operating there. In May 1915, four of the Wittelsbachs sailed into the Baltic and bombarded Libau, which was subsequently captured by the German army. The five ships of the class were moved to Libau during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, though they did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> combat during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Nagato {{spent most}} of {{the first two years of}} the war {{training}} in home waters. She was transferred to Truk in mid-1943, but did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> combat until the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 when she was attacked by American aircraft. Nagato did not fire her main armament against enemy vessels until the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. She was lightly damaged during the battle and returned to Japan the following month for repairs. The IJN was running out of fuel by this time and decided not to fully repair her. Nagato was converted into a floating anti-aircraft platform and assigned to coastal defense duties. After the war, the ship was a target for U.S. nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads in mid-1946. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by the second test.|$|E
5|$|Njörðr is {{introduced}} in Skáldskaparmál within {{a list of}} 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir.

In 1769, Curtis joined the frigate HMS Venus under Samuel Barrington before moving to the ship of the line HMS Albion in which he was promoted to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Simonsohn {{also raised}} the {{possibility}} of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>any</b> evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E
