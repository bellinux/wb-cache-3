50|$|Once a {{transformation}} from impedance to admittance has been performed the scaling changes to <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance</b> {{until such time}} that a later transformation back to normalised impedance is performed.|$|E
5000|$|The Smith chart is plotted on {{the complex}} {{reflection}} coefficient plane in two dimensions and is scaled in normalised impedance (the most common), <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance</b> or both, using different colours to distinguish between them. These are often known as the Z, Y and YZ Smith charts respectively. Normalised scaling allows the Smith chart {{to be used for}} problems involving any characteristic or system impedance which is represented by the center point of the chart. The most commonly used normalization impedance is 50 ohms. Once an answer is obtained through the graphical constructions described below, it is straightforward to convert between normalised impedance (or <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance)</b> and the corresponding unnormalized value by multiplying by the characteristic impedance (admittance). Reflection coefficients can be read directly from the chart as they are unitless parameters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} whether to use the Z Smith chart or the Y Smith chart for any {{particular}} calculation depends on which is more convenient. Impedances in series and admittances in parallel add while impedances in parallel and admittances in series are related by a reciprocal equation. If [...] is the equivalent impedance of series impedances and [...] is the equivalent impedance of parallel impedances, thenFor admittances the reverse is true, that isDealing with the reciprocals, especially in complex numbers, is more time consuming and error-prone than using linear addition. In general therefore, most RF engineers work in the plane where the circuit topography supports linear addition. The following table gives the complex expressions for impedance (real and <b>normalised)</b> and <b>admittance</b> (real and <b>normalised)</b> {{for each of the}} three basic passive circuit elements: resistance, inductance and capacitance. Using just the characteristic impedance (or characteristic admittance) and test frequency an equivalent circuit can be found and vice versa.|$|R
2500|$|The S-parameter matrix {{describing}} an N-port {{network will}} be square of dimension N and will therefore contain [...] elements. At the test frequency each element or S-parameter {{is represented by}} a unitless complex number that represents magnitude and angle, i.e. amplitude and phase. The complex number may either be expressed in rectangular form or, more commonly, in polar form. The S-parameter magnitude may be expressed in linear form or logarithmic form. [...] When expressed in logarithmic form, magnitude has the [...] "dimensionless unit" [...] of decibels. The S-parameter angle is most frequently expressed in degrees but occasionally in radians. Any S-parameter may be displayed graphically on a polar diagram by a dot for one frequency or a locus {{for a range of}} frequencies. If it applies to one port only (being of the form [...] ), it may be displayed on an impedance or <b>admittance</b> Smith Chart <b>normalised</b> to the system impedance. The Smith Chart allows simple conversion between the [...] parameter, equivalent to the voltage reflection coefficient and the associated (<b>normalised)</b> impedance (or <b>admittance)</b> 'seen' at that port.|$|R
5000|$|In RF {{circuit and}} {{matching}} problems {{sometimes it is}} more convenient to work with admittances (representing conductances and susceptances) and sometimes {{it is more convenient}} to work with impedances (representing resistances and reactances). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for series elements and normalised admittances for parallel elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance</b> or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius. For example the point P1 in the example representing a reflection coefficient of [...] has a normalised impedance of [...] To graphically change this to the equivalent <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance</b> point, say Q1, a line is drawn with a ruler from P1 through the Smith chart centre to Q1, an equal radius in the opposite direction. This is equivalent to moving the point through a circular path of exactly 180 degrees. Reading the value from the Smith chart for Q1, remembering that the scaling is now in <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance,</b> gives [...] Performing the calculationmanually will confirm this.|$|E
5000|$|A {{transmission}} {{line with a}} characteristic impedance of [...] may be universally considered to have a characteristic admittance of [...] whereAny impedance, [...] expressed in ohms, may be normalised by dividing it by the characteristic impedance, so the normalised impedance using the lower case z, suffix T is given by Similarly, for normalised admittanceThe SI unit of impedance is the ohm with {{the symbol of the}} upper case Greek letter omega (Ω) and the SI unit for admittance is the siemens with the symbol of an upper case letter S. Normalised impedance and <b>normalised</b> <b>admittance</b> are dimensionless. Actual impedances and admittances must be normalised before using them on a Smith chart. Once the result is obtained it may be de-normalised to obtain the actual result.|$|E
