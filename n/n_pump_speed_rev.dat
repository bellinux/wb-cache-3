Unfortunately, it is impossible to measure the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> in situation. We proposed an alternative method to infer <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> indirectly in situ. The <b>Pumping</b> <b>speed</b> indicator (PSI) is based on similarity of the pump-down method and the semiconductor manufacturing processes, estimates the exhaust capacity of vacuum pump.

40|$|A Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) is a {{mechanical}} pump used {{to assist the}} weakened left ventricle to pump blood to the entire body. One method of controlling <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> is using a closed-loop controller that changes the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> based on the patient's level of activity and demand for cardiac output. An {{important aspect of the}} development of a closed-loop controller is the selection of the desired <b>pump</b> <b>speed.</b> <b>Pump</b> <b>speed</b> must be chosen such that the patient receives adequate cardiac output for his/her level of activity. The pump must also operate in a safe physiological operating region, placing constraints on other hemodynamic parameters. This work presents the <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> selection problem as a multiobjective optimization problem, considering constraints on cardiac output, left atrial pressure, and arterial pressure. A penalty function is assigned to each hemodynamic variable and a mathematical model of the LVAD and cardiovascular system is used to map the penalty functions as functions of the hemodynamic parameters to penalty functions as functions of <b>pump</b> <b>speed.</b> The penalties for the different variables are combined by forming a weighted sum, and the best set of <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> is determined by minimizing the combined penalty functions using different sets of weights. The resulting set of best <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> forms the noninferior set (Zadeh, IEEE Trans. On Auto. Control, 1967). It was discovered that the noninferior set contains discontinuities, so the concept of a modified noninferior set known as the Clinician's noninferior set is introduced. A decision support system (DSS) is presented that allows clinicians to determine a single <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> from the noninferior set by investigating the effects of different speeds on the hemodynamic variables. The DSS is also a tool that can be utilized to help clinicians develop {{a better understanding of how}} to assign weights to the different hemodynamic variables...|$|R

40|$|This report calculates {{the effect}} of the conductances of the pumping lines on the <b>pumping</b> <b>speeds</b> of the vacuum pumps being used to pump the inner vessel, and annular space, vacuum tight during the CC Cryostat testing. Effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speeds</b> were {{calculated}} for various values of pressure via the above stated formulas (see calculations). Conductances of valves, elbows, and tees were calculated with the help of ref. 1, and the volumes of the inner vessel and annular space were calculated wtth the aid of ref. 2. The major results of these calculations follow. The attached graphs show the effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> vs. pressure, as well as the pressure vs. pumpdown time for both the inner vessel pumpdown and the annular space pumpdown. Many intervals of pressure were chosen in order to give a complete picture of the effects on the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed,</b> and pumpdown time. An important rule of thumb is that the effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> be close to the intrinsic <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> in the region of interest for the best efficiency. With an infinite conductance, these quantities become equal. In the case of the annular space pumpdown. the effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> is within approximately 15 % of the intrinsic <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> for pressures down to 6000 {mu}, and at that point, the conductance effects slow the system down and provide a 49 % difference at 1000 {mu}. To Improve these numbers, the line length must be shortened, or even better, the line diameter increased. As far as pumpdown time is concerned, the actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time, and would have been even better if the pumping system did not lag due to a leaK and its repair time. The inner vessel pumpdown shows a pumpdown time near 1 hour to reach 100 {mu} pressure. The effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> matches to within 10 % of the intrinsic <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> to 6000 {mu}, and then the conductance effects become more important and provide a 41 % difference at 1000 {mu}. The actual pumpdown was completed in a reasonable amount of time which demonstrates that the pump used was in fact adequate for this application...|$|R
40|$|Vacuum {{facility}} backpressure {{is known}} to affect the performance of Hall thrusters through ingestion of background gases by the thruster. Ingested gases may be ionized and subsequently accelerated, artificially increasing the measured thrust. This study seeks to characterize how backpressure affects performance by changing the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of the facility, not by the commonly used technique of bleeding additional propellant in to the vacuum chamber. Performance is measured at xenon <b>pumping</b> <b>speeds</b> of 140, 000 and 240, 000 l/s, on a nominally 5 kW Hall thruster at voltages and flow rates of 300 - 600 V and 5 - 15 mg/s. At the highest <b>pumping</b> <b>speed,</b> performance data are collected while matching the discharge current observed at the lower <b>pumping</b> <b>speed.</b> Thrust, specific impulse, and efficiency are presented at both pumping rates. The anode mass flow at zero backpressure is calculated by extrapolation from the observed change in flow rate with pressure. On average, the correction is 4 % of the anode flow rate at the maximum <b>pumping</b> <b>speed,</b> which {{is comparable to the}} uncertainty in the flow controllers...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 1992, {{the first}} of the DIII-D {{divertor}} baffles and cryocondensation pumps was installed. This open divertor configuration, located on the outermost floor of the DIII-D vessel, includes a cryopump with a predicted <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of 50, 000 {ell}/s excluding obstructions such as support hardware. Taking the pump structural and support characteristics into consideration, the corrected <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> for D{sub 2 } is 30, 000 {ell}/s [1]. In 1996, the second divertor baffle and cryopump were installed. This closed divertor structure, located on the outermost ceiling of the DIII-D vessel, has a cryopump with a predicted <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of 32, 000 {ell}/s. In the fall of 1999, the third divertor baffle and cryopump will be installed. This divertor structure will be located on the 45 {sup o} angled corner on the innermost ceiling of the DIII-D vessel, known as the private flux region of the plasma configuration. With hardware supports factored into the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> calculation, the private flux cryopump is expected to have a <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of 15, 000 {ell}/s. There was question regarding the effectiveness of the private flux cryopump due to the close proximity of the private flux baffle. This led to a conductance calculation study of the impact of rotating the cryopump aperture by 180 {sup o} to allow for greater particle and gas exhaust into the cryopump's helium panel. This study concluded that the cost and schedule impact of changing the private flux cryopump orientation and design did not warrant the possible 20 % (3, 000 {ell}/s) increase in pumping ability gained by rotating the cryopump aperture 180 {sup o}.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} calculations done {{to determine the}} vacuum <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> for the D-Zero solenoid. The raw calculations are attached. A summary of the results are listed. The vacuum <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of the solenoid {{is determined by the}} conductance of the pumping path. At higher pressure ranges during initial pumpdown, the conductances will be rather high. Calculations were not done for the transient pumpdown period, only the steady state type pumping situation. The pressure is assumed to be on the order of 10 E- 7 torr. This is the free molecular flow regime based on Knudsen number. This pressure regime is also where the <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> would be least. The conductances were calculated based on pumping helium gas at a temperature of 300 Kelvin. The total conductance of the pumping path from the solenoid to the inlet of the turbomolecular pump is 11. 8 L/s. The effective <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> of a 1000 L/s turbo pump attached to this pumping path is 11. 7 L/s. The minimum required <b>pumping</b> <b>speed</b> for design purposes was set at 4. 3 L/s. This value was arrived at by assuming a warm leak size (10 E- 8 atm-cc/sec) was not detected during fabrication of the solenoid.

Through the use of variable speed components, the supplied capacity {{can be reduced to}} match the required load and hence reduce unnecessary energy consumption. However, for fan coil units, difficulties can arise when optimizing fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> at part load. Practically locating optimal water and air flow rates from readily available information and for varying supplied capacities is necessary, {{in order to reduce the}} fan coil power consumption. This research attempts to identify whether optimal fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> exist for a fan coil unit and how they can be implemented, in a practical manner, in a system control applications. Using an empirical fan coil and pump model, the total power consumption (fan and pump) for different combinations of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> over a range of capacities was calculated. It was observed that, for a given capacity, an optimal combination of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> exists and there was a significant change in power consumption for different combinations of fan and <b>pump</b> <b>speeds</b> supplying the same capacity. A control strategy is described that utilizes a simple fan coil capacity estimation model, coupled with air and water flow rates, along with nominal design data. The <b>pump</b> <b>speed</b> is optimized using PID control to maintain the space temperature at the chosen set-point, which matches the supplied capacity to the required capacity. At set-time intervals, the capacity estimation model is utilized to optimize the water and air flow rates for the required capacity. The control strategy is evaluated, using a full building simulation model for a daily load profile and is compared to two baseline conditions: for no control of the fancoils/pump combination and for PID circulation control of the pump only.
