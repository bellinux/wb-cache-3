25|$|Since 2005 when Levono {{acquired}} IBM's ThinkPad, Chinese {{companies have}} been actively expanding outside of China, in both developed and developing countries. In 2013, Chinese companies invested US$90 billion globally in <b>non-financial</b> sectors, 16% more than 2012.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} exhorts business to adopt <b>non-financial</b> measures of success (e.g., Deming's Fourteen Points, balanced scorecards). While CSR benefits are hard to quantify, Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes found a correlation between social/environmental performance and financial performance.|$|E
25|$|Currency risk (also {{known as}} Foreign Exchange Risk hedging) is used both by {{financial}} investors to deflect the risks they encounter when investing abroad and by <b>non-financial</b> {{actors in the}} global economy for whom multi-currency activities are a necessary evil rather than a desired state of exposure.|$|E
25|$|These steps go {{far beyond}} the simple task of {{identifying}} {{a small number of}} financial and <b>non-financial</b> measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that the balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and <b>non-financial</b> topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} is {{the release of}} financial and <b>non-financial</b> information on a real-time or near real-time basis. The purpose of continuous {{reporting is}} to allow external parties access to information as underlying events take place, rather than waiting for end-of-period reports. The adoption of XBRL by companies makes the release of continuous reporting information more feasible. Continuous reporting also benefits users under Regulation Fair Disclosure.|$|E
25|$|On January 5, 2009, Obama's {{campaign}} account @BarackObama was among several celebrity accounts that were hacked and domain hijacked. The hacker phished the password of a Twitter administrator's account, {{gaining access to}} other accounts to which he then changed the passwords, and subsequently offered access to accounts upon request at Digital Gangster. The case eventually led to a <b>non-financial</b> settlement with the Federal Trade Commission by Twitter.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture, {{mainly in}} private hands, {{has been largely}} deregulated, with the {{exception}} of cotton and sugar production. Construction, <b>non-financial</b> services, and domestic wholesale and retail trades are largely private. This has promoted a steady increase of GDP and the annual growth rate. The Government of Egypt tamed inflation bringing it down from double-digit to a single digit. Currently, GDP is rising smartly by 7% per annum due to successful diversification.|$|E
25|$|Design of a {{balanced}} scorecard is about the identification of {{a small number of}} financial and <b>non-financial</b> measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.|$|E
25|$|The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act) is the {{principal}} legislative instrument, although there are also offence provisions contained in Division 400 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Upon its introduction, it was intended that the AML/CTF Act would be further amended by a second tranche of reforms extending to designated <b>non-financial</b> businesses and professions (DNFBPs) including, inter alia, lawyers, accountants, jewellers and real estate agents; however, those further reforms {{have yet to be}} progressed.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} offers a taxonomy for <b>non-financial</b> business reporting, which {{is becoming increasingly}} important in SEC Filings. In some approaches taxonomies are supported by Extensible Business Reporting Language XBRL. Venture capitalists and investors {{are concerned with the}} capability of a firm to create value in future. Financial statements are limited to current and past financial indicators and valuations of capital assets. In contrast, value {{network analysis}} is one approach to assessing current and future capability for value creation and to describe and analyze a business model.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is one of}} India's largest direct investors. From 1991 to 2004, {{the stock}} of FDI inflow has {{increased}} from USD $11.3 million to $344.4 million, and totaling $4.13 billion. This is a compound rate increase of 57.5 percent annually. Indian direct investments abroad began in 1992, and Indian corporations and registered partnership firms are now allowed to invest in businesses up to 100 percent of their net worth. India's largest outgoing investments are in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 54.8 percent of the country's foreign investments. The second largest are in <b>non-financial</b> services (software development), accounting for 35.4 percent of investments.|$|E
25|$|Value network {{analysis}} addresses both financial and <b>non-financial</b> value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such {{as a type of}} business in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, double loop or generative learning mode, it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} that conversation between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E
25|$|During Netanyahu's third term, he {{continued}} his policy of economic liberalization. In December 2013, the Knesset approved the Business Concentration Law, which intended to open Israel's highly concentrated economy to competition to lower consumer prices, reduce income inequality, and increase economic growth. Netanyahu had formed the Concentration Committee in 2010, and the bill, which was pushed forward by his government, implemented its recommendations. The new law banned multi-tiered corporate holding structures, in which a CEO's family members or other affiliated individuals held public companies which in turn owned other public companies, and who were thus able to engage in price gouging. Under the law, corporations were banned from owning more than two tiers of publicly listed companies and from holding both financial and <b>non-financial</b> enterprises. All conglomerates were given four to six years to sell excess holdings. Netanyahu also began a campaign of port privatization to break what he viewed as the monopoly held by workers of the Israel Port Authority, so as to lower consumer prices and increase exports. In July 2013, he issued tenders {{for the construction of}} private ports in Haifa and Ashdod. Netanyahu has also pledged to curb excess bureaucracy and regulations to ease the burden on industry.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve further {{expanded}} the collateral it will loan against to include commercial paper {{using the new}} Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF). The action made the Fed a crucial source of credit for <b>non-financial</b> businesses in addition to commercial banks and investment firms. Fed officials said they'll buy {{as much of the}} debt as necessary to get the market functioning again. They refused to say how much that might be, but they noted that around $1.3 trillion worth of commercial paper would qualify. There was $1.61 trillion in outstanding commercial paper, seasonally adjusted, on the market as of October 1, 2008, {{according to the most recent}} data from the Fed. That was down from $1.70 trillion in the previous week. Since the summer of 2007, the market has shrunk from more than $2.2 trillion. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. Forty-five out of 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the issues}} arising from {{unsolicited}} phone marketing is the dealing in individuals' personal information, ie. financial institutions selling personal information, balances and transaction information to third parties. However financial services companies, those that offer both banking, insurance, and investment products, say that the issue and attempted legislation on the topic was caused by smaller financial institutions who simply focused on one type of product or business. The {{reason for this is}} that combining all those products with one company creates a Walmart-style economies of scale and other synergies which are difficult to compete against as a single product line company. By putting forth legislation which forbids financial institutions from sharing information with other companies, single-product-line financial institutions could cripple integrated financial services companies because of the technicality that the banking, investments, and insurance parts of the business had to be operated under separate company affiliates within a holding company. Most financial services companies claim that they have never sold information to <b>non-financial</b> services companies. Some critics of financial institutions agreed with this analysis but continued to press for the legislation because they believed that the financial services integrated business model was fundamentally wrong; however the vast majority of critical articles focused on the issue of selling information to outside telemarketers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-financial</b> cooperatives - such as {{fishermen}} coop or farmers coops of the Antigonish movement, {{continue to}} provide an alternative economic model the world over despite rise of private sector led economic growth, especially for small producers and farmers in accessing markets and negotiating prices collectively. Within Maritimes though, such cooperatives seem to {{have given way to}} more individual enterprises that operate more as 'association' rather than collective business, but continuing to have a very close sense of 'community' and collective identity - be it lobster fishers or dairy farmers. Newer form of economic enterprises of recent times are also generally termed as 'social enterprises' - with dual objective of profit and socially responsible and positive outcomes. Such enterprises don't always have collective ownership, but almost always have a sense of 'community' well-being. Investment Cooperatives are yet another form of collective enterprise, often getting formed to finance a community based enterprise such as alternative energy coop or local-food marketing coop. Shared-economy is yet another form of new wave idea that borrows from same coop principle of community sharing an economy more inclusively; though the potential conflict between the private and corporate profit v/s community benefiting collectively continues to be an ongoing debate; a debate that Antigonish Movement challenged in 1920 and 1930s, and seem to go through in cyclical fashion ever-since. Societies are once again at cross-roads for balancing between individual and corporate wealth, group / cooperative enterprises, and more shared-economies where everyone can share benefits. Legacy and lessons from the Antigonish Movement continue to be relevant in our modern times.|$|E
500|$|In a Sotheby's {{auction in}} Geneva, in April 1987, the Duchess's {{remarkable}} jewellery collection raised $45 {{million for the}} Institute, approximately seven times its pre-sale estimate. Blum later claimed that Egyptian entrepreneur Mohamed Al-Fayed tried to purchase the jewels for a [...] "rock bottom price". Al-Fayed bought much of the <b>non-financial</b> estate, including the lease of the Paris mansion. An auction of his collection was announced in July 1997 for later that year in New York. Delayed by his son's death in the car accident that also claimed the life of Diana, Princess of Wales, the sale raised more than £14 million for charity in 1998.|$|E

500|$|After {{weeks of}} speculation, JAL applied for {{protection}} under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law (the Japanese equivalent of Administration in the United Kingdom or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States) on 19 January 2010.

[...] JAL's main creditors (Mizuho Corporate Bank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) originally objected to the bankruptcy declaration, but changed their mind after the Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan recommended court protection, according to a senior bank official. Shares of JAL were delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 20 February 2010. At a time, its stock {{was considered one of}} [...] "bluest of blue chips" [...] of Japan.

500|$|In Enron's {{natural gas}} business, the {{accounting}} had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying {{the gas and}} actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, citing that it would represent [...] "true economic value." [...] Enron became the first <b>non-financial</b> company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract was signed, income is estimated as {{the present value of}} net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Due to the large discrepancies of attempting to match profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. While using the method, income from projects could be recorded, although they might not have ever received the money, and in turn increasing financial earnings on the books. However, in future years, the profits could not be included, so new and additional income had to be included from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, [...] "If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income." [...] Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.|$|E

2500|$|Orthodox Marxists such as Andrew Kliman have decried a [...] "physicalist" [...] {{interpretation}} of value along Sraffian lines, but their own {{interpretation of}} profit was (arguably) [...] "physicalist", because, basing themselves on value-added statistics, they tacitly permitted only {{the existence of}} profits that appear out of a physical increase in the stock of new goods and services newly produced. Profit income from asset transactions was largely disregarded. However, in his 2014 work, Kliman et al. compared the profits of US financial and <b>non-financial</b> corporations using national accounts data, in order to {{argue that it is}} not financialization which has depressed productive investment, but that instead the real cause is the falling rate of industrial profit of <b>non-financial</b> corporations.

2500|$|Organizations {{have used}} systems {{consisting}} of a mix of financial and <b>non-financial</b> measures to track progress for quite some time.
