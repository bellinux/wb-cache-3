5000|$|After {{arriving}} in the United States, Davis is forced to confront Crofton after finding that the race's purse has been halved from US$100,000 to $50,000. Woodcock soon clashes with Davis over the new trainers softer methods and sometimes non-cooperative ways, including taking Phar Lap away from a press conference and back to his stable before the conference was finished. When questioned by Crofton about sacking Woodcock, Davis explains that [...] "If I did the goddamn horse would sit in his stall for the next month and cry". Woodcock also doesn't listen to advice about different horse shoes to suit the different track surface and Phar Lap badly cracks his front right hoof further hampering his preparation for the big race. Before the race word gets out that some jockeys may have been bribed to keep him boxed into the rails during the race not allowing him to win and keep gamblers from losing {{large amounts of money}} so Davis instructs Billy Elliot to lead from the start. Behind Davis's back, Woodcock immediately counters this by telling Elliot to run Phar Lap's <b>normal</b> <b>race</b> of <b>starting</b> slow and finishing fast. Using Woodcock's advice (which initially angers Davis), Phar Lap wins the Agua Caliente Handicap in Mexico, blood streaming from a split hoof. He dies soon after, in suspicious circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|Räikkönen {{continued}} {{from the}} second stint of pit stops to take the win {{a couple of seconds}} ahead of Alonso. It was Räikkönen's second straight win after being victorious at the French Grand Prix the week before. Alonso, finishing second, told the Spanish press that he was adamant that he would catch up with Hamilton in the drivers championship saying that, [...] "With <b>normal</b> <b>races,</b> sooner or later I will close the gap. I must always be one step higher than him on the podium." [...] The British driver finished third to lose two points in the championship to the chasing Alonso, but also achieving his ninth podium out of nine <b>race</b> <b>starts,</b> equalling Jim Clark's record.|$|R
