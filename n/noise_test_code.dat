40|$|The idea {{of using}} mixing {{enhancement}} to reduce jet noise is not new. Lobed mixers have been around since shortly after jet noise became a problem. However, these designs were often a post-design fix that rarely was worth its weight and thrust loss from a system perspective. Recent advances in CFD and some inspired concepts involving chevrons have shown how mixing enhancement can be successfully employed in noise reduction by subtle manipulation of the nozzle geometry. At NASA Glenn Research Center, this recent success has provided an opportunity to explore our paradigms of jet noise understanding, prediction, and reduction. Recent advances in turbulence measurement technology for hot jets have also greatly aided our ability to explore the cause and effect relationships of nozzle geometry, plume turbulence, and acoustic far field. By studying the flow and sound fields of jets with various degrees of mixing enhancement and subsequent noise manipulation, {{we are able to}} explore our intuition regarding how jets make <b>noise,</b> <b>test</b> our prediction <b>codes,</b> and pursue advanced noise reduction concepts. The paper will cover some of the existing paradigms of jet noise as they relate to mixing enhancement for jet noise reduction, and present experimental and analytical observations that support these paradigms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Lack of {{effective}} usage examples in API documents {{has been proven}} to be a great obstacle to API learning. To deal with this issue, several approaches have been proposed to automatically extract usage examples from client code or related web pages, which are unfortunately not available for newly released API libraries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to mining API usage examples from <b>test</b> <b>code.</b> Although <b>test</b> <b>code</b> can be a good source of usage examples, the issue of multiple test scenarios might lead to repetitive and interdependent API usages in a test method, which make it complicated and difficult to extract API usage examples.

30|$|Software {{projects}} {{often include}} <b>test</b> <b>code.</b> Test code may contain bugs, which, in theory, may be reported just like production code. However, bug localization algorithms should not include <b>test</b> <b>code</b> within their scope. Consider, for instance, three bug reports, whose resolution involved the modification of (i) only production <b>code</b> (no <b>test</b> code); (ii) production and test code; and (iii) only <b>test</b> <b>code.</b> In the first case, {{it is obvious}} that localization does not benefit from considering <b>test</b> <b>code.</b> When the resolution of a bug requires changing production and <b>test</b> <b>code</b> (second case), it is usually because a test was added or modified to catch the referred bug in the future. Test code was not the source of the failure, though. Therefore, modified test files are not what developers expect as an answer from the localization algorithm in this case. Finally, when a bug in the <b>test</b> <b>code</b> itself is caught (third case), developers already have detailed information provided by the test framework, which includes the location of the bug. Thus, even if a developer chooses to report a test bug instead of fixing it immediately, it is likely that this report will include the detailed information already provided by the test framework. Therefore, bug reports on <b>test</b> <b>code</b> are rarer (because the developer may choose to fix the bug instead of reporting it) and likely to be localized (because test frameworks already indicate the buggy files). This rationale led us to restrict the localization to production code.|$|R

Methods: This was a tool-making research that had 3 main stages: development of the Persian version of the Consonant-Vowel in <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> (4 lists and each list in 5 different signal to noise ratio), examination of its content validity, and its administration on a total of 50, 18 to 25 year normal hearing individuals (20 men / 30 women) that selected by random sampling method, in order to examine the reliability of the test from the students of the University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences, Tehran, Iran. For descriptive reports, central tendencies and indices of dispersion were used and for statistics relations; Pearson correlation test, intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), paired t-test and independent t-test were used.
