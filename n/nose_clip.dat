40|$|The {{effect of}} hop aroma on {{perceived}} bitterness intensity, character and temporal profile of beer was investigated. A hop aroma extract was added at 3 levels (0, 245, 490 mg/L) to beers at low, medium and high bitterness. Beers were evaluated for perceived bitterness intensity, harshness, roundedness and linger by a trained panel using a rank-rating technique at each bitterness level, {{with and without}} <b>nose</b> <b>clips.</b> The use of <b>nose</b> <b>clips</b> enabled the olfactory aspect to be decoupled from taste and mouthfeel aspects of bitterness perception. Results showed significant modification of perceived bitterness in beer by hop aroma depending on the inherent level of bitter-ness. These modifications were mainly driven by olfaction – in an example of taste-aroma interactions, as well as certain tactile sensations elicited by the hop aroma extract in the oral cavity. At low bitterness, beers with hop aroma added were perceived as more bitter, and of ‘rounded’ bitterness character relative to those without hop aroma. When judges used <b>nose</b> <b>clips,</b> this effect was completely eliminated but the sample was perceived to have a ‘harsh’ bitterness character. Conversely, at high bitterness, even when <b>nose</b> <b>clips</b> were used, judges still perceived beers containing hop aroma to be more bitter. These increases in bitterness perception with <b>nose</b> <b>clips</b> indicates the stimulating of other receptors, e. g. trigeminal receptors by hop aroma extract, which {{in tandem with the}} high bitterness, cause perceptual interactions enhancing bitterness intensity and also affecting bitterness character. Bitterness character attributes such as ‘round’ and ‘harsh’ were found to significantly depend on bitterness and aroma levels, with the second level of aroma addition (245 mg/L) giving a ‘rounded’ bitterness in low bitterness beers but ‘harsh’ bitterness in high bitterness beers. The impact of aroma on temporal bitterness was also confirmed with time-intensity measurements, and found to be mostly significant at the highest level of hop aroma addition (490 mg/L) in low bitterness beers. These findings represent a significant step forward in terms of understanding bitterness flavour perception and the wider impact of hop compounds on sensory perception...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether {{respiratory}} muscle {{training is}} of benefit {{to patients with}} chronic airflow limitation is controversial. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of resistance breathing training on physiological and functional measures in patients with chronic airflow obstruction. METHODS: The design was a randomised, double blind, controlled trial with a six month follow up. Eighty two patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of less than 70 % predicted, and an FEV 1 /vital capacity ratio of less than 0. 7, were randomised to receive training for 10 minutes five times daily with progressively larger resistances through a resistive breathing device (PFLEX) as tolerated or to a sham device which gave minimal resistance. The main outcome measures, respiratory muscle strength and endurance, a progressive exercise test, a six minute walk test and physical and emotional function (chronic respiratory questionnaire) were assessed at monthly intervals. Patients in both groups were also randomised to wear or not wear <b>nose</b> <b>clips</b> during their training. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between treatment and control groups, with or without <b>nose</b> <b>clips,</b> for any of the outcomes. Confidence intervals on the difference between treatments were narrow, excluding clinically important difference in any major outcome. CONCLUSION: This training regimen fails to strengthen respiratory muscles or improve exercise or functional capacity in patients with chronic airflow limitation...|$|R

40|$|Single {{concentrations}} of six odorants (eugenol, heptyl alcohol, nonanal, 1 -octanol, dl-menthol, valeric acid) {{were selected to}} be trigeminal stimuli, based upon previous studies done through anosmics (individuals that lack a functional olfactory system). The stimuli were presented in random order three time each in vapor-phase either retronasally or oral-cavity-only. They were identified on a digital computer by 20 subjects (ages 18 to 35, 9 females). Retronasal presentations were produced by inhaling via the mouth with a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> closing the nostrils, and then removing the <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> and exhaling from the nose. Oral-cavity-only presentations were produced by inhalation via the mouth with a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> closing the nostrils, and exhalation from the mouth with the <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> remaining in place. This study investigates if subjects could identify odorants when restricted to the oral-cavity-only using the same identifiers of the odorants when presented retronasally. RESULTS: Median percent retronasal correct identifications [correct identification terms are shown in brackets] were: eugenol, 100 % [cloves or spice]; heptyl alcohol, 67 % [cleaner]; nonanal, 58 % [citrus or floral]; 1 -octanol, 71 % [citrus or cleaner]; dl-menthol, 100 % [ointment or peppermint]; valeric acid, 67 % [rancid or sweat]. Median percent correct oral-cavity-only identifications were all 0 %, except for dl-menthol, for which percent correct oral-cavity-only median correct identification was 67 %. A Friedman Non-Parametric ANOVA statistical analysis showed significant difference between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal. Pairwise comparisons showed significant differences between odorants presented oral-cavity-only versus retronasal for all odorants except for dl-menthol. CONCLUSIONS: Many vapor-phase 'trigeminal' odorants can be identified only when access to the nasal cavity (retronasal) occurs, but substantial correct identification of vapor-phase dl-menthol also occurs when restricted to the oral cavity (oral-cavity-only). Odorants similar to dl-menthol may contribute to flavor from both the oral and nasal cavities...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} {{was to examine the}} {{influence}} of aroma and tasting temperature, on the detection of and difference sensitivity for fat content in cottage cheese. The detection (DetT) and difference (DiffF) thresholds were determined in 4 different conditions defined by a combination of two factors, each involving two variables: a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> (with or without) and the tasting temperature (7 C or 15 C). Forty non-trained panelists participated in this study. Thresholds were determined using two-alternative forced-choice (2 -AFC) tests in ascending concentration series. Individual thresholds were calculated using the Best Estimate Threshold (BET) method. An increase in tasting temperature induced a decrease in the DetT and Difff, while the use of a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> led to an increase in both thresholds. A hierarchical cluster analysis evidenced three homogeneous subsets of subjects with contrasting sensitivity profiles: subsets 1 (n = 7) and 2 (n = 9) were characterized by high and low DetT and Diffr values, respectively, for all conditions, while a larger third subset (n = 24) included subjects with medium thresholds values that varied from one condition to another.

For the young, threshold sensitivity {{was unrelated to}} supra-threshold intensity for all tastants and in all experimental conditions. For the elderly, {{in a few cases}} a relationship was found between threshold sensitivity and suprathreshold intensity, but only when subjects wore a <b>nose</b> <b>clip.</b> The optimally preferred concentration did not differ between the elderly and the young when the products were tasted without a <b>nose</b> <b>clip,</b> except for both sweet tastants, where elderly men showed a higher optimally preferred concentration than did the young. The optimally preferred concentration did not depend on the pleasantness of the foods and was unrelated to threshold sensitivity, but did show a negative correlation with the supra-threshold intensity of sucrose, aspartame and citric acid for the elderly and of NaCl, sucrose and caffeine for the young. This study does not support the assumption that age-related loss of taste sensitivity will inevitably lead to a preference for taste-enhanced foods...|$|E

40|$|Background and objective: Diaphragmatic {{breathing}} patterns under resistive loading remain poorly documented. To our knowledge, this is {{the first}} study assessing diaphragmatic motion under conditions of inspiratory resistive loading with the use of sonography. Methods: We assessed diaphragmatic motion during inspiratory resistive loading in 40 healthy volunteers using M-mode sonography. In phase I of the study, sonography was performed during normal quiet breathing without respiratory loading. In phase II, sonography was performed after application of a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> and connection of the subjects to a pneumotachograph through a mouth piece. In phase III, the participants were assessed while subjected to inspiratory resistive loading of 50 cm H 2 O/L/s. Results: Compared with baseline, the application of a mouth piece and <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> induced a significant increase in diaphragmatic excursion (from 1. 7 to 2. 3 cm, P < 0. 001) and a decrease in respiratory rate (from 13. 4 to 12. 2, P < 0. 01). Inspiratory resistive loading induced a further decrease in respiratory rate (from 12. 2 to 8. 0, P < 0. 01) and a decrease in diaphragmatic velocity contraction (from 1. 2 to 0. 8 cm/s, P < 0. 01), and also an increase in tidal volume (from 795 to 904 mL, P < 0. 01); diaphragmatic excursion, however, did not change significantly. Conclusions: Inspiratory resistive loading induced significant changes in diaphragmatic contraction pattern, which mainly consisted of decreased velocity of diaphragmatic displacement with no change in diaphragmatic excursion. Tidal volume, increased significantly; the increase in tidal volume, along with the unchanged diaphragmatic excursion, provides sonographic evidence of increased recruitment of extradiaphragmatic muscles under inspiratory resistive loading...|$|E

The Zrs was recorded for approximately 20  s (5 – 6 respiratory cycles) while the patients firmly supported their cheeks with their palms in the sitting position using a <b>nose</b> <b>clip</b> with the neck in a comfortable neutral posture. Upper airway artifacts resulting from glottal changes, air leaks, and cheek support techniques during measurements significantly affect the impedance results (Peslin et al. 1985; Uchida et al. 2013; Bikov et al. 2015). Therefore, such upper airway artifacts were carefully eliminated. Three to five technically acceptable measurements were performed as recommended in the guidelines (Oostveen et al. 2003).|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} nonoral sensations, such as visual texture and odor, {{on the size}} of the first bite were {{investigated}} in a series of studies using specially constructed food delivery cups with lower, from which custards were ingested ("ingested custard"), and upper, from which a custard was viewed and/or smelled ("upper custard") compartments. Ingested and upper custards were either the same or different. Bite size was defined as the weight of custard sucked out of the lower compartment during a single suck through an 11 -mm diameter straw. The results from the first study indicated that the recognition of oral qualities of custards via vision or olfaction determined the size of the first bite. When this recognition was favorable, e. g., when the upper custard was known to be creamy, a relatively large bite was taken, irrespective of the custard that was actually ingested. When this recognition was unfavorable, a relatively small bite was taken. The second study showed that when recognition was prevented by modifications of the upper custard's color, odor, or visual texture, bite size was determined by the oral qualities of the ingested custard. This was confirmed in a third study, where the oral characteristics of the ingested custard were varied by adding a flavorant (benzaldehyde) and/or by using <b>nose</b> <b>clips</b> to eliminate retronasal smelling. Bite sizes decreased significantly when these variations reduced creaminess. Odor and visual texture characteristics of the upper custard significantly affected the perception of creaminess and other attributes related to the food's viscosity, melting, and thickness. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|SummaryChronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) patients have increased neutrophils and macrophages in their lungs, and {{inflammation of the}} airway is related to oxidative stress. This study assessed the levels of 8 -isoprostane (an oxidative stress marker) and chemokines related to neutrophil and monocyte inflammation (growth-related oncogene α [GROα] and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 [MCP- 1]) in the airway of ex-smoking COPD patients by exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection. Thirty-two (28 males) stable COPD patients (14 with FEV 1 ⩾ 50 % [Group 1], 18 with FEV 1 < 50 % predicted [Group 2]) and 18 non-smoking age and sex-matched controls were studied in this cross-sectional study. EBC was collected using the EcoScreen (Jaeger, Germany) during 10 min of tidal breathing with the <b>nose</b> <b>clipped.</b> Concentrations of 8 -isoprostane, GROα and MCP- 1 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. COPD patients had a higher concentration of 8 -isoprostane than controls (COPD versus control, P< 0. 001; Group 1 versus Group 2, P= 0. 045). 8 -isoprostane increased across the groups from normal, Group 1 to Group 2 (r= 0. 64, P< 0. 001). The median intraquartile range (IQR) levels in pg/ml for GROα were 45. 3 (44. 5 – 46. 5), 45. 4 (44. 5 – 46. 0), 46. 0 (45. 6 – 47. 3), whereas MCP- 1 levels were 5. 3 (5. 2 – 5. 9), 6. 2 (5. 4 – 6. 9) and 5. 7 (5. 5 – 6. 4) in Group 1, Group 2 COPD and control subjects, respectively. GROα level was lower in COPD patients when compared to controls (P= 0. 01). MCP- 1 level did not differ between COPD and the control group. 8 -isoprostane level, but not GROα and MCP- 1, in EBC was increased in COPD patients with poorer lung function. This suggests an increased oxidative stress in the airway in patients with more severe COPD...|$|R
