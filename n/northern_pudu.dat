50|$|The {{park has}} one of Colombia's highest {{biodiversity}} indices and {{a high number of}} endemic and endangered species, this due to low human activity in the area and diversity of thermal levels. Some 500 species of birds have been recorded in the area, 37 of which are hummingbirds. Noteworthy birds include long-wattled umbrellabird and the colorful puffleg, the latter being endemic to the region. The park is also home to 182 mammals, among them spectacled bears, pumas, jaguars, <b>northern</b> <b>pudú,</b> South American coati, scaly-footed small-eared shrew, porcupines and three species of ocelot. Other species include 71 amphibians, 70 bats and 55 butterfly species (all belonging to the Satyrinae subfamily). Western Andes toad is only known from the park. In 2003 a new species of wren was found in the area and named Munchique wood-wren after the park.|$|E
50|$|Deer {{constitute}} {{the second most}} diverse family after bovids. Though of a similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers, which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids. Characteristics typical of deer include long, powerful legs, a diminutive tail and long ears. Deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportions. The largest extant deer is the moose, which is nearly 2.6 m tall and weighs up to 800 kg. The elk stands 1.4 - 2 m at the shoulder and weighs 240 - 450 kg. On the contrary, the <b>northern</b> <b>pudu</b> is the smallest deer in the world; it reaches merely 32 - 35 cm at the shoulder and weighs 3.3 - 6 kg. The southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier. Sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced - in most species males tend to be larger than females, and, except for the reindeer, only males possess antlers.|$|E

The antlers, which are shed annually, can extend from 6.5 to 7.5 cm in length and protrude from between the ears. Also on the head are large preorbital glands.

40|$|La dieta de Puma concolor es ampliamente conocida a {{lo largo de}} su distribución, sin embargo, en Colombia no se ha realizado ningún estudio sobre sus hábitos alimentarios. Entre 2007 - 2009, la dieta de puma fue analizada en el Parque-Nacional-Natural-Puracé, sur occidente de los Andes colombianos. Ítems alimenticios de cinco especies presa fueron identificadas en su dieta; el venado conejo (Pudu mephistophiles) es la presa más importante. Como herramienta complementaria para la identificación de huesos y pelos contenidos en heces (n= 60), se instalaron seis cámarastrampa en lugares estratégicos, para {{registrar}} la presencia de pumas y presas potenciales. El descubrimiento de la dependencia de los pumas con el pudú sugiere una única adaptación de los pumas de paramo a la disponibilidad de presas y resalta su importancia como reguladores de las poblaciones presa. Estos resultados contribuyen a incrementar el poco conocimiento sobre la ecología de pumas de los Andes, de sus presas y de las especies en su conjunto en Colombia. Obtener información sobre el grupo de presas de pumas en diferentes ecosistemas, es esencial para entender los requerimientos regionales para su supervivencia y diseñar acciones de conservación que permitan seguir/evaluar las necesidades particulares de áreas protegidas en toda su distribución. Food {{habits of}} Puma concolor (Carnivora: Felidae) in the Parque Nacional Natural Puracé,Colombia. Neotropical puma (Puma concolor) diet is scarcely known, in particular that of mountain dwelling individuals from Northern South America. This is the first study on pumas from the paramo and the first puma diet analysis for Colombia. The puma diet was studied from 2007 to 2009 in the Puracé National Park in the South Colombian Andes. Paramos are unique neotropical high altitude ecosystems which store and regulate water, and are currently threatened by agricultural expansion and climate change. Seven latrines were monitored {{for three years and}} scat collected, washed and dried. Items in scat such as hair, bones, claws and others were separated. Hairs were inspected by microscopy and compared to voucher hair museum specimens. Bone fragments, claws and teeth were also compared to museum collections and identified wherever possible. Additionally, six cameras were set along game trails to document puma and potential prey presence in the area. Food items from five species were identified in 60 puma scats; <b>Northern</b> <b>Pudu</b> (Pudu mephistophiles) was the most important prey in their diet. A total of 354 camera trap-nights photographed a male and female puma, <b>Northern</b> <b>pudu</b> and Spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). The main conclusion suggests a strong dependence of puma on the threatened and mysterious <b>Northern</b> <b>Pudu</b> in paramo habitats. This behavior might reflect restricted prey availability in the high Andes mountains of Colombia, and highlights the plasticity in the puma diet. Conservation actions in the paramo should thus, focus on focal wild species, and in particularly those that show a relationship, such as the one evidenced here with the dependence of puma on <b>Northern</b> <b>Pudu.</b> These findings contribute to increase the little known ecology of Andean puma populations and the species as a whole in Colombia. Baseline data on puma prey populations in different ecosystems throughout their range, is critical to understand the regional requirements for survival, and design conservation actions, to follow and evaluate the need for particular protected areas along their geographical gradients.
