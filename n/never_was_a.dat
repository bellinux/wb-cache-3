That if he corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward to bear witnesses? That if the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? In point of fact, Socrates indicates relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.|$|E

25|$|The Church of England {{was legally}} {{established}} in the colony in 1619, and the Bishop of London sent in 22 Anglican clergyman by 1624. In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, {{in addition to the}} salary of the minister. There <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry, consisting of gentry laymen controlled the parish. By the 1740s, the Anglicans had about 70 parish priests around the colony.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I can see, it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|E

[...] A media-only single, [...] "Stuck Inside a Cloud", which Leng described as [...] "a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality", achieved number 27 on Billboards Adult Contemporary chart.

500|$|The messenger, however, {{does not}} reach Romeo and, instead, Romeo learns of Juliet's {{apparent}} death from his servant, Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary {{and goes to}} the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two [...] "star-cross'd lovers". The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud.

500|$|Ibis, {{reviewing}} the Memoir of Thomas Bewick, written by himself in 1862, compares {{the effect of}} Bewick and Gilbert White, writing [...] "It was the pages of Gilbert White and the woodcuts of Bewick which first beguiled the English schoolboy to the observation of our feathered friends", and [...] "how few of our living naturalists but must gratefully acknowledge their early debt to White's 'History' and to the life-like woodcuts of Bewick!" [...] The reviewer judges that [...] "Probably we shall not wrong the cultivated annalist of Selborne by giving {{the first place to}} Bewick." [...] However, comparing them as people, [...] "Bewick has not the slightest claim to rank with Gilbert White as a naturalist. White was what Bewick <b>never</b> <b>was,</b> <b>a</b> man of science; but, if no naturalist, Bewick was a lover of nature, a careful observer, and a faithful copier of her ever-varying forms. In this, and in this alone, lies his charm." ...|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead you to a very dangerous position...

[...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there <b>never</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism.

Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

500|$|Forrest Wickman of Slate {{wrote of}} Northup's book giving a more {{favorable}} account of the author's onetime master, William Ford, than the McQueen film.

[...] The movie, however, according to Wickham, [...] "frequently undermines Ford." [...] McQueen undercuts Christianity itself as well, in an effort to update the ethical lessons from Northup's story for the 21st century, by holding the institutions of Christianity up to the light for their ability to justify slavery at the time. Northup was a Christian of his time, writing of his former master being [...] "blinded" [...] by [...] "circumstances" [...] that in retrospect meant a racist acceptance of slavery despite being a Christian, a position untenable to Christians now and to Christian abolitionists of the 19th century but not contradictory to Northup himself. Valerie Elverton Dixon in The Washington Post characterized the Christianity depicted in the movie as [...] "broken".|$|E
