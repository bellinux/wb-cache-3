50|$|When {{the bill}} of lading {{is used as a}} {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types of bill of lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight bill of lading and order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> that is not negotiable. In this case, {{the bill of}} lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. Order bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or <b>named</b> <b>consignee.</b> Therefore, an order bill of lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|E
5000|$|Simply, {{the bill}} of lading confers prima facie title over the goods to the <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> or lawful holder. Under the [...] "nemo dat quod non habet" [...] rule ("no one gives what he doesn't have"), a seller cannot pass better title than he himself has; so if the goods are subject to an {{encumbrance}} (such as a mortgage, charge or hypothec), or even stolen, {{the bill of}} lading will not grant full title to the holder.|$|E
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or {{air waybill}} are not documents of title to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|E
50|$|Colonial merchants, {{some of them}} smugglers, {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the protests. Because the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, it threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business. Legitimate tea importers who had not been <b>named</b> as <b>consignees</b> by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act. Another major concern for merchants was that the Tea Act gave the East India Company a monopoly on the tea trade, and it was feared that this government-created monopoly might be extended in the future to include other goods.|$|R
50|$|Dangerous goods {{shipments}} {{also require}} a special declaration form {{prepared by the}} shipper. Among the information that is generally required includes the shipper's name and address; the <b>consignee's</b> <b>name</b> and address; descriptions {{of each of the}} dangerous goods, along with their quantity, classification, and packaging; and emergency contact information. Common formats include the one issued by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for air shipments and the form by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for sea cargo.|$|R
50|$|The {{goods in}} the air {{consignment}} are consigned directly to the party (the <b>consignee)</b> <b>named</b> in the letter of credit (L/C). Unless the goods are consigned to a third party like the issuing bank, the importer can obtain the goods from the carrier at destination without paying the issuing bank or the consignor. Therefore, unless a cash payment has been received by the exporter or the buyer's integrity is unquestionable, consigning goods directly to the importer is risky.|$|R
40|$|A {{straight}} or {{non-negotiable bill}} of lading is a {{bill of lading}} which is made out to a <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> only. Under English law this bill – although physically transferable from the shipper to the <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> – cannot be endorsed by the latter to a third party on-buyer. On the other hand the position under American law is different and allows the transferability of the non-negotiable bill by delivery and agreement to transfer title to the bill or to the goods represented by it (49 USC 80106). This article investigates the English and the American approach {{on the issue of}} transferability and negotiability of straight bills of lading and places this significant difference between two major Common Law jurisdictions in its proper context, i. e. the sale of commodities. Three questions are addressed: (a) can a straight bill of lading be tendered by the seller to its buyer for payment? (b) Can a straight bill be tendered under the newly adopted Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) ? And (c) does the buyer need to present the straight bill to the carrier in order to obtain redelivery of the cargo carried under it...|$|E
40|$|The concept “right of control” {{virtually}} {{has been}} widely used in other transport modes than carriage of goods by sea. It has been regulated, for example, in Warsaw and Montreal convention on air transportation, COTIF-CIM convention on rail transportation and CMR convention on road transportation, whereas this subject has never been dealt with in maritime conventions. Features of the modes results {{in the development of}} the documentary rules applicable for the transport documents towards various directions. Compared with other transport practice, goods carried by sea are often resold many times before its arrival at the destination. In order to carter for this characteristic of maritime transport, a bill of lading system has been developed which helps the traders to transfer the property rights in goods. A traditional bill of lading representing the goods then gives a constructive possession of the goods to its holder. By presenting the bill to the carrier, the holder can demand delivery of goods from the latter. The transfer of the bill means the transfer of the constructive possession of goods. Thus who has the possession of the bill actually has the control of the goods. With the overwhelming improvement of the shipping industry and consequent shortening of the time used for each voyage, the use of bills of lading in many trades is rapidly decreasing or has entirely disappeared. Instead sea waybills or other non-negotiable transport documents are more and more appreciate especially where there is no requirement for financing security. Besides, the multimodal transport documents used in the container logistic and multimodal transport can hardly fit in with the concept of traditional bill of lading so as to provide a document of title function, which means a document relating to goods the transfer of which operate as a transfer of the constructive possession of the goods, and may operate as a transfer of the property in them. Furthermore, e-commerce systems have also a swift tendency with utilization in the maritime transport. The characteristics of these transport documents distinguish from each other (e. g. negotiable or non-negotiable, documentary or electronic), yet they are endowed with (or at least related with), by agreement or by statute, one common and significant feature—the control of goods. Normally the control of goods in transit includes: (a) The right to give or modify instructions in respect of the goods that do not constitute a variation of the contract of carriage; (b) The right to demand delivery of the goods before their arrival at the place of destination; and (c) The right to replace the consignee by any other person. Although there are rules peculiar to the use of certain transport document, the aspect of right of control, which is given by the document to the parties interested in the contract of carriage, has not been paid much attention on in the maritime law context. There are no uniform rules on this subject on an international scale. Consequently, practices on this point diverge very much in different jurisdictions. Furthermore, the existent rules on right of control for certain documents often cannot provide clear guidance on problems associated with the distribution of right of control and the liability of the carrier in relation to the execution of instruction of the party who has the right of control. Cases in this respect can be found in both England and China. Take the sea waybill for instance, one of the merit of sea waybill that the shipper can, at any time before delivery, direct the carrier to deliver the goods to a person other than the <b>named</b> <b>consignee.</b> The carrier would, prima facie, be obliged to comply with this order since normally the contract would be construed as one to deliver to the <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> or to such other person as the shipper might direct. There is then a conflict which needs to be resolved. On the one hand, the shipper wishes to retain his rights of disposal at any time before delivery. On the other hand, the <b>named</b> <b>consignee</b> wants delivery made to him in accordance with the carrier’s undertaking. The carrier will not wish to resolve the conflict in favor of either in case he is liable to the other. Neither the existing conventions on carriage by air, road and rail provide clear guidance on this problem, nor do the CMI rules. The above reasons constitute the primary rationale for the thesis, ‘‘Right of Control’’. Upon the call for a comprehensive solution on the subject ‘‘right of control’’, the recent UNCITRAL draft convention on transport law has provided a set of brand new rules for this subject. Chapter 11 concerns the concept of right of control and the transfer of the rights. Can it provide a proper normative predictability for all the traders interested in a contract of carriage? Can it provide sufficient guidance for the problems which already exist? Does it facilitate a fair weighting of the diverse interests involved? Is it sufficiently clear? Is it applied consistently? Are there significant gaps? Can it fit in with the future documentary development? All these factors underline the need for this thesis...|$|E
500|$|News of the Tea Act {{set off a}} {{firestorm}} of protest in the colonies. This was not a dispute about high taxes; the price of legally imported tea was actually reduced by the Tea Act. Protesters were instead concerned {{with a variety of}} other issues. The familiar [...] "no taxation without representation" [...] argument remained prominent, along with the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies. Some colonists worried that, by buying the cheaper tea, they would be conceding that Parliament had the right to tax them. The [...] "power of the purse" [...] conflict was still at issue. The tea tax revenues were to be used to pay the salaries of certain royal officials, making them independent of the people. Colonial smugglers {{played a significant role in}} the protests, since the Tea Act made legally imported tea cheaper, which threatened to put smugglers of Dutch tea out of business. Legitimate tea importers who had not been <b>named</b> as <b>consignees</b> by the East India Company were also threatened with financial ruin by the Tea Act, and other merchants worried about the precedent of a government-created monopoly.|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic Container Line, being a {{maritime}} carrier of goods, {{introduced a new}} transportation document, which needs some explanations and a juridical analysis. The new document consists of two seperate documents: in the port of loading the shipper of the goods receives a freight receipt, in which all particulars concerning the goods and its transport are duly given. The shipper has a choice: instead of such a freight receipt he may ask for a normal bill of lading. But the conditions of carriage are the same both according to the freight receipt as well as according to the bill of lading. There is only one major difference: the bill of lading may be delivered {{to the order of}} the shipper or to the bill of lading holder, whereas the freight receipt must bear the exact <b>name</b> of the <b>consignee.</b> In consequence the freight receipt is not a document which entitles its holder to dispose of the cargo. The freight receipt is delivered to the shipper and remains in his hands. The freight receipt is being drawn up by the carrier or his agent in the port of loading on a telex apparatus, which has a connection with the carrier's agent apparatus at the port of discharge. There, at the same time, a „notice of arrival" is being written by the telex receiver apparatus. This notice of arrival (of the cargo) is being delivered to the consignee, who with that document in hand may take delivery of the cargo. The whole terminology is a new one. Maritime law does not know a freight receipt (it knows merely a mate's receipt which has other functions) nor a notice of arrival of the cargo in form of a document of title. And therefore the legal status of these two documents, considered together as one document of transport, must be found. According to Polish civil law the two mentioned documents together may be identified with a freight bill, a document which is being met with in other branches of the transportation industry. The prefix „telex" should denote that the document is not transferred in its material form (as a piece of paper) but on„wires" with the aid of electronic apparatus. At the port of discharge the document is being drawn up once more. This facilitates enormously maritime trade if and when a bill of lading is not needed. And a bill of lading is not needed when the partners of the selling contract are in constant contact and have a full confidence that the contract will be fulfilled in the agreed manner and time. Such a situation may be found in relations between enterprises of socialist countries. Therefore the maritime telex freight bills could be successfully used in these countries.
