While the LB method is not as accurate as the pseudo-spectral method, full self-consistent field theoretic simulations of block copolymers on graphoepitaxial templates yield essentially indistinguishable results from pseudo-spectral calculations.

We compare the temperature dependence of peak current, excess current, and conductance slope for interfaces with and without heavy interface defect concentrations. We identify that the tunnel and excess currents depend on temperature and defect density but that the conductance slope, a two-terminal analog to subthreshold slope, depends only on defect density and not temperature, contrasting sharply with the heavy temperature dependence seen in TFETs in literature. We propose that TFETs based on this and similar materials systems are dominated by parasitic effects such as tunneling into oxide trap states, or other parasitics that are not intrinsic to the heterojunction itself, and that in the absence of these effects, the true steepness from band-to-band tunneling is limited by defects and inhomogeneity at the <b>interface.</b> <b>National</b> Science Foundation (U.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} notion of film authorship as a transitory, fluid concept, one {{that is capable of}} {{acquiring}} new meaning and connotations as it shifts between different national, cultural, and cinematic contexts.

This study argues for the viability of the remake as a topic of research through which to consider the (re) positioning of concepts of authorship and the (trans) <b>national,</b> at the <b>interface</b> of postmodern, global/local concerns in film production, reception and interpretation. In particular, this study calls for the recognition of contemporary film authorship, specifically auteurism, as two-tiered ("traditional" and "popular" auteurism as necessarily separate yet interconnected concepts). Following this socio-cultural theoretical discussion, presented in its first two chapters, this study then applies {{the notion of}} authorship as a shifting, transitory concept to a case study of Alejandro Amenábar's Abre los ojos (1997) and its recycled version, Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky (2001). This particular instance of cross-cultural cinematic recycling provides a pertinent illustration {{of the way in which}} contemporary authorial modes are both aligned and demarcated by their distinct cultural, cinematic contexts...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{divergence}} {{is likely}} a major {{driving force in}} evolution. Comparative transcriptomics provides a new glimpse into the evolution of gene regulation. Ascomycota fungi are uniquely suited among eukaryotes for studies of regulatory evolution, because of broad phylogenetic scope, many sequenced genomes, and facility of genomic analysis. Here we review the substantial divergence in gene expression in Ascomycota and how this is reconciled with the modular organization of transcriptional networks. We show that flexibility and redundancy in both cis-regulation and trans-regulation can lead to changes from altered expression of single genes to wholesale rewiring of regulatory modules. Redundancy thus emerges as a major driving force facilitating expression divergence while preserving the coherent functional organization of a transcriptional response. available in PMC 2010 April 12.

40|$|In most LDCS, {{especially}} in {{those which are}} actually industrializing, the public sector is very large and {{plays a key role}} in the development process. The article focuses on large public enterprises, and puts a particular emphasis on the relationship between corporate strategies and national policies. It stemms from a survey of four major sectors of Brazil and Mexico : electricity, oil, steel and telecommunications. The first part shows that beyond their ideological and historical differences Brazil and Mexico follow very similar economic models of development, which are centered on three actors : private national companies, multinational (foreign) corporations, and public enterprises. The first ones are too weak, the second ones are faced with strong nationalism, and thus the last ones inevitably account for a very large part of the overall economic activity. The second part analyzes the strategy of public enterprises and shows how <b>national</b> policies <b>interface</b> with them in a dialectical process. The outcome of that process is seen as largely determined by three different logics : the development stage of the country is more important in the determination of general strategic objectives and of the financing of investment, whereas the particular characteristics of a given sector of activity influences more the product-market and the technological and industrial strategies, social relations and social legitimacy being determined, last but not least, by the specific national culture of each country. In conclusion, the article asserts that if public enterprises know best what the right technico-economical choices should be for them, and if governments should be responsible for the major political choices, the interface between the two is poorly organized, due to a lack of managerial skills in both countries. It therefore suggests that new tools, such as the french «contrats de plan» and others, be experimented over there. Anastassopoulos Jean-Pierre, Blanc Georges. Entreprises publiques et développement.

40|$|A {{multiple}} microfermentor battery {{was designed}} for high-throughput recombinant protein production in Escherichia coli. This novel system comprises eight aerated glass reactors with a working volume of 80 ml and a moving external optical sensor for measuring optical densities at 600 nm (OD 600) ranging from 0. 05 to 100 online. Each reactor can be fitted with miniature probes to monitor temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH. Independent temperature regulation for each vessel is obtained with heating/cooling Peltier devices. Data from pH, DO, and turbidity sensors are collected on a FieldPoint (<b>National</b> Instruments) I/O <b>interface</b> and are processed and recorded by a LabVIEW program on a personal computer, which enables feedback control of the culture parameters. A high-density medium formulation was designed, which enabled us to grow E. coli to OD 600 up to 100 in batch cultures with oxygen-enriched aeration. Accordingly, the biomass {{and the amount of}} recombinant protein produced in a 70 -ml culture were at least equivalent to the biomass and the amount of recombinant protein obtained in a Fernbach flask with 1 liter of conventional medium. Thus, the microfermentor battery appears to be well suited for automated parallel cultures and process optimization, such as that needed for structural genomics projects...|$|R
