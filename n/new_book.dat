5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded {{by one of his}} staff, Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her <b>new</b> <b>book</b> would be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{has said}} it is {{unlikely}} she will write any more books in the Harry Potter series. In October 2007 she stated that her future work was unlikely {{to be in the}} fantasy genre. On 1 October 2010, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Rowling stated a <b>new</b> <b>book</b> on the saga might happen.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} {{success of}} her first book, No Logo (1999), extended author and journalist Naomi Klein's book tour beyond its original two-week schedule. She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> and the pressure to match No Logos success was bearing down upon her. She relented to the pressure for another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this <b>new</b> <b>book</b> to be a sequel or follow-up, but rather a stand alone collection of writing.|$|E
5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>book</b> {{depository}} {{opened in}} South Marston, Swindon in October 2010, and current building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, {{which will be}} renamed the Weston Library when it reopens in 2014–15.

60|$|When {{the young}} lady arrived, he invited her {{to walk into the}} back room to look over some <b>new</b> <b>books</b> he had just got in. If she had known he {{proposed}} to give up the business, she would have thought it rather strange that he should be buying <b>new</b> <b>books.</b> But she knew nothing of his intentions. When she was seated at the table whereon the <b>new</b> <b>books</b> were spread, Mr. Tolman stepped outside of the shop door to watch for Glascow's approach. He soon appeared.|$|R

5|$|In 2008, Gekko is {{promoting}} his <b>new</b> <b>book</b> Is Greed Good?, warning about a coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie, runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore, a top trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob, a protégé of KZI managing director Louis Zabel, has been {{raising money for}} Dr. Masters and his fusion research project, which might create abundant clean energy. Jake is also financially assisting his mother, Sylvia, who has quit nursing to speculate in residential real estate.|$|E
5|$|Morton and {{his colleagues}} {{anticipated}} that copies of the <b>new</b> <b>book</b> would be prepared quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned {{from a trip to}} Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, May 6, 2014, former Yankee Mariano Rivera debuted his <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> The Closer. In it, Rivera {{talks about}} both second baseman Robinson Cano, Rivera's former teammate, and the Red Sox captain Dustin Pedroia. Rivera created {{controversy}} when he stated Cano lacks hustle and heart despite his unending talent {{and that he}} would prefer to pick Pedroia on a team over Cano as a result.|$|E

5|$|That year Znaniecki {{published}} a <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> still mostly philosophical rather than sociological, Cultural Reality. Published in English, {{it was a}} synthesis of his philosophical thought. In New York, Thomas and Znaniecki carried on research for the Carnegie Corporation {{on the process of}} immigrant Americanization. Znaniecki contributed to Thomas' book, Old World Traits Transplanted, and {{published a}}n anonymous solicited article on that topic to the February 1920 Atlantic Monthly.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the novel brought Rand new {{publishing}} opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in The Fountainhead. Though this book was never completed, {{a portion of the}} material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of Reader's Digest. Rand was also able to get an American publisher for Anthem, which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States. When she was ready to submit Atlas Shrugged to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire the <b>new</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tale {{was well}} {{received}} by the Scotsman, but The Times Literary Supplement was not entirely enthusiastic:Among the little books that have become as much a manifestation of autumn as falling leaves, one looks first for whatever Miss Beatrix Potter gives... In her <b>new</b> <b>book...</b> {{although there is no}} diminution in the charm and drollery of the drawings, Miss Potter's fancy is not what it was. The story is inconclusive. Next year we think she must call in a literary assistant. We have no hesitation in calling her pencil perfect.|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the <b>new</b> <b>book</b> should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and flips the car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his <b>new</b> <b>book</b> himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Marshall Poe took a {{leave of}} absence from his {{teaching}} job at the University of Iowa to work full-time on the <b>New</b> <b>Books</b> Network, which he founded. The network describes itself as [...] "a consortium of podcasts dedicated to raising the level of public discourse by introducing serious authors to serious audiences." [...] At first, Poe himself interviewed the authors of <b>new</b> non-fiction <b>books</b> for the website that was then called <b>New</b> <b>Books</b> in History. But the site now has many channels devoted to <b>new</b> <b>books</b> on subjects ranging from African-American studies and economics to philosophy and sports. Poe invites volunteers who are knowledgeable about a subject to conduct [...] "radio interviews" [...] with authors of <b>new</b> <b>books</b> in that subject area. [...] "It's premised on the idea that while most people won't read serious books, they might listen to the authors of those books talk about the ideas in them," [...] Poe told an interviewer. [...] "Reading is hard and inconvenient; listening is easy and convenient. We interview authors with <b>new</b> <b>books,</b> make 'radio shows' out of them, and distribute them on the web as podcasts." [...] Poe added that he would be seeking investors, soliciting donations and looking for business partnerships to pay his salary.|$|R

5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, {{such as the use}} of Thomas Cranmer's <b>new</b> <b>Book</b> of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5|$|Inoculation, {{treatment}} of smallpox: Joseph Needham states that {{a case of}} inoculation for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), yet they rely on a book Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. Wan Quan (1499–1582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox inoculation in his Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. The process of inoculation was also vividly described by Yu Chang in his Yuyi cao (寓意草), or Notes on My Judgment published in 1643, and Zhang Yan in his Zhongdou xinshu (種痘新書), or <b>New</b> <b>book</b> on smallpox inoculation in 1741. As written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (痧痘集解) of 1727, {{which was based on}} Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579, the technique of inoculation to avoid smallpox was not widespread in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567– 1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
