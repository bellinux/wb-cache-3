It was determined that the basic approach was a good design which, with proper implementation of the accumulator, up/down counter and logic should provide accurate mid-bit sampling with symmetric bits. However, when bit asymmetry occurs, the bit synchronizer can lock up with a large timing error, yet be quasi-stable (timing will not change unless the clock and bit sequence drift).

Interestingly, as previously observed in the separation results of section 4.3. 2, the GMM mask estimation ability significantly declines with the introduction of more adverse conditions. For example, in the case of babble noise at a reverberation time of 128 ms, when the SNR is decreased from 25 to 20 dB we note a difference in SIR of almost 5 dB. However, the HKM has a difference of less than 1 dB, and the FCM of just 0.34 dB.

These limitations include degradation of the linearity and span of the locking range in the first- and second-order loops respectively, and the acquisition speed of the first-order loop. The acquisition speed, the circuit complexity, the locking range and the noise performance of the original TDTL architecture were investigated and new improved architectures are proposed. The design, mathematical analysis, and testing results of the proposed architectures are presented. Evaluation using MATLAB/Simulink. of these architectures, under noisy and <b>noise-free</b> <b>environments</b> demonstrated significant improvements in the above performance parameters compared to the original TDTL system. Further, some of the proposed architectures are re-configurable which means that they can be optimized for a given performance parameter to match a given application requirement. In addition, in order to assess the real-time performance of these architectures, some were implemented using FPGA-based (field programmable gate array) development systems. Practical results obtained from those hardware modules concurred with the results obtained from simulation using MA TLAB/Simulink. Additionally, a number of new digital PLL system topologies for synchronizing a voltage source inverter with the low-voltage utility grid were developed and tested. The systems were tested, using MA TLAB/Simulink, under extreme conditions, such as introducing excessive total harmonic distortion (THD) in the grid voltage waveform. Despite the fact that such distortion can significantly falsify the zero-crossings, the proposed architectures were able to establish synchronization in less than 200 ms. In more realistic situations, locking was achieved within 100 ms. Such systems should find applications for interfacing renewable energy generating systems with the low-voltage utility grid.

40|$|Formant {{frequency}} {{estimation of}} speech signals {{plays an important}} role in speech synthesis, compression, and recognition. For example, formant information serves as a significant acoustic feature and offers a phonetic reduction in speech recognition. It plays a vital role in the design of some hearing aids [1]. Free resonances of the vocal-tract (VT) system are called formants. Formants are associated with peaks in the smoothed power spectrum of speech. Among different formant estimation techniques, linear predictive coding (LPC) based methods have received considerable attention [2]. In this case, formant frequencies are computed from the autoregressive (AR) parameters of the VT system. Most of the formant frequency estimation methods, so far reported, deal only with <b>noise-free</b> <b>environments.</b> However, formant estimation from noisy speech signals is difficult but an essential task as far as practical applications are concerned. In order to handle noisy environments, recently in [1], a method based on an adaptive band-pass filter-bank, later referred as AFB method, has been proposed where the estimation accuracy depends on initial estimates. In this paper, we propose a scheme for accurately estimate the formant frequencies of speech signals in a noisy environment. First, a frequency domain noise reduction scheme is proposed. The ACF of the resulting noise-compensated speech signal is then employed in a modified form of least-squares Yule-Walker equations (LSYWE) to estimate poles of the VT system. Finally, a pole selection criterion has been introduced for extracting the desired formants which enables the proposed scheme to avoid errors associated with weak formants. Experimental results on natural and synthetic vowels in the presence of additive white noise are presented. 2. p r o p o s e d m e t h o d The overall vocal-tract (VT) filter can be represented by a P-th order AR system with a transfer function given by H (z) = G A (z) G G 1 - Z a z n (1 - Piz_ 1...|$|R

Estimation uncertainties are simultaneously assessed using repetitions of the input signal (multi-sine sweeps) as the input of a bootstrap procedure. Mathematical foundations and a practical implementation of the method are discussed using an experimental example.

40|$|Vast {{majority}} of wireless appliances used in household, industry and medical field share the ISM frequency band. These devices need to coexist {{and thus are}} challenged to tolerate their mutual interference. One {{way of dealing with}} this is by using frequency hopping; where the device changes its radio channel periodically. Consequently, communications will not suffer from the same interference each time; instead, it should be fairer and more stable. This thesis investigates the aforementioned problem in the field of low power wireless sensor networks and Internet of Things where Contiki OS is used. We introduce a low-power pseudo-random frequency-hopping MAC protocol which is specifically characterized as a duty cycled asynchronous sender-initiated LPL style protocol. We illustrate two flavors of the protocol; one that does not use any dedicated channel and another which allows dedicated broadcast channels that can implement frequency-hopping as well. We implement the protocol in C for real hardware and extensively test and evaluate it in a simulated environment which runs Contiki. It proved to work with Contiki's IPv 6 stack running RPL (the standardized routing protocol for low power and lossy wireless networks). We compare the performance of the implemented protocol to the singlechannel ContikiMAC with varying levels of interference. Results show a reduction down to 56 % less radio-on time (1. 50 % vs. 3. 4 %) and 85 % less latency (306 ms vs. 2050 ms) in the presence of noise, while keeping a good basecost in <b>noise-free</b> <b>environments</b> with 1. 29 % radio duty cycle when using 9 channels with no dedicated broadcast channels (vs. 0. 80 % for single channel) and 252 ms average latency(vs. 235 ms).

Therefore, it is recommended as a good alternative to single channel ContikiMAC in realworld deployments where noise presence is anticipated...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{theoretical}} studies predict that the dynamics of spatially structured populations (metapopulations) can be altered by constant perturbations to local population size. However, these studies presume large metapopulations inhabiting <b>noise-free,</b> zero-extinction <b>environments,</b> and their predictions have never been empirically verified. Here we report an empirical study {{on the effects of}} localized perturbations on global dynamics and stability, using fruitfly metapopulations in the laboratory. We find that constant addition of individuals to a particular subpopulation in every generation stabilizes that subpopulation locally, but does not have any detectable effect on the dynamics and stability of the metapopulation. Simulations of our experimental system using a simple but widely applicable model of population dynamics were able to recover the empirical findings, indicating the generality of our results. We then simulated the possible consequences of perturbing more subpopulations, increasing the strength of perturbations, and varying the rate of migration, but found that none of these conditions were expected to alter the outcomes of our experiments. Finally, we show that our main results are robust to the presence of local extinctions in the metapopulation. Our study shows that localized perturbations are unlikely to affect the dynamics of real metapopulations, a finding that has cautionary implications for ecologists and conservation biologists faced with the problem of stabilizing unstable metapopulations in nature.
