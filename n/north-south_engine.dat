50|$|Designed by AMC, the Premier {{was also}} briefly badged as the AMC Premier and Renault Premier in late 1987 and early 1988. Unusual (for a FWD car) {{in having a}} <b>north-south</b> <b>engine</b> {{mounting}} (presumably to accommodate a future AWD version), it shared several parts with the Renault 25, and spawned a rebadged version named Dodge Monaco (1990-1992); this platform was the building block for the 1993 LH cars (Vision, Dodge Intrepid, etc.).|$|E
50|$|An A40 Farina Mark II was {{introduced}} in 1961. It had a 3.5 in longer wheelbase to increase the space for passengers in the back seats, and the front grille and dashboard were redesigned. The Mark II had more power (37 hp/28 kW) and an SU replaced the previous Zenith carburettor but was otherwise similar mechanically. An anti-roll bar was fitted at the front. The 948 cc engine was replaced {{in the autumn of}} 1962 by a larger 1098 cc version with an output of 48 bhp. The A40 shared this engine with the Morris Minor, which was also rear-wheel drive - both models retaining the traditional <b>north-south</b> <b>engine</b> layout - and also with the recently introduced front-wheel drive, transverse-engined Morris 1100. An improved gearbox was fitted to the A40 at the same time.|$|E
