5000|$|One other {{interesting}} note about the car's propulsion concerned {{the placement of}} the motorman's controls in the cab. Standards stuck with BRT tradition, which placed <b>the</b> train's controller <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> right hand and <b>the</b> brake <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> left. This was in contrast to IRT equipment, which placed <b>the</b> controller <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> left and <b>the</b> brake <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> right. The city owned IND system would emulate the IRT's practice. Meanwhile, later BMT designs would replicate the Standards. Therefore, the controls in subway cars of BRT or BMT design would appear [...] "backwards" [...] to motormen who were acclimated primarily to IRT or IND equipment once the subways had been unified in 1940.|$|R

5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse.
