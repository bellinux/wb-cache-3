It shows the singer {{standing in a}} London street, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the vivid colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. An earlier shoot by Jean-Baptiste Mondino was scrapped; it would later appear in a 1995 article for The Face, in which Björk explained: [...] "It cost £24,000. But <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I want. OK, I admit it, [...] I'm a pop star"! In the original cover picture, Björk was surrounded by silver balls, but she scrapped the cover in favour of something [...] "more poppy". Designer Paul White of Me Company—who had been a frequent collaborator since The Sugarcubes—"surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family". Me Company designed the artwork, while Martin Gardiner modelled the lotus flower used in the album's booklet and packaging. The jacket Björk wears, shown on the cover, was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album's title. It was specially crafted from envelope paper called Tyvek by designer Hussein Chalayan. Björk {{was a friend of}} Chalayan and an admirer of his designs, modelling for him in September 1995. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of a 2015 MoMA retrospective on the singer, titled Björk. Vice has identified the airmail jacket look as one the [...] "ultimate fashion moments" [...] of Björk's career.|$|E

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it {{was that}} I saw. It was a message from Bertha. Mary Phillips had devised the means of sending it. Bertha had sent it.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} I thought that I had heard enough, and slipped away when their backs were turned. For, friend Mahatma, I {{had just seen}} a fox shot, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{shooting}} meant.|$|R
6000|$|But I {{was called}} from earth--yea, called [...] Before my rose-bush grew; [...] And would that <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>What</b> feels he {{of the tree}} I planted, [...] And whether, after I was called [...] To be a ghost, he, as of old, [...] Gave me his heart anew! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By no means. I {{always made}} {{the worst of}} Frampton, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{injustice}} I did him. I never saw greater kindness and unselfishness than he has shown me.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{it is to}} sit enthroned {{amid the}} clouds of sunset as the spirits sit in Blake's pictures. Giddiness took away all {{sensation}} of touch or form, but the sense of blinding color remained.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} the {{pleasure}} of meeting you all again to-morrow," [...] he said, closing the door after Lord Runton. [...] "I won't keep you <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the journey is down from town. Good night, Runton!" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> {{the change}} in Sophy's face was, I could recall it, {{and saw that the}} {{alteration}} in her was not really so great as I had imagined. She certainly looked many years older than she was, but it was the black hair and eyebrows which gave the pale and unnatural appearance to her face, which had so struck me when she first entered the room.|$|R
6000|$|Kit made {{a sign of}} understanding. [...] "Yes; {{you showed}} us how to bring the peat down. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to say. It's awkward ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it <b>now!</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it meant, {{the feeling}} that has haunted me--the sounds I kept hearing--the guns of the ships at sea and the voices calling in distress! I know now. It means, sir, it means--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what has}} this head of yours been doing? Has it been resting {{for ten minutes}} together? <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I am saying, Flora--I warn you, that if you will not give {{yourself}} needful quiet now, you will suffer for it by and by." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't advisin' nobody. If {{you want}} my opinion, I'd say, <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you done fer Mac New, thet he wouldn't {{double-cross}} you. When it comes down under the skin there ain't much difference between outlaws an' other range men in a deal like thet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{was that}} woman once, if all be not a dream. <b>I</b> am <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not <b>what,</b> seeking hospitality--if I can believe {{my eyes and}} ears--of Godiva's son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I made no remark {{to him or}} to the landlord. Nothing roused me <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was coming; <b>I</b> {{waited for}} the end. There was some change visible in me to others, as I suppose, though not {{noticeable}} by myself, which first surprised my husband and then daunted him. When the next night came I heard him lock the door softly in his own room. It didn't matter to me. When the time was ripe ten thousand locks wouldn't lock out what was to come.|$|R
6000|$|The girl shuddered. [...] "Even <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is {{it makes}} me creep," [...] she whispered, as the faint clanking of a distant chain came to their ears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! You mean it's not!' {{returned}} Miss Dartle. 'Well, I'm {{very glad}} to hear it! <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do! That's the advantage of asking. I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy, and so forth, in connexion with that life, any more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George!" [...] I yelled, greatly excited. [...] "I {{heard that}} lion breathing. Don chased him up there. I heard hard, {{wheezing}} breaths somewhere behind me, {{but in the}} excitement I didn't {{pay any attention to}} them. I thought it was Jones panting, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winston {{felt his}} pulses throb faster, for the girl's {{unabated}} confidence stirred him, {{but he looked}} at her gravely. [...] "I wonder if you realize what you have given me in return? Life as I had seen it was very grim and bare--and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> with a little help, it is possible to make of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Taking his hand.] Good-bye, John. You're {{not angry}} with me because I was horrid.... I'm glad {{you told me about}} his wife. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I've treated you shocking, but don't {{leave me}} alone now. You've had your revenge. If you leave me by myself <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> shall do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leaving me {{unable to}} move he began to ascend the pinnacle, calling your {{daughter}} Swallow by sweet names as a man calls a shy horse which he fears will escape him. I watched from below, and even in my pain <b>I</b> laughed, for <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> must come. Since the Swallow did not answer, Bull-Head, wishing to be cunning, crept behind her in silence, and of a sudden seized the cloak and the arm beneath it, for he feared lest she should choose death and cheat him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold, that is enough! Was it round?--and thick?--and had it {{letters and}} devices graved upon it?--yes? Oh, <b>NOW</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> this Great Seal is that there's been such worry and pother about. An' ye had {{described}} it to me, ye {{could have had}} it three weeks ago. Right well I know where it lies; {{but it was not}} I that put it there--first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} through all that," [...] said Dorian, shaking his head, and smiling. [...] "I am {{perfectly}} happy <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> conscience is, to begin with. It {{is not what}} you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous." ...|$|E
60|$|LARRY. Nora. [She {{turns and}} looks at him hardly, without a word. He {{continues}} anxiously, in his most conciliatory tone]. When I left you that time, I was just as wretched as you. I didn't rightly know what I wanted to say; and my tongue kept clacking to cover the loss I was at. Well, I've been thinking ever since; and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I ought to have said. I've come back to say it.|$|E
6000|$|... “Something {{is going}} to happen—is happening, for that matter. I feel it. Something is coming here, to us. It is coming <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> but it is coming.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do you? Then <b>now</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{you think}} of Augustus. We think he is very clever; but <b>I</b> do not <b>know</b> any man who makes himself more popular with young ladies." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{crash and}} a sharp point cut my nose, but I was out upon the grass. Then there were twenty other crashes, and all the hounds were out too, for Tom had cheered them on. I ran {{to the edge of}} the lawn and saw a steep slope leading to the sands and the sea. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the sea was, for after Tom had shot me in the back I lived by it for a long while, and once swam across a little creek to get to my form, from which it cut me off.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I {{could have}} done. I {{can turn out}} a {{quotation}} from Sophocles (by looking to the index) as well as another: I can throw off a bit of fine writing too, with passion, similes, and a moral at the end. What, pray, is the last sentence but one but the very finest writing? Suppose, for example, I had made Maximilian, as he stood {{by the side of}} Catherine, look up towards the clouds, and exclaim, {{in the words of the}} voluptuous Cornelius Nepos, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, my dear. You know that letter {{we had a}} {{fortnight}} ago from Mrs. Conway, and that we puzzled over it a good deal. After talking as usual about her being determined to find the will and set matters straight, she said that we might possibly see her before long, and begged us not to show any surprise or to seem to recognize her. Well, you know, we talked it over, and could make nothing of it. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> she means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is so dreadful," [...] she said, [...] "to {{think that}} I, {{who ought to}} have known you so well--I, your betrothed wife--have been {{thinking}} that you were so mean as to be jealous; for I did think it was that, John, when you made light of the doings of the hero I {{had been thinking about}} so much, and would not allow that he had done anything particular. I thought that you were jealous, John; and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you have done, and why you spoke so, I feel I am altogether unworthy of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack," [...] he resumed, [...] "I'm in a hole. Never troubled {{to ask for}} {{my letters}} {{until late in the}} afternoon, and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do unless you can help me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest father, no, he's not gone, {{nothing is}} gone. I {{have been happy}} and {{contented}}, but I shall be happier and more contented still, <b>now</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are. <b>I</b> am not blind, father, any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oho! Then it is true. 'When Brahm {{ceases to}} dream, the Gods die.' <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> indeed, <b>what</b> he meant. Once, too, the guru {{said as much}} to me; but then I did not understand. <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> am wise.|$|R
