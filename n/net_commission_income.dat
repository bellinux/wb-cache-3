40|$|<b>Net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> {{is one of}} the key {{elements}} of a bank’s core income. In the current low-interest rate environment, this type of income is gaining importance relative to net interest income. This paper analyses the effects of bank and country specific determinants of <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> on a set of cooperative banks from European countries in the 2007 - 2014 period. In order to do that, dynamic panel data methods (system Generalized Methods of Moments) were employed. Subsequently, alternative panel data methods were run as robustness checks of the analysis. Strong positive impact of bank concentration on the share of <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> was found, which proves that cooperative banks tend to display a higher share of fee income in less competitive markets. This is probably connected with the fact that they stick with their traditional deposit-taking and loan-providing model and fees on these services are driven down by the competitors. Moreover, compared to commercial banks, cooperatives do not expand heavily into non-traditional fee bearing services under competition and their overall fee income share is therefore decreasing with the increased competitiveness of the sector...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – to {{find and}} assess {{connection}} between banking sector profitability and real economy data, using panel data, and to display analysis capabilities of dynamic panel data estimation methods. Design/methodology/approach – a panel, or longitudinal data set, consists of a sequence of observations, repeated through time {{on a set of}} statistical units. Panel data and their estimation methods are frequently used in various economic research, as it gives more information than pure cross-section or time series data. Findings – dynamic panel data estimation methods are used to study relationship between income statement items (net interest <b>income,</b> <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> and operating expenses) and macroeconomic variables. Model estimation shows that included macroeconomic variables are significant and there is interaction between banks profitability and real economy. Net interest income are found to be dependent on real investment and short term interest rate, <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> reacts to changes in real gross domestic product (GDP) and operating expenses are connected to real GDP and compensation per employee. Practical implications – the model is used to estimate income statement items changes after the external forecasted macroeconomic impact. The forecasts indicate that banks profitability reacts to changes in macroeconomic situation. Research type: case study...|$|R

Our methodology {{is based on}} stochastic frontier analysis which is run {{on a set of}} 649 European cooperative banks using data between 2006 and 2015. Our results show that average inefficiency of European cooperative banks is increasing since 2008, smaller cooperative banks are significantly more efficient than the bigger ones over the whole time period and that share of <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> to total income surprisingly seems to have no impact on bank cost efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{change of}} banking models over {{last few decades}} {{has led to an}} {{increasing}} share of fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> of banks. In this paper we deal with determinants of banking fees in the European Union with special emphasis on market concentration based on EU- 27 data from 2007 to 2012. For the estimation we use System Generalized Method of Moments, which is appropriate for dynamic panel data, allows for time invariant and lagged dependent variables and is able to deal with endogeneity. We conclude that banks facing higher competition tend to expand more aggressively into non-traditional activities and therefore they report higher fee income shares. Moreover, we found that a higher equity to assets ratio is related with higher shares of fee income since by expanding into non-traditional businesses the bank needs more capital to prevent the potential risks of the new activity. Surprisingly, a high deposits to assets ratio tends to increase the fee income share, which may be possibly attributed to relatively high switching costs and to close relationship between depositor and bank in the EU banking sector. However, macroeconomic conditions do not seem to {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> share...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} both {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of bank fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> in the European Union with a special emphasis on the Czech Republic. Since fee income represents the largest part of non-interest income earned by banks, it remains a major challenge for bank management to set and maintain an appropriate fee policy. However, solving for the optimal fee structure {{has not yet been}} accomplished either on a theoretical level, or in actual practice. In the empirical part of the paper, we analyse banking fee income in EU banking sectors based on three different indicators: the magnitude of <b>net</b> fee and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> relative to total operating income, to total assets and to gross domestic product. Our results show that the Czech banking sector was not abnormally dependent on fee income compared to other EU countries in the period 2007 - 2012. As a result, we argue that the high profitability of Czech banks cannot be attributed to abnormal banking fees and <b>commission</b> <b>income,</b> but rather that other factors should be considered. We also concluded that the market concentration of the Czech banking sector declined since the Herfindahl index decreased in last years. The rise in competition was caused mainly by new entrants we refer to as ‘low-cost banks’ that offer a limited product portfolio and provide a large part of their services without fees and commissions. Consequently, we have determined that the business models of some low cost banks in the Czech Republic are not sustainable from a longer term perspective...|$|R
50|$|Services {{accounted}} for more than 70 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 2004. The sector employed nearly 75 percent of the labor force in 2002.The banking sector is widely regarded as advanced by both regional and international terms. In 2007, total profits of the 15 listed banks rose 14.89% to JD640m ($909m). Jordan’s strong growth of 6% in 2007 was reflected in a 20.57% expansion in net credit to JD17.9bn ($25.4bn) by the end of the year. Most improvement was in trade, construction and industry. Many banks suffered from the sharp correction in the Amman Stock Market in 2006, encouraging them to focus on core banking business in 2007, and this was reflected in a 16.65% rise in <b>net</b> interest and <b>commission</b> <b>income</b> to JD1.32bn ($1.87bn). The stock market also picked up in 2007 and total portfolio income losses decreased. Although Jordan’s banking sector is small by global standards, it has attracted strong interest from regional investors in Lebanon and the GCC. New regulations introduced by the CBJ, in addition to political stability, have helped to create a favourable investment environment. Its conservative policies helped Jordan avoid the global financial crisis of 2009, Jordanian banks was one of the only countries that posted a profit in 2009.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper qualitatively and quantitatively {{assesses the}} degree of {{resilience}} in the financial intermediary sector of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central African States (CEMAC) to macroeconomic shocks and discusses the relevant policy implications. Using GMM and a battery of estimations techniques, the panel-based investigations broadly show that the sub-region is vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks. Lower bank provisions result {{on the one hand}} from shortages or decreases in long-term financing, real exchange, GDP per capita growth rate {{and on the other hand}} from increases of interest rates. Whereas the change in interest rate increases <b>net</b> <b>income</b> <b>commission,</b> the effect is negative from lower levels of short-term financing. The incidence of changes in interest rates on the interest rate margin of banks is ambiguous. The findings broadly confirm the need to incorporate macroeconomic shocks in financial policy decision making.

40|$|This thesis makes three {{different}} {{contributions to the}} literature on bank income diversification {{and its effect on}} bank performance. Firstly, the study makes a theoretical contribution by incorporating non-interest income components into Ho and Saunders (1981) model in the presence of pricing strategies, including bundling and loss-leader strategies, as well as being well-informed and less-informed customers. The model distinguishes fees and <b>commissions</b> <b>income</b> and trade income by proposing the conditions that create the negative relationships with net interest margin. The study also empirically tests the theoretical relationships for the European banking system and the results state that both fees and <b>commissions</b> <b>income</b> and trade income negatively affect interest margin. Secondly, this study examines the relationship between interest and non-interest income sides by considering the switching cost for customers created by loan maturity for non-interest products. Theoretically, the study derives an equation that long-term loans create a switching cost for the sale of non-traditional products. The theoretical contribution is empirically tested for the UK banking system using unique UK banking data over the period 2005 - 2012. The empirical results suggest that by shifting loan maturity from short term to long term creates a switching cost for non-interest product sale. This empirical finding leads to test switching cost created by long-term loan, particularly for trade products. Shifting the maturity from short term to long term creates switching cost for trade products either. Thirdly the study contributes by investigating the aftermath of findings on the relationship between interest and non-interest income sides, and switching cost created by increasing loan maturity. The third study in this thesis contributes to the literature by examining the effect of non-interest income, conditional on deposit and loan maturities, on bank performance using UK banking data as a laboratory from 2005 to 2012. The study finds that fees and <b>commissions</b> <b>income</b> do not explain bank performance. However, when the fees and commissions variables are conditional on longer loan maturity, it alleviates the risk-adjusted bank performance. Trade income increases the bank performance. However when it is dependent on deposits and loans with long maturities, it has an adverse effect on bank performance. The result of direct maturity diversification indicates that, while the UK banks do not benefit from deposit diversification, the maturity diversification of loan is linked to a higher bank performance...|$|R
