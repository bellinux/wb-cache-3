5|$|The {{geological}} features {{near the}} headwaters of Catawissa Creek primarily include anthracite and ridges of sandstone. The valleys {{in this part of}} the watershed are <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> steep. Elsewhere in the watershed, the topography consists mostly of less steep valleys and some hills.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, a notch in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E

50|$|Southward {{the shoe}} becomes {{gradually}} <b>narrower</b> <b>and</b> longer, the largest being the hunting snow-shoe of the Cree, which is nearly 6 ft long {{and turned up}} at the toe. Even smaller models, developed most notably by the Iroquois, are <b>narrower</b> <b>and</b> shorter, reflecting the need for maneuverability in forested areas.|$|R

5|$|The skull {{is small}} and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> {{relatively}} long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate—a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull—is <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase. The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and <b>narrow,</b> <b>and</b> they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E

5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} thicker than that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the inner surface is covered with hollows once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores are long, <b>narrow,</b> <b>and</b> straight.|$|E
5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). The eyes were large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered to be much too <b>narrow,</b> <b>and</b> the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E

By 18 August 1914, two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium, the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun.|$|E
5|$|It is {{expected}} that reopening the station will result in reduced car usage to and from Pill and the surrounding villages. Most station users will walk to the station, with the next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off, followed by cyclists and bus users. Some parking restrictions are proposed to prevent rail users parking on the local streets, which are <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> not suitable for widening.|$|E
5|$|Mantises can be loosely {{categorized}} as being macropterous (long-winged), brachypterous (short-winged), micropterous (vestigial-winged), or apterous (wingless). If not wingless, a mantis has {{two sets of}} wings: the outer wings, or tegmina, are usually <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> leathery. They function as camouflage and as a shield for the hind wings, which are clearer and more delicate.|$|E

5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a fine structure has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> {{structurally}} unsound, leading {{the authorities to}} rename it Chelsea Bridge to avoid the Royal Family's association with a potential collapse. In 1926 it was proposed that the old bridge be rebuilt or replaced, due to the increased volume of users from population growth, {{and the introduction of}} the automobile. It was demolished during 1934–1937, and replaced by the current structure, which opened in 1937.|$|E

5|$|The genus is characterised by large, slender {{workers with}} {{elongated}} mandibles, which are <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> triangular in shape. The mesosoma and appendages are also long. These ants {{are similar in}} appearance to Nothomyrmecia, but can be distinguished from the shape of their node. They also had a powerful sting located in the abdomen. Two of the three species are from the Eocene while the third species is from the Late Oligocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the <b>narrow</b> <b>and</b> faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to aerodynamic drag from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
