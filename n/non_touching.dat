In perfect infor-mation games, they are quite successful for the game of Go which has a huge search space [1]. The UCT algorithm [9] in combination to the incremental development ofa global search tree has enabled Go programs such as C RAZY STONE [2] and MOGO[11] {{to be the best}} on 9 * 9 boards and to become competitive on 19 * 19 boards...|$|E

It generates the virtual information to the real world to the user's perception and interaction to perform the tasks. Graphics, Audio-visual and Interaction (GAI) based mobile Augmented Reality is a Human Computer Interaction technology where user can view the multimedia content (like video, 2 D, 3 D, text, animation) with audio visuals in augmented environment. GAI based mobile AR system allows user to develop their own Augmented Reality applications and games. This system based on Symbian and Android Smartphone where the users can use their Smartphone's camera for real time video capturing and rendering virtual object augmented environments. Users can interact and control the virtual objects by touch in touch enable phone or by button in <b>non</b> <b>touch</b> phone. The general purpose of this technology is to introduce multimedia base Mobile Augmented Reality to user. This paper describes the potential of AR in mobiles and how the various useful features like 2 D/ 3 D object, audio, video can be implemented in Mobile AR...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPandemic is an {{epidemic}} occurring over {{a very wide}} area affecting {{large number of people}} when new strains emerge for which people have very less resistance and there are no readymade vaccines available. Pandemic can spread in {{a short amount of time}} from person to person and especially, the care givers that the patients with flu interact are at higher risk of exposure. Virtual care, leveraging collaboration technologies can be extremely useful in such situations to maintain essential services for patients and communities but limit the risk to your staff that is providing services by enabling social distancing. Leveraging dependent information vectors, analytics can be used to open up local clinics that are closer to affected population and can be operated remotely by providers to provide care at the same time not exposing themselves to the direct contact with patients. We will look at some unique ways that virtual care methods such as Telehealth, m-health and remote care can be leveraged to efficiently reduce the risk. These include, but not limited to such as video analysis based pre-evaluation of patients, remotely controlled lockers for sample collection, gesture and voice based <b>non</b> <b>touch</b> controls...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Central venous access devices {{facilitate}} home {{treatment in}} boys with haemophilia. These are usually fully implanted lines, {{referred to as}} ports. Caregivers are taught to manage the port using sterile techniques and maintaining patency by flushing with saline or heparin solution. National and international guidelines for the home care of ports are lacking. Aim: To evaluate if infection or occlusion rates differ between home care regimens used for ports in children with haemophilia. Methods: Children with ports were identified from the PedNet registry. Data on the homecare policy were acquired from each centre. To ensure a complete data set for each port, only ports that had been removed {{were included in the}} study. Three care groups were defined: ‘aseptic <b>non</b> <b>touch</b> technique’, ‘sterile technique’ and ‘fully sterile technique’. Outcomes within and between the groups were analysed. Results: A total of 240 children with 352 ports were studied. Insertion occurred at a median age of 1. 32 years. The median port duration was 2. 94 years with a total of 215 688 port days in children without and 183 852 in children with inhibitors. Infection was {{the most common cause of}} port removal (34 %); there was no significant difference with infection as reason for removal between the different care groups. Occlusion was not more frequent in centres that did not use heparin. Conclusion: Use of sterile gloves and gowns did not reduce the risk of port infection. Using less stringent sterile techniques for accessing ports is easier for caregivers and in addition may have health economic benefits...|$|R
40|$|A {{community}} of individuals heterogeneous {{in terms of}} revenue occupies a territory subdivided into zones characterized by unequal levels of amenities. Starting from the concept of land rent a la Ricardo, we propose a model determining the bid rents in the diff erent zones {{as well as the}} distribution of the population among these. We then study the impact of a shock a ffecting negatively the amenities in one zone on the rents of the other zones via a process of "voting with the feet" a la Tiebout. Starting from this analysis, we propose a taxation of land rent that allows for a compensation of the residents whose neighborhood is directly a ffected by the amenity shock by {{the other members of the}} community. Such is system may prevent NIMBY attitudes. Moreover, as far as rent is observable, the mechanism has the advantage of having no preference revelation problem.

Nevertheless, this topic is still relatively insufficiently explored. This thesis is aimed on specific example of vulgarity - namely male and female pupils' vulgarity against teachers and not only on verbal vulgarity (curse words). It will be about broader conception containing even non-verbal and paraverbal phenomenons. This thesis explores pupils' vulgarity against teachers through observation and interviews. It brings demarcation of what is manifestation of pupils' vulgarity against teachers, findings that boys compared with girls and older pupils compared to younger ones are more vulgar against teachers. Thesis further presents functions and forms of pupils' vulgarity against teachers, <b>touching</b> (<b>non)</b> reactions of teachers on pupils' vulgarity addressed to them and teachers view on the topic of pupils' vulgarity against teachers and even their view on vulgarity at school in general. At the same time, teachers' (non) reactions on pupils' vulgarity against teachers and on phenomenon of pupils' vulgarity against teachers and even on phenomenon of vulgarity at school in general is viewed from perpective of male and female pupils.

40|$|Background: As life {{expectancy}} gets higher, the demand {{of health services}} for elderly starts to grow. Flexibility worsens as one grows older, while Senam Sehat Indonesia (SSI) is an easy exercise for elderly to promote joint flexibility. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare flexibility of low back and hips, knees and also ankles between SSI-exercising and non SSI-exercising elderly women. Methods: This cross-sectional study took place at three elderly nursing homes in Semarang and Ungaran. Subjects were 60 -year-old women and over. Primary data was taken from the measurement of toe touching test and range of motion (ROM) of knee and ankle using universal goniometer. Data was analyzed with ANCOVA test which compares flexibilities between SSI-exercising and non SSI-exercising subjects by including age and Body Mass Index in the analysis using SPSS 15. 0 for windows. Results: Mean results of SSI-exercising subjects, which are - 3. 4 ± 7. 61 cm for toe touching test, 130. 3 ± 8. 34 o for ROM of knee and 62. 3 ± 17. 20 o for ROM of ankle, are all higher than those of non SSI-exercising subjects, which are consecutively, - 7. 0 ± 11. 39 cm, 122. 8 ± 12. 42 o and 57. 8 ± 15. 21 o. ANCOVA test results are not significantly different for toe touching test (p= 0. 610), but they are for ROM of knee and ankle (consecutively p= 0. 000 and p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Knee and ankle flexibilities of SSI-exercising elderly women are significantly higher than those of <b>non</b> SSI-exercising. Toe <b>touching</b> test results are better in the SSI-exercising elderly women, though not significantly different. Keywords: flexibility, Senam Sehat Indonesia, elderly, women...|$|R
