This {{study examines}} {{the factors that}} guide the behaviour and relationships between <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> and intermediary dyads. We examine {{both sides of a}} dyadic transaction and develop an export producer–intermediary behaviour typology by using a grounded theory method through qualitative interviews. We propose three forms of export producer–intermediary dyads based on the degree of information sharing, intensity of price negotiation, level of transaction costs, and partner satisfaction and propensity to export directly. These three forms are as follows: (1) competitive, (2) cooperative and (3) mismatched relationships...|$|R

Combining production, international trade and development theories, a four variable (production, <b>exports,</b> <b>producer</b> price and imports) vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) model is developed for each country. The causality results show that the hypothesis of export-led development is supported by these three major players in the international wheat trade, though a bi-directional causality is found for Canada and the USA.

The investigation found that the dumping margin of Argentina was around 41.9% and 49.2%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 23.3%. However, by applying the EU “Lesser duty rule”, the anti-dumping duties will be imposed {{at the level of the}} injury margin, for most <b>exporting</b> <b>producers,</b> which is for Argentina between 22% and 25.7%, and for Indonesia between 8.8% and 20.5%.

40|$|Dried, roasted or {{processed}} into peanut butter, peanuts mean {{money for}} millions of households. World peanut production is around 30 million tonnes, with China, USA, Argentina and India as major <b>export</b> <b>producers.</b> In Africa, the largest producers are Nigeria (2, 800, 000 t), Sudan (980, 000 t) and Senegal (828, 000 t). Peanuts are in fact grown in most ACP countries. Research on improved peanut varieties has {{for a long time}} been dormant, but the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), seems to be quickly making up for this (see also Spore 91). For the past decade, research on groundnuts has focused on varieties that are suited for local conditions, such as drought, poor soils and a range of pests and diseases. In Africa, leaf spot, aflatoxine contamination, groundnut rosette and foliar disease often lead to considerable harvest losses. In West Africa, ICRISAT has been releasing numerous disease-resistant varieties for testing among farmers. In Samanko, almost literally the back garden of the ICRISAT centre in Mali, a women s group has been successfully testing some of these varieties. In ideal conditions, a peanut harvest can amount to three tonnes per hectare but traditional varieties in Mali do not yield more than 500 kg/ha. In the tests, some new varieties are yielding more than 1 tonne/ha and are maturing in only 90 days instead of 115 days traditionally. The women determine which varieties pass the test and will be distributed to other regions. They have rejected certain lines of varieties with promising high yields, for one that has more attractive seeds or is more suitable for their goats. It is, ICRISAT tell us, the women who are the major players. That, they say, is what participation is all about. We look forward to the women s side of the story!

40|$|Widespread {{empirical}} {{evidence indicates that}} <b>exporting</b> <b>producers</b> have higher productivity than nonexporters, although the reasons why are unclear. Some analysts argue that exporters acquire knowledge of new production methods, inputs, and product designs from their international contacts, and with this knowledge they achieve higher productivity than their more insulated domestic counterparts.

However, increasing production costs, the scarcity of hired labor, and unfavorable exchange rates have reduced the productivity and competitiveness of the Chilean fruit sector. The aim of this article is to evaluate the harvest labor quality in cherry growing in Chile through the use of productivity indicators. A harvest labor evaluation system (HLES) was designed and four indicators were measured: Average Weight of Harvested Box, Average Daily Production per Worker, Percent of Export Fruit, and Percent of Fruit Discarded. Significant differences werefound between the 2010 / 11 season (with the HLES implementation) and the previous seasons without HLES. The average worker yield, average weight of a filled box, and fruit quality improved, while the amount of discarded fruit decreased. Hired labor management in agriculture is crucial for improving the productivity of the fresh fruit <b>export</b> <b>producers.</b> The use of HLES and the adoption of new technologies could help to solve the competitiveness problem in the Chilean fruit sector...|$|R

Two main positions currently shape this debate: one that argues the payment of 'above market' prices will promote reliance by Southern producers on low value agricultural production; another that fair trade might actually alleviate barriers to diversification and facilitate export opportunities. Responding {{to a lack of}} empirically grounded literature, the paper focuses on involvement by the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) with two dedicated fair trade marketing networks. Based on qualitative case study research, analysis shows that dedicated fair trade organisations have {{played a significant role in}} promoting export diversification: particularly through the facilitation of market access and provision of the financial, social and physical capital needed to support such changes. Beyond this however, the study also highlights the importance and limitations of ‘moral geographies’ that permeate the construction of ethical credentials beneficial to the international marketing of Southern <b>export</b> <b>producers</b> in Northern consumer markets...|$|R

30|$|We next {{consider}} {{what happens to}} trade aggregates when BAMs are in place to support the EITE sectors in the economy. The policy of export rebate (BAE) is targeted to assisting exporters where the additional costs of production incurred due to the carbon pricing policy are rebated when goods are exported from Australia. Our projections show that the reduction in export volume is lowered by using BAE and BAP to some degree, but again, {{it is interesting to}} note that the adoption of green tariffs in Australia is likely to further deteriorate exports as shown by a 5.07 % reduction in the export volume compared to the NBA outcome (−  4.98 %). The imposition of tariffs makes inputs to <b>export</b> <b>producers</b> more expensive. Hence, there is a squeeze in the profit margins in the absence of their ability to pass on the increased costs to customers. As given in Table  3, carbon regulation causes a rise in export prices and BAI has no impact toward easing them. Again, BAE, BAP and BAEI (reflecting the BAE component of BAEI) cause a very modest easing of export price increases.|$|R

Second, I show that economic fundamentals such as inflation, productivity, demand, exchange rates and market structure can only partially explain adjustment decisions and cross-market synchronization. Third, I present a dynamic menu cost model of price-setting, and attribute the remaining unexplained part in adjustment decisions to differences in menu costs across countries. I calculate the implied export and domestic market menu costs from the data and estimate that export menu costs are 1. 5 % of period steady state revenues and three times as large as domestic market menu costs...|$|R
40|$|In {{parallel}} {{with changes in}} official standards, supermarket chains in Europe have developed prescriptive, production-oriented standards, e. g. the European Union Retailers Produce Working Group for Good Agricultural Practices (GlobalGAP), and are asking their suppliers for produce to be certified according to food-safety and quality standards. There are concerns that the proliferation and enhanced stringency of standards that are imposed by high-income countries can negatively affect the competitiveness of producers in developing countries and impede actors from entering or even remaining in high-value food markets. Yet, in some cases, others argue that such standards can play a positive role, providing the catalyst and incentives for the modernization of export supply and regulatory systems and the adoption of safer and more sustainable production practices. This article provides an empirical analysis of EU private food-safety standards impact on pesticide use and farm-level productivity among smallholder <b>export</b> vegetable <b>producers</b> in Kenya. We apply an extended three-stage damage control production framework that accounts for multiple endogeneity problems to farm-level data collected from a random cross-section sample of 439 small-scale vegetable producers. Estimation results show that <b>export</b> <b>producers</b> complying with private standards significantly use less toxic pesticides; however {{there is no significant}} difference on the total quantity of pesticides used. Contrary to findings elsewhere, the econometric evidences here show that export vegetable farmers in Kenya use pesticide below the economic optimum. The third stage structural revenue model results demonstrate a positive and significant impact of standards adoption on revenue of vegetable production. While food safety and quality standards can be a barrier for resource poor smallholders to maintain their position in the lucrative export markets, they can also induce positive changes in production systems of small-scale farmers who adopt it as shown by the results presented. Generally this article partly supports the notion that adoption of emerging food-safety standards can serve as a catalyst in transforming the production systems of developing countries towards safer and more sustainable production.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{widespread}} empirical evidence indicating <b>exporting</b> <b>producers</b> have higher productivity than nonexporters, the mechanisms that generate this pattern are less clear. One view is that exporters acquire knowledge of new production methods, inputs, and product designs from their international contacts, and this learning results in higher productivity for exporters relative to their more insulated domestic counterparts. Alternatively, the higher productivity of exporters may simply reflect the self-selection of more efficient producers into a highly competitive export market. In this paper we use micro data collected in the manufacturing censuses in South Korea and Taiwan to study the linkages between a producer’s total factor productivity and choice {{to participate in the}} export market. We find differences between the countries in the importance of selection and learning forces. In Taiwan, transitions of plants {{in and out of the}} export market reflect systematic variations in productivity as predicted by self-selection models. Plants with higher productivity, ex ante, tend to enter the export market and exporters with low productivity tend to exit. Moreover, in several industries, entry into the export market is followed by relative productivity improvements, a result consistent with learning-by-exporting forces. In South Korea, the evidence of self selection on the basis of productivity is much weaker. I...|$|R

Results show that some farmers change categories in sequence; farmers that produce for the domestic market can later produce for the foreign market and eventually specialize further in the production of exports. The three types of farmers differ in several aspects.

It employs {{more than a half}} a million people in the formal sector and over two million people in the informal sector. The major export destinations demand some minimum quality levels of the produce entering their market. There have been technological innovations with regard to seed priming, treatment, disease and insect resistance and overall quality improvement. However the increased profitability associated with such technological advancement has not been fully enjoyed in Kenya and other developing countries due to non-adoption, partial adoption or inappropriate adoption of the improved technologies.

40|$|This study {{analytically}} {{shows that}} a VER serves as an institution to protect incumbent firms of an exporting country. A VER is an entry barrier in the export market. It favours the concentration of industry, and allows established firms to better exploit economies of scale by producing output at lower average cost. Since the break-even price for potential firms is the average cost, entry in the domestic market is also inhibited, regardless of the form of competition. A VER also allows the raising of the price cost margin in the export market. However, the smaller the country, the greater the possibility also of a larger monopoly power in the domestic market. The impact on firm size is ambiguous. From the social point of view, three conventional effects from the elimination of a VER are usually considered: the rent loss effect, the efficiency effect and the <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> price effect. In this study, two further effects on welfare are examined: the increased intermediate inputs cost effect and the variety effect.
