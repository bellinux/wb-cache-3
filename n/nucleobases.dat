5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions {{to each other and}} are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of <b>nucleobases</b> (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four <b>nucleobases</b> along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
5|$|A Holliday {{junction}} is a branched {{nucleic acid}} structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined together. These arms may adopt {{one of several}} conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of <b>nucleobases</b> closest to the junction.

Possible scenarios leading to <b>nucleobase</b> mispairing are discussed, and selected examples are presented. They include changes in <b>nucleobase</b> selectivity as a consequence of alterations in acid-base properties of <b>nucleobase</b> atoms and groups involved in complementary H bond formation, guanine deprotonation, and stabilization of rare <b>nucleobase</b> tautomers by metal ions.

5|$|The <b>nucleobases</b> are {{classified}} into two types: the purines, A and G, being fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds, and the pyrimidines, the six-membered rings C and T. A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, uracil (U), usually takes {{the place of}} thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing <b>nucleobases</b> — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E

40|$|Molecular tips in {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy can directly detect intermolecular electron tunneling between {{sample and}} tip molecules and reveal the tunneling facilitation through chemical interactions that provide overlap of respective electronic wave functions, that is, hydrogen-bond, metal-coordination-bond, and charge-transfer interactions. <b>Nucleobase</b> molecular tips were prepared by chemical modification of underlying metal tips with thiol derivatives of adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil and the outmost single <b>nucleobase</b> adsorbate probes intermolecular electron tunneling to or from a sample <b>nucleobase</b> molecule. We found that the electron tunneling between a sample <b>nucleobase</b> and its complementary <b>nucleobase</b> molecular tip was much facilitated compared with its noncomplementary counterpart. The complementary <b>nucleobase</b> tip was thereby capable of electrically pinpointing each <b>nucleobase.</b> Chemically selective imaging using molecular tips may be coined “intermolecular tunneling microscopy” as its principle goes and is of general significance for novel molecular imaging of chemical identities at the membrane and solid surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The term {{formula weight}} (F.W.) has a {{specific}} meaning {{when used in}} the context of DNA synthesis: whereas an individual phosphoramidite <b>nucleobase</b> to be added to a DNA polymer has protecting groups and has its molecular weight quoted including these groups, the amount of molecular weight that is ultimately added by this <b>nucleobase</b> to a DNA polymer {{is referred to as the}} <b>nucleobase's</b> formula weight (i.e., the molecular weight of this <b>nucleobase</b> within the DNA polymer, minus protecting groups).|$|R
30|$|The <b>nucleobase</b> pairs are {{characterized}} by their conformational diversity in the wild. Yet a modern nanobiotechnology utilizes their planar conformations only, developing what can be called a “planar approach”. It is well established that the most energetically favorable conformations of the complementary <b>nucleobase</b> pairs are planar and correspond to the classical Watson-Crick <b>nucleobase</b> pairs.|$|R

25|$|Albrecht Kossel is {{considered}} one of the great scientists of biochemistry and genetics. By isolating and defining nucleic acid and the <b>nucleobases,</b> he provided the necessary precursors that led to the double-helix model of DNA, devised by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Kossel {{isolated}} {{and described the}} five organic compounds that are present in nucleic acid: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds were later shown to be <b>nucleobases,</b> and are key {{in the formation of}} DNA and RNA, the genetic material found in all living cells.|$|E
30|$|Taking {{into account}} the great {{conformational}} variety of the <b>nucleobase</b> pairs in the wild [9], {{as well as a}} relative lack of the theoretical awareness of all the possible conformations, we suppose that the <b>nucleobase</b> pairs are capable of forming observable non-planar structures. Because of a quite good knowledge of the complementary base pairs, we believe that those structures could be found in the non-canonical non-complementary <b>nucleobase</b> pairs. Additionally, we needed a means to find all possible conformations of the given <b>nucleobase</b> pairs. We solved that problem in [11].|$|R

In Haplogroup BT and chimpanzee chromosomes, this marker consists of 9 T <b>nucleobase</b> units. This pattern suggested that the 9T stretch of Haplogroup BT was the ancestral version and that Haplogroup A was formed by the deletion of one <b>nucleobase.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Nucleobase</b> and {{nucleoside}} compounds exist {{widely in}} various organisms. An often occurring {{problem in the}} discovery of new bioactive compounds from natural products is reisolation of known <b>nucleobase</b> and nucleoside compounds. To resolve this problem, a capillary electrophoresis-high resolution mass spectrometry (CE-HR-MS) method providing both rapid separation and accurate mass full-scan MS data was developed {{for the first time}} to screen and dereplicate known <b>nucleobase</b> and nucleoside compounds in crude extracts of natural products. Instrumental parameters were optimized to obtain optimum conditions for CE separation and electrospray ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF/MS) detection. The proposed method was verified to be precise, reproducible, and sensitive. Using this method, known <b>nucleobase</b> and nucleoside compounds in different marine medicinal organisms including Syngnathus acus Linnaeus; Hippocampus japonicus Kaup and Anthopleura lanthogrammica Berkly were successfully observed and identified. This work demonstrates that CE-HR-MS combined with an accurate mass database may be used as a powerful tool for dereplicating known <b>nucleobase</b> and nucleoside compounds in different types of natural products. Rapid dereplication of known <b>nucleobase</b> and nucleoside compounds allows researchers to focus on other leads with greater potential to yield new substances...|$|R
25|$|Kossel {{continued}} his previous {{work on the}} nucleic acids. During the period 1885 to 1901, {{he was able to}} isolate and name its five constituent organic compounds: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil. These compounds are now known collectively as <b>nucleobases,</b> and they provide the molecular structure necessary in the formation of stable DNA and RNA molecules.|$|E
25|$|Anti-metabolites are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many {{of them have a}} similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The <b>nucleobases</b> are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either <b>nucleobases</b> or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case S-phase (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, it {{was shown}} that the nucleic acid purine base adenine can be formed by heating aqueous {{ammonium}} cyanide solutions. Other pathways for synthesizing bases from inorganic materials were also reported. Leslie E. Orgel and colleagues have shown that freezing temperatures are advantageous for the synthesis of purines, due to the concentrating effect for key precursors such as hydrogen cyanide. Research by Stanley L. Miller and colleagues suggested that while adenine and guanine require freezing conditions for synthesis, cytosine and uracil may require boiling temperatures. Research by the Miller group notes the formation of seven different amino acids and 11 types of <b>nucleobases</b> in ice when ammonia and cyanide were left in a freezer from 1972 to 1997. Other work demonstrated the formation of s-triazines (alternative <b>nucleobases),</b> pyrimidines (including cytosine and uracil), and adenine from urea solutions subjected to freeze-thaw cycles under a reductive atmosphere (with spark discharges as an energy source). The explanation given for the unusual speed of these reactions at such a low temperature is eutectic freezing. As an ice crystal forms, it stays pure: only molecules of water join the growing crystal, while impurities like salt or cyanide are excluded. These impurities become crowded in microscopic pockets of liquid within the ice, and this crowding causes the molecules to collide more often. Mechanistic exploration using quantum chemical methods provide a more detailed understanding {{of some of the}} chemical processes involved in chemical evolution, and a partial answer to the fundamental question of molecular biogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Of all {{properties}} of metal <b>nucleobase</b> complexes, formation of multinuclear species {{appears to be}} an outstanding feature. After a brief introduction into well known polymeric metal <b>nucleobase</b> complexes, three aspects recently Studied in our laboratory will be dealt with in more detail: (i) Heteronuclear complexes derived from trans-[(amine) 2 Pt(1 -MeC) 2] 2 + (1 -MeC= 1 -methylcytosine). They form, e. g. with Pd(II) or Hg(II), upon single deprotonation of the exocyclic amino group of each 1 -MeC ligand, compounds of type trans-[(amine) 2 Pt(1 -MeC-) 2 MY]n+, displaying Pt-M bond formation. (ii) Cyclic <b>nucleobase</b> complexes derived from cis-a 2 Pt(II). A cyclic compound of composition {[(en) Pt(UH-N 1,N 3) ] 4 } 4 + (UH=monoanion of unsubstituted uracil) is presented and the analogy with organic calix-[4]-arenes is pointed out. (iii) Cyclic <b>nucleobase</b> complexes from trans-a 2 Pt(II). Possible ways for the preparation of macrocyclic <b>nucleobase</b> complexes containing trans-a 2 Pt(II) linkages are outlined and precursors and intermediates are presented...|$|R
40|$|Methylation at the N 7 {{position}} {{is one of}} the most frequently naturally occurring modifications of guanosine. This alteration drastically changes the hydrogen bonding and acid–base properties of the guanine <b>nucleobase.</b> Here we show on the example of the model <b>nucleobase</b> 7, 9 -dimethylguanine that due to blockage of N 7 of the purine ring, new hydrogen bonding patterns occur on the minor groove binding face of this <b>nucleobase</b> involving the ring nitrogen N 3 and the exocyclic amino group N 2 H 2. The free 7, 9 -dimethylguaninium ion and several transplatinum(II) complexes of the this ligand are presented and discussed. Methylation at N 7 drastically changes the acid–base and hydrogen bonding properties of the <b>nucleobase</b> guanine. 7, 9 -Dimethylguanine, the model compound for this naturally occurring modified <b>nucleobase,</b> shows new and extensive hydrogen bonding patterns involving its minor groove binding face both in its free form as well as in several transplatinum(II) complexes...|$|R
30|$|The first {{way is to}} {{find the}} other non-planar <b>nucleobase</b> pairs that would be much more {{convenient}} for usage in a real industry than those that we have found and presented in this paper. The next way might be searching for an appropriate <b>nucleobase</b> modification in order to achieve the same goal. And the third way is to try to synthesize similar to the non-planar <b>nucleobase</b> pair structures which would behave themselves both as non-planar and energetically favorable at the same time.|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{emergence}} of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds, including <b>nucleobases</b> and amino acids, that are the building blocks of life. An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid of sparks to mimic the effect of lightning. Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules. Computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|DNA usually {{exists as}} a {{double-stranded}} structure, with both strands coiled {{together to form}} the characteristic double-helix. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. Nucleotides in DNA contain a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate, and a nucleobase. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four <b>nucleobases</b> adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine and guanine are purine bases, while cytosine and thymine are pyrimidines. These nucleotides form phosphodiester bonds, creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nuclei bases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleotides (bases) are matched between strands through hydrogen bonds to form base pairs. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (stronger: three hydrogen bonds).|$|E
500|$|The DNA {{double helix}} is {{stabilized}} primarily by two forces: hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic <b>nucleobases.</b> In the aqueous {{environment of the}} cell, the conjugated [...] bonds of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the DNA molecule, minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell. The four bases found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). These four bases {{are attached to the}} sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide, as shown for adenosine monophosphate. Adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine.

40|$|Herein, {{we report}} the {{preparation}} of nucleobase-containing synthetic amphiphilic diblock copolymers using RAFT polymerization. Well-defined spherical micelles can be formed in aqueous solutions through the self-assembly of the amphiphilic copolymers, with the <b>nucleobase</b> functionality sequestered {{in the core of}} the particles. Following assembly, copolymers with the complementary <b>nucleobase</b> were introduced into the preformed micellar solutions. This addition induced a change in nanostructure size and morphology and this reorganization was fully characterized by DLS, TEM, SLS and SAXS analysis. The insertion of copolymers with the complementary <b>nucleobase</b> into formed micelles was also confirmed by 1 H NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy. For micelles consisting of moderately short hydrophobic blocks, upon the addition of complementary <b>nucleobase</b> copolymer a decrease in size was observed but without any accompanying morphological change. For micelles formed from longer hydrophobic blocks, a morphological transition from spheres to cylinders and then to smaller spheres was observed upon increasing the amount of the complementary copolymer. This work highlights how complementary <b>nucleobase</b> interactions can be used to induce nanostructure reorganization and through a simple mixing process provide access to different nanostructure sizes and morphologies...|$|R

Levene suggested that DNA consisted {{of a string of}} nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups. Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order. In 1937, William Astbury produced the first X-ray diffraction patterns that showed that DNA had a regular structure.|$|E

[...] Single-stranded breakages are easier to repair than double-stranded breakages, because there is still an unbroken complementary strand to use as a template.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the initiating step in metastable-ion decay of UV matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) -produced ions, we conducted experiments in which we exchanged all active protons for deuterons of tetrameric and hexameric oligodeoxynucleotides. We wish to address the controversial proposal that in the negative-ion mode, as in the positive-ion mode, fragmentation is driven by <b>nucleobase</b> protonation. The results show unambiguously that proton transfer, leading to zwitterion formation, charges a <b>nucleobase</b> prior to its elimination. The zwitterion formation directs fragmentation of {{both positive and negative}} oligodeoxynucleotide ions. Poly-T-rich oligodeoxynucleotide tetramers show surprising differences in the negative compared to the positive-ion mode, as thymine is preferentially expelled, instead of a <b>nucleobase</b> with higher proton affinity. For the exceptional case of negatively charged poly-T-rich oligodeoxynucleotide tetramers generated by MALDI, we propose that zwitterion formation with positive charging of a <b>nucleobase</b> leads to base stabilization in the negative-ion mode through an interaction of the positive <b>nucleobase</b> with the excess negative charge. Moreover, backbone cleavages (accompanied by H rearrangement) of a phosophodiester bond give first-generation products that {{can be traced back to}} this tripolar complex bearing one positive and two negative charges, all of which may be interacting...|$|R
