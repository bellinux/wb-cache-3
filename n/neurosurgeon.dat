5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American <b>neurosurgeon</b> Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm, and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian <b>neurosurgeon</b> Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian <b>neurosurgeon</b> Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the crash, Onassis's father and {{stepmother}} arrived from New York at the hospital where Onassis was being treated. The couple were accompanied by an American <b>neurosurgeon.</b> Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English <b>neurosurgeon</b> Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no chance of surviving his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen with the Life Extension Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Alexander Onassis was buried next to the chapel on his father's private Ionian island of Skorpios.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE. To {{determine}} the number of <b>neurosurgeons</b> in clinical practice in Canada on Jan. 1, 1996, and their practice profile and to determine requirements for 2001 and 2011. DESIGN. Telephone survey and national mail survey. SETTING. Canada. PARTICIPANTS. All 174 <b>neurosurgeons</b> in Canada engaged in active clinical practice on Jan. 1, 1996, and all residents enrolled in neurosurgery training programs in Canada during the 1995 - 96 academic year. OUTCOME MEASURES. Demographic characteristics, full-time equivalents, workload, attrition, reasons for exit, vacancies, supply and shortfall. RESULTS. All 174 <b>neurosurgeons</b> responded to the survey. There is a chronic shortage of 25 <b>neurosurgeons</b> in Canada. Sixty-two established <b>neurosurgeons</b> will have stopped practice by 2001 and 181 by 2011. They will need to be replaced, for a total requirement of 87 and 206 <b>neurosurgeons</b> by 2001 and 2011 respectively. Canadian neurosurgery training programs can currently generate only up to 69 and 177 graduates by 2001 and 2011 respectively. During the period 1985 - 95, 50 % of neurosurgery graduates emigrated from Canada within 2 years of obtaining certification, creating potential deficits of up to 52 and 117 <b>neurosurgeons</b> by 2001 and 2011 respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Strategies need to be developed quickly to address not only the chronic shortfall but also the attrition of established <b>neurosurgeons.</b> Strategies to increase and retain the number of Canadian neurosurgery graduates are also needed...|$|R

40|$|To {{establish}} to {{what extent}} <b>neurosurgeons</b> subscribe to the lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS) guideline, and to evaluate their current management of patients with LRS against the guideline. All active <b>neurosurgeons</b> in the Netherlands (n= 92) were mailed a questionnaire about the guideline and data from 66 responders were analysed. Patients were recruited via seven of the participating <b>neurosurgeons</b> and were interviewed once by telephone. The medical records of the participating patients (n= 163) were also examined. Of the 26 propositions in the LRS guideline, seven were not fully endorsed by the <b>neurosurgeons.</b> Three of these seven propositions may need updating based on "new evidence". The time between {{the onset of the}} LRS episode and the actual moment of surgery was considerably longer than that recommended in the guideline. Based on their current management of LRS patients, the <b>neurosurgeons</b> largely adhere with the LRS guideline...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} {{a survey of}} the opinion of <b>neurosurgeons</b> on the multidisciplinary clinical guideline 'lumbosacral radicular syndrome'. The aim was to describe to what extent <b>neurosurgeons</b> in the Netherlands endorse the content of this guideline. The guideline was issued in 1996 by the Netherlands Institute of Quality Health Care {{and this is the first}} attempt to evaluate the implementation of this guideline. Methods: All active <b>neurosurgeons</b> (n= 92) in the Netherlands were invited to complete a questionnaire investigating to what extent they agree with the 26 recommendations in the guideline 'lumbosacral radicular syndrome'. The results are represented in frequencies (%) in order to express the magnitude of their consent or dissent with the recommendations. Results: Overall, 75 % of the <b>neurosurgeons</b> responded and, of these, 94 % agreed (at least partially) with the content of the guideline. Of the 26 recommendations in the guideline, seven were not fully endorsed by the <b>neurosurgeons.</b> Three of these seven recommendations may need revision based on newly published data. Conclusion: This survey shows that almost all <b>neurosurgeons</b> subscribed (at least partially) to the multidisciplinary LRS guideline. Therefore, one important aspect of the implementation process has been fulfilled, i. e. acceptance of the content of the guideline...|$|R
50|$|World War II {{produced}} {{a dramatic change}} in the world of neurological surgery. Deployed surgeons learned neurosurgery while on active duty in one of the armed services. Others experienced either abbreviated training, or had their program interrupted when called to active duty. After the war these surgeons returned to the United States with a need to add credentials. Existing neurosurgical training programs incorporated these surgeons and the number of training sites proliferated. Thus, in the late 1940s there was an explosion in the numbers of young <b>neurosurgeons</b> surfacing in communities and seeking recognition from organized neurosurgical societies. There was intense resistance from the established neurosurgical community, however, to this new group of <b>neurosurgeons.</b> The Harvey Cushing Society (now the AANS), did not immediately recognize this new group of <b>neurosurgeons</b> and made efforts to exclude them from their organization. The precursor to the CNS was the Interurban Neurosurgical Society organized by <b>neurosurgeons</b> Adrian Verbruggen and Harold Voris meeting at the University Club of Chicago. The society was open to all <b>neurosurgeons</b> living no more than one travel day away from Chicago. It met for one day only (Saturday). There was a mailing list but no dues, by-laws, officers or publications. About 150 <b>neurosurgeons</b> attended once a year. Most attendees were from the northeast, mid-Atlantic, southeast, and mid-west. Eventually, a more organized effort was put together when twenty two <b>neurosurgeons</b> met in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1951, the first formal organizing and scientific meeting was convened in Memphis, Tennessee, attended by 121 <b>neurosurgeons.</b> The CNS was infolded into the AANS for several years until it held its own independent meeting in 2000, completing the separation of the two organizations. The CNS has expanded significantly and now has over 8000 members worldwide.|$|R
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris <b>neurosurgeon.</b> Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E
5|$|Mary Meader {{was born}} to William H. and Genevieve Upjohn in Kalamazoo, Michigan on April 15, 1916, a {{grandchild}} of Dr. W. E. Upjohn, {{the founder of the}} pharmaceutical Upjohn Company. Meader majored in French and Spanish at Smith College. She left the college in preparation for a marriage to the <b>neurosurgeon</b> Richard Upjohn Light, a first cousin of hers. Since the two could not legally marry each other in Michigan, they moved to Maryland, where they married in 1937.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a <b>neurosurgeon.</b> The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Monitoring of {{intracranial}} pressure (ICP) is a routine procedure in the neurosurgery field. Although the routine practice of monitoring ICP has decreased in recent years, the practice patterns {{have not been}} studied in Colombia.

Megan begins to investigate the death of Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), leading her directly back to her former case of Julie's death.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American <b>neurosurgeon</b> Harvey Williams Cushing increased the acceptance of surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E

5|$|In New York City, Stephen Strange, an {{acclaimed}} but arrogant <b>neurosurgeon,</b> badly injures {{his hands}} in a car accident, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon and former lover Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but Strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange eventually learns of Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who mysteriously regained full use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange, revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. She eventually agrees to train Strange, despite his arrogance, which reminds her of Kaecilius.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan joined Tan Tock Seng Hospital as a {{consultant}} <b>neurosurgeon</b> in 1991, where he reorganised the way stroke patients were treated, arranged for the neurosurgical intensive care unit to be computerised, introduced stereotactic brachytherapy for dealing with brain tumours, and chaired the National Neuroscience Institute's planning committee. In 1994, he moved into private practice at Gleneagles Hospital, establishing the first stereotactic radiosurgical treatment system driven by a linear particle accelerator in Singapore. He also worked with medical device manufacturer Siemens to develop image-guided surgical systems. He published more than 50 scientific papers and chapters in neurology books.|$|E
5|$|The five {{characters}} who are first {{introduced in the}} series premiere, as surgical interns, are Grey, Karev, O'Malley, Stevens, and Yang. They are initially mentored by Bailey, a senior resident who becomes the hospital's Chief Resident, and later an attending general surgeon, in season six. The surgical program is initially headed by the Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having {{had an affair with}} her mother when Meredith was a child. In Webber's employ are attending <b>neurosurgeon</b> Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang.|$|E
40|$|The {{power of}} {{interpretation}} {{in the analysis}} of cranial computed tomography (CCT) among <b>neurosurgeons</b> and radiologists has rarely been studied. This study aimed to assess the rate of agreement in the interpretation of CCTs between <b>neurosurgeons</b> and a radiologist in an emergency department. Method 227 CCT were independently analyzed by two <b>neurosurgeons</b> (NS 1 and NS 2) and a radiologist (RAD). The level of agreement in interpreting the examination was studied. Results The Kappa values obtained between NS 1 and NS 2 and RAD were considered nearly perfect and substantial agreement. The highest levels of agreement when evaluating abnormalities were observed in the identification of tumors, hydrocephalus and intracranial hematomas. The worst levels of agreement were observed for leukoaraiosis and reduced brain volume. Conclusions For diseases in which the emergency room procedure must be determined, agreement in the interpretation of CCTs between the radiologist and <b>neurosurgeons</b> was satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Background: The term ""Defensive'' {{medicine}} was coined {{in the early}} 19709 s and {{has been an important}} topic of scientific investigation and professional debate ever since. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the characteristics of defensive medicine, its reasons, and the extent to which it is practiced in the Turkish health care system. This is the first national survey to study the practice of defensive medicine among <b>neurosurgeons</b> in Turkey. Methods: The present cross-sectional study on defensive medicine assessed <b>neurosurgeons</b> registered at the Turkish Neurosurgical Society, who are actively working in various centers and hospitals within the Turkish health care system. A 40 -question survey was adapted from existing measures described in the literature and was completed by a total of 404 <b>neurosurgeons,</b> representing 36. 7 % of the <b>neurosurgeons</b> registered at the Turkish Neurosurgical Society. Results: Seventy-two percent of the participants in the current study reported practicing defensive medicine. This practice was mainly reported among inexperienced <b>neurosurgeons</b> (74. 4 %). Most were younger than 40 years of age (75. 2 %), working in state hospitals/universities (72. 7 %), and living in the Marmara region (38 %). Respondents reported engaging in defensive medicine by avoiding high-risk surgery (62. 6 %), ordering additional imaging studies (60. 9 %) and laboratory tests (33. 7 %), and referring patients to consultants (31. 2 %). Most participants consider every patient as a potential threat in terms of a medical lawsuit (68. 3 %) and do not believe the courts can distinguish malpractice from complications (89. 6 %). Conclusion: Concerns and perceptions about medical liability lead <b>neurosurgeons</b> to practice defensive medicine. By avoiding high-risk surgery, ordering unnecessary diagnostic tests, and referring the patients to consultants, <b>neurosurgeons</b> try to minimize the risk of malpractice and protect themselves from legal risks, resulting in higher healthcare expenditure and longer treatment periods...|$|R

5|$|As {{the civil}} disobedience {{campaign}} {{spread to other}} parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and other leading members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave the camp and return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam to travel to the UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at the hands of a <b>neurosurgeon</b> Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a <b>neurosurgeon,</b> neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
