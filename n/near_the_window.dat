500|$|Later, Dr. Lee {{explains}} {{what they are}} dealing with. Gabriel allows Michael {{to come in the}} hospital, but nobody else. Michael enters the building and realizes that he has a [...] "dead man switch", meaning that if Wyath is shot, then the whole building will blow up. Gabriel goes up <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to handle a man who is screaming, and the police are prepared to shoot him. However, to prevent Gabriel from using his switch, Michael jumps at him, causing him to divert his path. Gabriel knocks him out, and shortly after injects him with ketamine. Michael suddenly wakes up in his [...] "green reality". Michael is looking for a ring, which is Dr. Wild's. He sees a hallucination of a penguin, caused by the drugs. The penguin tells him that Rex has the ring. He calls him down, and Rex reveals that he stole it for his girlfriend, Emma (Daniela Bobadilla). Michael meets Emma and gets the ring back. Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones) claims that he is [...] "having a nightmare about madness". He wakes up in the [...] "red reality" [...] and sees Dr. Lee helping him. The police are coming in to shoot him. Michael quickly phones and tells them to stop, due to the [...] "dead man switch". Gabriel and Michael talk about Gabriel's two reality life. This makes Michael think about his life. Shortly later, Michael and Dr. Evans are talking about his mind. He thinks about his life and tells her that he is okay. During a subsequent discussion, he finds out that Dr. Lee was not really inside his mind; he was actually helping himself.|$|E

He also identified the mysterious [...] "fireflies" [...] observed by Glenn during Friendship 7 as [...] particles of frozen liquid loosened from the outside of the spacecraft, which he could produce by rapping on the wall <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> He renamed them [...] "frostflies".|$|E
2500|$|The theatre had {{multiple}} exits: a little known side-door {{was used by}} those in the orchestra and back stage while an upper balcony exit was a clear way out. In the panic of the fire, many people were pushed and fell, and {{they were unable to}} escape. Many people jumped out of the windows of the theatre. Others who were assembled <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> were afraid to do so. The editor of the Richmond Standard, present at the scene, urged people to jump; he, with help from many others on the ground, then heroically saved the lives of many of those who chose to do so.|$|E

2500|$|In Europe, magpies {{have been}} {{historically}} demonized by humans, mainly {{as a result}} of superstition and myth. The bird has found itself in this situation mainly by association, says Steve Roud: [...] "Large blackbirds, like crows and ravens, are viewed as evil in British folklore and white birds are viewed as good". In European folklore, the magpie is associated with a number of superstitions surrounding its reputation as an omen of ill fortune. In the 19th century book, A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar, a proverb concerning magpies is recited: [...] "A single magpie in spring, foul weather will bring". The book further explains that this superstition arises from the habits of pairs of magpies to forage together only when the weather is fine. In Scotland, a magpie <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the house is said to foretell death.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin's purges of the 1930s {{affected}} Comintern activists {{living in}} both the USSR and overseas. [...] At Stalin's direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser, using the pseudonym 'Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin', was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later, the NKVD). At Stalin's orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge. Several hundred German Communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated, {{and more than a}} thousand were handed over to Germany. Fritz Platten died in a labor camp; the leaders of the Indian (Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish Communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. Leopold Trepper recalled these days: [...] "In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o'clock in the morning.... Exactly 3 o'clock the car lights began to be seen... we stayed <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and waited , where the car stopped." ...|$|E

He took the candle, and advanced softly to draw the curtain--stopped half way, and listened for a moment--then turned to the landlord.|$|R
