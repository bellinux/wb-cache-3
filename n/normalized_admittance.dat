40|$|The {{objective}} of my bachelor thesis {{was to create}} a Smith chart visualization tool in computing environment MATLAB. I created an impedance Smith chart in graphical user interface which delineate parameters of basic line types. Parameters of transmission lines can be defined in the Smith chart as normalized impedance, reflection coefficient, <b>normalized</b> <b>admittance</b> or impedance in combination with lineâ€™s characteristic impedance. It is also possible to design simple matching circuits, e. g. with quarter-wave transformer, series stub, parallel stub or matching circuits with lumped elements...|$|E
40|$|Some {{acoustic}} {{properties of}} Kevlar- 29 - a fine fibered, layered material is investigated. Kevlar {{is characterized by}} very high strength, uniform filaments arranged in a parallel batt where most filaments are random in the x-y plane but ordered as planes in the z direction. For experimental purposes, volume porosity, static flow resistance and mean filament diameter are used to identify the material. To determine the acoustic surface admittance of Kevlar, batts of the material are cut into small pads and placed into a standing wave tube terminated by a rigid brass plug. The attenuation and relative phase shift are recorded at each frequency {{in the range of}} 50 to 6000 Hz. Normalized conductance and susceptance are combined to form the acoustic absorption coefficient. The data are compared with theory by plotting the <b>normalized</b> <b>admittance</b> and normal incident absorption coefficient versus cyclic frequency...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the electromagnetic characterization of biological tissues in radiofrequency domain. In this aim, a measurement bench including a vector network analyzer and an open-end coaxial probe was introduced. The complex permittivity identification of the middle under testing is performed by solving an inverse problem. A quadratic fitness function that represents the difference between reflection coefficient measurement and reflection coefficient acquired with the <b>normalized</b> aperture <b>admittance</b> is minimized. The optimization is based on a heuristic algorithm: particle swarm. The approach is validated on well known dielectric middle and then tested on biological tissues...|$|R
40|$|Statistical {{fluctuations}} in the eigenvalues of the scattering, impedance and admittance matrices of 2 -Port wave-chaotic systems are studied experimentally using a chaotic microwave cavity. These fluctuations are universal in that their properties are dependent only upon the degree of loss in the cavity. We remove the direct processes introduced by the non-ideally coupled driving ports through a matrix-normalization process that involves the radiation-impedance matrix of the two driving ports. We find good agreement between the experimentally obtained marginal probability density functions (PDFs) of the eigenvalues of the <b>normalized</b> impedance, <b>admittance</b> and scattering matrix and those from Random Matrix Theory (RMT). We also experimentally study {{the evolution of the}} joint PDF of the eigenphases of the normalized scattering matrix as a function of loss. Experimental agreement with the theory by Brouwer and Beenakker for the joint PDF of the magnitude of the eigenvalues of the normalized scattering matrix is also shown.

5000|$|The {{analysis}} of lumped element components {{assumes that the}} wavelength at the frequency of operation {{is much greater than}} the dimensions of the components themselves. The Smith chart may be used to analyze such circuits in which case the movements around the chart are generated by the (<b>normalized)</b> impedances and <b>admittances</b> of the components at the frequency of operation. In this case the wavelength scaling on the Smith chart circumference is not used. The following circuit will be analyzed using a Smith chart at an operating frequency of 100 MHz. At this frequency the free space wavelength is 3 m. The component dimensions themselves will be in the order of millimetres so the assumption of lumped components will be valid. Despite there being no transmission line as such, a system impedance must still be defined to enable normalization and de-normalization calculations and [...] is a good choice here as [...] If there were very different values of resistance present a value closer to these might be a better choice.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{magnetic}} nanoprobes (or magnetic nanoantennas) providing a magnetic near-field enhancement and vanishing electric field is presented and investigated, {{together with their}} excitation. It is established that {{a particular type of}} cylindrical vector beams called azimuthally electric polarized vector beams yield strong longitudinal magnetic field on the beam axis where the electric field is ideally null. These beams with an electric polarization vortex and cylindrical symmetry are important in generating high magnetic to electric field contrast, i. e., large local field admittance, and in allowing selective excitation of magnetic transitions in matter located on the beam axis. We demonstrate that azimuthally polarized vector beam excitation of a photoinduced magnetic nanoprobe made of a magnetically polarizable nano cluster leads to enhanced magnetic near field with resolution beyond diffraction limit. We introduce two figures of merit as magnetic field enhancement and local field <b>admittance</b> <b>normalized</b> to that of a plane wave that are useful to classify magnetic nanoprobes and their excitation. The performance of magnetic nanoprobe and azimuthal polarized beams is quantified in comparison to other illumination options and with several defect scenarios. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Planar {{arrays of}} waveguide-fed slots have been {{employed}} in many radar and remote sensing applications. Such arrays are {{designed in the}} standing wave configuration because of high efficiency. Traveling wave arrays can produce greater bandwidth {{at the expense of}} efficiency due to power loss in the load or loads. Traveling wave planar slot arrays may be designed with a long feed waveguide consisting of centered-inclined coupling slots. The feed waveguide is terminated in a matched load, and the element spacing in the feed waveguide is chosen to produce a beam squinted from the broadside. The traveling wave planar slot array consists of a long feed waveguide containing resonant-centered inclined coupling slots in the broad wall, coupling power into an array of stacked radiating waveguides orthogonal to it. The radiating waveguides consist of longitudinal offset radiating slots in a standing wave configuration. For the traveling wave feed of a planar slot array, one has to design the tilt angle and length of each coupling slot such that the amplitude and phase of excitation of each radiating waveguide are close to the desired values. The coupling slot spacing is chosen for an appropriate beam squint. Scattering matrix parameters of resonant coupling slots are used in the design process to produce appropriate excitations of radiating waveguides with constraints placed only on amplitudes. Since the radiating slots in each radiating waveguide are designed to produce a certain total admittance, the scattering (S) matrix of each coupling slot is reduced to a 2 x 2 matrix. Elements of each 2 x 2 S-matrix and the amount of coupling into the corresponding radiating waveguide are expressed in terms of the element S 11. S matrices are converted into transmission (T) matrices, and the T matrices are multiplied to cascade the coupling slots and waveguide sections, starting from the load end and proceeding towards the source. While the use of non-resonant coupling slots may provide an additional degree of freedom in the design, resonant coupling slots simplify the design process. The amplitude of the wave going to the load is set at unity. The S 11 parameter, r of the coupling slot closest to the load, is assigned an arbitrary value. A larger value of r will reduce the power dissipated in the load while increasing the reflection coefficient at the input port. It is now possible to obtain the excitation of the radiating waveguide closest to the load and the coefficients of the wave incident and reflected at the input port of this coupling slot. The next coupling slot parameter, r, is chosen to realize the excitation of that radiating waveguide. One continues this process moving towards the source, until all the coupling slot parameters r and hence the S 11 parameter of the 4 -port coupler, r, are known for each coupling slot. The goal is to produce the desired array aperture distribution in the feed direction. From an interpolation of the computed moment method data for the slot parameters, all the coupling slot tilt angles and lengths are obtained. From the excitations of the radiating waveguides computed from the coupling values, radiating slot parameters may be obtained so as to attain the desired total <b>normalized</b> slot <b>admittances.</b> This process yields the radiating slot parameters, offsets, and lengths. The design is repeated by choosing different values of r for the last coupling slot until the percentage of power dissipated in the load and the input reflection coefficient values are satisfactory. Numerical results computed for the radiation pattern, the tilt angles and lengths of coupling slots, and excitation phases of the radiating waveguides, are presented for an array with uniform amplitude excitation. The design process has been validated using computer simulations. This design procedure is valid for non-uniform amplitude excitations as well...|$|R
