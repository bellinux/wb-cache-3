5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|I {{have come}} to the clear {{conclusion}} that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken. <b>Nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services. I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self-written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation.|$|E

She said her initial reaction was surprise and [...] "a certain air of disbelief" [...] because during her 44-minute interview for the story, Erdely never brought up Jackie or asked about any of the allegations made in the article. Sullivan said: [...] "I was plainly not prepared for what the story looked like. <b>Nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think her characterization of my interview was fair." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferdinando {{rejected}} it outright with the fullest support of Louis XIV, his great-uncle. Cosimo's eyes now fell upon Violente of Bavaria. Choosing her would strengthen ties between France—where Violente's sister was the dauphine—and Bavaria. There {{was only one}} obstacle in the way, Ferdinando II, Cosimo's father, impartially advised Violente's father, Ferdinand Maria, to invest a huge sum into a bank. Soon after the Elector deposited the sum, the bank collapsed. Ferdinand Maria still had sore feelings; Cosimo consented to the reduction of her dowry accordingly to reimburse the Elector. Ferdinando was unimpressed with his wife. Violente, however, electrified the Grand Duke. He wrote, [...] "I have never known, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think the world can produce, a disposition so perfect..." ...|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{think it can be}} very valued in that regard. I always thought of it as a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E

When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of [...] "shoot him" [...] from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, [...] "He [...] was, I understand, in military phrase, in {{what is known as}} the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> understand now."

500|$|In {{order to}} acquire Violante Beatrice's {{hand for the}} Grand Prince, Cosimo was obliged to reimburse Ferdinand Maria's son Maximilian II. With this {{obstacle}} surmounted, the marriage contract was signed on 24 May 1688, granting Violante Beatrice a dowry of 400,000 thalers in cash and the same amount in jewellery. She married the Grand Prince by proxy in Munich on 21 November 1688 and was married in person on 9 January 1689. The wedding reception {{was held at the}} Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. The new Grand Princess was instantly enamoured with the bridegroom, {{in spite of the fact}} he loathed her. Cosimo III, however, could not find fault in his daughter-in-law, saying, [...] "I have never known, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think the world can produce, a disposition so perfect".|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of TV Blend {{was also}} {{critical}} of the episode, writing: [...] "I don't think based on the first episode that {{we can say that}} Grey's is headed in a new direction, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think the writers are making much of an effort to bring the series back to the greatness that was its earlier seasons. That said, this is Grey's Anatomy and with that comes the usual drama, sex, love and whacky medical mysteries thrown in the mix to keep things moving. If that's what you’re looking for, I think you'll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV noted that the special foreshadowed a [...] "very dark" [...] season, adding: [...] "The talk between George's mom and one of the surgeons [...] proved {{to be one of the}} more heart-breaking scenes in an episode that in itself is heartbreaking enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Ted {{initially}} advised {{his brother}} Robert against challenging the incumbent President Johnson for the Democratic nomination in the 1968 presidential election. Once Eugene McCarthy's strong {{showing in the}} New Hampshire primary led to Robert's presidential campaign starting in March 1968, Ted recruited political leaders for endorsements to his brother in the Western states. Ted was in San Francisco when his brother Robert won the crucial California primary on June 4, 1968, and then after midnight, Robert was shot in Los Angeles and died a day later. Ted Kennedy was devastated by his brother's death, as he was closest to Robert among those in the Kennedy family. Kennedy aide Frank Mankiewicz said of seeing Ted at the hospital where Robert lay mortally wounded: [...] "I have never, ever, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> expect ever, to see a face more in grief."

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club writer Myles McNutt compared the episode to [...] "Training Day" [...] commenting that The Inner Circle' is {{more successful than}} that episode [...] on some levels", but [...] "both episodes suffer from the same problem: They’re simply not very funny or meaningful, which I'd argue is even more problematic for [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] given {{its position in the}} season." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while [...] "the episode did have its funny moments", [...] "overall, you can just feel that the show has changed in a very fundamental way". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that [...] "the fact that the writers so clearly {{had no idea what to}} do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes – <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> feel especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager." ...|$|E
500|$|The Spaniel Club {{was formed}} in 1885, and issued a breed {{standard}} for the Norfolk Spaniel, recognising it as a variety of spaniel. However, the general public saw it only as a generic land spaniel. By the 1890s, the breed had become common throughout the counties of England, leading dog writers such as Rawdon Briggs Lee to question the authenticity of its origins, or that the various liver and white spaniels from around England constituted a single breed; [...] "Personally, I do not consider the liver and white spaniel any particular variety at all, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> believe that {{it has ever been}} indigenous to Norfolk." [...] He states that similar dogs exist in Devonshire that do not trace ancestry to Norfolk, and that liver and white spaniels pre-date the breeding of the Black and Tan Terrier with an ordinary spaniel. F.H.F. Mercer described the breed in 1890 as being [...] "virtually extinct in its purity", with its liver and white colours running through any numbers of miscellaneous spaniels, and he too discredits the origins involving the Duke of Norfolk.|$|E
500|$|In 1756, Dr. John Wall {{published}} a 14-page pamphlet {{on the benefits}} of Malvern water, that reached a 158-page 3rd edition in 1763. Further praise came from the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet in 1757, the poet Thomas Warton in 1790, quoted in a review by the medical historian W.H. McMenemy. Cure tourism in Malvern got press mention. In a letter dated 18 July 1759 to Mrs Montague, Benjamin Stillingfleet wrote: [...] "I have been at Malvern about twelve days, where, with difficulty, I have got a lodging, the place is so full, <b>nor</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> wonder at it, there being some instances of very extraordinary cures, in cases looked on as desperate, even by Dr. Wall, who first brought these waters into vogue...The road is very fine, and made on purpose for the convenience of the drinkers". Chambers, in a footnote to the [...] "song" [...] quoted above, wrote [...] "Though modern visitors do not now lie in bushes, yet so crowded was Malvern one season that a lady of rank and fashion, with her equipage and servants were actually obliged to be sent to the Workhouse. It is now the custom, during the season, to let out this house to visitors, and the money gained this way is applied to the funds for maintaining the poor." [...] Nicholas Vansittart brought his wife Catherine to Malvern for a rest cure in 1809. In 1828, William Addison, the physician of The Duchess of Kent (mother of Queen Victoria) lectured about Malvern at the Royal Institution commending [...] "its pure and invigorating air, the excellence of its water, and the romantic beauty of its scenery".|$|E

500|$|The season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} among television critics.

If that's what you’re looking for, I think you’ll enjoy the season premiere just fine." [...] Capshaw's performance this season was praised, with The TV Addict calling her [...] "immensely likeable". Although [...] "Sympathy for the Parents" [...] was the least viewed episode, TV Fanatic called the episode [...] "touching", praising Chambers' performance. TV Fanatics reaction to the season was fairly mixed, with Steve Marsi saying that Grey's Anatomy was facing an identity crisis after viewing [...] "Give Peace a Chance". He said that: [...] "Still popular but lacking its past magic, it's trying to decide what to become. All we can say is that if it becomes what we saw 12 hours ago, we are all for it. Last week saw the doctors plunging into ER-style chaos with 12 different doctors giving 12 different accounts of one case. Last night, we saw something else equally unusual." [...] He praised Patrick Dempsey's performance, saying: [...] "Again, it was a single case that took up the entire hour, but instead of 12 doctors' version of events, the focus was largely on just one, and the best one: Dr. Derek Shepherd. Patrick Dempsey's McDreamy character may be eye candy, but he's got substance. Last night's episode proved that in spades, and was one of the series' best in some time." ...|$|E
