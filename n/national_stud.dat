5|$|In France, {{the breed}} is {{organized}} by SHERPA (Syndicat hippique des éleveurs de la race pyrénéenne ariégeoise/Union of Horse Breeders of the Ariege Pyrenees) in La Bastide-de-Serou, {{which has about}} 400 members and 600 horses in the stud book. SHERPA unites eleven regional offices whose purpose is to organize Mérens breeders and enthusiasts. The role of SHERPA is to decide the overall direction of the breed {{in partnership with the}} French <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b> It promotes the Mérens at fairs, national shows and international exhibitions, as well as publishing newsletters and breeder lists. SHERPA also organizes the annual breed show in Bouan.|$|E
5|$|Only {{purebred}} Mérens may {{be registered}} in the breed stud book. The selection of stallions is rigorous, based on tests {{at the age of}} three. The breeding goal is to produce horses with the ideal conformation and good character. The gaits are subject to particular observation in all stallions, and during the three-year-old inspections, they must perform a dressage test, a cross-country jumping test, a test on the longe line and a physical inspection. The Mérens {{has one of the most}} stringent inspection procedures, and breeders aim to achieve a steady increase in the quality of the breed. Mares are evaluated during a breed competition organized by the French <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Population {{numbers for}} the Castillonnais are quite low. The {{majority}} of breeders are located in Castillon-en-Couserans, in Ariège, but a few {{can be found in}} Brittany and Provence. In November 2005, there were only around 260 existing Castillonnais, and a goal was created by the breed association to double the number of purebred mares between 2005 and 2014. Inbreeding is a concern due to low population numbers, and the <b>national</b> <b>stud</b> farm at Tarbes and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agronomic Research) have been brought in to help safeguard the genetic resources of the breed.|$|E
25|$|At FEI competitions, {{members of}} the military, police, <b>{{national}}</b> <b>studs,</b> <b>national</b> schools, and national institutes retain the right to wear their service dress instead of the dress required of civilian riders.|$|R
50|$|Never say Die was {{put down}} in 1975, by when his stock had won 309 races {{worth more than}} £400,000 in Great Britain. He is buried in The <b>National</b> <b>Stud's</b> horse cemetery.|$|R

5|$|The French <b>national</b> <b>stud,</b> the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} {{registration}} of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, {{but does not}} allow the registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a <b>national</b> <b>stud</b> in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be implemented, and media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|The breed is {{accessible}} {{to the public at}} l'Asinerie nationale de la Tillauderie, an experimental farm in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in Charente-Maritime, and at the Saintes <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b> Members of the breed are exhibited at the annual Paris International Agricultural Show. Approximately a dozen horses are exported each year, mainly to Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. A few breeding stallions have been exported to the United States. Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a draft animal, as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal. A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|At FEI Grand Prix levels, {{dress is}} more {{strictly}} controlled. Riders must wear white or light-colored shirts, white ties or chokers, black or brown boots, white or light fawn breeches, and red or black jackets. Members of the military, police forces, and <b>national</b> <b>studs,</b> however, retain {{the right to}} wear their service uniforms instead of FEI-prescribed dress. [...] In some circumstances, members of international teams may wear jackets in their country's respective colors or add national insignia.|$|R
5000|$|France {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} producers of Anglo-Arabians. The French Anglo-Arab traces back to two stallions: the Arabian stud Massoud and Aslam, a [...] "Turkish" [...] horse, probably of the now-extinct Turkoman or [...] "Turkmene" [...] breed. These Syrian imports were then crossed with a trio of Thoroughbreds, specifically, the Comus Mare, the Selim Mare, and Daer. Some years later, three of their daughters — Clovis, Danae, and Delphine — formed the foundation of the French Anglo-Arabian breeding program. The programs primary Anglo-Arab breeding farm, Pompadour <b>National</b> Anglo-Arab <b>Stud,</b> is located in Arnac-Pompadour, a commune of central Frances Corrèze department, home to the famous Château de Pompadour. In addition, the area serves as the French <b>National</b> <b>Studs</b> headquarters. The Anglo-Arabian possesses one of Frances oldest studbooks, and the Selle Français, the countrys leading sport horse, still bears the stamp of significant Anglo-Arab influence.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} of the modern Anglo-Norman horse {{is similar to that}} of many other French regional equine populations of the 19th century, when government-run <b>national</b> <b>studs</b> transformed indigenous French horses by introducing foreign stallions. Arabians and Thoroughbreds were major influences. The most common crossbreeding was between native mares used by the military or for pulling carriages and Thoroughbred stallions, and by 1914 these types were recognized as [...] "demi-sang" [...] or [...] "half-blood" [...] horses. Half-blood horses were found in many French regions, and different types were usually named after the regions in which they were bred.|$|R
5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> to redirect its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|Although breed {{associations}} and the French <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> are making {{efforts to protect}} the breed, very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the breed very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in breed numbers is proof that the breed is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began {{to limit the number}} of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other <b>national</b> <b>stud</b> books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E
50|$|After the {{continental}} trading blockade was raised, following {{the defeat of}} Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo in 1815, the market-wise Normandy breeders began to use their common but tough, all-purpose Norman stock {{as a foundation for}} breeding horses for general military use, both riding and light draught, and then, increasingly, to produce specialized horses of both types. Supported by the Administration of <b>National</b> <b>Studs,</b> they imported English Thoroughbreds and, just as importantly {{in the context of the}} trotting horse, English half-bred or hunter stallions, which were then unknown in France. They also imported the incomparable Norfolk Roadster the greatest trotter under saddle and in harness in the whole of Europe.|$|R
50|$|Riding attire is {{different}} {{in each of the}} three phases. Dressage and stadium jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire. However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider's attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors. Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and <b>national</b> <b>studs</b> are required to wear service dress in the dressage and stadium jumping phases.|$|R
50|$|The World Arabian Horse Organization (WAHO) is {{the world}} {{organization}} for the preservation, improvement and preservation of Arabian horses. WAHO grants membership to nations after examination of <b>national</b> breeding <b>stud</b> books, and review of regulations for each country.|$|R
5|$|Members of {{the breed}} are shown {{annually}} at the Paris International Agricultural Show. There are fairs {{held for the}} breed at Lessay and Gavray, in Manche. The <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> at Saint-Lo remains involved in the maintenance {{and development of the}} breed, and organizes the annual national competition for the breed. The stud also organizes events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the Ardennes to improve the latter's gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, traveling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American Stud Book, the {{registration}} book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much {{later than the}} General Stud Book, and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other <b>national</b> <b>stud</b> books, unlike the General Stud Book rules. In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem {{was the fact that}} American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby.|$|E
5|$|The Poitevin breed {{has very}} low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals {{registered}} with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were covered, with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year. Over the past decade, {{the highest number of}} foals registered was 113 in 2008, and between 80 and 90 foals were registered in the other years. The majority of breeding farms are located in the Poitou area, including Vendée (especially around Fontenay-le-Comte and Luçon), Deux-Sèvres (especially near Melle), Vienna and Civray, and some in Charente, near Ruffec. There are <b>National</b> <b>Studs</b> located in Saintes and Vendée. There are a few breeders in Maine-et-Loire.|$|R

500|$|In 1955, Nabor {{was sold}} to Poland. [...] The Polish were {{rebuilding}} their Arabian breeding program following World War II, and wanted a stallion that would restore the Ibrahim sire line to their <b>national</b> <b>studs.</b> Ibrahim was a desert-bred stallion brought to Poland in 1907 by Count Joseph Potocki. [...] The horse was killed in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution, {{and by the end}} of World War II, the sire line had been lost to Poland. It was preserved via Ibrahim's son Skowronek, who had been exported to England in 1912, and Skowronek was the great-grandsire of Nabor. [...] In Poland, Nabor was first put to stud at the Albigowa State Stud, then in 1957 moved to the Michalow State Stud. [...] While in Poland, he was noted for his docile temperament, intelligence, soundness, and Saklawi-style Arabian beauty: [...] "dry, fine head with expressive eye, swan neck and milk-white hair unusual for his age ... he resembled the Arabian horses painted by Juliusz Kossak, the best painter of oriental horses." [...] In 1962, the Poles were also able to import his sire Negatiw.|$|R
5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft, the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{owes its}} {{survival}} {{to a small}} group of enthusiasts, working with the French <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b> A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a genetic bottleneck in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Québec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of inbreeding, leading the Unité Nationale de Sélection et de Promotion de Race to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998. At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and Belgian horses was suggested to increase genetic diversity using morphologically and historically similar breeds. The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.|$|E
5|$|The modern Norman Cob is {{slightly}} heavier {{than it was}} in the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category. The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the Institut national de la recherche agronomique and Institut national agronomique performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been inbred and suffered genetic drift from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} the Anglo-Norman was in Lower Normandy, known for horse breeding, thanks to its climate and soil. The breed {{developed}} region-specific specializations. [...] Le Merlerault is the oldest area of origin, and mainly produced saddle horses, while the Cotentin and Auge valleys produced carriage horses. The main center for breeding, especially during the Second French Empire (1852-1870), was the plains around Caen, where young foals were placed on pasture. The <b>National</b> <b>Studs</b> at Saint-Lô and du Pin, originally military studs for the breeding of cavalry horses, also participated in the breeding of Anglo-Norman horses. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, in the Orne, the Anglo-Norman arose almost exclusively in the district of Alençon, specifically Merlerault, with a few being bred in the department of Calvados. Today, Normandy, still a horse breeding center, is home to 20 percent of all mares of the Selle Français breed, the national French sport horse developed in large part from the Anglo-Norman. [...] The region has produced numerous Selle Français that have been successful in international competition.|$|R

5|$|The {{studbook}} for the Poitevin {{horse was}} created by the Société Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-Sèvres on June 26, 1884, with a horse section and a donkey section. The first edition was released December 31, 1885, setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses. In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry, backed by the purchase of mules by the French <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> and bonuses given to the best stallions.|$|E
5|$|Thought to have {{originated}} in prehistoric times, the exact {{early history of}} the Mérens remains a mystery. Theories on its origins include descent from Iberian horses, similar to many regional mountain horses, or possibly Oriental horses brought to the area by settlers from the east. Small black horses from the area of Ariège have been recorded {{as early as the}} time of Julius Caesar, as well as being associated with Charlemagne. They pulled artillery for Napoleon's Grand Army, as well as being used by farmers, dock workers, miners and smugglers moving goods through the Pyrenees mountains. They were frequently seen at local horse fairs, and were used to breed mules in a cross with Catalan donkeys. By the end of the 19th century, they had gained a reputation as light cavalry horses. At the same time, however, uncontrolled crossbreeding led to a decline in the purebred population, and in 1908 the local agricultural society was put in charge of the breed. The breed registry was created in 1933, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French <b>National</b> <b>Stud.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{mechanization}} {{of transport}} {{and the military}} in the 20th century, the Anglo-Norman was no longer in demand as a carriage and military horse. In addition, World War II and the German occupation of France caused significant damage to the Norman homeland of the breed as fighting destroyed farms and killed half of the horses at the <b>National</b> <b>Stud</b> at Saint-Lô. Most of the surviving were of the Norman Cob breed, and horses lost their status as animals of luxury and leisure. Many farms were left in ruins, and breeders were left rethinking their breeding aims. Certain provisions of the Marshall Plan convinced them not to focus on breeding draft horses, and that type began to disappear. Instead, emphasis shifted toward producing horses for equestrian sports, and a stud book was created for the Anglo-Norman breed on December 7, 1950, at Saint-Lô. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Anglo-Norman became a major force in international equine competition. At the 1964 Summer Olympics, the Anglo-Norman Lutteur B won a gold medal in show jumping.|$|E
