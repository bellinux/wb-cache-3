Six factors were identified in winter and five factors in summer. PMF-resolved source profiles were consistent with source profiles established by near-field measurements. The major sources were traffic-related emissions (combustion and gasoline evaporation) in winter and in summer accounting for 51 and 74 wt %, respectively, in agreement with the national emission inventory. The gasoline evaporation related to traffic source had a significant contribution regardless of the season (22 wt % in winter and 30 wt % in summer). The NMHC emissions from road transport are estimated from observations and PMF results, and compared to local and global emission inventories. The PMF analysis finds reasonable differences on emission rates, of 20 – 39 % higher than the national road transport inventory. However, global inventories (ACCMIP, EDGAR, MACCity) underestimate the emissions up to a factor of 10 for the transportation sector. When combining emission inventory to our results, there is strong evidence that control measures in Lebanon should be targeted on mitigating the NMHC emissions from the traffic-related sources. From a global perspective, an assessment of VOC (volatile organic compounds) anthropogenic emission inventories for the Middle East region as a whole seems necessary as these emissions could be much higher than expected at least from the road transport sector...|$|E

Road {{traffic is}} one of the major {{anthropogenic}} emission sectors for NOx, CO and <b>NMHCs</b> (<b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons).</b> We applied ECHAM 4 /CBM, a general circulation model coupled to a chemistry module, which includes higher hydrocarbons, to investigate the global impact of 1990 road traffic emissions on the atmosphere.

It is revealed that NMHC emissions from road traffic play a key role for the impact on ozone.

Improving over previous global modelling studies, which concentrated on road traffic NO x and CO emissions only, we assess the impact of NMHC emissions from road traffic. It is revealed that NMHC emissions from road traffic play a key role for the impact on ozone. They are responsible for (indirect) long-range transport of NO x from road traffic via the formation of PAN, which is not found in a simulation without NMHC emissions from road traffic. Long-range transport of NMHC-induced PAN impacts on the ozone distribution in Northern Hemisphere regions far away from the sources, especially in arctic and remote maritime regions. In July total road traffic emissions (NO x, CO and NMHCs) contribute to the zonally averaged ozone distribution by more than 12 % near the surface in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes and arctic latitudes. In January road traffic emissions contribute near the surface in northern and southern extratropics more than 8 %. Sensitivity studies for regional emission show that effective transport of road traffic emissions occurs mainly in the free troposphere. In tropical latitudes of America up to an altitude of 200 hPa, global road traffic emissions contribute about 8 % to the ozone concentration. In arctic latitudes NMHC emissions from road transport are responsible for about 90 % of PAN increase from road transport, leading to a contribution to ozone concentrations of up to 15 %...|$|R

40|$|<b>NMHC</b> (<b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> are a {{major group}} of {{atmospheric}} trace gases with impact on photochemical processes in the atmosphere, especially oxidant formation with ozone being {{the most prominent of}} them, and contributions to SOA (secondary organic aerosols). By this, they are coupled to climate issues via the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas ozone and aerosol effects. NMHC monitoring was initiated in Europe in the “Tropospheric Ozone Research” project (1988 - 1995), and it was continued in EMEP and GAW (Global Atmosphere Watch) where it is an ongoing initiative which recently has been reinforced (GAW Report 171). In this presentation we will focus on time series from Central European mountain stations (46 - 49 °N, 7 - 13 °E) : Hohenpeissenberg (985 m, DWD, Germany, 1998 -ongoing), Rigi (1031 m, EMPA, Switzerland, 2003 -ongoing), Junfraujoch (3580 m, EMPA, Switzerland, 2000 -ongoing, and ULg (FTIR), Belgium, 1984 -ongoing), Zugpitze (2650 m, UBA, Germany, 2000 -ongoing), Schauinsland (1205 m, FZ-Jülich (1989 - 94), and UBA, Germany, 2004 -ongoing), Brotjacklriegel (1016 m, UBA, Germany, 2000 - 2004), Donon (775 m, EMD, France, 1997 - 2007). Most sites used weekly flask samples but also on-line measurements were carried out with higher time resolution within the former TOR project and in the more recent time series at Hohenpeissenberg, Rigi, and Jungfraujoch. All samples were analysed by GC. Additionally to these GC measurements, a time series of column integrated acetylene and ethane by FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometry) is available from Jungfraujoch, from 1984 onwards. We focus here on time series of monthly averages of anthropogenic hydrocarbons over the 1997 - 2009 time period. They show quite similar patterns among the various stations over the whole period with pronounced seasonal cycles. Significantly lower mixing ratios were measured at the highest elevated sites, the Zugspitze and Jungfraujoch. Differences between the lower mountain sites (775 - 1200 m) are on first view surprisingly small. Generally, the differences between the high altitude and the other mountain sites are lowest in summer due to enhanced vertical mixing and thermal upslope winds. Downward trends for anthropogenic hydrocarbons are very similar at the various stations and are 2 %/yr for C 2 -C 3 alkanes (+/- 1 %), 3 - 6 %/yr for C 4 -C 7 alkanes (+/- 2 %), 2 - 3 %/yr for C 2 -C 3 alkynes and ethene (+/- 2 %), 4 % /yr for propene and benzene (+/- 2 %), and 5 - 10 %/yr for toluene and xylenes (+/- 3 and 5 %, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{and its effects}} on the ecosystem {{has been a source of}} concern for many environmental pollution organizations in the world. In particular climatologists who are not directly involved in petroleum industry sometimes express concerns about the environmental impacts of gas emissions from flaring at well heads. For environmental and resource conservation reasons, flaring should always be minimized as much as practicable and consistent with safety considerations. However, any level of flaring has a local environmental impact, as well as producing emissions which have the potential to contribute to the global warming. In the present research the Industrial Source Complex (ISCST 3) Dispersion Model is used to calculate the ground level concentrations of two selected primary pollutants (i. e. methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> emitted due to flaring in all of Kuwait Oilfields. In additional, the performance of the ISCST 3 model is assessed, by comparing the model prediction with the observed concentration of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> obtained from the monitoring sites. The described model evaluation is based on the comparison of 50 highest daily measured and predicted concentrations of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons.</b> The overall conclusion of this comparison is that the model predictions are in good agreement with the observed data (accuracy range of 60 - 95 %) from the monitoring stations maintained by the Kuwait Environmental Public Authority (EPA). A specific important conclusion of this study is that, there is a need for a proper emission inventory strategy for Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) as means of monitoring and minimizing the impact of methane and <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> released because of flaring activities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> such as ethane are {{important}} precursors to tropospheric ozone and aerosols. Using {{data from a}} global surface network and atmospheric column observations we show that the steady decline in the ethane mole fraction {{that began in the}} 1970 s 1, 2, 3 halted between 2005 and 2010 in most of the Northern Hemisphere and has since reversed. We calculate a yearly increase in ethane emissions in the Northern Hemisphere of 0. 42 (± 0. 19) [*]Tg[*]yr− 1 between mid- 2009 and mid- 2014. The largest increases in ethane and the shorter-lived propane are seen over the central and eastern USA, with a spatial distribution that suggests North American oil and natural gas development as the primary source of increasing emissions. By including other co-emitted oil and natural gas <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> we estimate a Northern Hemisphere total <b>non-methane</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> yearly emission increase of 1. 2 (± 0. 8) [*]Tg[*]yr− 1. Atmospheric chemical transport modelling suggests that these emissions could augment summertime mean surface ozone by several nanomoles per mole near oil and natural gas production regions. Methane/ethane oil and natural gas emission ratios could suggest a significant increase in associated methane emissions; however, this increase is inconsistent with observed leak rates in production regions and changes in methane’s global isotopic ratio...|$|R
