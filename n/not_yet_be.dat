5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations with malicious intent could send {{information that could}} enable human civilization to destroy itself, such as powerful computer viruses or {{information on how to}} make extremely potent weapons that humans would <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> able to use responsibly. While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use {{on the part of the}} extraterrestrials. According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security. Even a virtual machine on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth. In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the Encyclopædia Galactica until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.|$|E

5000|$|A prochronism (from the Greek πρό, [...] "before", and χρόνος, [...] "time") is an {{impossible}} anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> invented {{when the situation}} takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time (e.g. The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci {{at the top of}} this page). A prochronism may <b>be</b> an object <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> developed, a verbal expression that had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> coined, a philosophy <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> formulated, a breed of animal <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> evolved (or perhaps engineered), or use of a technology that had <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> created.|$|R

25|$|In early Imperial China, {{the common}} script was the Xiaozhuan style. About 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, {{the first to}} conquer all of China, imposed Li Si's {{character}} uniformisation, a set of 3300 standardized Xiǎozhuàn characters. Its graphs on old steles — some dating from 200 BC — reveal indications of the stroke order of the time. However, stroke order could still <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> ascertained from the steles, and no paper from that time is extant.|$|E
25|$|Consecutively {{in order}} of appearance: The sheets are {{numbered}} consecutively as each is published. Thus, {{it is not possible}} to determine the sheets neighbouring a particular sheet without a current sheet index. Nor is it always possible to indicate on a sheet's map surround the numbers of adjacent sheets, as the date of publication of forthcoming sheets (and therefore thei place in the numbering system) may <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> known. This system is therefore suitable only for small maps, or those in an irregular sheet division (as in tourist maps published by the private sector), and is seldom now used for modern official map series. Example: Geological Atlas of Switzerland (1:25,000).|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this generosity, the {{ambition}} of the board to make the SFPP, as its name indicates, a printing company {{as well as a}} newspaper publishing company, could <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> satisfied. The cost of fitting out a printshop was too high and therefore, after a call for tenders, the printing of Sinn Féin was subcontracted to Fowler & Co., a neighbour of the SFPP, which handled the printing of the newspaper until May 1908. From then until the autumn of 1910, the contract was given to An Cló Chumann, a Dublin company specialised in Irish language printing which Seumas McManus had helped to set up several years previously.|$|E

25|$|Thus his raid upon Dobrzyń, {{the latest}} {{acquisition}} of the knights on Polish soil, speedily gave them a ready weapon against him. The Prussian bishops, who were devoted to the knights, questioned the authority of Gediminas letters and denounced him as {{an enemy of the}} faith at a synod in Elbing; his Orthodox subjects reproached him with leaning towards the Latin heresy, while the pagan Lithuanians accused him of abandoning the ancient gods. Gediminas disentangled himself from his difficulties by repudiating his former promises; by refusing to receive the papal legates who arrived at Riga in September 1323, and by dismissing the Franciscans from his territories. These apparently retrogressive measures simply amounted to a statesmanlike recognition {{of the fact that the}} pagan element was still the strongest force in Lithuania, and could <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> dispensed with in the coming struggle for nationality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{problematic}} case is {{the cases}} of desired non-disclosure of PGD results for some genetic disorders that may <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> apparent in a parent, such as Huntington disease. It is applied when patients {{do not wish to}} know their carrier status but want to ensure that they have offspring free of the disease. This procedure can place practitioners in questionable ethical situations, e.g. when no healthy, unaffected embryos are available for transfer and a mock transfer has to be carried out so that the patient does not suspect that he/she is a carrier. The ESHRE ethics task force currently recommends using exclusion testing instead. Exclusion testing is based on a linkage analysis with polymorphic markers, in which the parental and grandparental origin of the chromosomes can be established. This way, only embryos are replaced that do not contain the chromosome derived from the affected grandparent, avoiding the need to detect the mutation itself.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{the debate}} about the ferry arose again. The bridge would {{necessarily}} terminate the car ferry service, but many locals wanted to keep a passenger ferry, which would provide faster service between Bergen and Kleppestø than the buses could. A public meeting held on 1 November 1977 established the Information Panel For the Askøy Bridge which demanded that the bridge <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> built and the ferry service remain. Within a week they presented a report to the county municipality's transport committee, but were not able to convince the committee to instruct the toll company to work to retain a passenger ferry service. Protests were also made by parents at Lyderhorn School and Nybø School in Bergen, which were both located along the roads which were proposed used to connect to the bridge. The issue was discussed in the county council on 14 December. The council voted principally in favor of a bridge, but did not give any grants. It also did not prioritize between the Askøy Bridge and the planned Nordhordland Bridge.|$|E

500|$|As part of Ed Dubinsky's APOS {{theory of}} {{mathematical}} learning, {{he and his}} collaborators (2005) propose that students who conceive of 0.999... as a finite, indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have [...] "not yet constructed a complete process conception of the infinite decimal". Other students who have a complete process conception of 0.999... may <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> able to [...] "encapsulate" [...] that process into an [...] "object conception", like the object conception they have of 1, and so they view the process 0.999... and the object 1 as incompatible. Dubinsky et al. also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing [...] as a number {{in its own right}} and to dealing with the set of natural numbers as a whole.|$|E
500|$|... was a central-battery ironclad {{built for}} the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the 1870s. She {{was built in the}} United Kingdom because such ships could <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>be</b> {{constructed}} in Japan. The ship participated in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 where she was damaged during the Battle of the Yalu River in 1894 and participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895. She collided with two Japanese ships during a storm and sank in 1897. She was refloated the following year and repaired. Fusō played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and was reclassified as a coast defense ship after the war. She was struck from the Navy List in 1908 and sold for scrap the following year.|$|E

Completed in 1878, Kongō briefly served with the Small Standing Fleet before becoming a training ship in 1887, thereafter making training cruises to the Mediterranean and to countries {{on the edge of the}} Pacific Ocean. The ship returned to active duty during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 where she participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei. Kongō resumed her training duties after the war, though she also played a minor role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The ship was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906 and was sold for scrap in 1910.|$|E
