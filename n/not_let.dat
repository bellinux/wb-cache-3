5|$|Blackwell's son and {{approximately}} 50 other children boycotted the school, {{because of its}} decision to <b>not</b> <b>let</b> the children wear the SNCC freedom pins.

The schools became popular and continued to teach classes every summer until 1970, when the local schools finally desegregated.|$|E

5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial that he did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of}} the Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E

5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> go easily.|$|E

He urges Travers to <b>not</b> <b>let</b> deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} bankruptcy, Rail Management {{established}} a new company, Ofotbanen Drift AS, {{to take over}} the estate in bankruptcy. They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had <b>not</b> <b>let</b> them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate. The company filed for bankruptcy in May, after the Norwegian Tax Administration could not claim NOK700,000 in due taxes.|$|E
