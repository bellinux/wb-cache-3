Questionnaires were col-lected in this study to appraise thermal sensation vote (TSV) of crews and passengers in specific ship cabins environment during a hot season. Predicted mean vote (PMV) was calculated based on the field environmental data. The <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> was 22. 6 C for passen-gers, 22. 9 C for the working crews and 20. 9 C for resting crews based on calculation using TSV regres-sion. From PMV regression, the <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> was 24. 0 C for passengers, 25. 1 C for working crew and 24. 7 C for resting crew. Predicted <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> from PMV {{is higher than the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> from TSV. Human factors of crew, metabolism rate and clothing insulation were reasonably modified in order to minimise the differences between TSV and PMV and predict PMV accurately. Investigation of the thermal preference and productivity of the crews were also carried out during the field experiment. The results showed that female subjects or elderly subjects (above 40) preferred working in warmer environment and that <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> can not ensure high productivity. Therefore, variance exists between thermal sensation and thermal preference. From the field data analysis, productivity of the crew in slightly cool or slightly warm environment was higher than that in the environment with <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature.</b> Productivity is 101. 7 % when TSV is 0 and reaches the peak of 105. 1 % in slightly cool environment.

The findings on the occupants living in naturally ventilated buildings {{have shown that the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature,</b> Tn ranges from 26.1 °C to 28.9 °C and the average Tn is 28.1 °C.

The findings on the occupants living in air-conditioned or mixed both naturally ventilated and air-conditioned buildings have shown that the <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature,</b> Tn ranges from 24.2 °C to 27.5 °C and the average Tn is 25.9 °C.

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the effect of radon mineral water applied in the form of full baths on blood pressure in people with hypertension. Methods: A total of 27 patients, average age 58. 10 years with hypertension were included in the study. Balneotherapy was applied in the form of full baths with mineral radon water of <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature.</b> Values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before and after twenty minutes therapy on the first and fifth day of treatment. Results: On the first day of treatment there was no significant change in blood pressure after the application of full baths with mineral radon water of <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> (systolic pressure t = 0. 697, not significant; diastolic pressure t = 0. 505, not significant).

This allowed independent verification of the absolute temperatures in the relatively quiet conditions early in the night, especially important given the context provided by co-located EISCAT ion temperature measurements which allow investigation of the likely emission altitude of the passive FPI measurements. The results demonstrate that this altitude changes from 120 km pre-midnight to 115 km post-midnight.

40|$|Summary: Continuously welded rails {{generate}} forces, {{which can}} cause dangerous rail failures, if not managed. A recently developed method allows the fast non-destructive (nd) determination of rail stresses, weakened track conditions and <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> in fixed track between traffic. Based on the magneto-elastic principle the interaction with the microstructure is measured. The amplitude of the detected Mag-netic Barkhausen Noise (MBN) containing the pulses generated in the rail depends on the stress. The latter may become complex in curves and under weakened track conditions, which requires special attention. The presented technique offers a wide spread use for <b>neutral</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements and covers the actual need of a non-destructive SFT measuring technique...|$|E
