This category of <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> has historical roots going back many decades but has relatively recent focus due to new discoveries of unique properties of some nanoscale <b>materials.</b> Bulk <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> are prepared {{by a variety of}} severe plastic deformation methods, and these will be reviewed. Powder processing to prepare bulk <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> requires that the powders be consolidated by typically combinations of pressure and temperature, the latter leading to coarsening of the microstructure. The thermal stability of <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> will also be discussed.

50|$|The average {{hardness}} of {{a material}} decreases with d (crystallite size) decreasing below 10 nm. There {{have been many}} mechanisms proposed for grain boundary sliding and hence material softening, but the details are still not understood. Besides grain boundary strengthening, much attention has been put into building microheterostructures, or nanostructures of two materials with very large differences in elastic moduli. Heterostructures were first proposed in 1970 and contained such highly ordered thin layers {{that they could not}} theoretically be separated by mechanical means. These highly ordered heterostructures were believed to be stronger than simple mixtures. This theory was confirmed with Al/Cu and Al/Ag structures. After the formation of Al/Cu and Al/Ag, the research was extended to multilayer systems including Cu/Ni, TiN/VN, W/WN, Hf/HfN and more. In all cases, decreasing the lattice period increased the hardness. One common form of a <b>nanostructured</b> <b>material</b> is aggregated diamond nanorods, which is harder than bulk diamond and is currently the hardest (~150 GPa) material known.|$|E

30|$|Martensitic {{transformation}} in <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> has attracted considerable scientific interest {{over the past}} decades because phase transformation behaviors in <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> are different from their conventional coarse-grained counterparts [1, 2]. To explain abnormal martensitic transformation behaviors, many competing theories have been suggested, including lack of nucleation sites [3], inhibition of nanotwin boundaries [4], surface energy difference [5, 6], and interfacial stress due to particle curvature [7, 8]. Among them, {{it is widely believed}} that interfacial stress {{plays an important role in}} abnormal martensitic transformation of <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> due to the high volume fraction of interfaces. Nevertheless, this viewpoint has only been brought forward in theories, which has difficulty to be verified through experiment. In addition, stress-induced martensitic transformation has been widely observed and investigated in past half a century [9 – 11]. Martensitic transformations could be found to be affected in a variety of ways of the application of stress. However, whether the martensitic transformations in <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> can be influenced by the nanoscaled stress has rarely been documented, which is of great importance to martensitic transformation research in <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{mechanical}} properties of <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials,</b> defined hereafter {{as having a}} mean grain size that falls in the 50 - 200 nm ranges, is reviewed and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> that are processed via two synthesis approaches: consolidation of nanocrystalline powders and electrodeposition. The present review demonstrates that processing history significantly influ-ences mechanical behavior as revealed by the following observations. First, a low strain harden-ing behavior is usually observed during the plastic deformation of <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> processed by milling (also known as mechanical milling or attrition). The phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} process of dislocation annihilation or dynamic recovery during plastic deforma-tion. Second, the reported asymmetry of yield strength between tension and compression can be rationalized based on the existence of porosity or the presence of a bimodal phase distribution. Third, significant strain hardening behavior is generally observed in <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> processed by electrodeposition. The observation of strain hardening in nanostructured materi-als can be explained on the basis of dislocation multiplication. Fourth, the low ductility that is frequently reported for <b>nanostructured</b> <b>materials</b> is related to an absence of dislocation activity. Recent work reviewed suggests that this limitation may be surmounted by implementing the concept of multiple length scales in the microstructure. 1...|$|R
