30|$|According to a {{previous}} study [8], <b>noise</b> <b>type</b> classification accuracy using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for four known and distinct types of noise is nearly 100 %. This suggests that <b>noise</b> <b>type</b> classification, assuming diverse and well-separated noise classes, does not adversely affect the performance of MMSR. However, {{this is no longer}} true when an unknown type of noise signal is present in the test speech. Since <b>noise</b> <b>type</b> mismatch can significantly impact performance, a strategy to address any <b>noise</b> <b>type</b> difference between training and test noisy speech should be employed. Since most conventional methods have focused on compensating the difference between clean and noise-corrupted speech, they cannot be directly applied to MMSR. Jacobian adaptation has been used to adapt the parameters of HMMs in changing noise conditions with some success [12, 13]. However, since this is based on a simple linear approximation of the nonlinear cepstral distortion, it does not accurately reflect the changing noise conditions present in the HMM parameters.|$|E

This methodology combined a wavelet transform algorithm with a logarithmic transform algorithm, and carried on the thorough analysis for the characteristics of interferogram wavelet coefficients from two aspects of energy distribution and statistics. Firstly, energy distribution characteristics of low frequency son-band coefficients were researched {{before and after the}} logarithmic transform, so that <b>noise</b> <b>type</b> of interferogram can be identified. On this base, the noise level would be estimated by high frequency coefficients. From the analysis results obtained in this study, the conclusions can be made that noise of InSAR interferogram is the additive noise, high frequency coefficients show standard normal distribution, and the noise level could be estimated by HH son-band on one scale. These results provide more spaces for noise analysis and processing of InSAR interferogram based on the wavelet transform algorithm...|$|E

40|$|For a sound source, {{directivity}} is {{an important}} parameter to specify. This parameter also reflects the physical feature of the sound generation mechanism. In this article, studies on the directivity of railway noise, by measurement and by theoretical investigation, are discussed extensively and systematically. The two most important <b>noise</b> <b>types,</b> i. e. rolling noise and aerodynamic noise, are focused on. A model of perpendicular dipole pair is proposed to interpret the measurement specified directivity characters of wheel/rail radiation. This model naturally explains why a vibrating railway wheel does not present dipole directivity character and why rail radiation is of different vertical and horizontal directivity characters. Moreover pantograph noise is also found to be of perpendicular dipole components. As for aerodynamic noise around bogies, scattering of the air flow is proposed to be the mechanism of the noise generation; this understanding leads to a different directivity description for the noise component. Directivities of other important <b>noise</b> <b>types</b> are discussed as well; their directivities become understood, although lacking of relevant directivity data.
