5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their <b>non-support</b> for Adams {{if there was no}} support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and <b>non-support,</b> and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process of getting a divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E

40|$|Influences of {{reaction}} conditions on methane decomposition over <b>non-supported</b> Ni catalystEffects {{of reaction}} temperature and methane gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on methane decomposition over <b>non-supported</b> Ni catalyst {{have been investigated}} in this work. Methane molecules activation, Ni particles growth and nano-carbon diffusion were the main factors influencing methane decomposition stability of <b>non-supported</b> Ni. The results of methane decomposition activity test on the <b>non-supported</b> Ni catalyst showed that the prepared <b>non-supported</b> Ni could exhibit a good methane decomposition performance with 273 g(C) /g(Ni) and 2667 mol(H 2) /mol(Ni) at 500 degrees C and 45000 mL/(g(cat). h).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this survey was to reduce the use of human albumin 20 % in <b>non-supported</b> {{indications}} at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. Methods: During a 30 -day period, in December 2006, a preliminary prospective analysis of medical prescriptions of human albumin 20 % and therapeutic indications according to ANVISA RDC 115 guidelines was performed. Based on this analysis, a project was developed. In January 2007, a daily routine to follow up albumin prescriptions by the Hospital pharmacists was established. Results: From January to October 2007, 14, 799 vials of albumin 20 % were used, out of which 4, 191 had <b>non-supported</b> indications, resulting in a R$ 1. 36 million loss. In 2008 (from January to October), 13, 519 vials of albumin 20 % were prescribed, and 1, 648 of them had <b>non-supported</b> indications, causing a R$ 535 thousand loss. The ratio between loss risk and consumed amount was 91. 99 between January and October 2007. During {{the same period in}} 2008, this ratio was 39. 60. Between January and October 2007, the average percentage of albumin prescribed for <b>non-supported</b> indications was 28 %, whereas this percentage dropped to 13 %, i. e., a decrease by 54 %, during the same period of 2008. Conclusions: The inclusion of a pharmacist in the process of verifying medicine indications and justification of use was translated into safer processes to patients, ensuring that they received the correct medication for the correct indication, therefore reducing the chance of adverse events and contributing to reduce red-tape procedures and unnecessary expenditures by the institution...|$|R

Conventional evolutionary approaches struggle to discover near-optimal solutions due to the combinatorial search space, and the difficulty in discovering the <b>non-supported</b> solutions. Recently, a knowledge-based evolutionary approach, KEA, has been developed that overcomes {{some of the problems}} of the earlier algorithms as it is not restricted to the bi-criterion case, finds <b>non-supported</b> solutions and scales well to larger problems; however, the mid-point of its Pareto front is often dominated by alternative algorithms where they are applicable. Novel extensions to KEA, increasing the knowledge of the mid-point, termed KEA-W are examined, eliminating the mid-point deficiencies at the cost of computational time...|$|R

30|$|In {{preparation}} of the aforementioned bimetallic catalysts, GRR was widely employed to provide a simple and cost-effective fabrication approach [10, 11]. By utilizing {{the difference in the}} standard reduction potentials, replacement between two metals can be easily achieved at ambient condition. Many metal composites prepared by GRR have been reported, including Ag-Au [12, 13], Pt-Au [14, 15], Pd-Pt [16, 17], Ag-Pt [18 - 21], Pd-Ag [22, 23], Cu-Pd [24], and Cu-Ag [25]. However, most of the studies focused on the {{preparation of}} <b>non-supported</b> catalysts. The prepared catalysts suspended in the solution could be hardly collected and deposited on the electrodes in the electrochemical cells. Moreover, the effective electrochemical surface area of the <b>non-supported</b> catalysts could be greatly sacrificed due to the aggregation of nano-catalysts in brushing or printing process [4, 26].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{survival}} of the self-employed who have received start-up grants and compare them to non-grant recipients.

Human capital from prior experience and assets strongly influenced the survival of supported start-ups, whereas social capital was less significant than for <b>non-supported</b> start-ups. The better survival of supported firms can be explained by the assessment process and the training prerequisite for grants rather than the relatively small and short financial support. However, the supported entrepreneurs ended up more likely to become unemployed after failure, whereas the others moved on to activities outside the labour force...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method for {{handling}} logically conflicting inputs into knowledge bases in a compromised way. The method revises nite bases which are subjected to some integrity constraints, and performs a reconciliation of the conflicting data, by allowing the consistent logical consequences of the given up database elements or inputs, to update the database as a compromise. Since justifications for those consequences are not available in the revised database, they are classified as <b>non-supported</b> consequences. Those <b>non-supported</b> data are viewed as extra information which survived from the revision process. Resolving conflicting updates in dynamic databases, for instance, are frequent and critically important problems of real applications. Such problems require the revision of theories and knowledge bases. It is not realistic to aim for a generic approach in those cases, since theory revision is fundamentally dependent on application-specific mechanisms, principles and heuristics.

The method of bismuth deposition has a dramatic effect on the activity of the palladium based catalysts: spontaneous deposition of Bi on <b>non-supported</b> Pd nanoparticles leads to relatively low activity enhancement, whereas decoration of carbon-supported Pd nanoparticles by Bi 2 O 3 and Bi(OH) (3) clusters leads to very high activity increase at low overpotentials. In situ infrared spectroscopy indicated that the modification of Pd by Bi did not affect the selectivity of glycerol oxidation, whereas in the case of Pt containing catalyst, a dramatic change in selectivity occurred at low potentials...|$|R
