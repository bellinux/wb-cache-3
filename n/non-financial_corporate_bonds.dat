40|$|Trends in debt {{issuance}} have changed significantly {{over the past}} decade, both prior to the financial crisis and subsequently. This article provides an update on these trends in Canada relative to those in other capital markets and, where possible, analyzes {{the impact of the}} crisis on Canadian corporate issuance. The author examines trends in capital markets in Canada and other regions over the past ten years, focusing on three areas: the issuance of financial and <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> the issuance of financial and non-financial corporate equity, and securitization. The increased use of innovative and riskier financing prior to the crisis was less pronounced in Canada, and future refinancing needs are more in line with historical issuance levels. ...|$|E
40|$|Bond {{rating is}} one that should be {{considered}} by investors before making an investment bond. This is because bond rating provides an informative statement and provide signals about the probability of failure of a company's debt. In the bond rating process, rating agencies rate firms from various aspects, one of which is the company's financial data. Analysis of financial statements in the form of financial ratio analysis and statistical calculations can be used to detect an under or overvalued securities. Research on Indonesia's bond rating is still rare and research results have been found to show different results. Therefore, research should be repeated that test the ability of financial ratios in predicting bond ratings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find empirical evidence of financial ratios that can differentiate ratings of investment grade corporate bonds and non-investment grade, and obtained a predictive model that can assess the bond rating as appropriate. The data used are the data of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and assessed by a rating agency PEFINDO in the year 2007 - 2008. Variable research is leverage (LTLTA), liquidity (CACL), solvency (CFOTL), profitability (OIS), productivity (STA). By using discriminant analysis (MDA) with the application program of SPSS 16, this study tries to examine the financial ratios that can form a bond rating prediction model that can assess accurately. The results of this research shown below: (1) there are differences in corporate’s bond ratings of investment grade and non-investment grade in the financial ratios in liquidity (CACL), solvency (CFOTL), profitability (OIS), and productivity (STA), (2) financial ratios which can form a bond rating prediction model is CACL, OIS, STA, (3) the level of accuracy of the prediction model is formed by 94. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact of US {{quantitative}} easing (QE) on global <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> issuance. It distinguishes between two QE instruments, MBS/GSE debt and Treasury bonds, and disentangles between two channels of transmission of QE to global bond markets, namely flow effects (purchases) and stock effects (holdings). We control {{for a number of}} domestic and global macro-financial factors. In particular, we control for weaknesses in crossborder and domestic banking which might have induced the corporate sector to issue more bonds. The results indicate that US QE had a large impact on <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> issuance, especially in emerging markets, and that flow effects (i. e. portfolio rebalancing) were the main transmission channel of QE. A counterfactual analysis shows that bond issuance in emerging markets since 2009 would have been halved without QE...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the current {{macroeconomic}} environment there is an expectation of an increase in South African <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> failure, where advance prediction thereof will become even more important. A number of South African <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> failures have occurred following the financial crisis. In addition, South Africa experienced a watershed moment with the first default on a <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> in 2013. At the same time, with the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) framework there have been significant advances in the quality of financial information which should improve its usage in predicting corporate failure. This study used the latest sample to date of listed South African <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporates</b> that met the definition of failure but limited the universe of financial information to that which was prepared under IFRS. At the same time, adjustments were made to the financial data based upon pre-selection of independent credit statistic variables most commonly used in ranking relative credit risk for <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporates.</b> Additionally, equity market price data was introduced into the model to add a forward-looking information consideration. This resulted in an eleven variable model where differentiation of corporate failure was facilitated through the use of multiple discriminant analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} role of bank lending {{tightening}} on <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporate</b> (NFC) <b>bond</b> issuance in the eurozone. By utilizing a unique data set provided by the ECB Bank Lending Survey, we capture the "pure" credit supply effect on corporate external financing. We find that tightened credit standards positively affect the NFC bond issuance: A 1 pp increase in banks reporting considerable tightening on loans leads to around a 7 % increase in firms' bond issuance in the eurozone. Focusing on a spectrum of aspects contributing to bank credit tightening, we document that banks' balance sheet constraints, {{as well as the}} perception of risk lead to significantly higher NFC bond issuance. In addition, we show that stricter lending conditions, such as wider margins, higher collateral requirements and covenants significantly increase NFC bond issuance volumes too. Furthermore, the impact of bank credit tightening on firms' bond issuance is particularly observable in core eurozone countries and not in peripheral countries. This is partially due to the underdeveloped of debt capital markets in the peripheral countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new approach, {{based on the}} Merton model, to decomposing <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> spreads into the expected loss, bond risk premium and liquidity premium components. The approach focuses on establishing the bond risk premium using the equity risk premium and the hedge ratio, which are estimated using a dividend discount model and a BEKK-GARCH model. The analysis focuses on <b>non-financial</b> European BBB-rated <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> and distinguishes explicitly between German, French, Spanish and Italian firms. The {{results show that the}} bond risk premium is the largest component. While the expected loss component made the greatest contribution to the strong widening of the spreads around the turn of 2008 / 09, the spreads were then heavily dominated by the bond risk premium and investors received relatively low or, at times, no compensation for expected losses. The safe interest rate and the sovereign CDS premiums are key determinants of the expected loss component and the bond risk premium...|$|R

40|$|Because {{the option}} to call a <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> should rise in value when bond yields fall, the {{relation}} between noncallable Treasury yields and spreads of <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> yields over Treasury yields should depend on the callability of the <b>corporate</b> <b>bond.</b> I confirm this hypothesis for investment-grade <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds.</b> Although yield spreads on both callable and noncallable <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> fall when Treasury yields rise, this relation is much stronger for callable bonds.

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, Asian governments have made {{remarkable}} improvements in government bond issuances. However, {{there is very little}} progress of disintemediation in the region. It is because <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> remain underdeveloped in Asia. The key issue of Asian <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> market is its lack of credit ratings at investment grade. Without the status of investment grade, Asian <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> cannot easily gain access to international and domestic institutional investors and the <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> cannot grow easily. Three key institutional foundations are crucial to accelerate the growth of the Asian <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> namely credit insurance, securitization and Asian bond funds. The first two foundations can transform Asian <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> to be investment-grade assets and the last one can enlarge the investor base of the <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds.</b> Top-rated insurers can transform Asian <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> to be investment-grade assets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} the return volatilities of <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> equities, and Treasuries under the Merton model with stochastic interest rates. Constructing empirical volatilities using bond returns over daily, weekly, and monthly horizons, we find that empirical bond volatilities are too high to be explained by equity and Treasury volatilities. Furthermore, the results are robust to using credit default swaps rather than <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> to measure volatility in the credit market. At the daily return horizon, the excess volatility of <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> is related to known liquidity proxies. However, this relation disappears at the monthly horizon even though <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> continue to be excessively volatile.

The option market, however, contains valuable information about future movements in both stocks and <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> and these relations are unidirectional, suggesting that the option market is a preferred venue for informed trading.

Panel {{data for the}} late 1990 s show that idiosyncratic ¢rm-level volatility can explain as much cross-sectional variation in yields as can credit ratings. This ¢nding, together with the upward trend in idiosyncratic equity volatility documented by Campbell, Lettau, Malkiel, and Xu (2001), helps to explain recent increases in <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> yields.
