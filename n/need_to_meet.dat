If the mission was sabotage, reconnaissance or espionage, there was no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> in large units. If the team was to carry out direct action, often an unwise mission unless an appreciable number of the locals had military experience, it would be necessary to assemble into units for combat. Even then, the hideouts of the leadership were known only to subcell leaders. The legitimacy of the Jedburgh team came from its known affiliation with Allied powers, and it was a structure more appropriate for UW than for truly clandestine operations.|$|E
25|$|From a Maslownian perspective, Sarkar {{defends the}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> {{physical}} and mental needs before being able {{to engage in a}} journey to find that transcendental nature of the world. The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.|$|E

Currently the maximum reduction of fertility due to sperm vaccines in laboratory experiments with mice is ~75%. The lack of efficacy {{is due to}} variability of immunogenicity from one animal to another. Even when exposed to the same exact vaccine, some animals will produce abundant antibody titers to the vaccine's antigen, while others produce relatively low antibody titers. In the Eppin trial that attained 100% infertility, a small sample size (only 9 monkeys) was used, and even among this small sample 2 monkeys were dropped from the study because they failed to produce sufficiently high antibody titers.|$|E

Lisa Curtis, senior research fellow for South Asia, and Baker Spring, research fellow in National Security Policy, at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank said in a commentary, “The lack of US condemnation of India's latest missile test demonstrates that the US is comfortable with Indian progress in the nuclear and missile fields and appreciates India's <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the emerging strategic challenge posed by rising China.” “It is telling that no country has criticised India's missile test,” the US experts wrote. “The US change in position with regard to Indian missile capabilities demonstrates how far the US-India relationship has evolved over the last decade,” Curtis and Spring said.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland feudalism and its {{bonds of}} {{allegiance}} to the local laird {{was associated with the}} Jacobite risings with the result that the Hanoverian Government took steps to undermine the system. After 1747 the moot hill was not used {{as a part of the}} baronial court process and the requirement for a gathering place for soldiers was also a thing of the past. The construction of Moot halls did away with the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> in the outdoors. Moot hills gradually ceased to have any significant role and many have suffered the final ignomy of being ploughed out and their existence almost or actually forgotten. Place names and local folklore have preserved the memory of a few, however records suggest that the majority have been destroyed. A few moot hills ended up with unlikely secondary uses, such as Knockenlaw, which was used as the 'blast wall' for a gunpowder magazine and Chapel Hill which was used as a viewing point for watching horse racing.|$|E
