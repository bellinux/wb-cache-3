5|$|Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) is {{contacted}} by Tess (Susan Misner), {{a woman from}} his past who warns him to leave Boston. When he meets her, Peter intuits that she is being abused by her boyfriend Michael (David Vadim). He ambushes Michael and warns him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> Tess again. Michael then informs local crime boss Worth (Tom Riis Farrell) that Peter is back in town.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites {{on the head and}} neck have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> spiders.|$|E
5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E

5|$|Back at the caves, after {{informing the}} {{survivors}} why {{they went into}} the jungle and that Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) is dead, Jack decides that he is going after Kate and Locke. Upon reaching the Hatch, he finds no one there and rappels down the shaft on his own. While exploring, he comes across a painted mural, and a wall where the key hanging around his neck is pulled by a strong magnetic force. Finally, after being surprised by a bright light and loud music, he enters what appears to be an underground geodesic dome with computer equipment, including an Apple II Plus computer with its prompt glowing and its shift key relabeled execute. As Jack is about to use it, Locke appears and tells Jack <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it. After Jack raises the gun and asks where Kate is, Locke is revealed to be at gunpoint. The gunman threatens that he will shoot Locke if Jack does not surrender. Jack refuses, instead taunting Locke about his destiny. Finally, the gunman steps out and Jack seems to recognize him. The gunman is Desmond.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> {{the green}} {{book that is}} stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E

5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of private piers situated upon {{the western and}} northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed {{as a result of}} Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to the Tabernacle Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants littering the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to sea vessels was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides was evident in the Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted.|$|E

After 1872, he lived in Bharat Ashram with his wife and children.|$|E

25|$|Other people {{raise the}} issue of hazards to the animals in their working environments. The risk of {{accidental}} detonation of a mine by an animal is of concern to some; the Navy maintains that the chances of this are minimal, because the animals are trained <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the mines, which in any case are specifically designed not to be detonated by marine animals. Another fear is that opposing forces, aware of mine-hunting dolphins in a given area, may shoot dolphins in the water, leading to deaths of both NMMP and native animals.|$|E
25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. Automatic operation is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

500|$|As a {{very private}} man, Longfellow did not often add autobiographical {{elements}} to his poetry. Two notable exceptions are dedicated {{to the death of}} members of his family. [...] "Resignation" [...] was written {{as a response to the}} death of his daughter Fanny in 1848; it does not use first-person pronouns and is instead a generalized poem of mourning. The death of his second wife Frances, as biographer Charles Calhoun wrote, deeply affected Longfellow personally but [...] "seemed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> his poetry, at least directly". His memorial poem to her was the sonnet [...] "The Cross of Snow" [...] and was not published in his lifetime.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to this legal victory {{and based on the}} [...] "illegal or immoral acts" [...] language of the opinion, the state passed a constitutional amendment creating the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC). The California State Assembly in 1955 passed a law authorizing broad powers for the ABC to shut down any [...] "resort [...] sexual perverts." [...] The Black Cat was shut down under this authority, along with a number of other establishments. In a test case involving an Oakland bar, Vallerga v. Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the California Supreme Court struck down this new law as unconstitutional. This decision was not a complete victory, as the court noted that had the ABC's revocation been based on [...] "reports of women dancing with other women and women kissing other women" [...] it might have upheld the law. Homosexuals, therefore, had won the right to assemble but only if they agreed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
500|$|The other superheroes {{around her}} {{attempt to get}} the box from her and free her from its power; one by one it begins to corrupt them all. Pandora can see the sins above the Justice League members {{fighting}} over the box. As the battle continues, Pandora is finally able to attack the Sins, by killing Envy. Constantine takes Shazam {{out of the area}} and tricks him into switching off his powers. Constantine then uses a ritual artifact to steal Billy's powers. When he is attacked by an agent of the Cold Flame, Constantine uses the Shazam power, but is unable to control it. Billy Batson distracts the agent, giving Constantine time to kill it, and Billy regains his power. Constantine pleads with Billy <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> Pandora's box, afraid of the power it may possess, but Shazam leaves Constantine and returns to the group, where he sees the effect the box has had on Wonder Woman. He knocks the box aside and picks it up; the resulting contact corrupts him also, giving him an appearance similar to Black Adam and causing a huge ripple through the magical planes.|$|E
