5|$|After falling {{pregnant}} by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) {{gave birth}} to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies. Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then {{went in search of}} her biological parents. Brett did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), came to visit and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.|$|E

His granddaughter, Stella, who wrote a biography about him in 2001, said, [...] "He did not know that he had cancer, and he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> He did not ask much about this. He was first hospitalized in 1999. My grandfather went through with treatment, but he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about the illness. He acted with serenity every day, and because of that, we respected this wish." ...|$|E
500|$|There are ethical {{concerns}} {{related to}} prenatal genetic testing or {{preimplantation genetic diagnosis}} to ensure a child is not born with a given disease. For example, prenatal testing raises the issue of selective abortion, a choice considered unacceptable by some. As it is a dominant disease, there are difficulties in situations in which a parent does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{his or her own}} diagnosis. [...] This would require parts of the process to be kept secret from the parent.|$|E

500|$|The {{third season}} opens with Ron seen begrudgingly {{returning}} to his city hall job after the Pawnee government has been shut down for three months. Ron starts to become a father figure of sorts to April and Andy (Chris Pratt) during the third season, despite his insistence that [...] "I'm not interested in caring about people." [...] When April is hospitalized with influenza in [...] "Flu Season," [...] she starts to explain her relationship problems with Andy, but Ron insists he does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about her private affairs. However, after Ron hires Andy to be her temporary replacement, the two spend the day bonding and Ron, against his better judgment, tells Andy that April is {{in the hospital and}} that he should visit her. Later in the season, in [...] "Media Blitz," [...] Ron gets even further involved by chastising April for leading Andy on, and urges her to either forgive Andy or move on. His advice ultimately helps April decide to forgive Andy.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in advance how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E
500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually do care about you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's pointless to have the time with them and not enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of taking care of him.|$|E

2500|$|He was a secretive and mischievous man {{who enjoyed}} stories {{irrespective}} of their truth. His friends observed that his anecdotes were more notable for humour than accuracy {{and in many}} cases he set out deliberately to deceive.

The collection of clocks in his living room were all set at different times: to some people he said that this was because he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the real time; to others he claimed that it was to save him from being deafened by their simultaneous chimes.|$|E
2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just want to know where he is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who took him.

2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew what he was up to. [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
2500|$|... "Love Thing" [...] is {{the fourth}} track; it focuses on {{relationships}} and how after many disappointments the girls do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about love. The song symbolizes the Girl Power philosophy by showing the support between each other and finding the strength to continue. The fifth track, [...] "Last Time Lover", was originally called [...] "First Time Lover" [...] and was {{about the loss of}} virginity, but was discarded and changed to a song full of provocations, where sex is the main issue. The sixth track, [...] "Mama", was dedicated to the group's mothers, and deals with the difficulties in the relationships between mothers and teenagers that appear during adolescence. Reviewers described the ballad as [...] "glossy" [...] and [...] "corny". The seventh track, [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] is about the presumptuous superstar life and how someone can get trapped in the world of fame. The inspiration for this song came from some of the people the group met in the music industry. It was well received by critics, who thought that the song was one of the group's [...] "strongest and underrated songs" [...] and that it (still) [...] "feels relevant today". The two songs were released as a double A-side single, the fourth and last one released from the album, becoming the fourth consecutive number-one of the group in the United Kingdom, and reaching the top 10 across continental Europe. [...] "Something Kinda Funny", the eighth track of the album, is about the [...] "fun" [...] the group experienced together, and how it was fate that they came to know each other. The ninth track, [...] "Naked" [...] deals with vulnerability and the step from girls to women and how this process made the group stronger, something they were experiencing at that moment. It received mixed reviews from critics; some described it as [...] "soulful and funky as anything by TLC or Brand New Heavies", while others considered the song as a [...] "bit of a let down". The last track of the album, [...] "If U Can't Dance", deals with preconceived ideas about people and how sometimes they are totally different from what they appear.|$|E
