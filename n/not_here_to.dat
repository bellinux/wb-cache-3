500|$|Madonna's backup singers Donna De Lory and Niki Haris {{were called}} in to provide harmonies on [...] "Survival". She commented, [...] "The minute you walked in , she was giving you the lyric sheet. That was the atmosphere—we're <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> just hang out. It's fun, but we're here to work and get this done". De Lory recalls the {{sessions}} for [...] "Survival" [...] took a [...] "couple of hours" [...] {{and there were no}} retakes. During recording sessions, Madonna was interested in working with Austin after he produced Joi's debut album The Pendulum Vibe (1994). According to the singer, [...] "She wanted to know, 'Who is this? Who produced it? How did this happen?'" ...|$|E
500|$|General Sir Archibald Wavell {{instructed}} Morshead to {{hold the}} fortress for two months {{while the rest of}} Wavell's forces reorganised and mounted a relief mission. With the 9th Division, 18th Infantry Brigade and supporting forces from various Allied nations, Morshead's force decisively defeated Rommel's powerful initial assaults, and retained possession of the fortress. His strategy for the defence of Tobruk is still mentioned in officer training colleges around the world {{as an example of how}} to arrange and conduct in-depth defences against a superior armoured force. An important part of Morshead's tactics was conducting offensive operations when these were possible. His attitude was summed up in a reported remark, made when his attention was drawn to a British propaganda article entitled [...] "Tobruk can take it!" [...] Morshead commented: [...] "we're <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> take it, we're here to give it." ...|$|E
500|$|Written {{solely in}} first person, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] explores {{the themes of}} freedom and self-expression, {{approached}} by sultry lyrics. It puts emphasis to how she cannot be changed or molded into being something she is not. In the verses, Cyrus addresses confidence and the attempt to discover for what she is yearning for, respectively. Choruses have Cyrus shouting the title and variations {{of it in a}} repetitive manner, against the beat of the song. Monica Herrera of Billboard interpreted the lyrics [...] "If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya / I'm <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> sell ya" [...] to be an official declaration of rebellion in order to dispose herself of tween role-model responsibilities. Likewise, various other critics believed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] spoke of her completely drawing away from the image she had developed through Hannah Montana, which first aired in March 2006.|$|E

500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what the}} song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 August 2017, Abbasi {{was elected}} Prime Minister of Pakistan by the National Assembly, {{defeating}} his rival Naveed Qamar of the PPP by 221 votes to 47. Jamiat Ulema-e Islam (F) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement also supported his election. Addressing the National Assembly after his election, he said [...] "I may {{be here for}} 45 days or 45 hours, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> keep the seat warm. I intend to work and get some important things done." [...] On that same day, he {{was sworn in as}} the Prime Minister in an oath-taking ceremony at Presidency Palace. After he took charge, Nawaz Sharif decided that Shehbaz Sharif would remain in Punjab and Abbasi would continue as Prime Minister until the 2018 general election to be held in June. According to Rana Sanaullah Khan, PML (N) senior leadership feared that abandonment of the post of Chief Ministership of Punjab by Shahbaz Sharif would weaken the party's hold in the country's most populous province, which has 183 out of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and plays a crucial role in determining the future government in Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{typically}} reviewed [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] favorably. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly {{felt the}} song was [...] "not bad business for stationary cardio, but not the stuff year-end top tens are made of, either." [...] She said it didn't offer [...] "major sensations" [...] and found it similar to Christina Aguilera’s [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] (2010). Greenblatt was also disappointed with the song's rhyming in the lines, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> sell ya' / Or tell {{you to go to}} hell". Sonya Sorich of Ledger-Enquirer said that while she anticipated some negative reception, [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] was also a prime candidate for a guilty pleasure dance track." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic referred to [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] as [...] "stomping" [...] and selected it as one of the album's best. Fraser McAlpine of BBC said that though the song has strong sexual undercurrents, Cyrus maintained classy throughout the track [...] [...] "If Miley's gonna weather the Ensexification Moment it'll be because she's doing it during a period of extrema GaGa, when videos are less about acreage of flesh and more about feathers and Victorian scientists. Oh, and because she's got the songs and the voice, that always helps", McAlpine concluded.|$|E

500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating, saying, [...] "We're <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> talk about music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E
500|$|Resident Evil 5s 2007 E3 trailer {{was criticized}} for {{depicting}} a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village. According to Newsweek editor N'Gai Croal, [...] "There {{was a lot of}} imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery", although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released. Takeuchi said the game's producers were completely surprised by the complaints. The second trailer for the game, released on May 31, 2008, revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the African BSAA agent Alomar, who assists the protagonist. Critics felt that Alomar's character was added {{to address the issue of}} racism, though Karen Dyer said the character had been in development before the first trailer was released. Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5. He acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer, though said he did not expect there to be further complaints once the game was released and people were [...] "able to play the game and see what it is for themselves". In a Computer and Video Games interview, producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue: [...] "We can't please everyone. We're in the entertainment business – we're <b>not</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> state our political opinion or anything like that. It's unfortunate that some people felt that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, {{after the}} release of Juiced, Mark McGwire was among 11 Major League Baseball players that were {{publicly}} addressed concerning their use of steroids.
