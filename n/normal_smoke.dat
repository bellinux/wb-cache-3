40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} concentrations, soot concentrations, and mixture fractions {{were measured}} in the fuel-lean (overfire) region of liquid-fueled buoyant turbulent diffusion flames burning in still air. Pool-fire configurations were studied with the liquids burning from horizontal round wicks, considering both sooting (toluene, benzene, n-heptane, and isopropanol) and nonsooting (methanol and ethanol) fuels. Flame heights and characteristic residence times also were measured, both for the turbulent flames and at the <b>normal</b> <b>smoke</b> point (for the sooting fuels). Carbon monoxide and soot generation factors (mass of CO or soot emitted per unit mass of fuel carbon burned) were uniform throughout the overfire region and were relatively independent of flame residence times (which were generally {{an order of magnitude}} longer than the <b>normal</b> <b>smoke</b> point residence times of the sooting fuels). Processes of carbon monoxide and soot emission for the nonalcohols are closely related, based on the good correlation between their emission factors: 0. 37 kg CO/per kg soot {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 09. However, nonsooting methanol and ethanol/air flames still emitted low levels of CO so that there is a component of CO emissions that is not associated with soot...|$|E
40|$|Overfire soot volume {{fractions}} and mixture fractions, flame heights, and characteristic flame residence times, {{were measured}} for turbulent acetylene, propylene, ethylene and propane diffusion flames burning in still air. Test conditions ranged from highly buoyant pool-like flames to buoyant jet flames, using three burners (with exit diameters of 5, 50, and 234 mm) {{and a wide}} range of fuel flow rates. Soot generation efficiencies (the percentage of fuel carbon converted to soot and emitted from the flame) were uniform throughout the overfire region for a given flame condition. Soot generation efficiencies increased with increasing flame residence times but tended to approach asymptotic values for residence times roughly ten times longer than residence times at the <b>normal</b> <b>smoke</b> point. Within the asymptotic region, soot volume fractions are directly related to mixing levels, analogous to the laminar flamelet concept for nonpremixed flames, which offers substantial simplifications for analysis of the continuum radiation properties of the overfire region...|$|E
50|$|Katsuobushi is the Japanese {{name for}} a {{specific}} type of smoked dried tuna. Although Katsuobushi is a form of dried skipjack, the product may be said to be similar to the traditional Maldive Fish. However, the process of smoke drying which lasts for 21 days at a minimum as opposed to less than a week’s drying for <b>normal</b> <b>smoked</b> skipjack means that Katsuobushi is much drier, therefore a better preserved product. Quality of the product is maintained by using specially imported wood from Japan at specific stages of smoking and by using Refrigerated Containers for shipping the finished product.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{non-standard}} aviation fuels {{on a typical}} small gas turbine combustor were studied {{and the effectiveness of}} design changes intended to counter the effects of these fuels was evaluated. The T 700 /CT 7 turboprop engine family was chosen as being representative of the class of aircraft power plants desired for this study. Fuel properties, as specified by NASA, are characterized by low hydrogen content and high aromatics levels. No. 2 diesel fuel was also evaluated in this program. Results demonstrated the anticipated higher than <b>normal</b> <b>smoke</b> output and flame radiation intensity with resulting increased metal temperatures on the baseline T 700 combustor. Three new designs were evaluated using the non standard fuels. The three designs incorporated enhanced cooling features and smoke reduction features.

40|$|Smoke Detectors/Alarms {{save the}} lives of over sixty percent of people each year in the United States. Most of the {{existing}} homes are still fitted with the <b>normal</b> <b>smoke</b> detectors either running out of the 120 V ac wiring or out of a 9 V dc battery. These alarms are perfectly fine to alert residents if there is a fire while they are home. But for people who are away from home when a fire occurs, {{it would be nice if}} they could be alerted automatically of such an occurrence and therefore be able to act upon the event by either calling the fire department, police or a neighbor to check on their house. With this in mind, the idea to build a smoke detector/alarm system that could alert a homeowner while he is away from home came about. This system is a wireless smoke detector/alarm system that will make an automatic phone call via POTS if an alarm is triggered by smoke from a fire. Upon smoke detection, the alarm will communicate the event to an Access Point wirelessly which in turn will trigger an auto dialer with preprogrammed phone numbers and a message to automatically call each of the numbers and relay the preprogrammed phone message...|$|E

40|$|Cigarettes contain {{thousands}} of poisonous substances. Therefore, {{it is imperative}} that attempts be made to end unnecessary exposures to cigarette smoke, and prevent unnecessary exposure to cigarette smoke to prevent suffering. The situation is even more dangerous in the case of Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) which contributes significantly to 'passive smoking. (see, Megazine, April 13, 1995). This is because the amount of chemicals/poisons found in ETS can range from twice to 50 times as much, compared with <b>normal</b> (mainstream) cigarette <b>smoke.</b> Some of these are as follows: Nicotine:It has twice the amount of ETS relative to "mainstream" smoke. 2 times Tar:It has two to five times the amount of ETS relaive to "mainstream" smoke.

40|$|Erectile dysfunction; prostatic cancer; renal cancer; smoking; sperm {{motility}} and urinary bladder cancer It {{is important to}} realise that virtually {{every part of the}} body, including the urological sys-tem, is adversely affected by smoking. Smoking is the most important known preventable cause of urinary bladder cancer and is also associated with a risk of prostatic and renal can-cer. The exact mechanism by which smoking increases the incidence of urological malig-nancy is not known. One possibility is that chemicals in cigarette smoke inhibit the syn-thesis of cytoprotective eicosanoids. Deficient local protection, against the hostile environ-ment caused by the presence of urine, could then encourage the process of carcinogenesis. Smoking is a powerful predictor of erectile dysfunction; cessation may restore <b>normal</b> func-tion. Cigarette <b>smoke</b> also exerts adverse effects on {{sperm motility}} and count.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{experienced}} smoker maintains adequate nicotine {{levels by}} 'puff-by-puff self-control' which also avoids symptomatic nauseating effects of nicotine overdose. It is postulated {{that there is}} a varying 'dynamic threshold for nausea' into which motion sickness susceptibility provides an objective toxin-free probe. Hypotheses were that: (i) nicotine promotes motion sickness whereas deprivation protects; and (ii) pleasurable effects of nicotine protect against motion sickness whereas adverse effects of withdrawal have the opposite effect. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy habitual cigarette smokers (mean±SD) 15. 3 ± 7. 6 cigs/day, were exposed to a provocative cross-coupled (coriolis) motion on a turntable, with sequences of 8 head movements every 30 s. This continued to the point of moderate nausea. Subjects were tested after either ad-lib <b>normal</b> smoking (<b>SMOKE)</b> or after overnight deprivation (DEPRIV), according to a repeated measures design counter-balanced for order with 1 -week interval between tests. RESULTS: Deprivation from recent smoking was confirmed by objective measures: exhaled carbon monoxide CO was lower (P< 0. 001) for DEPRIV (8. 5 ± 5. 6 ppm) versus SMOKE (16. 0 ± 6. 3 ppm); resting heart rate was lower (P< 0. 001) for DEPRIV (67. 9 ± 8. 4 bpm) versus SMOKE (74. 3 ± 9. 5 bpm). Mean±SD sequences of head movements tolerated to achieve moderate nausea were more (P= 0. 014) for DEPRIV (21. 3 ± 9. 9) versus SMOKE (18. 3 ± 8. 5). DISCUSSION: Tolerance to motion sickness was aided by short-term smoking deprivation, supporting Hypothesis (i) but not Hypothesis (ii). The effect was was approximately equivalent to half of the effect of an anti-motion sickness drug. Temporary nicotine withdrawal peri-operatively may explain why smokers have reduced risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{determine}} if nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation {{may be a}} key factor in lung inflammation and respiratory dysfunction, we investigated whether NF-κB can be blocked by intratracheal administration of NF-κB decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), and whether decoy ODN-mediated NF-κB inhibition can prevent smoke-induced lung inflammation, respiratory dysfunction, and improve pathological alteration in the small airways and lung parenchyma in the long-term smoke-induced mouse model system. We also detected changes in transcriptional factors. In vivo, the transfection efficiency of NF-κB decoy ODNs to alveolar macrophages in BALF was measured by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labeled NF-κB decoy ODNs and flow cytometry post intratracheal ODN administration. Pulmonary function was measured by pressure sensors, and pathological changes were assessed using histology and the pathological Mias software. NF-κB and activator protein 1 (AP- 1) activity was detected by the electrophoretic motility shift assay (EMSA). Mouse cytokine and chemokine pulmonary expression profiles were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue homogenates, respectively, after repeated exposure to cigarette smoke. After 24 h, the percentage of transfected alveolar macrophages was 30. 00 ± 3. 30 %. Analysis of respiratory function indicated that transfection of NF-κB decoy ODNs significantly impacted peak expiratory flow (PEF), and bronchoalveolar lavage cytology displayed evidence of decreased macrophage infiltration in airways compared to normal saline-treated or scramble NF-κB decoy ODNs smoke exposed mice. NF-κB decoy ODNs inhibited significantly level of macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1 α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) in lung homogenates compared to <b>normal</b> saline-treated <b>smoke</b> exposed mice. In contrast, these NF-κB decoy ODNs-treated mice showed significant increase in the level of tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and pro-MMP- 9 (pro-matrix metalloproteinase- 9) in mice BALF. Further measurement revealed administration of NF-κB decoy ODNs did not prevent pathological changes. These findings indicate that NF-κB activation play an important role on the recruitment of macrophages and pulmonary dysfunction in smoke-induced chronic lung inflammation, and with the exception of NF-κB pathway, there might be complex mechanism governing molecular dynamics of pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and structural changes in small airways and pulmonary parenchyma in vivo. </p...|$|R
40|$|I am glad {{to report}} {{that there have been}} at least three {{promising}} developments in the quest for a safer cigarette. As I pointed out in my recent editorial on the topic, 1 “at least one company, Vector To-bacco Inc. is trying to capture the market consisting of smokers who cannot, or will not, give up their habit, but are afraid of its health consequences. As a result, Omni cigarettes 2 are now being promoted as “the first premium cigarette created to signifi-cantly reduce carcinogenic PAHs, nitro-samins, catechols, and organics, which are the major causes of lung cancer in smok-ers. 3 Whether or not such cigarettes will reduce lung cancer incidence is unclear, since as the accompanying Surgeon Gen-eral’s warning points out, “Reductions in carcinogens (PAHs, nitrosamins, catechols and organics) have NOT been proven to result in a safer cigarette. ” This closing statement appears to be no longer true. On June 27, 2002, the Vector Group issued a press release describing how an independ-ent research laboratory had treated the skins of 40 mice with smoke condensate of Omni cigarettes and those of a further 40 with the condensate of the leading US na-tional brand. 4 In these tests, 68 % of the mice treated with <b>normal</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> condensate developed skin tumours, com-pared to only 20 % of the group exposed to the Omni condensate. These test results certainly suggest that Omni cigarettes maybe less carcinogenic that at least one major competitor’s brand. I have brought the value of selenium supplementation to Vector Tobacco Inc. ’s attention and the company appears to be giving the trace element serious consideration. 5 Beyond this, Thione International Inc. has developed an antioxidant complex, (a major component of which is glutathione) which is designed to reduce free radical damage. The company is currently work-ing with four tobacco manufacturers to test cigarettes with filters containing this anti-oxidant complex. 6 In addition, Thione In-ternational Inc. is planning to market loz-enge and spray forms of its antioxidant complex as “tobacco remediation ” tools.
