40|$|The BAT {{reference}} document entitled â€˜Production of Pulp, Paper and Board' forms {{part of a}} series presenting the results of an exchange of information between EU Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection, and the Commission, to draw up, review and, where necessary, update BAT {{reference document}}s as required by Article 13 (1) of the Directive 2010 / 75 /EU on industrial emissions. This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the production of pulp, paper and board covers the activities specified in Sections 6. 1 (a) and 6. 1 (b) of Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, i. e. the integrated and <b>non-integrated</b> <b>production</b> in industrial installations of: (a) pulp from timber or other fibrous materials; (b) paper or cardboard with a production capacity exceeding 20 tonnes per day. In particular, this document covers the following processes and activities: -	chemical pulping: (a) kraft (sulphate) pulping process (b) sulphite pulping process -	mechanical and chemimechanical pulping -	processing paper for recycling with and without deinking -	papermaking and related processes -	all recovery boilers and lime kilns operated in pulp and paper mills. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the pulp, paper and board industry are the emissions to air of nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, dust, total reduced sulphur and ammonia; emissions to water of organic carbon, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and adsorbable organically bound halogens. The BREF contains nine chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the pulp, paper and board industry and on the common industrial processes and techniques used within the whole sector. Chapters 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 correspond to the following specific sectors: kraft (sulphate) pulping process, sulphite pulping process, mechanical and chemimechanical pulping, processing of paper for recycling with and without deinking, and papermaking and related processes. For each sector, these five chapters provide information and data concerning the applied processes and techniques; the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumption of raw materials, water and energy, and generation of waste; the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations; and the emerging techniques. In Chapter 8 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the pulp, paper and board industry. Chapter 9 is dedicated to concluding remarks and recommendations for future work regarding the sector. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|E
50|$|Like other animals, {{livestock}} {{also require}} appropriate proportions of fine and coarse particles in their feed. Theoretically, finer particle {{will be easier}} to digest in the rumen, however the presence of coarse particle might increase the amount of starch into small intestine thus increasing energetic efficiency. Livestock could be fed by grazing on grasslands, integrated or <b>non-integrated</b> with crops <b>production.</b> Livestock that are grown in stalls or feedlots are landless and typically fed by processed feed containing veterinary drugs, growth hormones, feed additives, or nutraceuticals to improve production effectiveness. Similarly, livestock are consuming grains as the main feed or as additional nutrient to the forage based feed. Processing grains for feed is aimed to get the easiest digestible grains to maximize starch availability, thus increasing the energy supply.|$|R
40|$|Soybean {{biodiesel}} (B 100) {{has been}} playing {{an important role in}} Brazilian energy matrix towards the national bio-based economy. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the most widely used indicator for assessing the environmental sustainability of biodiesels and received particular attention among decision makers in business and politics, as well as consumers. Former studies have been mainly focused on the GHG emissions from the soybean cultivation, excluding other stages of the biodiesel production. Here, we present a holistic view of the total GHG emissions in four life cycle stages for soybean biodiesel. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the GHG emissions of Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system with an integrated life cycle approach of four stages: agriculture, extraction, production and distribution. Allocation of mass and energy was applied and special attention was paid to the integrated and <b>non-integrated</b> industrial <b>production</b> chain. The results indicated that the largest source of GHG emissions, among four life cycle stages, is the agricultural stage (42 - 51 %) for B 100 produced in integrated systems and the production stage (46 - 52 %) for B 100 produced in non-integrated systems. Integration of industrial units resulted in significant reduction in life cycle GHG emissions. Without the consideration of LUC and assuming biogenic CO 2 emissions is carbon neutral in our study, the calculated life cycle GHG emissions for domestic soybean biodiesel varied from 23. 1 to 25. 8 gCO 2 eq. MJ- 1 B 100 and those for soybean biodiesel exported to EU ranged from 26. 5 to 29. 2 gCO 2 eq. MJ- 1 B 100, which represent reductions by 65 % up to 72 % (depending on the delivery route) of GHG emissions compared with the EU benchmark for diesel fuel. Our findings from a life cycle perspective contributed to identify the major GHG sources in Brazilian soybean biodiesel production system and they can be used to guide mitigation priority for policy and decision-making. Projected scenarios in this study would be taken as references for accounting the environmental sustainability of soybean biodiesel within a domestic and global level...|$|R
