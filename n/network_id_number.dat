40|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems in distributed systems is Leader Failure. Distributed network becomes unstable without leadership. To solve this problem Leader Election algorithm is executed to give the leadership to other processor. The election process starts when one or more processor discovers that leader has failed, and it terminates when the remaining processors know who the new leader is. Election process use ID number to choose the new leader. In this study we propose distributed leader election algorithm to solve leader failure in hypercube network when ID number is not distinguished. Performance is evaluated and analyzed. In a network of N nodes connected by a Hypercube network the proposed algorithm uses O(N) messages to elect a new leader in O(log N) time steps.

40|$|Abstract—This paper aims to {{recognize}} <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> from {{three types of}} valid identification documents in China: the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driver license of motor vehicle. We have proposed an approach using local similarity voting to automatically recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers.</b> Firstly, we extract the candidate region which contains <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and then locate the numbers and characters. Secondly, we recognize the numbers by an improved template matching method based on the local similarity voting. Finally, we verify the <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and characters. We have applied the proposed approach {{to a set of}} about 100 images which are shot by conventional digital cameras. The experimental results have demonstrated that this approach is efficient and is robust to the change of illumination and rotation. The recognition accuracy is up to 98 %.

50|$|This concept can be {{illustrated}} with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> to their employees. X {{should not have}} two employees with the same <b>ID</b> <b>number,</b> and likewise for Y; {{but it is not}} a problem for the same <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.|$|R

50|$|Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>IDs</b> are {{user account}} {{systems for the}} Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, which allows players to access certain online {{features}} such as the Nintendo eShop and Miiverse. As of December 9, 2013, Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>IDs</b> were implemented onto the Nintendo 3DS, becoming required for downloading free demos from the eShop, replacing the previous system in which eShop purchases were tied to a single system. Players who own both a Wii U and a Nintendo 3DS are able to link a single Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> to both systems, allowing funds added from credit cards or pre-paid cards to be shared across both systems' eShops. However, a Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> can only be used on one 3DS system at a time, requiring players to perform a system transfer to move account details from one 3DS system to another (IDs are currently tied to a single Wii U system, though a future update to resolve this has been promised, which is also essential for the company's long-term plans). Players may also sign into Nintendo Network on other platforms, such as the web-based Miiverse portal for computers, with functionality for tablets and smartphones also planned.|$|R
