25|$|<b>Nonconducting</b> {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E

40|$|The {{patient was}} {{admitted}} to the hospital for intravenous diuretics, supplemental oxygen, and telemetry monitoring. Despite improved hypoxia, her weakness and lightheadedness continued. The ECG demonstrated seconddegree atrioventricular (AV) block (AVB) with 2 : 1 conduction, a normal P-R interval, and widened QRS complex suggestive of an infranodal block. Owing to the patient’s symptoms and suspected block location, ambulation to evaluate the response to an increased sinus rate and enhanced AV nodal conduction was considered to be not clinically advisable. The patient was asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver to further support the diagnosis (Figure 2). A reversible cause of AVB was not identified on detailed medical history and laboratory evaluation. Because of persistent symptoms, an electrophysiologic study to definitively localize the block was not indicated, and she underwent implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker with symptom resolution shortly thereafter. COMMENT Careful ECG analysis reveals 2 : 1 conduction of P waves, best appreciated in the rhythm strip of lead V 1. Before and after <b>nonconducted</b> P waves, the P-R intervals are constant and of normal duration, 172 milliseconds (ms). The ventricular rate of 44 bpm is stable, the P-P interval is fixed, and the QRS complexes are widened (128 ms) with an intraventricular conduction delay pattern. Second-degree AVB with 2 : 1 AV conduction does not represent Mobitz type I or type II AVB. In his 1924 article, Mobitz 1 based his classification on whether the AV node exhibits “decremental conduction, ” characterized by progressive lengthening of the P-R interval prior to a <b>nonconducted</b> P wave (type I) or an unchanged P-R interval before and after the <b>nonconducted</b> P wave(s) (type II). Contemporary definitions require at least 2 consecutively conducted P waves to adequately evaluate the P-R interval before establishing the type of Mobitz block, rendering 2 : 1 (and more advanced second-degree AVB) unclassifiable by definition. The Mobitz type of seconddegree AVB describes an ECG pattern, not block location; however, some generalizations can be made. The site of type I block is usually in the AV node (nodal), unless the QRS complex is widened (� 120 ms), in which case the block is located in the His-Purkinje system (infranodal) 60 % to 70 % of the time. 2 Type II AVB is always infranodal...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between disabling conditions and registration for {{child abuse and neglect}} in a 19 - year whole- population birth cohort Setting. West Sussex area of the United Kingdom. Study Design. Retrospective whole- population cohort. Main Outcomes. Child- protection registration, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. Population and Participants. Infants born in West Sussex (119 729) between January 1983 and December 2001 with complete data including birth weight, gestational age, maternal age, and postal code. Results. Cerebral palsy, speech and language disorder, learning difficulties, conduct disorders, and <b>nonconduct</b> psychological disorders were all significantly associated with child- protection registration before adjustment, and all but cerebral palsy retained significance after adjustment for birth weight, gestational age, and socioeconomic status. Autism and sensory disabilities (vision and hearing) were not associated with an increased risk of child- protection registration. Conduct disorders and moderate/ severe learning difficulty were associated with registration in each of the 4 categories after adjustment for socioeconomic status, birth weight, and gestational age. Children with speech and language disorders and mild learning difficulties were at increased risk of physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. <b>Nonconduct</b> psychological disorders were associated with all categories except neglect, and cerebral palsy was associated with all categories except physical abuse and neglect. Conclusions. Children with disabling conditions seem to be at increased risk of registration for child abuse and neglect, although the pattern of registration varies with the specific disabling condition. The strong association with registration noted for conditions such as conduct disorder and learning difficulties is likely to arise, in part, because these conditions share a common etiologic pathway with child abuse and neglect...|$|R

40|$|Background: Exposure to combustion-derived fine {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{is associated with}} increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality especially in individuals with cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. PM inhalation causes several adverse changes in cardiac function that {{are reflected in the}} electrocardiogram (ECG), including altered cardiac rhythm, myocardial ischemia, and reduced heart rate variability (HRV). The sensitivity and reliability of ECG-derived parameters as indicators of the cardiovascular toxicity of PM in rats are unclear. Objective: We hypothesized that spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats are more susceptible to the development of PM-induced arrhythmia, altered ECG morphology, and reduced HRV than are Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, a related strain with normal blood pressure. Methods: We exposed rats once by nose-only inhalation for 4 hr to residual oil fly ash (ROFA), an emission source particle rich in transition metals, or to air and then sacrificed them 1 or 48 hr later. Results: ROFA-exposed SH rats developed <b>nonconducted</b> P-wave arrhythmias but no changes in ECG morphology or HRV. We found no ECG effects in ROFA-exposed WKY rats.

However, even marked bradycardia {{can often be}} physiologic, and {{in the presence of}} impaired ventricular function may offer important compensatory hemodynamic effects. Disorders of the sinoatrial node producing bradycardia include failure of impulse formation, sinoatrial conduction block, concealed sinus-perinodal reentry, carotid sinus hypersensitivity and the constellation of brady- and tachyarrhythmias that compose the "sick sinus syndrome. " Bradycardia can also result from intraatrial block, atrioventricular nodal block or infranodal block. In addition, paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias may produce concealment into the atrioventricular junction and simultaneous suppression of sinus node rhythmicity, resulting in long pauses. Pseudobradycardias manifesting as slow peripheral pulse rates can result from frequent, <b>nonconducted</b> early atrial premature beats, from ventricular bigeminy or runs of ventricular extrasystoles or from mechanical alternans. Cardiac pacemakers {{play an important role in}} the management of patients with severe symptoms attributable to bradyarrhythmias. However, excessive use of pacemakers and the inappropriate selection of physiologically unfavorable pacemaker systems should be avoided. Frequently, patients who are only mildly symptomatic with bradycardia should not receive a cardiac pacemaker because the prognosis is favorable.

BACKGROUND: In atrioventricular block, atrial surface ECG is unmasked. The effect of rate alone permits detection {{of the effect of}} other exogenous stimulations such as drugs in the presence of rate alterations. METHODS: High fidelity, high gain ECG leads I, II and III were recorded from 51 patients with heart block. Durations of P and Ta waves and the total PTa interval were measured from <b>nonconducted</b> atrial events. RESULTS: No relationship was found between sinus cycle length and PTa, P or Ta in 31 patients. In 20 patients, progressively decreasing the atrial pacing cycle length from 853 ms to 381 ms resulted in a linear reduction of the PTa interval from 444 to 291 ms (rho = 0. 76, slope = 0. 24). This was largely due to shortening of Ta. A linear rate correction formula was derived: corrected PTa = PTa - 0. 24 (PP - 1000). Atropine (0. 02 mg/kg) shortened the PP interval (p < 0. 001) and the PTa interval (p < 0. 01). Propranolol (0. 1 mg/kg) prolonged the PP interval (p < 0. 001) but did not alter the PTa interval.
