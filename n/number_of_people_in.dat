5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E

Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms.

5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It {{is the second most}} common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E

5|$|The {{message was}} {{repeated}} twice {{on the international}} 600m wavelength. The BdU later changed the order slightly and U-506, U-507 and the Italian submarine Capellini were dispatched. In parallel U-156 was assisting and supplying the survivors in the numerous lifeboats that kept arriving or were picked up. U-506 arrived at 11:32 on 14 September 1942, followed by U-507 in the afternoon of 15 September. Heading to a rendezvous with Vichy French ships under Red Cross banners, the U-boats were attacked by a U.S. Army B-24 Liberator bomber (343d Bomb Squadron; Lieutenant James D. Harden) at 12:32 on 16 September 1942. The attack ordered by Captain Robert C. Richardson III, which killed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the lifeboats and damaged U-156, forced Hartenstein to abandon the rescue operations. A majority of survivors were later rescued by British merchant ships and two Vichy French warships, the cruiser Gloire and the sloop Annamite, out of Dakar, Africa.|$|E

5|$|The {{events in}} the Velepromet camp formed part of three {{different}} ICTY indictments, although none resulted in a conviction. In the trial of Slobodan Milošević, the charges brought against Milošević by the ICTY prosecutors included unlawful confinement, imprisonment, torture and inhumane acts against Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including one hundred detainees held in the Velepromet camp. Milošević died before his trial was completed. Vojislav Šešelj, {{the leader of the}} Serb Radical Party, associated with the White Eagles paramilitaries, was charged with the unlawful confinement and killing of at least six people at the Velepromet camp who were buried in a mass grave near the site of the Ovčara massacre, near the village of Grabovo south of Vukovar, as well as an unspecified <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the brick yard adjacent to the Velepromet camp. He was acquitted of all charges in 2016. Goran Hadžić, a Croatian Serb policial leader in eastern Slavonia, who held the office of President of SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia, was charged with the unlawful confinement and murder of the 17 people in Velepromet who were later buried within the compound. His trial was abandoned in 2014 as a result of Hadžić being diagnosed with terminal cancer.|$|E
5|$|The local Norman {{population}} {{sought refuge}} in the castle {{to escape from the}} French soldiers who ravaged the town. The castle was well supplied for a siege, but the extra mouths to feed rapidly diminished the stores. Between 1,400 and 2,200 non-combatants were allowed inside, increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the castle at least fivefold. In an effort to alleviate the pressure on the castle's supplies, Roger de Lacy, the castellan, evicted 500civilians; this first group was allowed to pass through the French lines unhindered, and a second group of similar size did the same a few days later. Philip was not present, and when he learned of the safe passage of the civilians, he forbade further people being allowed through the siege-lines. The idea was to keep {{as many people as possible}} within Château Gaillard to drain its resources. Roger de Lacy evicted the remaining civilians from the castle, at least 400people, and possibly as many as 1,200. The group was not allowed through, and the French opened fire on the civilians, who turned back to the castle for safety, but found the gates locked. They sought refuge at the base of the castle walls for three months; over the winter, more than half their number died from exposure and starvation. Philip arrived at Château Gaillard in February 1204, and ordered that the survivors should be fed and released. Such treatment of civilians in sieges was not uncommon, and such scenes were repeated much later at the sieges of Calais in 1346 and Rouen in 1418–1419, both in the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
25|$|The {{share of}} the world's {{population}} living in absolute poverty fell from 43% in 1981 to 14% in 2011. The absolute <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> poverty fell from 1.95 billion in 1981 to 1.01 billion in 2011. The economist Max Roser estimates that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> poverty is therefore roughly the same as 200 years ago. This is the case since the world population was just little more than 1 billion in 1820 and the majority (84% to 94%) of the world population was living poverty.|$|E
