40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reviews the}} current state of knowledge of <b>non-living</b> <b>resource</b> potentials within the extended "legal " continental shelf (ELCS). The ELCS lies beyond the 200 nautical mile jurisdiction of nation states' exclusive economic zones, but within the outer limits defined by the criteria established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 76 (1982). The offshore <b>non-living</b> <b>resource</b> potentials are based on a statistical evaluation of known occurrences and reserves, the geologic environments favourable for their formation, models for sediment type and thickness, and basement composition. The result is an assessment of the potential for <b>non-living</b> marine <b>resources</b> to occur. The resources are divided into different types, based on their origin. Each is treated separately with a brief description of modes of formation followed by location, grade and resource estimate. Because placer deposits, comprising heavy minerals, gold and diamonds, are limited to near-shore areas they have negligible resource potential in the ELCS regions. Similarly, because phosphorite occurs mainly in the equatorial oceans between 400 m and 1, 500 m depth, they too have limited resource potential in ELCS areas. Evaporite deposits occur on many continental margins. However, they only occur within ELCS regions off eastern North America and western central Africa, where their resource potential is low. Polymetallic sulphides (PMS) are formed at volcanically active plate boundaries. With the exception of parts of the west Pacific and off the western coast of North America, where volcanically active plate boundaries are close to the continental margin, PMS resources are low in the ELCS regions. The major resource potential within the ELCS regions is held in iron-manganese nodules and crusts, oil, gas and gas hydrates. Four elemental metals are the main components of value in manganese nodules and crusts: manganese, copper, nickel and cobalt. Extrapolating known occurrences world wide, the total amount of these nodules and crusts within the ELCS regions may be as much as thirteen billion tonnes. Conventional oil and gas comprise an estimated 106 b. b. o. e. (billion barrels of oil equivalent) with a similar estimate of 115 b. b. o. e. for gas hydrates. In total, the resource potential (excluding recovery and production costs) contained within the ELCS regions of the world amounts to an estimated US$ 11, 934 trillions (at today's raw commodity prices) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{expanse of}} ocean which makes up all marine areas beyond {{national}} jurisdiction {{has been characterized}} as the last frontier of exploitation on the planet, a figurative final "Wild West". Existing users of areas beyond national jurisdiction, {{with the exception of}} fisheries, currently have a limited footprint there as a consequence, in part, of substantial hurdles in technological development that need to be overcome before many resources can be extracted at a commercially viable scale. However, we argue surprise shifts perpetuated by both established and emerging users could lead to an expansion in actors taking opportunities to chase lucrative resources that they are currently constrained from exploiting. Rapid development could also lead to a "crowded ocean" due to the multiplication of users which could present a problem given the current lack of a unified institutional framework for governance connecting the different user groups. Here, we have collated trends in human use of areas beyond national jurisdiction and offer a framework for, and examples of, unexpected dynamics relevant to living and <b>non-living</b> marine <b>resources.</b> Such an approach is necessary in order to begin to mobilize an adequate governance response to changing conditions and uses of areas beyond national jurisdiction.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{involves an}} analysis {{and discussion of}} the legal regime governing the exploitation of non-living marine resources within national jurisdiction in East Africa. This is {{in light of the}} relatively recent offshore oil and gas discoveries off the coasts of Mozambique and Tanzania which have resulted in offshore exploration activities along the Western Indian Ocean (including the Red Sea) in pursuit of these hydrocarbons. Before delving into legal analysis and discussion, the dissertation departs by providing background on the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) 2 which is the international legal regime governing maritime spaces and the contributions made by, inter alia, East African coastal States to bring it about. From here, the dissertation ventures into an analysis and discussion of the legal zones claimed by East African coastal States within which exploitation activities may occur. This part of the discussion involves, among other things, an in depth analysis of the practices of East African coastal States as far as establishing maritime zones in terms of international law. The dissertation then proceeds to discuss which East African coastal States have delimited their maritime zones where they overlap with neighbouring States with adjacent and/or opposite coasts. The discussion highlights which States, in terms of international law, have clearly defined the ambit of their maritime jurisdiction by establishing a delimitation boundary where claims to maritime zones overlapped. This part of the dissertation also discusses which States have not delimited their overlapping maritime zones and the reasons for the lack of delimitation. Following this, the dissertation moves on to discuss the LOSC provisions applicable to exploiting <b>non-living</b> <b>resources,</b> and analyse whether the laws of East African coastal States that pertain to exploiting these resources adequately give effect to LOSC. Finally, in light of the above analysis and discussions, the dissertation moves on to establish if whether or not the legal infrastructure of East African coastal States is adequate for exploiting <b>non-living</b> <b>resources</b> within their national jurisdiction. Generally, the findings reflect favourably on the legal framework of East African coastal States. However, the pressing issue is the practices of some States in respect of claiming certain maritime zones and where necessary, not delimiting these zones. This results in uncertainty as to the maritime jurisdiction of a coastal State, especially with resources such as oil and gas which may straddle across boundaries. Moreover, it creates conflict and as such, threatens peace and security in the region as well as stunt economic and socio-economic development. As such, this dissertation, on the one hand, reflects the advancement of East African coastal States from contributing towards the adoption and coming into effect of LOSC, as well as giving effect to it domestically as far as exploiting <b>non-living</b> <b>resources</b> within national jurisdiction is concerned. On the other hand, it highlights the work that lays ahead for East African coastal States {{in order for them to}} fully enjoy their right...|$|E

40|$|This thesis adopts an {{interdisciplinary}} approach. It examines {{the development of}} marine and coastal policy in Indonesia and explores how well Indonesia is governing its marine and coastal space and resources and with what effects and consequences. This thesis uses a policy analysis framework, with legislative and institutional activity as the basic unit of analysis. Three factors are identified as having been the major influences {{on the evolution of}} marine and coastal policy in Indonesia. These are international law, marine science and “state of the art” marine and coastal management. The role of these factors in the management of the coastal zone, living and <b>non-living</b> marine <b>resources,</b> marine science and technology, the marine environment and relevant international relations are analysed and discussed in the Indonesian case. This thesis concludes that Indonesia’s major challenges in terms of sustainable marine and coastal development are (a) to establish an appropriate management regime, and (b) to formulate and implement a combination of measures in order to attain the objectives of sustainable development. The basic problem is the fact that currently, Indonesia is not a “marine oriented” nation. Therefore, marine and coastal affairs are not {{at the top of the}} public policy agenda. Principles of international instruments have influenced the establishment of marine and coastal policy and management in Indonesia. However, in the implementation of sound management practices, Indonesia faces many challenges. The distinctive characteristics of Indonesia as an archipelagic nation underpin the basic philosophy of marine and coastal policy and management. With the increasing priority of marine and coastal policy in national development, science and environmental aspects have been able to play a greater role in policy development. ii A number of lessons can be taken from the Australian experience that may have some relevance to how Indonesia meets the challenges of implementing its new marine and coastal policy. For example, Indonesia needs to follow the lead of Australia, establishing national principles, goals and objectives for the sustainable of Indonesia’s marine and coastal resources and the conservation, protection and restoration of the marine and coastal environment. The solution for major marine and coastal management problems between federal and states, such as Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) and Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE), offer an attractive alternative for the implementation of regional autonomy in Indonesia. Also, there is a need for multi-stakeholder involvement throughout the policy development process. In readiness for the 21 st Century, the Guidelines of State Policy (GBHN) 1999 stated a shift of paradigm from ‘terrestrial oriented’ towards ‘marine oriented’ development. Indonesia started to give more priority to marine and coastal development and now faces the challenges posed by the transition from issue analysis and planning to the implementation of policies. One way or the other, it is reasonable to conclude that new forces and new needs are likely to bring change and improvement to marine and coastal governance in Indonesia over the next decade or so. ii...|$|R
