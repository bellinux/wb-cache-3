5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners, {{resulting in a}} large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

40|$|HIV {{prevalence}} {{is increasing}} rapidly among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) in China and potentially associated with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> partners that each man has on average.

5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{focus has}} been paid to the role of mental health among young people with regard to risky sexual {{behavior}} and HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between poor mental health and risky sexual behavior (HIV/AIDS) among a population of university students in Uganda. METHODS: In 2005, 980 Ugandan university students completed a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 80 %) assessing sociodemographic and religious background factors, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual behavior. Mental health was assessed using items from the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist- 25 and the Symptom Checklist- 90. RESULTS: High scores on depression and high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners among both males (odds ratio (OR) 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 - 3. 3) and females (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 8. 6) were significantly associated. Elevated anxiety scores among men were associated with high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 3) and inconsistent condom use (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 6). Psychoticism was also significantly associated with high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners among men. The associations remained statistically significant after controlling for sociodemographic factors and level of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that previous conclusions on the association between sexual behavior and mental health from high- and middle-income countries also are valid in a low-income setting, such as in Uganda. This knowledge has implications for policy formation and HIV/AIDS preventive strategies. Coordinated youth-friendly mental health and sexual and reproductive health services to meet the needs of young people would be desirable...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners, and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to penile penetration, pleasure can be received from vaginal stimulation {{in a variety}} of ways. It may be by masturbation, fingering, oral sex (cunnilingus), or specific sex positions (such as the missionary position or the spoons sex position). Heterosexual couples may engage in cunnilingus or fingering as forms of foreplay to incite sexual arousal, with penile-vaginal penetration as the primary sexual activity, or they may engage in them in {{addition to}} penile-vaginal penetration; in other cases, heterosexual couples use the latter acts as a way to preserve virginity or as a type of birth control. By contrast, lesbians and other women who have sex with women commonly engage in cunnilingus or fingering as main forms of sexual activity. Some women and couples use sex toys, such as a vibrator or dildo, for vaginal pleasure. Other women may adopt Kegel exercises, with the aim of tightening the vagina to increase sexual pleasure. The Kama Sutra, an ancient Hindu text written by Vātsyāyana, which includes a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> positions, may also be used to increase sexual pleasure, with special emphasis on female sexual satisfaction.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{reliable}} and perplexing findings from surveys <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior is that men report substantially more sexual partners than women do. We use data from national sex surveys and studies of prostitutes and their clients in the United States to examine sampling bias as an explanation for this disparity. We find that prostitute women are underrepresented in the national surveys. Once their undersampling and very high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> partners are factored in, the discrepancy disappears. Prostitution's role in the discrepancy is not readily apparent because men are reluctant to acknowledge that their reported partners include prostitutes...|$|R
50|$|Further {{evidence}} for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long‐term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a mixed sexual and asexual population of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexuals,</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful {{at the beginning of}} the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once-plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that {{the closeness of the}} relationship between the perpetrator <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse and the victim will determine the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instances <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, the duration of the sexually abusive relationship, the level of coercion necessary to gain compliance, and how long it takes the victim to tell. Differences for cases where the perpetrator is the victim's father and married to the victim's mother, the victim's stepfather or victim's mother's live-in boyfriend, and the victim's noncustodial father are explored. It is argued that in the first case type, the relationship is the closest, the second case type falls in the middle, and in the third, the relationship is the most distant. Hypotheses regarding <b>number</b> <b>of</b> instances <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> abuse, its duration, and the delay in telling are supported by the data...|$|R
