40|$|The {{current state}} of {{publicly}} funded family planning (FP) in New York State has been shaped by a history of diverse women's needs, the efforts of charismatic individuals and successful social movements, the development of agencies, and most recently, <b>negotiated</b> <b>legislation,</b> funding and policy changes on federal and state levels. In this study, FP advocates and providers are interviewed about their work in order to discern their meaning frames. Goffman's frame analysis is referred to, {{as it has been}} elaborated by Benford, Snow and others in social movement scholarship. This research introduces an analytical device called a social lineage. The Margaret Sanger lineage triangulates with interview narratives involving inclusion of diverse women in FP access and decision making and the recognition of reproductive and sexual health as human rights. Interview questions focused on the changes and subsequent impacts in the last 10 - 15 years of FP related policy. Two dominant themes in the interviewees' answers are identified: a commitment to provide services to diverse and marginalized groups of women and families, and concern over ideological barriers to service and information provision...|$|E
40|$|A common {{assumption}} is that the largest EU countries get their way most often in negotiations within the EU’s institutions. Contrary to this perspective, Jonathan Golub finds that smaller states like Finland tend {{to be far more}} successful at <b>negotiating</b> EU <b>legislation</b> than countries like France and Germany. He also finds little evidence for the idea that Member States might ‘buy influence’ by trading legislative outcomes for contributions to the EU budget.

40|$|Summary: The {{principle}} of subsidiarity is meant to demarcate the exercise of competences between the EU and its Member States and to balance the claim for regulatory power which these two legal worlds make. This article takes the view that subsidiarity has not proven so far {{to be a very}} useful touchstone in this regard. Moreover, there are still shortcomings in its envisaged application based on the legal framework provided by the Lisbon Treaty. It is therefore suggested that an approach beyond subsidiarity should be taken in future research in order to shed more light on how powers are balanced in practice in the EU. This approach submits for exploration the following hypothesis: the competences between the EU and its Member States are demarcated in daily practice by negotiating and balancing national discretionary powers, rather than defined through the legal framework and application of subsidiarity. In this view, two paths of research are proposed. The first identifies the Council, more specifically its de facto decision-making body, the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper), as an arena for using Member States’ national discretionary powers in the process of <b>negotiating</b> <b>legislation</b> at the ex ante EU law-making level. The second view suggests an analysis of how the powers are balanced at the ex post law-making level by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) when assessing the {{principle of}} proportionality and thereof the margin of discretion left to the Member States in protecting their national powers and interests. These two specific perspectives are to be placed in the broader perspective of achieving national interests while still contributing to the unity of EU law-making...|$|R

25|$|The premier is {{selected}} by the president {{without the need for}} approval from the legislature, but the legislature can pass laws without regard for the president, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the president and the legislature to <b>negotiate</b> on <b>legislation</b> if they are of opposing parties. After the election of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian as President in 2000, legislation repeatedly stalled because of deadlock with the Legislative Yuan, which was controlled by a pan-Blue majority. Historically, the ROC has been dominated by strongman single party politics. This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated {{in the office of the}} president rather than the premier, even though the constitution does not explicitly state the extent of the president's executive power.|$|R

5000|$|On 16 August, Prime Minister Qarase rebuffed {{an offer}} to <b>negotiate</b> the <b>legislation,</b> {{provided}} that it was withdrawn pending the reaching of a consensus and that it be referred to the Tanaloa talks, a University of Hawaii-mediated forum for government-opposition negotiations that took place during 2004. The Tanaloa talks had been a failure, Qarase said, and it was unacceptable for the opposition to set preconditions for negotiations. [...] "I welcome his willingness to discuss the Reconciliation and Unity Bill with the Government but he has put forward two ... quite impossible pre-conditions. One of those conditions is that the Reconciliation Bill must be referred to the Talanoa Dialogue and secondly we must withdraw the bill even before we discuss it. He wants to start afresh. Now {{this is not a}} trade union. We are running a government, and if he wants to come in engage the Government in discussion on this very important issue, he must come in without any pre-conditions", the Prime Minister declared.|$|R
50|$|The Executive Yuan is in {{the charge}} of the Premier. However, the ROC's {{political}} system does not fit traditional models. The Premier is selected by the President {{without the need for}} approval from the Legislature, but the Legislature can pass laws without regard for the President, as neither he nor the Premier wields veto power. Thus, there is little incentive for the President and the Legislature to <b>negotiate</b> on <b>legislation</b> if they are of opposing parties. During the tenure of the pan-Green's Chen Shui-bian the continued control of the Legislative Yuan by the pan-Blue majority caused legislation to repeatedly stall, as the two sides were deadlocked. There is another curiosity of the ROC system; because the ROC was previously dominated by strongman one-party politics, real power in the system shifted from one position to another, depending on what position was currently occupied by the leader of the state (Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, Chiang Ching-kuo). This legacy has resulted in executive powers currently being concentrated {{in the office of the}} President rather than the Premier.|$|R
50|$|Whelan, at 32, was the {{youngest}} ever elected as Buffalo's Chief Fiscal officer, where he served for an unprecedented four terms; something no one before or since has done. During Whelan's four terms in office as Comptroller, he led the efforts and oversaw their storing of Buffalo's fiscal integrity after inheriting a $35 million deficit that caused the city to lose its credit rating. He restored and improved the city's credit rating, and achieved fourteen consecutive years of city financial results ending in the black. He also introduced innovative financial and data processing mechanisms in the early 1980s. He {{was the first to}} secure <b>negotiated</b> bond <b>legislation</b> from the governor and state legislature; the first in the nation to do so. The Buffalo Water Authority's financing technique was made a reality due to his efforts. During his tenure, he negotiated and sold close to $1 billion in the city of Buffalo's long and short term borrowing. Whelan successfully achieved bond sales for the Buffalo Sewer Authority in excess of $300 million.|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary: As the 2005 - 06 Chair of the Western Governors' Association, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano placed special {{emphasis}} on issues surrounding sustainable development. As part of that initiative, she directed WGA staff to develop a white paper {{on the use of}} <b>negotiated</b> compromise federal <b>legislation</b> as a tool both to protect unique and sensitive lands in the West and to address growth and economic development issues faced by local communities. Western states contain the vast majority of publicly owned lands. Management of these lands impact the social and economic fabric of adjacent rural Western communities. As much of the West continues experiencing unprecedented population growth, the traditional tension between growth and preservation has escalated for these lands and the communities. This white paper traces the history of land conservation in the West and the seeds of collaborative approaches reaching back to federal statutes enacted in the 1960 s. The case studies show how traditional adversaries in three Western communities were able to avoid impasse and come together to hammer out difficult compromises to accommodate most interests. Success has not been fully realized in all cases, but the difficult work continues. There are those on both sides who believe compromising with “the enemy” on conservation and development is tantamount to surrender. However, as the West keeps growing, the pressure will mount to negotiate solutions on the conservation and development of land and water supplies for traditional and new uses. <b>Negotiated,</b> omnibus <b>legislation</b> for public lands is one of the new tools that can help. This approach requires undaunted leadership, (a strong motivating factor to get parties to the table), a level playing field during the collaborative process, and an outcome that has enough support to weather the federal legislative process. Western Governors are uniquely poised to identify opportunities in their respective states, help initiate a truly collaborative process, and stand with their Congressional counterparts if a bill moves through Congress. It is a leadership role that they have played in other arenas and would likely be welcomed by communities and advocates alike...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the two tracks {{used by the}} United States to negotiate and approve international treaties - (1) the traditional treaty process requiring Senate consent by a two-thirds vote and (2) the newer fast track process used for trade agreements, requiring Congressional passage of a law to approve and implement the agreement. Several historical and current examples are used such as the Treaty of Versailles and the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. The paper explains why the latter process is superior in many ways, and asks {{whether it should be}} applied more broadly beyond the topic of trade. Three challenges to doing so are discussed. First, the paper considers whether the Congressional-Executive Agreement format used for trade agreements is constitutional. Second, the paper considers the democratic acceptability of approving treaties by law rather than by a supermajority in the Senate. Third, the paper points to the key ingredient for the trade approach which is a framework statute that sets an agenda for the trade negotiations in advance and sets the terms for implementation. The paper recommends the adoption of similar international <b>negotiating</b> framework <b>legislation</b> in other areas of international law such as environment, labor, intellectual property, and possibly human rights...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{importance}} of {{marriage as a}} migration strategy {{has been accompanied by}} the increased problematisation and regulation of marriages between binational couples. In this article we propose an analytical framework for the study of marriage migration that permits to transcend three tendencies and related limitations of the existing literature. While offering rich insights into marriage migration and its government, the existing body of literature as a whole is, nevertheless, characterised by an implementation gap bias, a control bias and a destination country bias. To counter these tendencies and related analytical limitations we propose a framework that ethnographically studies binational couples’ embodied encounters with state authorities in countries of destination and citizenship with a particular focus on binational couples’ struggles for visas, resident permits and a right to family life. This approach highlights how the regulation of marriage migration is constitutive of differentiations and discriminations along intersecting lines of class, race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation and so forth. In brief, it allows to show how ‘doing border’ is intertwined with ‘doing gender’. Illustrated through ethnographic research, we show that this methodology permits to expose three aspects of marriage migration that have not been sufficiently considered so far. These include the securitization of marriage migration ‘from below’ and the establishment of informal hierarchies of desirability through informal practices of government, binational couples’ capacity to <b>negotiate</b> restrictive <b>legislations</b> and bureaucratic hurdles and, finally, the multiple entanglements of binational couples in the border and citizenship regimes of two or more nation-state orders...|$|R
40|$|Effectively {{protecting}} {{intellectual property}} rights (IPR) is linked intricately to human health. Consider the recent epidemic involving the production of heparin, a common pharmaceutical drug used for blood thinning. The heparin which caused allergic reactions in the United States and Germany derived from Chinese manufacturers. The questions that arose regarded placement of blame and how to prevent future occurrences. China has met the criteria for joining the World Trade Organization which means that it met the criteria for {{intellectual property rights}} enforcement. Despite this presumed qualification, the intellectual property enforcement regime in China remains weak. This weakness {{is due to a}} number of factors including bureaucratic structures and poor incentives for implementation. China has national legislation and the complementary bureaus charged with the implementation of IPR, yet the problems of counterfeiting and general intellectual property violations persist. Why has China‘s legislation been poorly reflected in their enforcement regime and what can the global community do to contribute proactively to the improvement of this intellectual property enforcement regime? One answer is to address the enforcement capacity limitations and the incentive structures of IPR implementation rather than <b>negotiate</b> and debate <b>legislation</b> for China which has proved fruitless. The findings of this study offers insight not just for intellectual property enforcement, but to all other realms of international legislative implementation in China. 1...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to define rules for the {{negotiation}} and adoption of laws so that, in each legislative jurisdiction, the laws are adequate to the potentially conflicting fundamental commitments {{of the members of}} the population in that legislative jurisdiction. Law as pluralism denotes <b>legislation</b> <b>negotiated</b> and adopted under conditions of conflicting fundamental commitments. Under the normative conception of pluralism put forward here, prima facie equal validity is accorded to all commitments held by a population, even where such commitments are incompatible with each other. As a corollary, laws should prima facie only bind members of the population whose fundamental commitments do not conflict with those laws. This has consequences for the negotiation and adoption of legislation: while descriptive fundamental commitments held by members of the population may serve as justifications for positions taken during legislative negotiations and hence indirectly as a basis for legislation, prescriptive fundamental commitments held by members of the population directly prejudice the content of legislation and hence should not serve as justifications for positions taken during legislative negotiations to the extent they are controversial. Under this conception, <b>legislation</b> is <b>negotiated</b> at a given level with the goal of achieving at least loose consensus at that level, according to which the laws are adequate to all the various potentially conflicting fundamental commitments held by the population at that level, even if the laws are thereby not yet fully enforceable at that level. <b>Legislation</b> is then <b>negotiated</b> at descending levels until tight consensus is reached at some level, whereupon the laws become fully enforceable...|$|R
40|$|Various {{works have}} been {{published}} in the last years focused on Chinese economic and political geography, as well as on themes connected to Chinese (Asian) business (<b>legislation,</b> <b>negotiating</b> style, etc.) contexts. However the literature lacks contributions that address the managerial aspects involved {{in the development of a}} production and supply base in China and the corresponding supply chain management issue. This development is a complex task in a social, cultural and normative context so distant from our own. A number of obstacles need to be overcome: the language, the cultural and geographic distance, the coordination of an international logistic net, the transfer of technological capabilities and managerial praxes, and the quality monitoring at source. This book summarised the main findings of the EU project "International Sourcing Strategies for China" focused on the above mentioned aspects. This project was coordinated by the authors in collaboration with partners belonging to the "Otto-von-Guericke" University of Magdeburg (Germany), the Beijing National Centre for Science and Technology Evaluation (NCSTE) (the main Chinese ministerial agency specialised in the assessment of scientific and technological programs), and finally INNOVA, a leading Italian company for technological transfer and strategic advising. Aware of the growing importance of the Chinese market, the European Union has activated the program "Asia Information Technologies & Communication", whose aim is to promote the identification of organizational solutions and ICT instruments for the effective management of the supply chains that join Europe and China. A sample of European enterprises was analysed, selected according to two criteria. These enterprises belong to industries where the EU-China interchange is most relevant. In addition, there units are in some way exemplary in their ability to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the international chessboards, where the careful and systematic resort to the sourcing opportunities offered by emerging countries is at times responsible for major buying advantages, extraordinarily fast increase rates, and sometimes even for a radical modification of the business. In greater detail, the structure of the book is the following. Chapter 1 reviews the papers published on international sourcing (IS). Determinants and problems, forms, development paths, and management practices of IS are illustrated following an extensive analysis of the literature. Chapter 2 briefly describes the main events that have characterized the recent history of China. Then it sketches a geo-economic picture of the country. The most important economic indicators are listed, that reveal how this country is assuming a more and more important role inside the international trading community. Chapter 3 points out objectives and methodology of the project "International Sourcing Strategies for China" from which this book draws its origin. After a short account of the samples, motives, advantages and obstacles underlying the choice of China as a sourcing base are described. Chapter 4 shows a taxonomy of the sourcing typologies of the sample. Each typology is described in terms of industry, purchasing code, organisational requirements, key competences, and characteristics of the relationship with the Chinese interlocutors. Chapter 5 indicates some methodologies that could be useful when choosing and planning the establishment of a sourcing channel in the Chinese market. A normative model is proposed that suggests the best suited typology depending on the key context variables (company size and purchasing volumes, complexity of the Chinese industrial context, and the complexity of the purchase code). Then the sequence of steps and activities involved in the development of a sourcing channel and an International Purchasing Office are listed. Chapter 6 details some of the most critical aspects of IS in China: the role of intermediaries, organizational decentralization, Chinese relational logic and negotiation style, the technology and know how transfer. Chapter 7 summarises modalities and legislative constrains that discipline foreign investments in China. Main forms and historical course of foreign investments, fiscal facilities and instruments for the defence of the intellectual property are briefly depicted. Chapter 8 gives a description of transport infrastructures in China. The evolution of the transport systems and the current situation of rail, air, road and naval infrastructures are illustrated...|$|R
