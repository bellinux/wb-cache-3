5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Ross Perot {{specifically}} cited his disinclination to forcing {{an election}} into the House when, in July of 1992, he temporarily suspended his independent candidacy. When he resumed his candidacy in early October 1992, {{the issue of}} that year's election being decided in the House of Representatives <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> significantly {{in the last month}} of the campaign.|$|E

25|$|In late 1971, the North Vietnamese {{took several}} actions which vastly {{improved}} and augmented their tracking capability. The most important was netting of their early warning and surveillance radar and their anti-aircraft artillery radar with SAM missiles. In that netted mode, the Fan Song (radars) which alerted U.S. pilots to the surveillance <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up,</b> as the surveillance {{could all be}} conducted with the other radars. General Lavelle believed that, with those mutually supporting radar systems transmitting tracking data to the firing sites, the SAM missile system was activated at U.S. aircraft at any time they were over North Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|Tom Hanks as Apollo 13 Commander Jim Lovell: Jim Lovell {{stated that}} before his book Lost Moon was even written, the movie rights were being shopped to {{potential}} buyers {{and that his}} first reaction was that Kevin Costner {{would be a good}} choice to play him. However, by the time Howard acquired the director's position, Costner's name <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> in serious discussion, and Hanks had already been interested in doing a film based on Apollo 13. When Hanks' representative informed him that a script was being passed around, he had the script sent to him. John Travolta was initially offered the role of Lovell, but declined.|$|E
500|$|Jack Matlock, US {{ambassador}} to the Soviet Union during its final years, said that the West gave a [...] "clear commitment" [...] not to expand, and declassified documents indicate that Soviet negotiators were given the oral impression by diplomats like Hans-Dietrich Genscher and James Baker that NATO membership was off the table for countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland. In 1996, Gorbachev wrote in his Memoirs, that [...] "during the negotiations on the unification of Germany they gave assurances that NATO would not extend its zone of operation to the east," [...] and repeated this view {{in an interview in}} 2008. However, in 2014, Gorbachev said [...] "The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all , and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either." [...] Eduard Shevardnadze, foreign minister of the Soviet Union between 1985 and 1991, has always maintained that [...] "NATO’s expansion beyond German borders <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for negotiation." [...] According to Robert Zoellick, a State Department official involved in the Two Plus Four negotiating process, no formal commitment regarding enlargement was made.|$|E

25|$|The {{extreme case}} {{is that of a}} double-headed coin that <b>never</b> <b>comes</b> <b>up</b> tails, or a double-tailed coin that never results in a head. Then there is no uncertainty.

6000|$|... --These {{questions}} are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the dean. It is like looking {{down from the}} cliffs of Moher into the depths.

2500|$|Hours {{after the}} battle, Ewell {{proposed}} to President Jefferson Davis {{that in order}} for the Confederacy to win the war, the slaves must be freed and join the ranks of the army; he was also willing to lead the blacks into battle. But Davis considered that [...] "impossible" [...] and that topic <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> between him and Ewell again. Nevertheless, Ewell, like Patrick Cleburne, was one of those few Confederate generals who saw that the Confederacy needed all the manpower it could get, regardless of race.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the murder}} of Dennis Kerr, Krueger was {{transferred}} back to the Oak Ridge division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, where {{he had spent the}} majority of his 34 preceding years in custody. In the years after Kerr's murder, he was the focus of a biography and several documentary films and sometimes tried to explain why he killed, but he <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> with rational reasons. [...] He said in a 1993 interview: [...] "I'm accused of having no morality, which is a fair assessment, because my morality is whatever the system allows." [...] On March 5, 2010, his 71st birthday, Krueger died of natural causes.|$|E

Mac's father arrived in England during the First Gulf War from a place Mac only remembers being called [...] "Otis", so Rob tells Bucky that his family is from Massachusetts, to which Bucky replies, [...] "Blast! I'm a filthy communist!!!". Mac's mother is from Hartlepool. Mac spent {{three and a half}} years at Rob's apartment and has come back and forth since that time.

60|$|When he {{made the}} leap for the {{catamaran}} Walter was not as fortunate as those around him. He entered the water close to the Merrimac, and when the great collier sank, the suction drew him under, and he went so far down that he fancied he would <b>never</b> <b>come</b> <b>up.</b> His breath was gone, a gulp partly filled him with water, and when at last {{the surface of the}} bay was again reached he <b>came</b> <b>up</b> more dead than alive.|$|R

Constans, who was [...] "seen by the captain to jump into the gig,"{1} luckily for us and unluckily for himself did not reach us. He came down out of the tangle of ropes under the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope caught his heel as he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward, and then fell and struck a block or spar {{floating}} in the water.

60|$|As you {{sit back}} half dreaming in the car, you keep {{wondering}} {{why it is}} that you <b>never</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> before in all these years.

50|$|The {{film was}} quite revolutionary with {{its use of}} mystery to the audience; the characters, background, and {{location}} all go unknown throughout the entire film.
