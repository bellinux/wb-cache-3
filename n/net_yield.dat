25|$|Interestingly, a bee {{does not}} {{experience}} diminishing returns because of nectar depletion {{or any other}} characteristic of the flowers themselves. In fact, {{the total amount of}} nectar foraged increases linearly with time spent in a patch. However, the weight of the nectar adds a significant cost to the bee's flight between flowers and its trip back to the hive. Wolf and Schmid-Hempel showed, by experimentally placing varying weights on the backs of bees, that the cost of heavy nectar is so great that it shortens the bees' lifespan. The shorter the lifespan of a worker bee, the less overall time it has to contribute to its colony. Thus, there is a curve of diminishing returns for the <b>net</b> <b>yield</b> of energy that the hive receives as the bee gathers more nectar during one trip.|$|E
2500|$|Oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} in microbial mats {{would also}} have increased the free oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, both directly by emitting oxygen and because the mats emitted molecular hydrogen (H2), some of which would have escaped from the Earth's atmosphere before it could re-combine with free oxygen to form more water. Microbial mats thus {{played a major role}} in the evolution of organisms [...] which could first tolerate free oxygen and then use it as an energy source. Oxygen is toxic to organisms that are not adapted to it, but greatly increases the metabolic efficiency of oxygen-adapted organisms — for example anaerobic fermentation produces a <b>net</b> <b>yield</b> of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate, cells' internal [...] "fuel", per molecule of glucose, while aerobic respiration produces a <b>net</b> <b>yield</b> of 36.

The on-farm trial had two treatments: TR and TG (named {{according to the}} tilapia strains) with three replications. Six rectangular ponds of varying sizes (400 – 880  m 2) were used for this experiment. Hybrid red and GIFT tilapia stains were stocked with prawn at the stocking densities of 1 tilapia fingerlings (either red or GIFT strain) and 3 prawn juveniles m- 2 in both treatments. Bamboo side shoot were posted vertically as periphyton substrate. This resulted in an additional substrate surface area of 1067  m 2 for periphyton development equaling 147 % of the pond surface area. Considering the body weight of freshwater prawn only, feeding rates were 10 % of body weight {{at the beginning of}} the study (up to 30  days), and feeding application was gradually reduced to 3 % in the last month assuming 80 % survival.

40|$|Abstract The {{detection}} {{and recognition of}} generic object categories with invariance to viewpoint, illumination, and clutter requires {{the combination of a}} feature extractor and a classifier. We show that architectures such as convolutional networks are good at learning invariant features, but not always optimal for classification, while Support Vector Machines are good at producing decision surfaces from wellbehaved feature vectors, but cannot learn complicated invariances. We present a hybrid system where a convolutional network is trained to detect and recognize generic objects, and a Gaussian-kernel SVM is trained from the features learned by the convolutional network. Results are given on a large generic object recognition task with six categories (human figures, four-legged animals, airplanes, trucks, cars, and &quot;none of the above&quot;), with multiple instances of each object category under various poses, illuminations, and backgrounds. On the test set, which contains different object instances than the training set, an SVM alone yields a 43. 3 % error rate, a convolutional <b>net</b> alone <b>yields</b> 7. 2 % and an SVM on top of features produced by the convolutional <b>net</b> <b>yields</b> 5. 9 %. ...|$|R
