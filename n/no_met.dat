5000|$|<b>No</b> <b>Met</b> pitcher {{had ever}} thrown a no-hitter until June 1, 2012 when Johan Santana no-hit the Cardinals. The franchise's hurlers had gone more than 7,800 games without {{pitching}} one — {{longer than any}} other Major League franchise. On several occasions, potential no-hitters by Met pitchers have been broken up in the late innings. Tom Seaver twice pitched [...] innings without allowing a hit for the Mets — {{in one of those}} games, against Chicago in 1969, Seaver only needed two more outs for a perfect game before Jimmy Qualls singled - while in recent years Tom Glavine, Pedro Martínez, John Maine, Mike Pelfrey, R.A. Dickey, Matt Harvey, Jacob DeGrom, Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard all lost their no-hit bids in the 7th or 8th inning. After the Mets got their first no-hitter, this left the San Diego Padres as the only remaining team in MLB that has never had a pitcher throw such a game.|$|E
5000|$|The 1993 Mets {{entered the}} season after a disappointing 1992 {{campaign}} where their major player acquisitions, designed to help the team return to contending for a division title, largely fizzled out. Their biggest acquisition, outfielder Bobby Bonilla, did not perform up to fans' expectations and was frequently booed by the local fans. Pitcher Bret Saberhagen and second baseman Willie Randolph, two more major pickups in the previous offseason, were injured much {{of the season and}} largely ineffective. One of the few bright spots was Eddie Murray, who led the team with 91 RBI to go along with 16 home runs, but besides he and Bonilla (74 RBI, 19 home runs) <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> reached 50 RBI or 15 home runs. Murray's [...]261 average led the regulars, who all struggled to record hits; shortstop Dick Schofield, for instance, recorded over 400 plate appearances but could not manage to reach 100 hits. Howard Johnson, the 1991 National League home run and RBI champion, also battled injuries and saw his totals fall off significantly. The pitching staff was not much better off, as Dwight Gooden recorded his worst season as a major leaguer and the team left a hole in its rotation by trading away ace David Cone in August; Sid Fernandez's 14 wins led the team.|$|E

50|$|A licence {{will contain}} {{one or more}} ratings. These are sub-qualifications that specify in more detail the exact {{privileges}} that the licence conveys. One type of rating is an Aircraft rating. This specifies the type or types of aircraft which can be flown, and is either a Class rating, when a whole broad class of aircraft can be flown, or a Type rating where the privileges are confined to a single type or group of very closely related types. The very basic aircraft rating usually obtained by PPL(A) holders at their initial skills test is the Single Engine Piston Landplane (SEP-land) Class Rating. This allows flight of single-piston-engined, non-turbocharged, fixed-pitch propeller, fixed tricycle gear, non-pressurised land aeroplanes (with a few exceptions). SEP class rating holders may optionally extend the privileges of this rating to cover complex features by taking formal differences training from a suitably qualified instructor. There are five categories of difference: tailwheel aircraft, retractable undercarriage, variable-pitch propeller, turbocharged engine and cabin pressurisation. There is no formal test for any difference training; the training is signed off as satisfactorily completed in the pilot's logbook by the instructor conducting the training. Other class ratings include Multi Engine Piston (MEP) landplane, Single and Multi engined piston Seaplane, Single Engine Turbine (SET) and Touring Motor Gliders. Note: There is <b>no</b> <b>MET</b> class rating, as multi engine turbine and all jet powered aircraft require a type rating. To add these to their licence a pilot has to undergo a course of training and pass an additional skills test. Differences training is also required for certain complex features within these class ratings. Aircraft ratings are type-specific for multi engine turboprop & all jet aircraft {{and for a few}} other very complex types. To obtain one of these a pilot must undergo specific training and pass a skills test. It is also possible to obtain permission from the CAA to fly an aircraft not covered by any type or class rating.|$|E

The Mets scuffled to start the season, dropping 3 of their first 5 games. After losing the first two in Atlanta to start their second series, the Mets began an 11-game win streak that started on Sunday with Colón picking up his second win. The Mets then returned home, and swept the Philadelphia Phillies, Miami Marlins, and Atlanta Braves. On April 23, 2015 the New York Mets beat the Braves 6-3 to complete a perfect 10 game homestand, tying their start to the 1986 season with a 13-3 record and tying the team record with an 11-game winning streak. During the 8th game of the season, David Wright pulled his hamstring while stealing a base. He left the game and Anthony Recker was brought in to play third base. After a number of weeks, Wright was diagnosed with spinal stenosis, raising questions as to whether the captain could ever return. During the 11 game winning streak, catcher Travis d'Arnaud was hit by a pitch, leading to a wrist injury. Kevin Plawecki was called up to replace d'Arnaud. In the same game, relief pitcher Jerry Blevins was hit by a line drive, breaking his arm. Their winning streak was broken in {{the first game of the}} Subway Series, where Jacob deGrom lost to Michael Pineda. The next day, in the second game of the series, Matt Harvey pitched 8.2 innings, but after giving up back-to-back hits, Harvey was taken out of the game. He would still get the victory. <b>No</b> <b>Met</b> would pitch a complete game until September.

Nutritional management during this physiological state can affect the biological components of immunometabolism. The objectives {{of this study were}} to measure concentrations of biomarkers in plasma, liver tissue, and milk, and also polymorphonuclear leukocyte function to assess the immunometabolic status of cows supplemented with rumen-protected methionine (Met) or choline (CHOL). Forty-eight multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized complete block design with 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of Met (Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA) and CHOL (ReaShure, Balchem Inc., New Hampton, NY) level (with or without). Treatments (12 cows each) were control (CON), <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> or CHOL; CON and Met (SMA); CON and CHOL (REA); and CON and Met and CHOL (MIX). From - 50 to - 21 d before expected calving, all cows received the same diet [1. 40 Mcal of net energy for lactation (NEL) /kg of DM] with <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> or CHOL. From - 21 d to calving, cows received the same close-up diet (1. 52 Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and were assigned randomly to each treatment. From calving to 30 d, cows were on the same postpartal diet (1. 71 Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and continued to receive the same treatments until 30 d. The Met supplementation was adjusted daily at 0. 08 % DM of diet, and CHOL was supplemented at 60 g/cow per day. Liver (- 10, 7, 21, and 30 d) and blood (- 10, 4, 8, 20, and 30 d) samples were harvested for biomarker analyses. Neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis and oxidative burst were assessed at d 1, 4, 14, and 28 d. The Met-supplemented cows tended to have greater plasma paraoxonase. Greater plasma albumin and IL- 6 as well as a tendency for lower haptoglobin were detected in Met- but not CHOL-supplemented cows. Similarly, cows fed Met compared with CHOL had greater concentrations of total and reduced glutathione (a potent intracellular antioxidant) in liver tissue. Upon a pathogen challenge in vitro, blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis capacity and oxidative burst activity were greater in Met-supplemented cows. Overall, liver and blood biomarker analyses revealed favorable changes in liver function, inflammation status, and immune response in Met-supplemented cows...|$|E
40|$|The {{onset of}} {{lactation}} in dairy cows {{is characterized by}} high output of methylated compounds in milk when sources of methyl group are in short supply.

Supplementing rumen-protected Met and CHOL may improve overall performance and health of transition cows. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of supplemental rumen-protected Met and CHOL on performance and health of transition cows. Eighty-one multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized, complete, unbalanced block design with 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of Met (Smartamine M, Adisseo NA, Alpharetta, GA) and CHOL (ReaShure, Balchem Inc., New Hampton, NY) inclusion (with or without). Treatments (20 to 21 cows each) were control (CON), CON+Met (SMA), CON+CHOL (REA), and CON+Met+CHOL (MIX). From - 50 to - 21 d before expected calving, all cows received the same diet (1. 40 Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) with <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> or CHOL. From - 21 d to calving, cows received the same close-up diet (1. 52 Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and were assigned randomly to treatments (CON, SMA, REA, or MIX) supplied as top dresses. From calving to 30 DIM, cows were fed the same postpartal diet (1. 71 Mcal of NEL/kg of DM) and continued to receive the same treatments through 30 DIM. The Met supplementation was adjusted daily at 0. 08 % DM of diet and REA was supplemented at 60 g/d. Incidence of clinical ketosis and retained placenta tended to be lower in Met-supplemented cows. Supplementation of Met (SMA, MIX) led to greater DMI compared with other treatments (CON, REA) in both close-up (14. 3 vs. 13. 2 kg/d, SEM 0. 3) and first 30 d postpartum (19. 2 vs. 17. 2 kg/d, SEM 0. 6). Cows supplemented with Met (SMA, MIX) had greater yields of milk (44. 2 vs. 40. 4 kg/d, SEM 1. 2), ECM (44. 6 vs. 40. 5 kg/d, SEM 1. 0), and FCM (44. 6 vs. 40. 8 kg/d, SEM 1. 0) compared with other (CON, REA) treatments. Milk fat content did not differ in response to Met or CHOL.

40|$|Methanethiol {{has been}} {{strongly}} associated with desirable Cheddar cheese flavor and can be formed from the degradation of methionine (Met) via a number of microbial enzymes. Methionine γ-lyase is thought {{to play a major}} role in the catabolism of Met and generation of methanethiol in several species of bacteria. Other enzymes that have been reported to be capable of producing methanethiol from Met in lactic acid bacteria include cystathionine β-lyase and cystathionine γ-lyase. The objective of this study was to determine the production, stability, and activities of the enzymes involved in methanethiol generation in bacteria associated with cheese making. Lactococci and lactobacilli were observed to contain high levels of enzymes that acted primarily on cystathionine. Enzyme activity was dependent on the concentration of sulfur amino acids in the growth medium. Met aminotransferase activity was detected in all of the lactic acid bacteria tested and α-ketoglutarate was used as the amino group acceptor. In Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris S 2, Met aminotransferase was repressed with increasing concentrations of Met in the growth medium. While <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> aminotransferase activity was detected in Brevibacterium linens BL 2, it possessed high levels of l-methionine γ-lyase that was induced by addition of Met to the growth medium. Met demethiolation activity at pH 5. 2 with 4 % NaCl was not detected in cell extracts but was detected in whole cells. These data suggest that Met degradation in Cheddar cheese will depend on the organism used in production, the amount of enzyme released during aging, and the amount of Met in the matrix...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for purifying papain from extracts of papaya latex. The procedure involves precipitation of the extract of papaya latex with sodium chloride followed by affinity chromatography of the redissolved precipitate. Precipitation of the protein from the latex extract {{is necessary to}} separate the papain from material which interferes with the binding of papain to the affinity column. During affinity chromatography, the affinity column is overloaded to insure absence in the final product of impurities which are capable of binding to the affinity column. The papain prepared by this procedure yielded an amino acid analysis and an N-terminal amino acid analysis expected for a sample of pure papain. <b>No</b> <b>Met</b> was detected on amino acid analysis nor was the presence of N-terminal residues other than He detected. On polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis at pH 4. 3, papain prepared by the method described in this work was indistinguishable from crystalline papain which was prepared by the method of Kimmel and Smith, and further purified by affinity chromatography.

40|$|OBJECT: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{contribution}} of the tracers 11 C-methionine (Met) and 18 F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) -guided stereotactic brain biopsy. METHODS: Forty-five patients underwent combined Met-PET and FDG-PET studies associated with computerized tomography (CT) - or magnetic resonance (MR) -guided stereotactic biopsy. Each patient presented with a lesion that was in proximity to the cortical or subcortical gray matter. The Met-PET and FDG-PET scans were analyzed to determine which tracer offers the best information to guide at least one stereotactic biopsy trajectory. Histologically based diagnoses were rendered in all patients (39 tumors, six nontumorous lesions) and biopsies were performed in all tumors with the aid of PET guidance. When tumor FDG uptake was higher than that in the gray matter (18 tumors), FDG was used for target definition. When FDG uptake was absent or equivalent to that in the gray matter (21 tumors), Met was used for target definition. Parallel review of all histological and imaging data showed that all tumors had an area of abnormal Met uptake and 33 had abnormal FDG uptake. All six nontumorous lesions had <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> uptake and biopsies were performed using CT or MR guidance only. All tumor trajectories had an area of abnormal Met uptake; all nondiagnostic trajectories in tumors had no abnormal Met uptake. CONCLUSIONS: When FDG shows limitations in target selection, Met is a good alternative because of its high specificity in tumors. Moreover, in the context of a single-tracer procedure and regardless of FDG uptake, Met is a better choice for PET guidance in neurosurgical procedures.

ALK+ status is generally thought to be mutually exclusive of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS mutations. However, the mutation status of other genes is not widely known in ALK+ tumors. The aim {{of this study is to}} survey for mutations involving other genes in 25 ALK+ cases confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization. MethodsUsing the DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples, a MassArray-based Lung Cancer Mutations Screening Panel was performed to test for 179 individual mutations in 10 genes, including EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB 2, JAK 2, AKT 1, AKT 2, KIT, MET and PIK 3 CA, which have been implicated in lung carcinogenesis and/or considered as potential therapeutic targets. ResultsFive of 25 ALK+ cases showed additional genetic abnormalities, which were verified by gene sequencing. One patient had EGFR del L 747 -S 752. The remaining four mutations were in the MET gene: MET N 375 S (n = 2) and MET R 988 C (n = 2). <b>No</b> <b>MET</b> amplification was found by fluorescent in situ hybridization in the four cases with MET mutation. No mutations were detected in the other genes tested. ConclusionsIn summary, additional mutations were found in 20 % of ALK+ cases involving two of the 10 genes tested.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{contribution}} of the labelled tracers [C- 11]methionine (Met) and [F- 18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in positron emission tomography (PET) -guided stereotactic biopsy of non resectable brain lesions. Twenty-five patients underwent combined Met-PET-, FDG-PET- and computerized tomography (CT) - or magnetic resonance (MR) -guided stereotactic biopsy according to a previously described technique for stereotactic FDG-PET. Met-PET and FDG-PET images were analyzed to determine which tracer offers the best information to guide at least one stereotactic biopsy trajectory. Histological diagnosis was obtained in all patients (23 tumours and 2 non-tumorous lesions). All tumours had an area of abnormal Met uptake and were biopsied under PET-guidance. FDG uptake in the tumour was higher than in the grey matter and was used for target selection in 12 of 23 tumours. Eleven of them were located in the basal ganglia or the brainstem. Met was used for target selection in 11 of 23 tumours where there was no FDG uptake or where FDG uptake was equivalent to that of the grey matter. Ten of them were located in the cortex. Two nontumoral lesions had <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> uptake and were biopsied under CT- or MR-guidance only. Forty-three out of 53 stereotactic trajectories obtained in these 25 patients were based on PET-defined targets and had an area of abnormal Met uptake. These trajectories always yielded a diagnosis of tumour. Moreover, all tumorous trajectories had an area of abnormal Met uptake. Finally, all non-diagnostic trajectories (n = 4) were CT/MR-defined because there was no area of abnormal Met uptake. These results suggest that patients who can benefit the most from Met-PET guidance could be selected pre-operatively. In conclusion, this work shows that Met is a good alternative to FDG for target selection in PET-guided stereotactic brain biopsy. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

Thirty-seven multiparous Holstein cows were fed the same basal diet from - 50 to - 21 d relative to expected calving [1. 24. Mcal/kg of dry matter (DM); <b>no</b> <b>Met</b> supplementation]. From - 21 d to calving, the cows received diets (1. 54. Mcal/kg of DM) with no added Met (control, CON; n. =. 13), CON plus MS (n. =. 11), or CON plus SM (n. =. 13). From calving through 30 d in milk (DIM), the cows received the same postpartal diet (1. 75. Mcal/kg of DM; CON), or CON plus MS or CON plus SM. Liver and blood samples were harvested at various time points from - 21 to 21 d relative to calving. Preplanned contrasts of CON versus SM + MS during prepartum (- 21 and - 10 d before calving) and postpartum (7, 14, and 21 d after calving) responses were evaluated. Cows fed MS or SM compared with CON had lower overall concentrations of plasma ceruloplasmin and serum amyloid A (SAA). Compared with CON, Met-supplemented cows had greater overall plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity. Liver concentrations of glutathione and carnitine also were greater overall with Met supplementation. Milk choline and liver phosphatidylcholine were lower overall in cows fed Met compared with controls. Liver tissue choline concentrations did not differ. Data indicate that supplemental Met enhanced de novo glutathione and carnitine synthesis in liver and, thus, increased antioxidant and β-oxidation capacity. The greater decrease of IL- 6 after calving coupled with lower ceruloplasmin and SAA in Met-supplemented cows indicated a reduction in proinflammatory signaling within liver. The lower hepatic phosphatidylcholine in Met-supplemented cows might have been associated with greater assembly or export of very low density lipoproteins. Overall, biomarker analyses in blood and tissue indicate that the beneficial effect of feeding SM and MS on postpartal cow performance {{is due in part to}} a better immunometabolic status...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge about large igneous provinces (LIPs) {{has played}} a {{fundamental}} role in shaping the prevailing view of mantle geodynamics, that of largely plate–driven flow in the upper mantle punctuated by rising, thermally-driven plumes from the lower mantle. The largest LIPs, including oceanic plateaus, reach volumes ranging from one million cubic km to greater than 10 million cubic km, and are apparently the product of relatively short-lived massive magmatic episodes that represent the largest non–ridge volcanic process on Earth (e. g., Coffin and Eldhom, 1994). In terms of magma flux, volume, and extent, such LIPs dwarf even the most prodigious present day hotspots, such as Iceland and Hawaii. Magma production rates for the largest LIPs rivalled, or even surpassed, that of the global mid–ocean ridge system for short periods of time. Moreover, because many of the largest continental LIPs formed during the Mesozoic, they may represent a mantle convection regime {{different from that of the}} ridge volcanism– dominated Cenozoic. A widely accepted explanation for oceanic plateaus and continental flood basalts is the plume head hypothesis, which posits that large, bulbous, primarily thermal diapirs are created at depth in the mantle, and then rise toward the surface, causing cataclysmic volcanism when they impact the lithosphere. Similar to the related plume hypothesis for hotspot volcanism, the plume head hypothesis has been accepted by many scientists because it provides a simple framework tying together many observations. Moreover, the plume head phenomenon occurs naturally in many numerical and laboratory experiments. The trouble is that there is currently no unequivocal geological evidence proving the plume head mechanism has operated within the Earth. Many existing data are indirect indicators of eruption rate and magmatic volume and could be explained by alternative hypotheses. Ongoing debate about the number, characteristics, and even existence of mantle plumes makes it desirable to consider alternative explanations for oceanic plateaus. Because these plateaus are arguably the most direct expression of mantle plume heads (in contrast to continental LIPs, whose magma must have first passed through continental lithosphere), understanding oceanic plateau formation is considered critical to understanding mantle geodynamics. In order to address the plume head versus alternative hypothesis, it is necessary to study a plateau for which the relation to contemporaneous mid–ocean ridges is known. Unfortunately, this condition is <b>no</b> <b>met</b> for plateaus formed during the Cretaceous Normal Superchon (a. k. a., the Cretaceous Quiet Period) –like Ontong Java, Manihiki, and Kerguelen plateaus–because of the lack of magnetic reversals and thus linear seafloor magnetic anomalies to mark the locations of spreading ridges. Shatsky Rise is the only large intraoceanic plateau formed at a time of magnetic reversals. Contemporaneous magnetic lineations exist around and within the Shatsky Rise plateau, providing a framework that allows the development of a tectonic model. However, this model is currently based on geophysical inferences with little geological evidence from sampling. ...|$|E
