5|$|Commentators {{have felt}} the game {{was an attempt to}} {{capitalize}} on then-recent, extensive <b>news</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf War, which had focused on the use of advanced, impersonal weapons (such as aircraft and guided missiles) to destroy enemy weapons and installations.

5|$|<b>News</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> legal actions also {{provided}} considerable free publicity. Variety reported that lines for the Broadway production stretched {{around the corner}} after it was condemned in the magistrates' court.

After proceedings began, the box office increased to $14,000–15,000 per week, which Variety described as near the theater's capacity.

5|$|The {{following}} year, {{the firm}} had to cut back operations, because <b>news</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the Persian Gulf War drew viewers away from infomercials. Ron Perelman of Forbes Holdings Inc. bought a 37.5 percent share of Guthy-Renker in 1993 in exchange for $25 million and priority access to air-time on Perelman's television stations. At the time, Guthy-Renker had grown to $60 million in revenue. In 1996, Perelman's {{stake in the company}} was resold to News Corp and Guthy-Renker bought it back. Two years later, Goldman Sachs bought a stake in the company that valued Guthy-Renker at $3 billion, and a Japanese trading company, Nissho Iwai Group, bought a 17 percent portion of Guthy-Renker's Asia subsidiary for $9 million. Guthy-Renker created a television station for infomercials called GRTV in 1996, which was sold to TVN Entertainment Corporation in 1999.|$|E

5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While watching the <b>news</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} <b>news</b> <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> {{him during the}} campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual {{for the vice president}} to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session for the first two months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{research}} has explored {{the ways the}} mainstream news media covers Muslims and Islam, but {{few studies have examined}} Muslims’ reactions to this reporting. Studies that have investigated this issue have identified that the responses of Muslims to <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> tend to be largely negative {{because of the lack of}} Muslim news sources, the stereotypical representation <b>of</b> Muslims in <b>news</b> <b>coverage,</b> the portrayal <b>of</b> Muslims as the enemy within, and the conflation of Muslims with terrorism. This paper further explores the attitudes of Muslims to <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> Islam and Muslims by drawing on data from 14 focus groups (N[*]=[*] 104 participants) conducted with Australian Muslims. Similar to previous research, findings reveal that Australian Muslims are highly critical <b>of</b> <b>news</b> media <b>coverage</b> <b>of</b> Islam and Muslims and express concern about the divisiveness that such portrayal can have for Australian society. However, the study participants also had positive comments to make about the news media. Possible solutions to negative news media portrayals of Muslims are considered.
