5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{is invited}} by her boss Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to spend Christmas {{with him to}} help him deal with a visit from his mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch). Liz finds it strange that Jack's fiancée Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) will not spend the holiday with him and {{immediately}} realizes that Jack has not told his mother about Avery's pregnancy. Avery becomes angry, but she and Liz convince him to tell her which he promises to do. Jack tells Colleen about the news {{but she is not}} excited about the pregnancy as Jack and Avery are not married. To get back at her, Jack calls his biological father Milton Greene (Alan Alda), the father she <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he had, and invites him to spend Christmas with him, and does not inform him that Colleen will be present. The next day, Milton arrives and Jack explains the reason for his visit is so that he can ambush Colleen as she looks down on his relationship with Avery. Later, Avery arrives and is angered about what Colleen said about her relationship with Jack. Liz tries to warn Colleen about Jack's plan but to no avail. She is shocked to see Milton, but immediately figures out what Jack is up to. Colleen gets even with Jack by faking a heart attack, which causes Milton and Avery to feel sorry for her thus abandoning their plan to reprimand Colleen. At the hospital, Avery reveals that she and Jack had planned to elope over New Year's and extends an invitation to everyone. After the announcement, Liz leaves and travels to White Haven, Pennsylvania to spend Christmas with her family.|$|E

500|$|Easley filed {{a lawsuit}} against the Seahawks, their team trainer and the team doctors stating that an {{overdose}} of Advil (ibuprofen) for an ankle injury a few years before was the cause of his kidney failure. He knew as early as 1986 that there were issues with his kidney but finally realized the severity of it when he failed the Cardinals physical. Easley claimed that he took 15 to 20 Advils daily for three months to reduce the swelling in his ankle, before a doctor intervened and told him to stop. [...] A former teammate said that Advil and other medications were easily obtainable in the Seahawks locker room in [...] "large dispensers" [...] without proper medical supervision. [...] Easley's physicians claimed that they <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to take the quantity of Advils Easley claimed he took. His case made national headlines and formed discussion involving the safe use of over the counter medication like Advil. The lawsuit was later settled out of court.|$|E

500|$|In chapter 285, [...] "Kiss of Truth", Hild {{reveals that}} Keiichi's sexual desires for Belldandy have {{previously}} been sealed away {{in order to}} prevent humans and gods from mating, as would be the natural consequences of Keiichi's wish for a goddess to be with him always. This explains why Keiichi has never been very forward in their relationship. Although Belldandy has never lied about this situation, she has also <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> When the old contract was dissolved and a new one is formed, Belldandy and Keiichi are immediately confronted with an Interracial Romance Inquisitor (Ansuz, mother of Belldandy and Skuld) who immediately sets a trial to determine if they are really meant to be together, and should Keiichi fail, they shall be separated forever. Once passing the test, Belldandy and Keiichi are allowed by the heavens to live together as a proper couple, with their wedding ceremony being held in the final chapter.|$|E
500|$|In September 1975, the Bruins and Eagleson {{had reached}} a deal that would pay Orr US$4 million (US$ in [...] dollars) for ten years. But when Orr's knee {{required}} surgery, the Bruins reduced its offer to US$295,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season and a payment of US$925,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) or 18.6% of the Bruins in June 1980. Eagleson turned down the offer and on June 7, 1976 {{was quoted in the}} Toronto Star as saying [...] "Boston offered a five-year deal at US$925,000 or 18.6 percent ownership of the club in 1980. I didn't think it would be wise for him to be a player-owner." [...] On June 9, 1976, after Orr had signed with Chicago, Eagleson told the Toronto Globe and Mail that the Bruin offer was [...] "a five-year offer for US$295,000 a year. In addition, Orr was to receive US$925,000 in cash payable in June 1980. That was to be a cash payment or involve Orr's receiving 18.6 percent of the Bruins stock." [...] According to a famous 1990 story in the Toronto Star by Ellie Tesher, Orr stated that Eagleson <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of the offer, during negotiations or after. While Eagleson had spoken publicly to reporters of the offer, he had not discussed it with Orr.|$|E
500|$|As the bell-making nears completion, Boriska’s {{confidence}} slowly transforms into a stunned, detached disbelief that he’s succeeded at the task. The work crew {{takes over}} as Boriska makes several attempts to {{fade into the}} background of the activity. Once the bell has been hoisted into its tower the Grand Prince and his entourage arrive for the inaugural ceremony as the bell is blessed by the priests. As the bell is prepared to be rung the royal entourage is overhead discussing their doubts that it will. It is revealed that Boriska and the work crew know if the bell fails to ring the Grand Prince will have them all beheaded. (It is also overheard that the Grand Prince had his brother, who raided Vladimir in The Raid sequence, beheaded.) There is a quiet, agonizing tension as the foreman slowly coaxes the bell's clapper back and forth, nudging it closer to the lip of the bell with each swing. A pan across the assembly reveals white-robed Durochka, leading a horse (preceded by a child, presumably hers) as she walks through the crowd. At the critical moment the bell rings perfectly, and she smiles. After the ceremony, Andrei finds Boriska collapsed on the ground, sobbing. [...] He admits his father <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the secret of casting a bell. Andrei comforts him, breaking his vow of silence and telling the boy that they should carry on their work together: “You’ll cast bells. I’ll paint icons.” Andrei sees Durochka, the boy, and the horse walk off across a muddy field in the distance.|$|E

Arjuna declines, saying that some villagers have {{informed}} him that Maripur is under attack. Chitra assures him that the city is well protected, but to no avail. Arjuna's mind is occupied with thoughts of the princess, to which Chitra bitterly asks if he would love her more if she were like the Princess Chitra he admires. Arjuna replies that since she has always kept her true self a secret, he has never truly grown to love her {{as much as he could}} and that his love is [...] "incomplete". Noticing that this upsets her, Arjuna tries to console his companion.|$|R
2500|$|Fitzwilliam, as a landlord, reduced rents and {{cancelled}} arrears in bad times, {{as well as}} supplying cheap {{food and}} giving to the elderly free coal and blankets. He also performed his obligations in repairing rented properties and his charitable dispensations were generous but discriminating. His chaplain at Wentworth {{said that he was}} [...] "ever giving alms to the poor...the tale of woe was <b>never</b> <b>told</b> to <b>him</b> in vain". Fitzwilliam also supported Friendly Societies and savings banks to encourage the poor to practice thrift and self-reliance. Fitzwilliam enjoyed the life of a country gentleman; hunting, racehorse breeding and a patron of the turf. At the Doncaster races in 1827 the Duke of Devonshire turned up on the first day with a coach and six and twelve outriders, the same as Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam appeared the next day [...] "with two coaches and six, and sixteen outriders, and has kept the thing up ever since".|$|R
2500|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} supporting the possibility of Sacco's guilt arose in 1941 when anarchist leader Carlo Tresca, {{a member of the}} Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee, told Max Eastman, [...] "Sacco was guilty but Vanzetti was innocent." [...] Eastman published an article recounting his conversation with Tresca in National Review in 1961. Later, others would confirm being told the same information by Tresca, but Tresca's daughter insisted she <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> Others pointed to an ongoing feud between Tresca and the Galleanisti, claiming the famous anarchist was just trying to get even.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Dr. George Zahorian {{was thought}} to have {{routinely}} distributed steroids and other drugs to WWF wrestlers, supposedly {{with the approval of}} WWF owner Vince McMahon. In 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after the steroid controversy engulfed the promotion, forcing him to temporarily cede control of the WWF to his wife Linda. The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon himself was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers. One notable prosecution witness was Nailz (real name: Kevin Wacholz), a former WWF performer who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon. Nailz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he repeatedly stated that he [...] "hated" [...] McMahon. The prosecution's intended star witness was Hulk Hogan, but this backfired when Hogan testified that McMahon <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to take nor tried to sell him steroids. The jury would later acquit McMahon of the charges and he resumed his role in the day-to day operations of the WWF.|$|E

2500|$|The theory {{now called}} [...] "Le Sage's theory of gravity" [...] was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1690s by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, a friend of Isaac Newton and Christiaan Huygens. Fatio was a well-known Swiss personage, and the kinetic theory of gravitation was his most notable scientific contribution, to which he devoted much of his life. Le Sage said that he heard of Fatio {{for the first time}} through his father, because his father had heard the prophecies of the cevénots (camisards), and told him that Fatio was among those prophets. Le Sage's father was well acquainted with the scientific fields in which Fatio worked, and he tutored Le Sage in the sciences. Nevertheless, Le Sage later claimed that his father <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that Fatio had created a theory of gravitation essentially identical to his own. (Le Sage also admitted that he had a pathologically bad memory, so it is unclear if his recollection is accurate.) In any case, Le Sage stated that he knew nothing of Fatio's theory until he was informed by his teacher Gabriel Cramer in 1749.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{is based}} upon the 1972 film The Godfather and tells the story of an {{original}} character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions. His actions in the game often take the form of events that happened off screen in the film; for example, he avenges Bonasera's daughter, he drives Vito Corleone to the hospital after he is shot, he plants the gun for Michael Corleone to kill Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, he places the horse's head in Jack Woltz's bed. Although the game was condemned by Francis Ford Coppola, who claimed Paramount <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about its development or asked for his input, it does feature voice acting from several stars of the film, including James Caan as Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and Abe Vigoda as Salvatore Tessio. Marlon Brando also recorded dialogue for Vito Corleone, in what would be his final acting job, but his ill health made most of his recordings unusable.

2500|$|Aaron Copland {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, on November 14, 1900. He was the {{youngest}} of five children in a Conservative Jewish family of Lithuanian origins. While emigrating from Russia to the United States, Copland's father, Harris Morris Copland, lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare to the US. It was there that Copland's father may have Anglicized his surname [...] "Kaplan" [...] to [...] "Copland", though Copland himself believed for many years that the change had been due to an Ellis Island immigration official when his father entered the country. Copland was however unaware until late in his life that the family name had been Kaplan, and his parents <b>never</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> this. Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' Brooklyn shop, H.M. Copland's, at 628 Washington Avenue (which Aaron would later describe as [...] "a kind of neighborhood Macy's"), on the corner of Dean Street and Washington Avenue, and most of the children helped out in the store. His father was a staunch Democrat. The family members were active in Congregation Baith Israel Anshei Emes, where Aaron celebrated his Bar Mitzvah. Not especially athletic, the sensitive young man became an avid reader and often read Horatio Alger stories on his front steps.|$|E

50|$|The {{plight of}} the Gentile nations during St. Paul’s time remains the plight of unreached nations today.

Meanwhile, 40% of mission resources go to 10 other countries which are oversaturated with gospel presence. Why the large disparity between the need and our response? The answer to this question is another question: “How can we send unless someone tells us about the unreached in the first place?” 70% of bible-believing Christians—people who know and take the Great Commission seriously—have <b>never</b> been <b>told</b> that over one-fourth of the world’s population has yet to come into contact with Christians who can tell them the good news of Jesus Christ.|$|R
