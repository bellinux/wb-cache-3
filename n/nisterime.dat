50|$|<b>Nisterime</b> acetate (USAN) (developmental {{code name}} ORF-9326), {{also known as}} 2α-chloro-4,5α-dihydrotestosterone O-(p-nitrophenyl)oxime 17β-acetate or as 2α-chloro-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one O-(p-nitrophenyl)oxime 17β-acetate, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a {{derivative}} of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that was developed as a postcoital contraceptive but was never marketed. It is an androgen ester - specifically, the C17α acetate ester of <b>nisterime.</b> Unlike antiprogestogens like mifepristone, <b>nisterime</b> acetate does not prevent implantation and instead induces embryo resorption as well as interrupts the post-implantation stage of pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nisterime</b> acetate is {{described}} as an androgen by some sources. However, {{it has also been}} reported that the drug lacks hormonal activity in bioassays, including androgenic, estrogenic, or progestogenic activity (as well as antagonistic activity). This finding has been described as puzzling in light of the potent abortifacient activity of the drug in animals and {{it has been said that}} its mechanism of action remains unknown.|$|E
