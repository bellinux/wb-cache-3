5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow <b>nanotubes</b> 4–20nm in diameter, {{essentially}} two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA <b>nanotubes</b> are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon <b>nanotubes,</b> and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon <b>nanotubes,</b> DNA <b>nanotubes</b> are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA <b>nanotubes</b> uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple, modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{absorption}} {{in carbon}} <b>nanotubes</b> differs from absorption in conventional 3D materials by presence of sharp peaks (1D <b>nanotubes)</b> {{instead of an}} absorption threshold followed by an absorption increase (most 3D solids). Absorption in <b>nanotubes</b> originates from electronic transitions from the v2 to c2 (energy E22) or v1 to c1 (E11) levels, etc. The transitions are relatively sharp {{and can be used}} to identify nanotube types. Note that the sharpness deteriorates with increasing energy, and that many <b>nanotubes</b> have very similar E22 or E11 energies, and thus significant overlap occurs in absorption spectra. This overlap is avoided in photoluminescence mapping measurements (see below), which instead of a combination of overlapped transitions identifies individual (E22,E11) pairs.|$|E

A model of single-walled carbon <b>nanotube</b> as interconnect is also presented and extended in modeling of single-walled carbon <b>nanotube</b> bundles. These models are applied {{in studying the}} performances of circuits such as the complementary carbon <b>nanotube</b> inverter pair and carbon <b>nanotube</b> as interconnect. Cadence/Spectre simulations show that carbon <b>nanotube</b> field-effect transistor circuits can operate at upper GHz frequencies.

5|$|Because of {{excellent}} thermal and chemical stability, boron nitride ceramics are traditionally used {{as parts of}} high-temperature equipment. Boron nitride has potential use in nanotechnology. <b>Nanotubes</b> of BN can be produced that have a structure {{similar to that of}} carbon <b>nanotubes,</b> i.e. graphene (or BN) sheets rolled on themselves, but the properties are very different.|$|E
5|$|Carbon <b>nanotubes</b> {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. Consequently, as {{expected}} from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual <b>nanotubes</b> can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon <b>nanotubes.</b> However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon <b>nanotubes</b> yet.|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{properties}} of metal-finite semiconducting carbon <b>nanotube</b> interfaces are studied {{as a function}} of the <b>nanotube</b> length using a self-consistent tight-binding theory. We find that the shape of the potential barrier depends on the long-range tail of the charge transfer, leading to an injection barrier thickness comparable to half of the <b>nanotube</b> length until the <b>nanotube</b> reaches the bulk limit. The conductance of the <b>nanotube</b> junction shows a transition from tunneling to thermally-activated transport with increasing <b>nanotube</b> length...|$|R
30|$|Functionalized <b>nanotube</b> surface can be {{achieved}} simply by exposing CNTs to vapors containing functionalization species that non-covalently bonds to the <b>nanotube</b> surface while providing chemically functional groups at the <b>nanotube</b> surface [19]. A stable functionalized <b>nanotube</b> surface {{can be obtained by}} exposing it to vapor stabilization species that reacts with the functionalization layer to form a stabilization layer against desorption from the <b>nanotube</b> surface while depositing chemically functional groups at the <b>nanotube</b> surface. The stabilized <b>nanotube</b> surface can be exposed further to at least another material layer precursor species that can deposit as a new layer of materials.|$|R
40|$|Using first-principles density {{functional}} theory {{based on}} gradient corrected approach, we have studied interaction of H 2 molecule with Li-doped carbon <b>nanotube</b> and <b>nanotube</b> based peapod structures. We find that H 2 physisorbs on pure carbon <b>nanotube,</b> {{which is in}} agreement with earlier studies, and this binding increases when H 2 binds to Li-decorated on carbon <b>nanotube</b> surfaces: the binding is further enhanced with Li atoms deposited on C 60 doped <b>nanotube</b> peapod structures. The increase in binding in the latter structures arises due to charge transfer between the <b>nanotube</b> and C 60, which further facilitates charge transfer from Li to the <b>nanotube.</b> Encapsulating fullerene molecule inside the <b>nanotube</b> provides {{a different way of}} increasing charge concentration on Li atom adsorbed outside the <b>nanotube.</b> The increase in H 2 binding energy due to C 60 encapsulation, compared to recently engineered metal doped <b>nanotube</b> structures, may lead to different carbon based materials for hydrogen storage at room temperature...|$|R

5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon <b>nanotubes.</b> High-quality <b>nanotubes</b> have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|Interaction between <b>{{nanotube}}s</b> {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon <b>nanotubes.</b> PL from double-wall carbon <b>nanotubes</b> strongly {{depends on the}} preparation method: CVD grown DWCNTs show emission both from inner and outer shells. However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs lying on the substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only. Detachment of the tubes from the substrate drastically increases PL.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Under the {{protection}} of argon gas, carbon <b>nanotube</b> reinforced magnesium metal matrix composite was made by stirring carbon <b>nanotube</b> into magnesium melts and formed by die casting. TEM and EDS methods were introduced to analyze boundary structure and chemical composition between carbon <b>nanotube</b> and magnesium metal matrix. The mechanical carbon <b>nanotube</b> properties of the composite were tested. Nickel chemical plating surface of carbon <b>nanotube</b> is favorable to adhesion of carbon <b>nanotube</b> to magnesium. Tests show that carbon <b>nanotube,</b> especially chemical nickel-plated one, has excellent role in strengthening the magnesium. The structure of magnesium was fined.

40|$|A highly ordered TiO 2 <b>nanotube</b> array on Ti {{substrate}} was fabricated {{by using}} an electrochemical anodic oxidation method. The morphology, crystalline phase, and photoelectrochemical property of the <b>nanotube</b> array were characterized. The photocatalytic activity of the <b>nanotube</b> array was evaluated by the decolorization of methyl orange in aqueous solution using the different light sources. The effects of structure and morphology of the <b>nanotube</b> array on its photocatalytic activity were investigated. It {{was found that the}} photoabsorption behavior of the TiO 2 <b>nanotube</b> film depended on the structures of the <b>nanotube</b> array. The <b>nanotube</b> array films exhibited a drastically enhanced photocurrent, and a higher photocatalytic activity compared with the TiO 2 nanoparticle film prepared by the regular sol-gel method. The experimental results indicated that the film thickness markedly influenced the photocatalytic activity of <b>nanotube</b> array film, and the 2. 5 mu m-thick TiO 2 <b>nanotube</b> array film appeared a maximum photodegradation efficiency to methyl orange. However, for a given <b>nanotube</b> length, the tube diameter was only very slightly affected the photocatalylic efficiency in this work.

5|$|Interactions between <b>nanotubes,</b> such as {{bundling}}, broaden optical lines. While bundling strongly affects photoluminescence, it {{has much}} weaker effect on optical absorption and Raman scattering. Consequently, sample {{preparation for the}} latter two techniques is relatively simple.|$|E
5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon <b>nanotubes</b> having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its bandgap energies for all <b>nanotubes</b> in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E
5|$|Whereas mechanical, {{electrical}} and electrochemical (supercapacitor) {{properties of the}} carbon <b>nanotubes</b> are well established and have immediate applications, the practical use of optical properties is yet unclear. The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab. Their unique feature is not the efficiency, which is yet relatively low, but the narrow selectivity in the wavelength of emission and detection of light {{and the possibility of}} its fine tuning through the nanotube structure. In addition, bolometer and optoelectronic memory devices have been realised on ensembles of single-walled carbon <b>nanotubes.</b>|$|E

5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single <b>nanotubes</b> and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon <b>nanotubes</b> derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals is that their DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{process has}} been developed for the efficient fabrication of carbon <b>nanotube</b> probes for use in atomic-force microscopes (AFMs) and nanomanipulators. Relative to prior <b>nanotube</b> tip production processes, this process offers advantages in alignment of the <b>nanotube</b> on the cantilever and stability of the <b>nanotube's</b> attachment. A procedure has also been developed at Ames that effectively sharpens the multiwalled <b>nanotube,</b> which improves {{the resolution of the}} multiwalled <b>nanotube</b> probes and, combined with the greater stability of multiwalled <b>nanotube</b> probes, increases the effective resolution of these probes, making them comparable in resolution to single-walled carbon <b>nanotube</b> probes. The robust attachment derived from this improved fabrication method and the natural strength and resiliency of the <b>nanotube</b> itself produces an AFM probe with an extremely long imaging lifetime. In a longevity test, a <b>nanotube</b> tip imaged a silicon nitride surface for 15 hours without measurable loss of resolution. In contrast, the resolution of conventional silicon probes noticeably begins to degrade within minutes. These carbon <b>nanotube</b> probes have many possible applications in the semiconductor industry, particularly as devices are approaching the nanometer scale and new atomic layer deposition techniques necessitate a higher resolution characterization technique. Previously at Ames, the use of <b>nanotube</b> probes has been demonstrated for imaging photoresist patterns with high aspect ratio. In addition, these tips have been used to analyze Mars simulant dust grains, extremophile protein crystals, and DNA structure...|$|R
