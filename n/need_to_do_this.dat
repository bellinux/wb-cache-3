25|$|There {{are four}} weapon classes: the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives, and the Frost Shield; each have the {{tactical}} roles {{of a long}} range attacker, slow melee attacker, fast melee attacker and a tank respectively. The active and passive abilities available for each class allow some form of customization. The weapon class and selected abilities (which also have cooldowns) can be changed {{before the start of}} any arena level. Each player must choose a different weapon class. Balfus can be made to interact with the environment's spiritual plane by ordering him to activate or trigger props like healing pedestals or set off a stunning blast from traps. He can travel with the characters, float in space or can be called to their location. Good positioning and communication will help the players use Balfus efficiently; the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> while facing waves of enemies, makes the game more challenging.|$|E

They are both put in jail. Murray comes to bail them out, telling them that he had to spend all of their newly acquired investment return on bail.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{activate}} his Crusnik powers, Abel usually issues a verbal or mental command to the nanomachines in his body. The exact wording and method of activation varies among the novels, the manga, and anime, {{and between the}} original Japanese and the English translations. For example, in the anime he says [...] "Nanomachines: Crusnik 02 - Power Output __% Activate" [...] while in the manga he silently activates Crusnik mode and receives a confirmation from the nanomachines of [...] "Crusnik 02 Loading. Limitation at __%... Acknowledged". In the anime, neither Cain nor Seth demonstrated a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order to activate their powers, {{and there are several}} times when Abel activates his powers without saying his usual command, so it appears to just be a literary device; the only exception to this is in the third novel where Sister Paula Souwauski, who is in combat with him, prevents the change by not letting him finish the statement, as it would flip the playing field as Abel in his human form is ranked as having a B- fighting ability while his 40% Crusnik is described as an S+.|$|E
2500|$|E. A. Thompson ("Britain, A.D. 406–410", in Britannia, 8 (1977), pp.303–318) {{offered a}} more provocative theory {{to explain the}} {{expulsion}} of officials and appeal for Roman aid. He suggested that a revolt consisting of dissident peasants, not unlike the Bagaudae of Gaul, also existing in Britain, and when they revolted and expelled the Roman officials, the landowning class then made an appeal for Roman aid. There is no textual proof that that was so, though it might be plausible if the definition of 'bagaudae' is changed to fit the circumstances. There is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> as any number of rational scenarios already fit the circumstances. There {{is the possibility that}} some form of bagaudae existed in Britain, but were not necessarily relevant to the events of 409 and 410. The alleged ubiquity of Pelagianism amongst the British population may have contributed to such a movement if it had existed, not to mention large-scale purges amongst the British elite over previous decades. Among the works that mention but skirt the issue is Koch's Celtic Culture (2005), which cites Thompson's translation of Zosimus and goes on to say [...] "The revolt in Britain may have involved bacaudae or peasant rebels {{as was the case in}} Armorica, but this is not certain." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012 PLOS Medicine {{published}} an article by three researchers {{who were involved in}} ongoing updates of a Cochrane Collaboration review of neuraminidase inhibitors for treating influenza, describing their experience of trying to gain access to clinical study reports for the antiviral Tamiflu (oseltamivir) from the drug's manufacturer Roche. The article outlined the need for access to all clinical trial data held by pharmaceutical companies and regulators, and detailed reasons given by Roche for not sharing data on Tamiflu. In a commissioned perspective article published in the same issue of PLOS Medicine, regulators from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other national regulatory bodies outlined a shift in their stance on access to clinical trial data but also highlighted challenges that would need to be overcome. The regulators noted, [...] "e consider it neither desirable nor realistic {{to maintain the status quo}} of limited availability of regulatory trials data" [...] and concluded, [...] "e welcome debate on these issues, and remain confident that satisfactory solutions can be found to make complete trial data available in a way that will be in the best interest of public health". The article marked a move towards the proactive disclosure of clinical trial data and led to the EMA holding a workshop to establish how this could be done. At the workshop Guido Rasi, the EMA’s Executive Director, announced [...] "oday represents the first step in delivering our vision. We are not here to decide if we will publish clinical-trial data, only how. We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order to rebuild trust and confidence in the whole system". PLOS Medicines chief editor, Virginia Barbour, was an invited speaker at the workshop representing the media.|$|E

60|$|For {{the same}} uprush of fancy which {{had shown him}} with all the force of {{mathematical}} demonstration that life had no meaning, brought with it another idea; {{and that was why}} Cronshaw, he imagined, had given him the Persian rug. As the weaver elaborated his pattern for no end but the pleasure of his aesthetic sense, so might a man live his life, or if one was forced to believe that his actions were outside his choosing, so might a man look at his life, that it made a pattern. There was as little <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> as there was use. It was merely something he did for his own pleasure. Out of the manifold events of his life, his deeds, his feelings, his thoughts, he might make a design, regular, elaborate, complicated, or beautiful; and though it might be no more than an illusion that he had the power of selection, though it might be no more than a fantastic legerdemain in which appearances were interwoven with moonbeams, that did not matter: it seemed, and so to him it was. In the vast warp of life (a river arising from no spring and flowing endlessly to no sea), with the background to his fancies that there was no meaning and that nothing was important, a man might get a personal satisfaction in selecting the various strands that worked out the pattern. There was one pattern, the most obvious, perfect, and beautiful, in which a man was born, grew to manhood, married, produced children, toiled for his bread, and died; but there were others, intricate and wonderful, in which happiness did not enter and in which success was not attempted; and in them might be discovered a more troubling grace. Some lives, and Hayward's was among them, the blind indifference of chance cut off while the design was still imperfect; and then the solace was comfortable that it did not matter; other lives, such as Cronshaw's, offered a pattern which was difficult to follow, the point of view had to be shifted and old standards had to be altered before one could understand that such a life was its own justification. Philip thought that in throwing over the desire for happiness he was casting aside the last of his illusions. His life had seemed horrible when it was measured by its happiness, but now he seemed to gather strength as he realised that it might be measured by something else. Happiness mattered as little as pain. They came in, both of them, as all the other details of his life came in, to the elaboration of the design. He seemed for an instant to stand above the accidents of his existence, and he felt that they could not affect him again as they had done before. Whatever happened to him now would be one more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.|$|E
