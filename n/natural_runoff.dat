5|$|Reduction in flow {{caused by}} dams, diversions, water for {{thermoelectric}} power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs – {{the latter of}} which consumes more than 15percent of the river's <b>natural</b> <b>runoff</b> – has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at {{only a fraction of}} its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Eutrophication poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing {{eutrophication}} should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a sustainable solution for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans {{should be aware that}} <b>natural</b> <b>runoff</b> (which causes algal blooms in the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E

500|$|Flows at {{the mouth}} have {{steadily}} declined {{since the beginning of}} the 20thcentury, and in most years after 1960 the Colorado River has run dry before reaching the sea. Irrigation, industrial, and municipal diversions, evaporation from reservoirs, <b>natural</b> <b>runoff,</b> and likely climate change have all contributed to this substantial reduction in flow, threatening the future water supply. For example, the Gila River – formerly one of the Colorado's largest tributaries – contributes little more than a trickle in most years due to use of its water by cities and farms in central Arizona. The average flow rate of the Colorado at the northernmost point of the Mexico–United States border (NIB, or Northerly International Boundary) is about , [...] per year – less than a 10th of the natural flow – due to upstream water use. Below here, all of the remaining flow is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, leaving a dry riverbed from Morelos Dam to the sea that is supplemented by intermittent flows of irrigation drainage water. There have been exceptions, however, namely in the early to mid-1980s, when the Colorado once again reached the sea during several consecutive years of record-breaking precipitation and snowmelt. In 1984, so much excess runoff occurred that some , or , poured into the sea.|$|E

As farming increased, low river flows dropped even lower, leading to saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay into the Delta.

2500|$|The Columbia Basin Project {{in central}} Washington changed the {{character}} of Crab Creek substantially. The Crab Creek irrigation-return drainage basin covers an irrigated area of 296mi² (767km²). A large earthfill dam, the O'Sullivan Dam (also {{referred to as the}} Potholes Dam) was constructed from 1947 to 1949, forming Potholes Reservoir, which serves as a central point in the CBP for storage of irrigation water, <b>natural</b> <b>runoff,</b> and irrigation-return flow, allowing irrigation water reuse throughout the southern CBP area. Potholes Reservoir releases water through canals and has no perennial outlet to Lower Crab Creek. Hence today the water in Lower Crab Creek comes from ground-water seepage from Potholes Reservoir and irrigation, from the Goose Lake Wasteway, and from tributary inflows downstream of the O’Sullivan Dam. [...] The water table in this section is variable but generally high due to the low elevation and irrigation runoff. Many lakes, including Merry, Lenice and Nunally Lakes, drain into Crab Creek.|$|E
5000|$|Unimpaired runoff, {{also known}} as full natural flow, is a {{hydrology}} term {{that is used to}} describe the <b>natural</b> <b>runoff</b> of a watershed or waterbody that would have occurred prior to anthropogenic or human influences on the watershed.

Although in our setting the preferences are restricted to be single-peaked over three alternatives, these problems persist.
