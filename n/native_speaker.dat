5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a <b>native</b> <b>speaker.</b> An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a <b>native</b> <b>speaker.</b> Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward {{on one side and the}} body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{was done}} by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese, making dialogue sound like what a <b>native</b> <b>speaker</b> of English would say instead of strictly adhering the original's exact wording. The localization editor, Ben Bateman, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, line by line or scene by scene rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same ideas in English. Most parts of the game that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese version, but a different one; Bateman did however try to make similar types of jokes, with similar contents and ideas. The game's use of Japanese language puns led to problems, as many of them relied on Japanese dialects to function; for these, Bateman replaced them with new puns in English. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} article is about phatic communication among English <b>native</b> <b>speakers,</b> {{about how the}} <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> create ties of union. The {{article is based on}} the writer’s elaborative qualitative research on Malinowski’s theory of phatic communion [1], Jakobson’s theory of language functions [2], and Brown and Gilman’s theory of power and solidarity [3]. The primary data are obtained from the interviews to nine <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> with different dialects of American English, British English, and Australian English. The research findings show the functions of phatic communication among English <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> and the types of expressions they use for creating ties of union. The phatic communication among English <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> is then related to politeness and is also verified by other significant theories in verbal human communication...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{pronunciation}} of English by <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of Dutch is investigated. Pronunciation can {{be judged by}} <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> but also be measured {{with the help of}} acoustic measurements. Is there a correlation between human judges and these acoustic-phonetic measurements and which features are important in pronouncing English? To find out, an experiment was set up in which 12 <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of Dutch and 6 <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> of English were pronouncing English. Of these 18 samples, 12 samples were manipulated: the VOT was made longer or, in case of the British <b>native</b> <b>speakers,</b> made shorter, as well as the vowels before plosives or fricatives with final (de) voicing. These thirty samples were put together in a survey that was sent to thirty British <b>native</b> <b>speakers</b> who judged the pronunciation. No correlation has been found between the acoustic-phonetic measurements and the human judgements and also neither VOT nor vowel length before final (de) voicing could influence the opinions of the judges. ...|$|R
