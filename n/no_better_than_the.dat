However, the Immortals fared <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed at the Clemson 26-yard line, {{where the}} Tigers began their second {{offensive}} possession. It began <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first, as Dantzler was tackled for a three-yard loss by defensive tackle Lamar Cobb. A rush for no gain {{and a short}} pass forced Clemson to again punt before gaining a first down. Somaini's second punt was kicked cleanly, and the Hokies returned the punt to their 42-yard line. Two rushes and a pass to the 50-yard line were not enough for a first down, and Tech punted to the Clemson 17-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The Florida State touchback allowed Vick {{to start}} at his 20-yard line for Virginia Tech's second {{possession}} of the game. The possession began <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first one, as Virginia Tech committed a 10-yard holding penalty on the first play. On subsequent plays, however, the Hokie offense began to move the ball with success. Vick completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver Eddie Royal, and the offense was aided by a 15-yard Florida State penalty, which gave the Hokies an automatic first down. Following the first down, Vick completed the first big Virginia Tech play of the game, throwing the ball 35yards downfield to Justin Harper, who caught it in Florida State territory. Two more plays pushed Virginia Tech {{to the edge of}} the Florida State red zone, but a penalty and another sack prevented the Hokies from advancing the ball further. Virginia Tech was forced to send in kicker Brandon Pace to attempt a 45-yard field goal. The kick was good, and Virginia Tech had tied the game 33 with 1:00 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The {{accuracy}} of the measured value of the Avogadro constant is currently limited by the uncertainty {{in the value of}} the Planck constant—a measure relating the energy of photons to their frequency. That relative standard uncertainty has been 50parts per billion (ppb) since 2006. By fixing the Avogadro constant, the practical effect of this proposal would be that the uncertainty in the mass of a 12C atom—and the magnitude of the kilogram—could be <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> current 50ppb uncertainty in the Planck constant. Under this proposal, the magnitude of the kilogram would be subject to future refinement as improved measurements of the value of the Planck constant become available; electronic realizations of the kilogram would be recalibrated as required. Conversely, an electronic definition of the kilogram (see Electronic approaches, below), which would precisely fix the Planck constant, would continue to allow 83⅓ moles of 12C to have a mass of precisely one kilogram but the number of atoms comprising a mole (the Avogadro constant) would continue to be subject to future refinement.|$|E

Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make him <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E

25|$|Wattles began {{training}} Dan Patch {{in earnest}} at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before {{his first start}} in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and Wattles with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who {{did not seem to}} be working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch did not disappoint, winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. Wattles had not pushed the colt, wanting to be able to stay at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.|$|E
25|$|Somerset batted {{first and}} were all out in around 90 minutes for just 55. Off-spin bowler Roy Tattersall unusually opened the bowling, and took seven for 25. No Somerset batsman reached double figures, and Buse made just five. When Lancashire batted, Buse himself proved almost as deadly, taking {{four of the}} first five wickets that fell for just 46 runs. But then Peter Marner and Alan Wharton decided to hit out, {{and put on a}} stand of 70 in 25 minutes for the sixth wicket. In all, Lancashire totalled 158, made off just 32 overs, with Buse taking six for 41 and the innings {{finishing}} by teatime on the first day. Somerset's second innings then proved <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first, with Brian Statham joining Tattersall in the wickets. Only a last-wicket partnership of 35 by Jim Redman and the debutant Brian Langford delayed matters at all. Somerset were all out for 79, losing by an innings and 24 runs, with Tattersall having match figures of 13 wickets for 69 runs. The game was over by six o'clock on the evening of the first day.|$|E
25|$|The {{second quarter}} would {{be full of}} missed {{opportunities}} and poor play from both teams. On the first play, a high snap from Bucs center Tony Mayberry went over quarterback Shaun King's head and into the end zone. King managed to knock {{the ball out of}} the end zone to prevent a touchdown, but it gave the Rams a safety and a 5–3 lead. Az-Zahir Hakim returned the free kick 15-yards to the Rams 40-yard line. Hakim also caught a 14-yard pass and ran for six as the team drove to the Bucs 26, but the drive was halted there and Wilkins missed a 44-yard field goal attempt. Following a punt from each team, Tampa Bay also got good field position from a good return, a 14-yard punt return from Karl Williams that gave them a first down on the Rams 45. Although they would drive to the St. Louis 26, they would ultimately fair <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Rams did. On third down, King lost a fumble while being sacked by Charlie Clemons. King recovered the ball, but the 13-yard loss pushed the team out of field goal range. The next time Tampa Bay had the ball, King threw a pass from the Rams 41 that went right into the arms of St. Louis defensive back Todd Lyght. A few plays later, the half ended with the score still 5-3, despite the Rams 159–75 advantage over the Buccaneers in total yards.|$|E

500|$|From {{the early}} drafts, Hammerstein and Logan made {{the issue of}} racial {{prejudice}} central to the story. Hammerstein repeatedly rewrote the Act II backstage scene where Emile, Nellie and Cable confront {{the question of the}} Americans' racism. As critic Robert Butler pointed out in his educational companion to the 2001 London production, [...] "if one young person has a prejudice, it might be a character flaw; if two young people share a prejudice, it tells us something about the society in which they grew up". In one draft, Emile advises that the Americans are <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Axis Powers, in their prejudice, and suggests they go home to sing songs about how all are created free and equal. [...] Lovensheimer states that a postwar American audience would have found such onstage sentiments to be offensive. In the staged version, Emile's expressions are limited to two lines arguing that prejudice is not inborn.|$|E
500|$|On the way home, Philip's fleet {{stopped at}} the island of Thasos {{off the coast of}} Thrace.

[...] Metrodorus replied that the king accepted the terms, and the Thasians opened their gates to the Macedonians. Once within the walls, however, Philip ordered his soldiers to enslave all the citizens, who were then sold away, and to loot the city.

500|$|Hewitt was {{responsible}} for initiating major improvements in Air Force education that took place [...] between 1945 and 1953, playing {{a key role in}} the establishment of RAAF College and the introduction of an apprenticeship training programme. The purpose of the College was, in Hewitt's words, to [...] "sow the seeds of service" [...] for future leaders, helping create a special RAAF esprit de corps. He added that it was [...] "almost a truism that the future RAAF can be <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Air Force College". [...] Founded at Point Cook in January 1948, RAAF College's inaugural commandant was Air Commodore Val Hancock, who also drafted its first charter. With the support of the Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance, Air Vice Marshal Ellis Wackett, Hewitt developed the Apprenticeship Training Scheme to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, introducing it with a nationwide publicity campaign to attract recruits. Its base was the Ground Training School, which opened at Wagga, New South Wales, in early 1948 to provide education and technical training for youths aged 15to17. It was renamed RAAF Technical College in 1950 and then the RAAF School of Technical Training in 1952.|$|E

[...] Pascu also appeared {{on a number of}} comedy recordings released by Divertis, earning Pascu the reputation of a protest song writer. [...] He was inspired by Romanian politics and the social debates of the 1990s to write hits like [...] "Morcovul românesc" [...] ("The Romanian Carrot") and [...] "Instalatorul" [...] ("The Plumber"). [...] Pascu acknowledged his political streak, recognized what he considered the necessary link between social phenomena and a songwriter's cultural perspective, and argued that songs should always tell a story. One of the parody songs included on Maşina cu jazzolină, titled [...] "Africa, Africa", drew special interest in cultural circles with its satirical undertones. The lyrics suggested that modern Romania was <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> average African nation. According to historian Sorin Mitu, [...] "Africa, Africa" [...] showed [...] "the Romanians' tendency to relate to extra-European realities", a trend he observed during Ceauşescu's final decade, and then throughout the early post-revolutionary period.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, when {{psychoanalysis}} was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to Hamlet, notably by Sigmund Freud, Ernest Jones, and Jacques Lacan, and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that [...] "the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations". After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an [...] "Oedipal desire for his mother and the subsequent guilt [...] preventing him from murdering the man [...] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do". Confronted with his repressed desires, Hamlet realises that [...] "he himself is literally <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sinner whom he is to punish". Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent [...] "distaste for sexuality"—articulated in his [...] "nunnery" [...] conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation. John Barrymore's long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, [...] "broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion against everything Victorian. He had a [...] "blunter intention" [...] than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.|$|E

500|$|In 1977, British {{psychiatrist}} David Cooper asked Foucault {{the same}} question which Claude Bourdet had formerly asked Viktor Fainberg during a press conference given by Fainberg and Leonid Plyushch: when the USSR has the whole penitentiary and police apparatus, which could take charge of anybody, and which is perfect in itself, why do they use psychiatry? Foucault answered {{it was not a}} question of a distortion of the use of psychiatry but that was its fundamental project. In the discussion Confinement, Psychiatry, Prison, Foucault states the cooperation of psychiatrists with the KGB in the Soviet Union was not abuse of medicine, but an evident case and [...] "condensation" [...] of psychiatry's [...] "inheritance", an [...] "intensification, the ossification of a kinship structure that has never ceased to function." [...] Foucault believed that the abuse of psychiatry in the USSR of the 1960s was a logical extension of the invasion of psychiatry into the legal system. In the discussion with Jean Laplanche and Robert Badinter, Foucault says that criminologists of the 1880—1900s started speaking surprisingly modern language: [...] "The crime cannot be, for the criminal, but an abnormal, disturbed behavior. If he upsets society, it's because he himself is upset". This led to the twofold conclusions. First, [...] "the judicial apparatus is no longer useful." [...] The judges, as men of law, understand such complex, alien legal issues, purely psychological matters <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> criminal. So commissions of psychiatrists and physicians should be substituted for the judicial apparatus. And in this vein, concrete projects were proposed. Second, [...] "We must certainly treat this individual who is dangerous only because he is sick. But, at the same time, we must protect society against him." [...] Hence comes the idea of mental isolation with a mixed function: therapeutic and prophylactic. In the 1900s, these projects have given rise to very lively responses from European judicial and political bodies. However, they found a wide field of applications when the Soviet Union {{became one of the most}} common but by no means exceptional cases.|$|E
