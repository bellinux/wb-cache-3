Nigerian Governments have been consistently facing challenges to reposition, reinvent, and realign themselves in light of increasing expectations for demonstrable results and enhanced responsiveness for a more cost effective, citizen-centric, and <b>networked</b> <b>government</b> evidenced by several incessant conflicts arising from marginalization of grassroots communities. Access to primary and authentic source of information at the grassroots is key to transparent and responsive government. The ICTs support for traditional governance is thus an effort aimed at building the capacity of indigenous political institutions, to participate in modern governance, have access to information and knowledge as well as to share experiences among themselves and with other stakeholders. This paper examines challenges and opportunities for transforming government and building an information-rich society. It provides strategies to digitize local government administration as a panacea to gaining access to authentic and reliable demographic data/information for meaningful decision-making processes towards attaining political stability from the grassroots level of governance using Nigeria’s Ondo State Local Government Areas as case study. It concludes by advocating the adoption and implementation of an “EATING” model, a bottom-up to participatory community engagement and development towards achieving political stability.

40|$|This essay {{seeks to}} broaden our {{understanding}} of <b>government</b> <b>networks</b> by placing them in more historical context and by elaborating different types of <b>government</b> <b>networks</b> within and without traditional international institutions. After {{a brief overview of}} the literature on transgovernmentalism since the 1970 s in Part I, Part H sets forth a typology of three different categories of <b>government</b> <b>networks.</b> Part III then seeks to pinpoint the specific accountability concerns associated with each type. Part IV offers one approach to answering some current accountability concerns by adapting the concept of 2 ̆ 2 information agencies 2 ̆ 2 from the European Union to the global level. This analysis rests on a claim of similarity between global <b>government</b> <b>networks</b> and a number of EU governance structures, primarily the 2 ̆ 2 comitology 2 ̆ 2 system and related transgovernmental and public-private networks. Finally, building on the same premise, Part V briefly surveys some of the more fundamental reconceptualizations of democracy and distills various elements of these visions that could be useful in strengthening the democratic pedigree of <b>government</b> <b>networks.</b> It concludes with an appeal to add global legislative networks to the pluralist mix of global governance mechanisms...|$|R
