40|$|Ireland is an {{established}} host country for migrant workers, refugees and asylum seekers {{from around the}} world with a high proportion migrating to the west of Ireland. Such <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> have brought a diverse range of cultural practices and customs to the western region and require a host community that is culturally sensitive to meet their needs. The Western Region Drugs Taskforce (WRDTF) recognises these <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> and thus their role in assessing needs around the prevention and treatment of substance use. This document presents an overview of the <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> in the west of Ireland; selects the largest <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> in the west of Ireland and describes substance use in their countries of origin; explores substance use in Ireland in general and among <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> in Ireland, with a focus on the west of Ireland; and reviews the risk factors for substance use in <b>new</b> <b>communities.</b> The final sections outline the barriers to effective service utilisation and possible service level responses, including recommendations for relevant service provision to and with members of <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> in the west...|$|R

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>communities</b> {{have long}} been celebrated as models for {{increased}} order and quality in {{the process by which}} rural land is brought into urban use and urban land into more intensive use. At the community level, innovations may be more readily tested in <b>new</b> <b>communities</b> rather than in existing settlements. While much attention has been focused upon innovations in technological and social systems, little attention has been given to institutional and financing innovations. Nonetheless, new institutional and financing techniques have been quietly introduced in the development of <b>new</b> <b>communities.</b> The most significant of these innovations address the problem of assuring the acquisition of capital in the improvement of land for public use. Initially, these innovations have been directed at public service facilities usually classified as amenities. However, they may also serve as alternative vehicles for the development of more traditional public services and facilities. This Article will survey several modes of financing the development of <b>new</b> <b>communities.</b> It will examine the relationship between private developers and state and local governments in this development process, and it will also consider the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s role in stabilizing the development process of <b>new</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of gifts to the church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The Palladium cinema {{was opened}} as the Empire in 1913 in a {{building}} which had previously been a brewery.

5|$|After winning {{only three}} of their first 10 matches of 2010–11, Foyle {{resigned}} as manager in September 2010, and was replaced with Tamworth manager Gary Mills the following month. Improving form saw York challenge for the play-offs, and by mid March 2011 they were sixth in the table—one place away from a play-off spot. They won {{only three of}} 10 matches in the run-in and missed out on the play-offs to finish the season in eighth place. York reached the FA Cup third round {{for the second consecutive}} year, and lost 2–0 to Premier League team Bolton Wanderers at the Reebok Stadium. York won three of the opening seven matches in 2011–12 and were only once below a play-off place from early October 2011, finishing the season in fourth place. Playing a passing style of football but producing results when needed, they earned 83 points that season—the second highest in the club's history. York drew 1–1 at home to Mansfield Town in the play-off semi-final first leg and won the second leg 1–0 after extra time at Field Mill. They then beat Newport County 2–0 at Wembley Stadium in the 2012 FA Trophy Final, which {{was the first time the}} club had won a national knockout competition. A week later, they returned to Wembley Stadium for the play-off final, beating Luton Town 2–1, with goals from Ashley Chambers and Matty Blair. The club was promoted to League Two, returning to the Football League after an eight-year absence.

5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A <b>new</b> <b>community</b> center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted to put out the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E

Three blocks from NY48, NY370 splits from NY31. As NY370 heads for downtown Syracuse, NY31 continues east, overlapping NY631 for a short distance before passing through Lysander <b>New</b> <b>Community</b> and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of Clay, NY31 meets NY481 at an interchange in the shadow of the Great Northern Mall. NY31 continues eastward through the town to Cicero, where it meets US11 and I-81 at exit30. As NY31 heads away from I-81, Oneida Lake slowly becomes visible to the north. NY31 comes within a mile (about 1.6km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the Madison County line, here delimited by Chittenango Creek, NY31 enters the western half of Bridgeport and meets the eastern terminus of NY298 near the banks of the creek. NY31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River, Ontario, {{site was}} {{established}} to rehouse the Allied effort at the Montreal Laboratory away from an urban area. A <b>new</b> <b>community</b> was built at Deep River, Ontario, to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, Camp Petawawa. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first {{director of the new}} laboratory was Hans von Halban. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by Bennett Lewis in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as ZEEP (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970. A larger 10MW NRX reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.|$|E

Founded in 1958, the Allied Arts Council of Lethbridge is the largest organization in the city dedicated to preserving and enhancing the local arts. In the spring of 2007, the Allied Arts Council Facilities Steering Committee initiated the Arts Re:Building Together Campaign, a grass roots campaign initiative to raise awareness and support for improving arts facilities in Lethbridge.

5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a <b>new</b> <b>community</b> called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh <b>new</b> <b>community,</b> complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills.

Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it. Then he tries to get on the celling only to fall off and lois catch him then says that he getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs.
