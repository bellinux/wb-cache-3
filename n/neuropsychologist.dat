An informal survey of <b>neuropsychologists</b> interested in the Houston Conference indicates rather different opinions concerning the training and education of <b>neuropsychologists.</b> It is our contention that the results of the Houston Conference can only be considered controversial at best and that there is still much diversity of opinion in the field regarding the proper training of <b>neuropsychologists.</b> We hope to stimulate further discussion and greater involvement of the profession before final criteria for education and training are developed and adopted...|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a newspaper reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian <b>neuropsychologist,</b> Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.|$|E
