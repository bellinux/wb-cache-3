5|$|Carl Joachim Hambro (7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985) was a <b>Norwegian</b> novelist, journalist, essayist, {{translator}} and Romance philologist. The {{son of the}} Conservative politician C. J. Hambro, he {{embarked on}} a philological career, graduating in 1939. During the Second World War he taught at Oslo Commerce School and the <b>Norwegian</b> College in Uppsala. After the war, he taught <b>Norwegian</b> at Sorbonne, whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the <b>Norwegian</b> Broadcasting Corporation and a few <b>Norwegian</b> daily newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1978, the Polar Affairs Department of the <b>Norwegian</b> Ministry of Justice and the Police, {{headquartered}} in Oslo, {{has been assigned}} {{the administration of the}} <b>Norwegian</b> polar areas including Queen Maud Land. Since 1979, the <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute has been a directorate under the Ministry of the Environment.|$|E
50|$|Pakistani <b>Norwegians</b> are <b>Norwegians</b> of Pakistani descent. First {{generation}} Pakistani <b>Norwegians,</b> who {{migrate from}} Pakistan, are {{distinguished from the}} mainstream in several demographic aspects, while second-generation Pakistani <b>Norwegians,</b> who are born in Norway, are well established in Norway and {{have gone on to}} become professionals and politicians. Pakistani <b>Norwegians</b> have strong presence in higher education, media, and politics.|$|R
50|$|The Kola <b>Norwegians</b> were <b>Norwegians</b> {{who settled}} along the {{coastline}} of the Russian Kola Peninsula from approximately 1850 to {{the closure of}} the border in the 1920s. It is estimated that around 1000 <b>Norwegians</b> lived on the Kola peninsula in 1917. The Kola <b>Norwegians</b> were deported to or put in camps in other parts of Russia during the course of World War II.|$|R
25|$|One {{issue that}} has been {{highlighted}} is the hypothesis that many <b>Norwegians</b> viewed Jews as outsiders, whose fate was of no direct concern to <b>Norwegians.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the <b>Norwegian</b> Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the <b>Norwegian</b> Trotting Association split their registration between purebred <b>Norwegian</b> trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the <b>Norwegian</b> or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the <b>Norwegian</b> Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the <b>Norwegian</b> Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{the newly}} created <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute was {{assigned}} the administration of <b>Norwegian</b> territories in the Arctic and Antarctic, including Queen Maud Land. Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but its efforts declined after that. On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to <b>Norwegian</b> sovereignty as a dependency (biland), and the Antarctic Treaty officially came into force on 23 June 1961. <b>Norwegian</b> activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern Weddell Sea by the <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute in 1976–77.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 he {{was awarded}} an honorary degree, doctor philos. honoris causa, at the <b>Norwegian</b> Institute of Technology, later part of <b>Norwegian</b> University of Science and Technology.|$|E
50|$|As {{reflected}} by how the students answer Hans, {{only a fraction}} of <b>Norwegians</b> consider themselves religious or visit the church regularly,even though the majority of <b>Norwegians</b> are members of the state church.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Norwegians</b> {{who fled}} from Harald Fairhair {{must have known}} about the isles before leaving Norway. If Grímr Kamban settled some time before, this could explain the <b>Norwegians</b> knowing about the Faroes.|$|R
50|$|In 1251 the Finnish Karelians again {{fought against}} the <b>Norwegians,</b> and in 1271 the two Finnish peoples, the Kvens and the Karelians, cooperated in wars and battles against the <b>Norwegians</b> in Hålogaland (Haalogaland).|$|R
5|$|In the 20th century, <b>Norwegian</b> {{architecture}} {{has been}} characterized by its connection with <b>Norwegian</b> social policy on the one hand, and innovation on the other. <b>Norwegian</b> architects have been recognized for their work, both within Norway—where architecture has been considered an expression of social policy—and outside Norway, in several innovative projects.|$|E
5|$|Ivar Hippe (born 19 March 1953) is a <b>Norwegian</b> {{political}} consultant, former {{journalist and}} presenter. He received national media attention in 1982 {{when he was}} expelled from Argentina by the government. On his return to Norway he began working for the <b>Norwegian</b> Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). In 1999 he became editor-in-chief of the <b>Norwegian</b> financial journal Økonomisk Rapport.|$|E
5|$|No care or nursing {{services}} and welfare payments are available. <b>Norwegian</b> residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities. The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic, Longyearbyen Hospital. Other public offices with presence on Longyearbyen are the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate of Mining, the <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute, the <b>Norwegian</b> Tax Administration and the Church of Norway. Longyearbyen is subordinate Nord-Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal, both located in Tromsø.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997 Brundtland was {{a member}} of Those <b>Norwegians</b> with Rune Lindbæk and Ole D Mjøs. Releases: Kaminzky Park album + singles on Paper. The current version of Those <b>Norwegians</b> does not include Torbjørn.|$|R
50|$|Historians have {{understood}} {{since the time}} of the Færeyinga saga that the Viking Grímur Kamban was the first settler in the Faroes. The <b>Norwegians</b> must have known about the isles before leaving Norway. If Grímur Kamban had settled some time earlier, this could explain the <b>Norwegians</b> knowing about them. Another, more logical explanation might be that the <b>Norwegians</b> came to know about the islands by the Gaels of Scotland and Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Norwegians</b> {{arrived in}} the Dakotas as early as 1859, shortly after the treaty with the Yankton Sioux was signed July 10, 1859. It took another ten years before the greater influx of <b>Norwegians</b> took place.|$|R
5|$|Norway was {{prior to}} 1920 {{extremely}} active in gaining {{international support for}} <b>Norwegian</b> sovereignty, but following the treaty, <b>Norwegian</b> interest in the archipelago dwindled. From {{the start of the}} Cold War, <b>Norwegian</b> politicians wanted to avoid bringing the islands into superpower politics. This resulted in a policy of avoiding agitating the Soviet Union, which again resulted in the <b>Norwegian</b> authorities actively working against both <b>Norwegian</b> and foreign activities on Svalbard which could raise tensions. Compared to mainland relations, which were dominated by deterring through NATO membership, the <b>Norwegian</b> policy on Svalbard was related to calming the Soviet Union. Similarly, while a foreign presence was encouraged on the mainland, it was strongly discouraged on Svalbard.|$|E

5|$|Since 5 May 1995, <b>Norwegian</b> law has {{required}} all <b>Norwegian</b> activity in Antarctica to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. <b>Norwegian</b> citizens who plan activities in Queen Maud Land must therefore {{report to the}} <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute, which may prohibit any non-compliant activity. Those who visit Queen Maud Land must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.|$|E
50|$|Jørgensen invited fellow <b>Norwegians</b> {{to form a}} Chamber of Commerce in January 1906, and the {{founding}} meeting was held in London the following April. 21 <b>Norwegians</b> attended, and Thode Fagelund was named {{the first president of}} the NBCC.|$|R

50|$|The {{taxation}} {{levels in}} Cyprus are considerably {{lower than in}} Norway, and Cyprus has actively courted <b>Norwegians</b> to move to Cyprus. Among the <b>Norwegians</b> who moved to Cyprus is the shipping billionaire John Fredriksen, who was {{the richest man in}} Norway.|$|R
5|$|Since 5 May 1995, <b>Norwegian</b> law has {{required}} all <b>Norwegian</b> activity in Antarctica, including Peter I Island, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All <b>Norwegian</b> citizens who plan activities on Peter I Island must therefore {{report to the}} <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute, who may deny any non-conforming activity. All people visiting the island must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|The Commissioner of Mining for Svalbard {{is part of}} the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate of Mining, but {{retains its}} own offices in Longyearbyen. The {{commissioner}} is responsible for administrating mineral rights, both for mining and petroleum. Other public agencies which have supervisory roles, but are not stationed on Svalbard, are the <b>Norwegian</b> Labour Inspection Authority, the <b>Norwegian</b> Petroleum Directorate, the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention and the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate for Product and Electrical Safety.|$|E
5|$|The German {{influence}} {{brought into}} Norway by neo-classicism abated when Norway gained full independence in 1905. A {{new generation of}} <b>Norwegian</b> architects educated in Sweden {{took the lead in}} developing a distinctly national architecture, endeavouring to break the German historicist tradition. However, German modernism and town planning continued to influence early 20th-century architecture. As the <b>Norwegian</b> Institute of Technology was founded in 1910 and began to teach architecture in Trondheim, there also emerged a distinctly <b>Norwegian</b> collegium of architects that has contributed to a <b>Norwegian</b> regional architecture, discussed by the art historian Sigfried Giedeon.|$|E
40|$|This article {{compares the}} labour market {{situation}} of graduates with {{different types of}} international background. The authors look at four groups of graduates: immigrants and ethnic <b>Norwegians</b> graduated in Norway and immigrants and ethnic <b>Norwegians</b> graduated abroad. By employing multinomial logistic regression analyses the authors find that ethnic <b>Norwegians</b> educated abroad face {{a higher risk of}} labour market mis-match in terms of unemployment and overqualification than <b>Norwegians</b> graduated domestically. Non-Western immigrants had an even higher risk of unemployment and skills mismatch, regardless of the origin of their education. The results indicate that education from abroad is not fully transferable to a domestic labour market and, in addition, that forms of discrimination against non-Western immigrants exist...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 10,262 <b>Norwegians</b> {{lost their lives}} either during the war or while they were imprisoned.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the national park and the protection {{is based on the}} Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which takes its mandate from the requirements in the Svalbard Treaty to protect the environment of the archipelago. The overall responsibility for protection lies with the <b>Norwegian</b> Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated management to the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of Svalbard. The latter performs all day-to-day practical management, including registration and inspection. In aspects related to cultural heritage, the Governor reports to the <b>Norwegian</b> Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and in issues relating to pollution, to the <b>Norwegian</b> Pollution Control Authority. While it has no authority, the <b>Norwegian</b> Polar Institute performs monitoring, mapping and research.|$|E
5|$|The {{operating}} deficits {{are covered}} through subsidies by the <b>Norwegian</b> Ministry of Transport and Communications.

Rolling stock maintenance is performed by NSB-owned Mantena.|$|E
5|$|Trade from Norway to Sweden was limited, mostly due to {{the limited}} infrastructure. <b>Norwegian</b> trades argued that a railway would allow for the export of <b>Norwegian</b> fish to Sweden.|$|E
5000|$|Early <b>Norwegians,</b> {{like all}} of the people of Scandinavia, were adherents of Norse paganism; the Sámi having a shamanistic religion.
