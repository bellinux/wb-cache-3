After {{the release of}} the film in June 1941, Columbia allowed the release of two more Medico films, Thunder Over the Prairie (July 1941) and Prairie Stranger (September 1941). Starrett, who went on to star in around sixty other western flicks, found The Medico of Painted Springs to be his favorite film. The film has many <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> from Rubel's original work.|$|E
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant (Anairetes parulus) is {{a species}} of bird in the tyrant flycatcher family Tyrannidae. This species is found in western South America; its range {{stretches}} from southern Colombia south along the Andes mountains to Tierra del Fuego. It prefers to live in upper montane forests and shrublands; however, it is a habitat generalist {{and can be found}} across a wide range of ecosystems. The tufted tit-tyrant has three subspecies, including the nominate subspecies Anairetes parulus parulus, A. p. aequatorialis, and A. p. patagonicus, and is very closely related to the Juan Fernández tit-tyrant. It is very small with a distinctive and conspicuous crest. The bird's head is black overall with white supraloral and postocular stripes. Its dull grayish-brown back contrasts with its white throat and breast that are covered with black streaks and pale, unmarked yellow underbelly. There are few <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> in plumage between the subspecies. It is a vocal flycatcher with a broad repertoire of songs.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> {{between the}} high- and {{low-temperature}} fumaroles; the latter tend to emit far more water than carbon dioxide. The fumaroles also release carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, and smaller amounts of helium. Hydrocarbons and {{other organic compounds}} are {{also found in the}} low-temperature fumaroles. Trace elements include arsenic, boron and titanium, with smaller amounts of barium, chromium, copper, lead, strontium and zinc. Sulfur is released from areas all over the cone, resulting in a noticeable sulfur smell.|$|E

The only <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> between the black-footed ferret and the steppe polecat are the former's much shorter and coarser fur, larger ears, and longer postmolar extension of the palate.|$|E
25|$|Many Occitan {{linguists}} and writers, {{particularly those}} {{involved with the}} pan-Occitan movement centred on the Institut d'Estudis Occitans, disagree with the view that Occitan is a family of languages and think that Limousin, Auvergnat, Languedocien, Gascon, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine are dialects of a single language. Although there are indeed <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> between these varieties, {{there is a very}} high degree of mutual intelligibility between them; they also share a common literary history, and in academic and literary circles, have been identified as a collective linguistic entitythe for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Cabernet Franc shares many of {{the same}} {{phenolic}} and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences.</b> Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.|$|E

25|$|Coteaux du Layon Villages AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du Layon AOC, this wine region covers six communes {{along the}} Layon river that have {{historically}} produced wines of high quality. The six communes are Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, there are <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> among the wines produced by each commune (all made from Chenin blanc) with the wines of Beaulieu-sur-Layon being characterized by their light aromas; Faye-d'Anjou wines having a distinctive brushwood aroma; Rablay-sur-Layon wines {{tend to be}} the most bold and round; the wines of Rochefort-sur-Loire tend to be full bodied and have the most aging potential; Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné wines are characterized by their delicate aromas that develop over time and the wines of Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay often have very round mouthfeel and robust flavors.|$|E

The video footage {{is made up}} of the audio from the Dallas show and video from both the Houston and Dallas shows; because of this the band had to wear the same clothes on two shows, {{although}} there are still <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences.</b> For example, {{it can be seen that}} Mike Shinoda wears two similar but different shirts, Brad Delson's guitar sometimes changes multiple times in the middle of songs from a red PRS to a black Ibanez, Dave Farrell's basses change a few times as well in the middle of songs, as well as lead singer Chester Bennington's shirt soaked with sweat, and it being completely dry the next time he is shown on screen.|$|E
25|$|The University of California reopened {{the stadium}} on September 1, 2012, {{for a home}} {{football}} game against the University of Nevada. This was the first football game in Berkeley {{since the end of}} the 2010 season. The sellout crowd of 63,186 watched the Nevada Wolf Pack spoil the grand re-opening with a 31-24 victory, Cal's first loss to Nevada at home since before the original stadium opened in 1923. There are many <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> between the new, more modern stadium and the old stadium that closed in 2010. The entire west side of the stadium was demolished (except for the historic façade), allowing the university to make the venue seismically safe, and add modern amenities. The east side, however, has remained relatively unchanged. The stadium was originally dedicated to the memory of those Californians that were lost in World War I, and on October 6, 2012, the university rededicated California Memorial Stadium in the memory of all Californians who sacrificed their lives in service to the nation.|$|E

25|$|On September 15, 2012, WPVI-TV {{took over}} {{production}} of MyNetworkTV affiliate WPHL-TV (channel 17)'s 10 p.m. newscast from NBC-owned WCAU (which began producing the 10 p.m. newscast in December 2005, after WPHL shut down its own in-house news department). The newscast, Action News at 10pm on PHL 17, respectively utilizes {{most of the}} same anchors as WPVI's weekday 4 p.m. and weekend evening newscasts with a few <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences.</b> Features anchor Alicia Vitarelli does not appear on the weeknight broadcasts, while Sports Director Ducis Rogers and weekend sports anchor Jeff Skversky join their respective anchor teams. Meteorologist Melissa Magee replaces Adam Joseph for the weekend editions. Additionally, while weeknight anchors Brian Taff and Sharrie Williams operate from the same desk used for the 4 p.m. broadcast, weekend anchors Walter Perez and Sarah Bloomquist (who also anchors the Noon edition alongside Rick Williams) operate from the main desk as they carry over to anchor 11 p.m.-midnight on WPVI. Bloomquist only anchors with Perez on the Sunday edition of the newscast. With this, WPVI became the third ABC owned-and-operated station {{to be involved in}} a news share agreement, after KGO-TV in San Francisco (which produces a 9 p.m. newscast for independent station KOFY-TV) and WTVD in Raleigh (which produces a 10 p.m. newscast for CW affiliate WLFL), and was later joined in 2014 by KABC-TV in Los Angeles (which produces a 7 p.m. newscast for independent station KDOC-TV). On September 15, 2014, the newscast was expanded to a full hour-long broadcast, making WPHL the second station in the Philadelphia area (along with competitor WTXF) to carry an hour-long newscast at 10 p.m. Only competitor WPSG carries a 1/2 hour long newscast, Eyewitness News at 10 on The CW Philly (operated by sister station KYW).|$|E

500|$|One of the <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> from Music Box and Carey's {{previous}} albums is its sound. The {{album was}} described by Afanasieff as a softer and more pop-oriented album, [...] "filling the songs with air", and allowing far more space in the overall sound. Another noticeable change is in the album's production. When Mariah Carey was released, critics took notice of its [...] "overly produced" [...] and [...] "studio perfect" [...] quality, where in comparison, Emotions maintains a [...] "raw, live sound." [...] Music Box however, falls in between the two, a decision made by Carey during the album's production. She would layer each track with live backing vocals, so not to sound too overly produced, but still kept the inclusion of musical synthesizers.|$|E

500|$|Genetic {{research}} has shown that Carménère may be distantly related to Merlot and the similarities in appearance have linked the two vines for centuries. Despite the similarities, there are some <b>noticeable</b> <b>differences</b> that aid the ampelographer in identifying the two vines. When young, Carménère leaves have a reddish hue underneath, while the leaves of Merlot are white. There are also slight differences in leaf shape with the central lobe of Merlot leaves being longer. Merlot ripens two to three weeks earlier than Carménère. In cases where the vineyards are interspersed with both varieties, the time of harvest is paramount in determining the character of the resulting blends. If Merlot grapes are picked when Carménère is fully ripe, they will be overripe and impart a [...] "jammy" [...] character. If the grapes are picked earlier when only the Merlot grapes have reached ripeness, the Carménère will have an aggressive green pepper flavor.|$|E
