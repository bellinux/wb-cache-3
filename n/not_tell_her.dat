Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit.
