40|$|Maxillary {{hypoplasia}} is {{a common}} developmental problem in cleft lip and palate deformities. These deformities have traditionally been corrected by means of orthognathic surgery. Management of skeletal deformities in the maxillofacial region has been a challenge for maxillofacial surgeons and orthodontists. Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a surgical technique that uses body′s own repairing mechanisms for optimal reconstruction of the hard and soft tissues. We present four cases of anterior maxillary distraction osteogenesis with tooth-borne distraction device— Hyrax, which were analyzed retrospectively using cephalometrics. Changes in nasolabial angle and interincisal angle after distraction of anterior maxillary segment were studied to conclude that there was <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in the the nasolabial angle while the interincisal angle showed marked improvement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Depending on the {{oxidation}} {{extent and}} the surface roughness after coating manufacturing, CoNiCrAlY coating displays different performance in thermal barrier coating systems. In this study, plasma-sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were treated by dry-ice blasting. Various treatment approaches of dry-ice blasting were assessed by means of comparing the coating quality in terms of cross-sectional structure, oxide concentration, surface morphology and roughness, and microhardness. The results showed that CoNiCrAlY coating including decreased oxides and smoother internal texture can be obtained in comparison with that deposited by conventional APS, no matter what type of treatment. The oxidation content differs after using different jet angle and installation location of dry-ice blasting. To some extent, dry-ice blasting has some cleaning effect on those splashed particles. However, <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> can be recognized in the top-surface morphology and surface roughness, because of the relatively small hardness of dry-ice pellets. There is a slight decrease in hardness probably resulting from the decrease in the oxide...|$|E
40|$|Educational {{data mining}} {{is in the}} habit of learn the data {{available}} in the field of education and show up the hidden knowledge from it. Classification methods like decision trees, machine learning, rule mining, etc can be applied on the educational data for forecasting the student’s behavior, performance of them in examination etc. This prediction will well helpful for tutors to classify the weak students and help them to score improved marks. The classification approach is applied on student’s internal assessment data to predict their performance in the final exam. The result of the classification categorized {{the number of students who}} are to be expected to fail or pass. The outcome result is given to the tutor and steps were taken to improve the performance of the students who were predicted as fail in the examination. After the statement of the results in the final examination the marks acquired by the students are provide into the system and the results were investigated. The proportional analysis results states that the prediction has helped the weaker students to improve and brought out betterment in the result. The algorithm is also analyzed by duplicating the same data and the result of the duplication brings <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> in predicting the student’s outcome. The goal of this survey is presented the several data mining techniques in determining of student failure. This article provides a review of the available literature on Educational Data mining, Classification method and different feature selection techniques that we should apply on Student dataset...|$|E

The emergence of new application such as real-time applications with more sensitivity and odd behavior required fundamental change in resource sharing policy. The delay which caused by congestion could sensationally demolish all the aspiration for delivering such sensitive application with respect to its restrictions. Scheduling mechanism plays an essential and crucial part of this function since queuing delay is the largest delay which experienced by the packet. Therefore, this paper is looking at the evolution of scheduling mechanism in the academic environment. We present the development in top-down approach form the last proposal to the very beginning. Although such approach provides a comprehensive knowledge, intensive information and rigorous tracking of the evolution of scheduling mechanism, the results shows that there is <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>changes</b> in the principle of the scheduling except for most recent scheduler named as Just Queuing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Some of {{the truck}} {{producer}} involved in production of municipal-service vehicles make some modifications in the main chassis and permit overloading on it. With doing these modifications some special instructions must be considered such as: decreasing speed, strengthening the springs and chassis beams, and so on. Hence chassis vibrational behavior will change the dynamic behavior of automobile effectively, adding auxiliary chassis is an alternative trend to change the rigidity. But, the main question that must be answered is: Are natural frequencies of the modified chassis in suitable range? So, this paper investigates the vibrational characteristics of the chassis before and after strengthening. For this purpose, the modal analysis has been accomplished by the commercial finite element packaged ANSYS and natural frequencies and mode shapes have been determined. In addition, the relationship between natural frequencies and engine operating speed has been explained and, finally advantages of the modified chassis {{which leads to the}} increase of the rigidity with <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>changes</b> in natural frequencies, has been discussed. The results show that the road excitation is the main disturbance to the truck chassis as the chassis natural frequencies lie within the road excitation frequency range...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hypercholesterolemia is the {{accepted}} causal {{risk factor for}} atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). 2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of cholesterol advised to tailor high-intensity statin for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, its impact of real clinical practice has not been examined in China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 3592 patients with CAD were consecutively enrolled who were receiving statins in outpatient department (at least 4  weeks) before they were admitted to the ward at five University hospitals from April 2011 to December 2015. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to the admission time before (group A, n =  1521) or after (group B, n =  2071) online announcement date of 2013 ACC/AHA guideline. The situation of statin application and LDL-C target achievement (LDL-C <  1. 8  mmol/L) in both groups were compared. Results: Data indicated that the constituent ratio of different kinds of statins usage was significantly different between the two groups (p <  0. 05), and the proportion of rosuvastatin application grew up in group B (20. 00 %) when compared with group A (10. 50 %, p <  0. 05). However, the mean dosage of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin had no significant change. More importantly, the achievement of LDL-C target in both groups was still extremely low (27. 9 % in group A vs. 26. 9 % in group B, p =  0. 5077). Conclusion: <b>No</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> of clinical practice with regard to cholesterol management was found in Chinese patients with CAD, accompanied by very low achievement of LDL-C target, suggesting that there is a great room for the improvement of cholesterol control in Chinese patients with CAD...|$|E
40|$|Using Wistar-strain male rats, {{weight and}} histochemical {{changes of the}} prostatic gland, testicles, seminal vesicle and adrenal glands were {{examined}} after extirpation of each endocrine organ (pituitay, adrenals and testicles) and administistion of various hormones. It was found that stainability is well coincided with the sexual functions. 1) The lateral portion of the dorsolateral lobe of the prostati c gland well represented sexual functions and showed the best stainability. The histochemical activities of ACP, RNA, Zn, and SD run parallel with prostatic functions but activity of ALP showed a reverse relationship. 2) Stainability of ALP, ACP and RNA in seminal tubulus of the testicle represented its spermatogenetic function. 3) In seminal v esicle, to which SD stain was only attempted, strong activity was demonstrated in epithelium of which stainability yielded to be concured with that of prostatic gland. 4) In adrenal cortex stainabilities of Sudan III and 17 KS generally coincided with its functions. 5) With the days elapsed after hypophysectomy, weight and histochemical activities of the testicles and adnexal organs were decreased, especially in the prostatic gland which showed marked hypofunction after 4 th weeks from the operation. Administration of Tp following hypophysectomy resulted a marked increase in weight of the adnexal organs and slight recovery of testicular spermatogenic function. Administration of Eb following hypophysectomy did not show decrease in weight of the testicle and adnexal organs but decrease in histochemical activities. 6) With administration of anterior pituitary hormones to normal rats, effects on testicles and adnexal organs were recognized {{in the following order}} of PMS, HCG, hypophorin, prolactin and controls. Adrenal functions were accerelated in every instances. 7) With adrenalectomy, the testicles and adnexal organs showed decrease s in both their weight and function, which were failed to be corrected by administration of cortisone. With administration of large doses of cortisone, these suppressive effects occurred more rapidly and predominantly. ACTH administration resulted marked increases in weight of the testicles and adnexal organs with a little accerelation of their functions. Combination therapy with cortisone and sexual hormones gave more pronounced effects of the sexual hormones on the testicles and adnexal organs, of which effects yielded to be suppressed by cortisone. 8) With ca s tration, decreases in both of weight and function of the prostatic gland and seminal vesicles were demonstrated, while no significant change was seen in the adrenal glands. With large doses of Tp after castration, unexpectedly slight increase was only observed in weight of the prostatic gland. With Eb, <b>no</b> <b>much</b> <b>change</b> was also demonstrated in its weight and function. 9) With administration of large dose of Tp, 0. 5 mg per day, to normal rats, weight and functions showed increases in the prostatic gland, decreases in the testicles and slight decrease in the adrenal glands. With administration of Eb, 0. 02 mg per day, to normal rats, weight and functions showed decreases in the testicles and adnexal organs and increase in the adrenal glands...|$|E
