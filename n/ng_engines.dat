40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the reasons behind}} Natural Gas (<b>NG)</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading on LNG fuelled vessels. Two instances of <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading due to low tank pressure have been document on KV Bergen in the Norwegian Coast Guard. Results from this study revealed that <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading {{was caused by the}} disruption of the liquid surface layer in the LNG tank initiated by tank sloshing. Research found that when the surface layer between the bulk liquid and vapor in the tank was modified by sloshing the rate of vapor condensation increased faster than the mass flow rate produced by the Pressure Build Up (PBU) circuit inside the Vaporizer. Using the difference between the mass flow rate entering the vapor region and exiting through condensation, the time which a <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading situation occurs was predicted. These conclusions were drawn from different models and calculations which analyzed factors affecting tank pressure. One model calculated the PBU mass flow rate by balancing the change in pressure in each section of the PBU. Another model developed an idealized set of equations for the time required to pressurize the LNG tank. A mixing model was also produced which calculated the lowest fall in tank pressure possible if the liquid in the tank mixed completely with the vapor in the tank. These mixing calculations proved the criteria for <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading can be met if there is enough interaction between the liquid and vapor in the tank. A measurement campaign was carried out to understand how the different sub-components of the LNG system (LNG tank, PBU, Evaporator, and water glycol circuit) behaved during normal operations. The goal of the measurement campaign was to find real values which may be used to predict the conditions leading to <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading. Using a heat balance from the different streams entering and leaving the Vaporizer, the average mass flow rate through the PBU circuit was determined to be 0. 16 kg/s. This vapor mass flow rate is an indication of the PBU s ability to build up the tank pressure. The time required to build up the tank pressure from 295 kPa to 495 kPa was measured to be approximately 18 minutes on MF Korsfjord the morning after bunkering. The calculated and measured results were combined to draw conclusions about the main factors leading to gas engine de-loading. By comparing the idealized and actual amount of time required to pressurize the tank, it was possible to estimate that 66. 2 % of the vapor mass flow from the PBU condensed while the tank was being pressurized. Using the rate of vapor condensation, it was possible to calculate that the thickness of an effective conduction layer, representative of the surface layer, is 1. 71 mm in undisturbed conditions. The thickness of an undisturbed tank was used as a base case to examine how modifying the thickness of the surface layer and area of the vapor liquid interface changes the rate of vapor condensation. In situations where the vapor condensation exceeded the PBU mass flow rate, the difference was used to calculate how quickly the tank pressure fell. This report also includes items for further research which would provide additional understanding of the factors leading to <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> de-loading. Included is a detailed description of an experimental rig which may be used to find the relationship between disturbances occurring outside the tank and sloshing happening inside. Different abatement technologies are also discussed to improve the reliability of LNG systems on LNG fueled vessels...|$|R

40|$|High EGR rates {{combined}} with turbocharging {{has been identified}} as a promising way to increase the maximum load and efficiency of heavy duty spark ignition Natural Gas engines. With stoichiometric conditions a three way catalyst can be used which means that regulated emissions can be kept at very low levels. Most of the heavy duty <b>NG</b> <b>engines</b> are diesel engines which are converted for SI operation. These engine’s components are in common with the diesel-engine which put limits on higher exhaust gas temperature. The engines have lower maximum load level than the corresponding diesel engines. This is mainly due to the lower density of NG, lower compression ratio and limits on knocking and also high exhaust gas temperature. They also have lower efficiency due to mainly the lower compression ratio and the throttling losses. However performing some modifications on the engines such as redesigning the engine’s piston in a way to achieve higher compression ratio and more turbulence, modifying EGR system and optimizing the turbocharging system will result in improving the overall efficiency and the maximum load limit of the engine. This paper presents the detailed information about the engine modifications which result in improving the overall efficiency and extending the maximum load of the engine. Control-related problems associated with the higher loads are also identified and appropriate solutions are suggested...|$|E

However, turbolag reduction is necessary to achieve high performance during engine transient operations and to improve vehicle fun-to-drive characteristics. Significant support {{for the study of}} turbocharged Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) engines and guidelines for the turbo-matching process can be provided by 1 -D numerical simulation tools. However, 1 -D models are predictive only when a careful tuning procedure is set-up and carried out {{on the basis of the}} experimental data. In this paper, a 1 -D model of a Heavy-Duty (HD) turbocharged CNG engine was set up in the GT-POWER (Gamma Technologies Inc., Westmont, IL, US) environment to simulate transient operations and to evaluate the turbolag. An extensive experimental activity was carried out to provide experimental data for model tuning. The model buildup and tuning processes are described in detail with specific reference to the turbocharger model, whose correct calibration is a key factor in accounting for the effects of turbine flow pulsations. The second part of the paper focuses on the evaluation of different strategies for turbolag reduction, namely, exhaust valve variable actuation and spark timing control. Such strategies were aimed at increasing the engine exhaust-gas power transferred to the turbine, thus reducing the time required to accelerate the turbocharger group. The effects of these strategies were examined for tip-in maneuvers at a fixed engine speed. Depending on the engine speed and the applied turbolag reduction strategy, turbolag reductions from 70 % to 10 % were achieve...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of six 32 {{passenger}} transit buses {{were characterized}} {{using one of}} the West Virginia University (WVU) Transportable Heavy Duty Emissions Testing Laboratories, and the fixed base chassis dynamometer at the Colorado Institute for Fuels and High Altitude Engine Research (CIFHAER). Three of the buses were powered with 1997 ISB 5. 9 liter Cummins diesel engines, and three were powered with the 1997 5. 9 liter Cummins natural gas (NG) counterpart. The <b>NG</b> <b>engines</b> were LEV certified. Objectives were to contrast the emissions performance of the diesel and NG units, and to compare results from the two laboratories. Both laboratories found that oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter (PM) emissions were substantially lower for the natural gas buses than for the diesel buses. It was observed that by varying the rapidity of pedal movement during accelerations in the Central Business District cycle (CBD), CO and PM emissions from the diesel buses could be varied by a factor of three or more. The driving styles may be characterized as aggressive and non-aggressive, but both styles followed the CBD speed command acceptably. PM emissions were far higher for the aggressive driving style. For the NG fueled vehicles driving style had a similar, although smaller, effect on NO{sub x}. It is evident that driver habits may cause substantial deviation in emissions for the CBD cycle. When the CO emissions are used as a surrogate for driver aggression, a regression analysis shows that NO{sub x} and PM emissions from the two laboratories agree closely for equivalent driving style. Implications of driver habit for emissions inventories and regulations are briefly considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} efficiency of three way catalytic converters is mainly {{defined by the}} emperature range wherein they are operating. Traditionally, ignition retard {{has been used to}} reduce the light-off time of the catalyst. This is however associated with a fuel penalty. With increasing vehicle electrification, electrically heating facilities present an alternative, especially for hybrid vehicles. Nevertheless, system complexity of hybrid vehicles prevents engineers to evaluate possible heating technologies and their corresponding fuel penalty with respect to traditional solutions. This paper evaluates the application of an electrically heated catalyst on a hybrid vehicle equipped with a Natural Gas (<b>NG)</b> <b>engine.</b> The effect of heating power on light-off time and fuel penalty is determined, using analysis techniques emerging from integrated powertrain control. By means of a case study, the importance of an integral approach is explained by comparing the fuel penalty and {{conversion efficiency}} improvement of electric heating with that of ignition retard.

40|$|There is {{a global}} effort to expand the use of {{alternative}} fuels due to their several benefits such as improving air quality with reducing some criteria emissions, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. This dissertation is focused on investigating the impact of two popular alternative fuels, biodiesel and natural gas (NG), on emissions from heavy-duty engines. Biodiesel {{is one of the}} most popular renewable fuels with diesel applications. Although biodiesel blends are reported to reduce particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and total hydrocarbon emissions; there is uncertainty on their impact on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. This dissertation evaluated the effect of biodiesel feedstock, biodiesel blend level, engine technology, and driving conditions on NOx emissions. The results showed that NOx emissions increase with 20 % and higher biodiesel blends. Also, in this study some strategies were proposed and some fuel formulations were found for mitigating NOx emissions increases with biodiesel. The impact of 5 % biodiesel on criteria emissions specifically NOx was also fully studied in this thesis. As a part of the results of this study, 5 % animal-based biodiesel was certified for use in California based on California Air Resources Board emissions equivalent procedure. NG {{is one of the most}} prominent alternative fuels with larger reserves compared to crude oil. However, the quality of NG depends on both its source and the degree to which it is processed. The current study explored the impact of various NG fuels, ranging from low methane/high energy gases to high methane/low energy gases, on criteria and toxic emissions from <b>NG</b> <b>engines</b> with different combustion and aftertreatment technologies. The results showed stronger fuel effects for the lean-burn technology bus. Finally, this thesis investigated the impact of changing diesel fuel composition on the criteria emissions from a variety of heavy-duty engine technologies. Emissions from an average diesel fuel used throughout the U. S. were compared with a 10 % aromatic, ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel used in California with more stringent air quality regulations. The results showed that the emerging aftertreatment technologies eventually eliminate the benefits of the lower aromatic content/higher cetane number diesel fuels...|$|E
40|$|Heavy duty on-road {{vehicles}} represent one of {{the largest}} sources of NOx emissions and fuel consumption in North America. Heavy duty vehicles are predominantly fueled with diesel, with the recent interest in natural gas (NG) systems. As emissions and greenhouse gas regulations continue to tighten new opportunities for advanced fleet specific heavy duty vehicles are becoming available with improved fuel economy. NOx emissions have dropped 90 % for heavy duty vehicles with the recent 2010 certification limit. Additional NOx reductions of another 90 % are desired for the South Coast Air basin to meet its 2023 NOx inventory requirements and the California optional low NOx standard in 2015. One of the difficulties in quantifying NOx emissions at the levels proposed in this research (90 % of the 2010 certification level ~ 0. 02 g/bhp-hr) is the measurement methods are approaching their detection limit to sufficiently quantify NOx emissions. Three upgraded NOx measurement methods were considered which include a raw NOx measurement integrated with real time exhaust flow, a real-time ambient correction approach, and a trace level ambient analyzer for accurate bag analysis. In summary the improved methods varied in their success where the raw sampling approach showed to be the most accurate and precise over the rage of conditions tested. The ISL G NZ 8. 9 liter <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> met and exceeded the target NOx emissions of 0. 02 g/bhp-hr. This engine significantly reduced 97 %- 100 % of NOx emissions compared with previous ISL G 8. 9 engines.

It is expected NG vehicles could {{play a role in the}} reduction of the south coast NOx inventory problem given their near zero emission factors demonstrated...|$|R

The energy policy of Sapienza University of Rome is focused on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in order to contribute to a transition as a complete redesign of the whole energy system toward a distributed energy generation, an integration of energy sources, a design of smart new grids including storage strategies. The author, energy manager of Sapienza, starts from a local scale, i. e. the Sapienza Lab for Smart Energy Systems within the Distributed Generation framework at different scales, to elaborate a foreseeable scaling-up process so that to spread the research activities outcomes as best practices.

40|$|Natural-gas (NG), spark {{ignition}} (SI) engines have widespread application {{in the power}} generation and upstream oil and gas industries. The manufacturers of these engines are being challenged to meet increasingly stringent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission regulations without sacrificing fuel conversion efficiency. SI engines may be operated with air 2 ̆ 013 fuel mixtures lean of stoichiometric to achieve higher thermal efficiency and to reduce NOx emissions. Compared with new combustion strategies such as homogeneous charge compression ignition, however, lean SI combustion suffers from a somewhat limited tolerability to mixture dilution and high cyclic variations. Alternatively, NOx emissions may be reduced by using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to dilute a stoichiometric air 2 ̆ 013 fuel mixture. This paper investigates the application of reformer gas (RG) to enable a higher mixture dilution of an <b>NG</b> SI <b>engine</b> using EGR. It was found that RG enrichment allows {{an increase in the}} EGR dilution of a stoichiometric NG 2 ̆ 013 air mixture from 12 per cent to more than 35 per cent. The optimal level of RG enrichment directly compensates for the combustion phasing retardation effect of EGR. Increasing the RG fraction in the mixture beyond the optimal value adversely affected the combustion process and fuel conversion efficiency. The experimental data suggest that NOx emissions comparable with the forthcoming 2010 US Environmental Protection Agency heavy-duty diesel engine regulations may be achieved using EGR, RG enrichment, and a three-way catalytic converter (TWC). An energy balance showed that there is the potential to increase the overall system fuel conversion efficiency slightly owing to a more optimized combustion process after taking into account the energy losses associated with fuel reforming. The approach of EGR, fuel reforming, and a TWC is suitable for retrofits because it can be accomplished without modifying the engine geometry. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{transportation}} {{sector is}} becoming increasingly linked to environmental problems, with a technology relying heavily on the exploitation of not renewable energies: the combustion of hydrocarbons in internal combustion engine (ICE). Since this is still {{expected to be the}} main technical solution to fulfil the mobility demand, more secure and sustainable fuel sources are needed. Natural gas (NG), which is composed primarily of methane, is {{regarded as one of the}} most promising alternative fuels because of its interesting chemical properties with high H/C ratio and high research octane number. The use of NG allows the reduction of pollutant emissions, while the gap in performance with respect to gasoline engines can be recovered by means of turbocharging devices. <b>NG</b> <b>engine</b> performance can be further improved by adopting a direct injection (DI) concept that can also extend the fuel-lean operating limit of normal engine operation, compared to port fuel injection. Within this framework a research activity was carried out at the Politecnico di Torino within the InGAS Collaborative Project (VII FP), Sub-project A 2, dealing with the development of a turbo DI CNG engine, optimized for mono-fuel CNG operation. The present thesis focuses on the development of a methodology for the numerical simulation (by means of 3 D CFD) of the CNG direct injection process, in view of its application to internal combustion engines, and on the analysis of the physical processes related to the jet formation and development and the formation of the air-fuel mixture. The results of the numerical analysis are then correlated with the outcomes of an experimental activity performed on the developed multi-cylinder engine and on an optical access single-cylinder engine, in order to obtain more detailed knowledge of the DI CNG engine behaviour. The thesis is divided into six chapters. After a short introduction related to the transportation sector environmental impact (Chapter 1, section 1. 1) an overview of the CNG Vehicle technology (section 1. 2) is presented. The results achieved during the InGAS CP (SP A 2) are summarized in section 1. 3. Chapter 2 focuses on the development of the numerical model for CNG direct injection simulation in an engine combustion chamber. Firstly the theoretical background of supersonic underexpanded jets is summarized (section 2. 1), followed by a literary review of previous investigations regarding the numerical simulation of gaseous direct injection in internal combustion engines (section 2. 2). In section 2. 3, the test case of a two-dimensional compressible flow issuing from a nozzle is examined to characterize the underexpanded-jet phenomenon independently from any geometrical constraint, imposed by the specific application. The main guidelines drawn in this preliminary study are then applied to the development of the finite volume numerical model of the engine, that is thoroughly described in section 2. 4. Chapter 3 is devoted to the validation of the numerical model. Section 3. 1 describes the planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique, employed for the experimental investigation of the mixture formation process in the optical access SCE, whose setup is presented in section 3. 2. Finally the post-processed results of the PLIF experiments are used to validate the developed numerical model in section 3. 3. A comprehensive analysis of the mixture formation process in the InGAS DI-CNG engine is discussed in Chapter 4, with reference to relevant operation conditions and injection strategies. The homogeneous operation at partial and full load is analyzed in section 4. 1 and 4. 2 respectively. The lean stratified operation at partial load is studied in section 4. 3. Chapter 5 is related to the injection system development and focuses on the optimization of the control phase of the InGAS injector, paying specific attention to its behavior at small injected-fuel amounts. The development of a CFD model of the actual injector geometry is described and the dynamic behaviour of the injector is analyzed. Finally, Chapter 6 draws the main conclusions of this stud...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the fast}} {{development}} of {{the internal combustion engine}} technologies together with the day by day more stringent issues raised by the environmental concerns, there is a strong demand for an improvement in combustion efficiency as well as in terms of pollutant emissions to the environment. Alternative fuels such as natural gas has been taken into account and applied on the commercial vehicles. Natural gas is primarily composed of methane and has several alternative features such as a high number of hydrogen to carbon ratio and high research octane number, which means it is possible to give higher boost to the fuel air mixture with less risk to have knock phenomenon. On the other hand, variable valve actuation (VVA) has been proved to be an effective way to increase engine efficiency by decreasing pumping losses at partial load conditions. In this context, research work has been proceed with CORE (CO 2 reduction for long distance transport) project, which is a collaborative large-scale integrating project for a call within FP 7 -SUSTAINABLE SURFACE TRANSPORT of the EC. The project consortium consists of three truck manufactures in Europe: Volvo, Daimler and IVECO, together with 13 other partners in the automotive industry and universities and it aims to demonstrate a substantial reduction of CO 2 emissions, 15 % improved fuel efficiency compared to a EURO V engine and fulfilling EURO VI emission legislation at the same time. The project is inserted in a series of research projects, which have been performed by the EC with the aim of boosting the cooperation among car manufactures, suppliers and technical universities as well as of defining enhanced and feasible solutions for the market. During this thesis research work within the CORE Project, a heavy duty engine fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG) using VVA technology has been numerically modelled using 0 / 1 D commercial tool GT Power. Since with VVA technology, it results lower exhaust temperatures which is not favoured by considering the aftertreatment working conditions. The advanced combustion management, thus the retarding combustion strategy combined with different valve profiles, has been numerically simulated in order to reach a good condition for aftertreatment working conditions both at steady state and transient conditions. Retarding combustion strategies have been numerically tested in order to increase the turbine outlet temperature by limiting the fuel consumption increment. At the same time, the upper limit of the turbine inlet temperature has also been taken into account. In order to obtain more opportunities to increase the model accuracy and to extend its applicability, based on the engine model built with GT Power, a user defined combustion based on fractal approach has been embedded. This user defined combustion is composed of several submodels (flow submodel, CAD submodel, flame submodel, combustion submodel [...] . etc). The validation of these submodels' coupling is done by comparing simulated and experimental data over a complete engine operating map after the calibration work. The model has shown its ability to reproduce the experimental data under the same working conditions with very high accuracy. Thus with this embedded combustion approach, it makes the model from a non-predictive one to a predictive one. Several applications have been numerically proceeded with this new model under transient condition tests with advanced combustion management and it demonstrates its good applicability and accuracy. Then this newly developed user combustion approach has been applied on the other two light duty engines: 1. 4 l T-jet PFI natural gas engine and 1. 4 l T DI natural gas engine. The engine models built in GT power have been carefully calibrated and they are able to reproduce the experimental data under the same working conditions with very high accuracy. A new application has been tested based on the engine models in which it is able to produce a spark advance value by targeting a proper MFB 50 value. The models are able to give comparable spark advance results once the users target the experimental MFB 50 values. This again further proves the robustness of the predictive model the developed user combustion approach. Meanwhile doing the predictive modelling for both engines, the flow submodel of the user combustion approach has also been improved with a available set of flow data obtained from 3 D CFD simulations. The simulated turbulence intensity over the engine revolution has reached a comparable level of the results coming from 3 D CFD data. The outcome of the work during the Ph. D study has been published in the following list. 1. Mirko Baratta, Roberto Finesso, Daniela Misul, Ezio Spessa, Yifei Tong, and Cesare Peletto.

40|$|A {{previously}} {{developed and}} validated zero-dimensional, multi-zone, thermodynamic combustion {{model for the}} prediction of spark ignition (SI) engine performance and nitric oxide (NO) emissions has been extended to include second-law analysis. The main characteristic of the model is {{the division of the}} burned gas into several distinct zones, in order to account for the temperature and chemical species stratification developed in the burned gas during combustion. Within the framework of the multi-zone model. the various availability components constituting the total availability of each of the multiple zones of the simulation are identified and calculated separately. The model is applied to a multi-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged and aftercooled, natural gas (<b>NG)</b> SI gas <b>engine</b> running on synthesis gas (syngas) fuel. The major part of the unburned mixture availability consists of the chemical contribution, ranging from 98 % at the inlet valve closing (IVC) event to 83 % at the ignition timing of the total availability for the 100 % load case, which is due to the presence of the combustible fuel. On the contrary, the multiple burned zones possess mainly thermomechanical availability. Specifically, again for the 100 % load case, the total availability of the first burned zone at the exhaust valve opening (EVO) event consists of thermomechanical availability approximately by 90 %, with similar percentages for all other burned zones. Two definitions of the combustion exergetic efficiency are used to explore the degree of reversibility of the combustion process in each of the multiple burned zones. It is revealed that the crucial factor determining the thermodynamic perfection of combustion in each burned zone is the level of the temperatures at which combustion occurs in the zone, with minor influence of the whole temperature history of the zone during the complete combustion phase. The availability analysis is extended to various engine loads. The engine in question is supplied with increasingly leaner mixtures as loads rise {{in order to keep the}} emitted nitrogen oxides (NO,) low. Therefore, in-cylinder combustion temperatures are reduced, resulting in increased destruction of availability due to combustion and reduced availability losses due to heat transfer with the cylinder walls, when expressed as percentages of the fuel chemical availability. Specifically, when engine load increases from 40 % to 100 % of full load, with the relative air-fuel ratio also increasing from 1. 56 to 1. 83, the destroyed availability due to combustion rises from 14. 19 % to 15. 02 % of the fuel chemical availability, while the respective percentage of the Cumulative availability loss due to heat transfer decreases from 13. 37 % to 9. 05 %.
