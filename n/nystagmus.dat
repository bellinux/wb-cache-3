5|$|Vision: {{different}} {{drugs as}} well as optic compensatory systems and prisms {{can be used to}} improve the symptoms of <b>nystagmus</b> or diplopia (double vision). Surgery can also be used in some cases.|$|E
5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, <b>nystagmus,</b> conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn {{together in the same}} direction), opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (dysphagia), visual problems (<b>nystagmus,</b> optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the vomiting or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, <b>nystagmus,</b> and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, <b>nystagmus,</b> hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (<b>nystagmus,</b> optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nystagmus</b> {{associated}} with BPPV has several important characteristics which differentiate it from {{other types of}} <b>nystagmus.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Nystagmus</b> {{lasts for}} 5–120 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{fixation}} suppresses <b>nystagmus</b> due to BPPV.|$|E
25|$|Positional: the <b>nystagmus</b> occurs only {{in certain}} positions.|$|E
25|$|Rotatory (torsional) <b>nystagmus,</b> {{where the}} top of the eye rotates towards the {{affected}} ear in a beating or twitching fashion, which has a latency and can be fatigued (the vertigo should lessen with deliberate repetition of the provoking maneuver). <b>Nystagmus</b> should only last for 30 seconds to one minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{roll test}} can {{determine}} whether the horizontal semicircular canal is involved. The roll test requires the patient {{to be in a}} supine position with their head in 30° of cervical flexion. Then the examiner quickly rotates the head 90° to the left side, and checks for vertigo and <b>nystagmus.</b> This is followed by gently bringing the head back to the starting position. The examiner then quickly rotates the head 90° to the right side, and checks again for vertigo and <b>nystagmus.</b> In this roll test, the patient may experience vertigo and <b>nystagmus</b> on both sides, but rotating towards the affected side will trigger a more intense vertigo. Similarly, when the head is rotated towards the affected side, the <b>nystagmus</b> will beat towards the ground and be more intense.|$|E
25|$|Between attacks {{they have}} <b>nystagmus</b> and dysarthria. These {{patients}} are responsive to acetazolamide.|$|E
25|$|The {{syndrome}} is frequently noticed first in children around {{six months of}} age by their photophobic activity and/or their <b>nystagmus.</b> The <b>nystagmus</b> becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first 6–7 years of life (but remain near 20/200).|$|E
25|$|Latency of onset: {{there is}} a 5–10 second delay prior to onset of <b>nystagmus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Repeated stimulation, {{including}} via Dix–Hallpike maneuvers, {{cause the}} <b>nystagmus</b> to fatigue or disappear temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Visual disturbance: It may be {{difficult}} to read or see during an attack due to associated <b>nystagmus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Episodic, {{characteristic}} definitive spells {{of vertigo}} lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with no unconsciousness, vestibular <b>nystagmus</b> always present.|$|E

25|$|Rotatory/Torsional {{component}} is present, or (in {{the case of}} lateral canal involvement) the <b>nystagmus</b> beats in either a geotropic (towards the ground) or ageotropic (away from the ground) fashion.|$|E
25|$|A {{simple but}} less-used {{technique}} is checking oculomotor responses with an optokinetic <b>nystagmus</b> drum, where {{the subject is}} placed inside the drum and surrounded by rotating black and white stripes. This creates involuntary abrupt eye movements (<b>nystagmus)</b> as the brain attempts to track the moving stripes. There is a good correspondence between the optokinetic and usual eye-chart acuities in adults. A potentially serious problem with this technique is that the process is reflexive and mediated in the low-level brain stem, not in the visual cortex. Thus someone can have a normal optokinetic response and yet be cortically blind with no conscious visual sensation.|$|E
25|$|Frerichs {{performed}} pioneer {{research of}} multiple sclerosis, and described <b>nystagmus</b> as {{a symptom of}} the disease. He also provided an early clinical description of a link between multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Typically, episodic ataxia {{presents}} as {{bouts of}} ataxia induced by startle, stress, or exertion. Some patients also have continuous tremors of various motor groups, known as myokymia. Other patients have <b>nystagmus,</b> vertigo, tinnitus, diplopia or seizures.|$|E
25|$|Hyperhydrosis, hypotension, burning eyes, {{increased}} appetite, {{changes in}} libido, hallucinations, faintness, <b>nystagmus,</b> vomiting, pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, nightmares, palpitation and paradoxical reactions including restlessness, aggression, violence, overstimulation and agitation have been reported, but are rare (less than 0.5%).|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{can cause}} drowsiness, listlessness, ataxia, visual disturbances, <b>nystagmus,</b> headache, and dizziness. These side effects {{are the most}} common, {{occurring}} in more than 1% of users. Transient nausea and vomiting are also common side effects.|$|E
25|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} {{is more likely}} in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as <b>nystagmus</b> in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the <b>nystagmus</b> occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{complete}} inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia {{have a number}} of other ophthalmologic aberrations. Included among these aberrations are greatly decreased visual acuity (<0.1 or 20/200) in daylight, Hemeralopia, <b>nystagmus,</b> and severe photophobia. The fundus of the eye appears completely normal. Also see Pingelap#Color-blindness.|$|E
25|$|Hypomagnesemia, also spelled hypomagnesaemia, is an {{electrolyte}} {{disturbance in}} which there is a low level of magnesium in the blood. Normal magnesium levels are between 1.46–2.68mg/dL (0.6-1.1 mmol/L) with levels less than 1.46mg/dL (0.6mmol/L) defining hypomagnesemia. Symptoms include tremor, <b>nystagmus,</b> seizures, and cardiac arrest including torsade de pointes.|$|E
25|$|Vestibular {{migraine}} is {{the association}} of vertigo and migraines {{and is one of}} the most common causes of recurrent, spontaneous episodes of vertigo. The cause of vestibular migraines is currently unclear; however, one hypothesized cause is that the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve leads to <b>nystagmus</b> in individuals suffering from migraines.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{symptoms}} of incomplete achromatopsia {{are similar to}} those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without <b>nystagmus</b> or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.|$|E
25|$|Tests for vertigo often {{attempt to}} elicit <b>nystagmus</b> and to {{differentiate}} vertigo from other causes of dizziness such as presyncope, hyperventilation syndrome, disequilibrium, or psychiatric causes of lightheadedness. Tests of vestibular system (balance) function include: electronystagmography (ENG), Dix-Hallpike maneuver, rotation tests, head-thrust test, caloric reflex test, and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP).|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} will report {{a history of}} vertigo {{as a result of}} fast head movements. Many patients are also capable of describing the exact head movements that provoke their vertigo. Purely horizontal <b>nystagmus</b> and symptoms of vertigo lasting more than one minute can also indicate BPPV occurring in the horizontal semicircular canal.|$|E
25|$|The Dix–Hallpike test is {{a common}} test {{performed}} by examiners {{to determine whether the}} posterior semicircular canal is involved. It involves a reorientation of the head to align the posterior semicircular canal (at its entrance to the ampulla) with the direction of gravity. This test will reproduce vertigo and <b>nystagmus</b> characteristic of posterior canal BPPV.|$|E
25|$|Vertigo*, {{better known}} as {{vestibular}} disease* in dogs, is an uncommon condition in older dogs. Most cases are idiopathic, {{but it can also}} be caused by otitis interna, or inner ear infection, tumors, and encephalitis. Signs include <b>nystagmus,</b> head tilt, circling, vomiting, and falling to one side. Idiopathic vestibular disease will usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks.|$|E
25|$|When {{performing}} the Dix–Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those {{who may not have}} the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dix–Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for <b>nystagmus.</b> A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of <b>nystagmus.</b> Both the Dix–Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dix–Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} {{periodic}} vestibulocerebellar ataxia, type-4 episodic ataxia (EA4) {{is an extremely}} rare form of episodic ataxia differentiated from other forms by onset in the third to sixth generation of life, defective smooth pursuit and gaze-evoked <b>nystagmus.</b> Patients also present with vertigo and ataxia. There are only two known families with EA4, both located in North Carolina. The locus for EA4 is unknown.|$|E
