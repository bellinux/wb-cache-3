40|$|Abstract: Carbon fibers {{were used}} to lay lengthways into three lays in jute fiber <b>needled</b> <b>mat</b> and the same fiber volume content of jute fiber <b>needled</b> <b>mat</b> were fabricated. Those two mats and the lengthways carbon fibers {{reinforced}} vinyl resin composites were made by VARTM. We made {{a comparison of the}} hybrid reinforced composites between the test value and the theoretical value which was predicted by establishing tensile and bending math-model and their mechanical properties were analyzed. The results show that there was a certain line between the theoretical value and the test value of the hybrid composites, so we can establish the mixing ratio between jute fiber and carbon fiber during the engineering application. Although the use of carbon fibers had greatly enhanced the tensile properties of hybrid composite, whose tensile strength and tensile modulus increased by 85. 94 % and 30. 99 % respectively than that without carbons, the bending model can’t be changed a lot...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the current {{international}} standards and corresponding apparatus {{for measuring the}} thermal conductivity of refractory glass fibre products have been reviewed. Refractory glass fibres are normally produced {{in the form of}} low-density <b>needled</b> <b>mats.</b> A major issue with thermal conductivity measurements of these materials is lack of reproducibility in the test results due to transformation of the test material during the test. Also <b>needled</b> <b>mats</b> are inherently inhomogeneous, and this poses additional problems. To be able to compare the various methods of thermal conductivity measurement, a refractory reference material was designed which is capable of withstanding maximum test temperatures (1673 K) with minimum transformation. The thermal conductivity of this reference material was then measured using various methods according to the different standards surveyed. In order to compare different materials, samples have been acquired from major refractory glass fibre manufacturers and the results have been compared against the newly introduced reference material. Materials manufactured by melt spinning, melt blowing and sol–gel have been studied, and results compared with literature values...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increasing {{awareness of the}} environment and energy, the fields of application for new types of plant fiber functional materials are expanding. In this study, different weight proportions of coir fiber were added to wood particle debris to produce hybrid boards. The two forms of coir fiber used were random distribution and non-woven <b>needle</b> <b>mat.</b> A mixed orthogonal experiment was designed to use the weight mixing ratio of wood debris and coir, the density of the hybrid boards, and the mixing form of the raw material as the experimental factors. The mechanical and sound absorption performances were evaluated. The experimental results provided evidence that the addition of the coir fibers enhanced the mechanical performance and sound absorption performance of the hybrid boards. The non-woven <b>needle</b> <b>mat</b> form in particular was effective at evenly distributing the fibers. The optimal plan for this kind of hybrid composite was obtained through experimental analysis. The excellent sound absorption performance and sufficient strength of the hybrid boards made them suitable for use on inner walls as sound-absorbing material or on interior trim parts in automotive applications. The research results demonstrated the advantages of using coir fiber and wood debris resources...|$|R
40|$|Pinyon and juniper {{trees are}} {{expanding}} into mountain sagebrush communities throughout their ranges. Fire {{is used to}} restore these sagebrush communities, but limited information is available on seedling establishment of native shrubs and herbs. We examined effects of spring prescribed fire in the Great Basin on emergence and survival of five species (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana, Festuca idahoensis, Poa secunda, Eriogonum umbellatum and Lupinus argenteus) common to these communities. Data were collected in three microsites (undertree, undershrub and interspace) on a burned and unburned site following a prescribed fire and on the unburned site the year prior to the fire. Soil temperature and moisture were collected on both sites and years. Emergence and survival of A. tridentata was low. Grasses had higher emergence and survival under trees in 2003 in the unburned site, reflecting the pre-burn distribution of these species. E. umbellatum had high emergence and survival regardless of site or microsite. L. argenteus had moderate emergence that was lowest on the burned site under trees and highest on the unburned site in interspaces. Burned soils were warmer than unburned soils. Undertree microsites on the unburned site were cooler than other microsites on both sites due to shading and insulation by <b>needle</b> <b>mats.</b> Soil moisture was generally higher on the burn site due to fewer shrubs and trees. Pinyon appeared to have a facilitative role for grass seedling establishment on both sites. Spring prescribed fire {{did not have a}} negative impact on emergence or survival in these mountain sagebrush communities. Low establishment of some species indicate higher seeding rates or repeated seeding may be required.

40|$|Self-reinforced {{polypropylene}} composites (SRPPC) {{were hot}} pressed from textile layers (carded mat, knitted fabrics) at three different temperatures (160, 165 and 170 °C) by setting a constant pressure (6 MPa) and constant holding time (2 min). Both textiles consist of {{two kinds of}} isotactic polypropylene (iPP) fibers differing in their orientation. In these compositions the highly oriented iPP works as reinforcement and the less oriented one fulfills {{the role of the}} matrix after hot consolidation. Two textile assemblies, viz. carded (also <b>needle</b> punched) <b>mats</b> and knitted fabrics were hot pressed; and the properties of the resultant SRPPC plates were investigated under tensile and falling weight impact conditions. The microstructure of the SRPPC was analyzed by light microscopy using polished sections and by SEM using cut surfaces...|$|R
50|$|Speleothem carbonates {{found in}} the caves {{have been subject to}} {{scientific}} studies. In fluviatile, spring, cave and soil environments microbial carbonates are important. In the biofilms and/or microbial mats, which are formed in the caves, the principal organisms associated are bacteria, particularly cyanobacteria, small algae and fungi. Petrographic analysis of a thin section has uncovered the presence of lithified structures and micrite, present as laminated to clotted with chocolate-brown blebs. These are identical to microbialites observed in modern and ancient stromatolitic carbonates. Laboratory observations with scanning electron microscope (SEM) have also confirmed the presence of calcified bacteria, micro-rods, and <b>needle</b> calcite. Organic <b>mats</b> (yellow-orange in colour) are made up of mineralized filamentous bacteria, bacterial stalks, cells and sheaths. Thus, these studies have indicated that microorganisms have actively influenced the genesis of speleothems of the Borra Caves.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, Tanzania {{has seen a}} rapid {{rise in the number}} of people who inject drugs (PWID), {{specifically}} heroin. While the overall HIV prevalence in Tanzania has declined recently to 5. 6 %, in 2009, the HIV prevalence among PWID remains alarmingly high at 35 %. In this paper, we describe how the Tanzania AIDS Prevention Program (TAPP), Médecins du Monde France (MdM-F), and other organisations have been at the forefront of addressing this public health issue in Africa, implementing a wide array of harm reduction interventions including medication-assisted treatment (<b>MAT),</b> <b>needle</b> and syringe programs (NSP), and "sober houses" for residential treatment in the capital, Dar es Salaam, and in Zanzibar. Looking toward the future, we discuss the need to (1) extend existing services and programs to reach more PWID and others at risk for HIV, (2) develop additional programs to strengthen existing programs, and (3) expand activities to include structural interventions to address vulnerabilities that increase HIV risk for all Tanzanians...|$|R

40|$|Dothistroma septosporum and D. pini {{cause the}} serious pine needle disease, Dothistroma needle blight (DNB). Of these, D. septosporum has a global distribution, while D. pini is known {{only from the}} USA, Russia, Ukraine and France. During a study of D. septosporum {{isolates}} from Pinus nigra in Hungary, microsatellite markers revealed {{the presence of a}} second Dothistroma species. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the DNB pathogens occurring in Hungary using four different molecular techniques. These included sequencing of the rDNA ITS region, a species-specific ITS-RFLP, mating type primers and a diagnostic microsatellite marker, Doth_A. Results showed that both D. septosporum and D. pini occur in Hungary and that both DNB pathogens were present on the same trees and in some cases, the same <b>needles.</b> Mating types <b>MAT</b> 1 and MAT 2 of D. septosporum were shown to be present in Hungary, but only the MAT 2 of D. pini was found. In addition, examination of needles with DNB symptoms from Russia revealed the presence of D. pini on Pinus pallasiana and P. nigra as well as on a new host, Pinus mugo. The molecular markers applied in this study were sufficiently robust to identify and differentiate between the two DNB pathogens, both in culture and directly from needles. They will consequently be useful to document the geographical range and to monitor the spread of D. septosporum and D. pini in future studies.

40|$|Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) is a {{procedure}} in composite material {{manufacturing in which}} resin and fibers are held apart until the last possible moment. In this way it can be contrasted with other manufacturing methods where the resin and fiber are combined prior to use. In RTM, unresinated fibers are held within a tool cavity and a differential pressure is applied to a supply of resin so that the resin flows into the reinforcement completely wetting it out. Reinforcements may be made of any fiber {{and the use of}} all forms has been reported, from unidirectional through woven or knitted cloths to <b>needled</b> and random <b>mats</b> and fully three-dimensional reinforcement preforms. The resin can be of a very wide range of chemistries and formulations, so long as the basic process requirements are met. Cure times can be from a few minutes to many hours. Resin injection machines vary widely, and production line design can be just as varied. The focus of this project will be the development of an intelligent injection system and its application to RTM. In order to achieve this, the Lab VIEW program will be employed to control pressure and flow rate—the two important parameters of RTM. This system includes an injector, computer, data acquisition boards, electric system and pneumatic system. A number of experiments have been performed to find the optimal application of this system. During the manufacturing of composite parts, all the processing parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate and displacement with respect to time, can be written to a computer hard disk to be analyzed later. All the data acquired during the operation can help us to understand in depth the processing of composite materials and the relationship between process, quality and property...|$|R
