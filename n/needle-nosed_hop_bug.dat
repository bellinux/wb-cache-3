50|$|In 2009, Teohari debuted his own weekly comedy show on Realitatea TV called După Bloguri, a pun on the După blocuri album title by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia. The program {{examined}} {{various aspects}} of Romanian contemporary culture by focusing on weekly Internet stories about Romanian bloggers and writers. Together with producer Ana Maria Caia, he executive produced the weekly program until its cancellation in late 2009 after 20 episodes.

50|$|IV: Deasupra tuturor is {{the third}} studio album by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia. It was {{released}} on November 10, 1997, by Cat Music in Romania, receiving universal acclaim from the group's fans as the way the tracks sounded was noticeably different from the previous three albums. It went on to sell over 55,000 copies with basically no promotion at all, due to the violent nature of its content, and it {{remains one of the}} best-selling hip hop albums in Romania. B.U.G. Mafia's fans have repeatedly ranked it as a classic among the group's albums.|$|R
50|$|Întotdeauna pentru totdeauna (Always Forever) is {{the sixth}} studio album by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia. It was {{released}} on October 17, 2000, by Cat Music in Romania. Recording sessions for the album took place in 2000 at the Magic Sound studios in Bucharest, Romania. The album's name is an untranslatable Romanian play of words, basically meaning that the group will always remain unchanged {{so that they can}} go into history, thus being remembered forever. B.U.G. Mafia's official website mentions this album as being one of their most underrated, despite its sales being above average.|$|R
50|$|Mafia is {{the debut}} studio album by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia, {{released}} September 20, 1995 on local Bucharest-based label Amma Sound. Production for {{the album was}} handled by group member and founder Tataee, with various composers and keyboardists giving co-production. Heavily influenced by N.W.A. and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, the album has been viewed as the pioneering record of gangsta rap in Romania. With its ever-present profanity and violent lyrics, it helped {{to give birth to}} this then-new genre of music in Romania. As hip hop music was quite new in Romania at the time, the album attracted many rock fans, who appreciated the group's aggressive approach towards music.|$|R
5000|$|După blocuri (In the Projects) is {{the fifth}} studio album by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia, {{released}} on January 18, 2000, by Cat Music in Romania. Recording sessions for the album took place throughout 1999 at the [...] "Magic Sound" [...] studios in Bucharest. The album features a darker tone than its predecessor, with heavy beats being accompanied by an overall sobriety in its lyricism. It has been categorized by fans and critics alike as the group's darkest work. Production for the album was handled by group member Tataee {{and some of his}} frequent collaborators at the time, keyboardist Camil Beldeanu and guitarist Cristi Andrei.|$|R
5000|$|The group {{started work}} on the album in late 1998 and {{recording}} sessions carried throughout 1999. As their previous album De cartier had sold over 130,000 copies which was unprecedented for a Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group, <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia were catapulted to superstardom and with that, new problems occurred for them. The Romanian media started capitalizing off their success by publishing false stories and intentionally portraying the group in a demeaning light. The anger and frustration of being unable to publicly defend themselves was put into {{a large number of}} the songs recorded for the album thus producing what the critics have called [...] "their darkest work since their debut album".|$|R
40|$|Jim Propp bugs me sometimes. I’m usually {{glad when}} he does. Today, Jim’s bugs {{are trained to}} hop {{back and forth on}} the {{positive}} integers: place a bug at 1, and with each <b>hop,</b> a <b>bug</b> at i moves to either i + 1 or i − 2. Of course, it might jump off the left edge; we put two bugcatching cups at 0 and − 1. Once a bug lands in a cup, we start a new bug at 1. What I haven’t mentioned is how the bugs decide whether to jump left or right. We could declare it a random walk, stepping in either direction with probability 1 / 2, but the U. of Wisconsin professor’s bugs are more orderly than that. At each location i, there is a signpost showing an arrow: it can point either Inbound, towards i − 2 and the bug cups, or Outbound, towards infinity. The bugs are somewhat contrarian, so when a bug lands at i, it first flips the arrow to point the opposite direction, and then hops that way (Fig. 1). Add an initial condition that all arrows begin pointing Outbound, and we have a deterministic system. Let <b>bugs</b> <b>hop</b> till the...|$|R
5000|$|... "Bani, Bani, Bani" [...] (Money, Money, Money) is {{a single}} by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia, {{featuring}} vocals from Michel Kotcha. The song, produced by group member Tataee and mixed by longtime collaborator Cristi Dobrică, was released as a stand-alone digital download single on April 24, 2017 by Casa Productions in Romania. The song examines the problematic relationships which spawn from financial difficulties, while also reflecting on the group's past and future prospects. The song's accompanying music video, directed by Alin Surdu, depicts a number of fictitious characters experiencing a stylized struggle for fiscal comfort, while also featuring {{the members of the}} group and singer Michel Kotcha performing their verses and chorus, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Vlad Irimia ( [...] ; born October 17, 1976), {{primarily}} {{known by}} his stage name Tataee (...) , is a Romanian record producer, rapper, record executive, and music manager. He {{is one of}} the founders of the well-known Romanian hip <b>hop</b> trio <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia, also having produced albums and overseeing the careers of many acclaimed Romanian rappers, such as La Familia, XXL & 10 Grei, Mahsat and JerryCo. As a music producer, he is frequently credited as one of the pioneers and key figures in the architecture of the Romanian version of gangsta rap, a style of music that closely resembles its American counterpart but also includes various local influences derived from balkan music or, more recently, electronica.|$|R
5000|$|De cartier (From The Hood) is {{the fourth}} studio album by Romanian hip <b>hop</b> group <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia, {{released}} September 20, 1998, by Cat Music in Romania. The album went on to sell over 130,000 copies and, due to some of its violently charged content and the group's acerbic statements on Romania's post communist social situation, De Cartier {{was the source of}} much controversy upon its release. The frenzy that resulted from this situation was also the source of a massive discreditation campaign by the Romanian media, who capitalized from the subject by intentionally portraying them in a negative light using false information. The public scrutiny lead to an unprecedented amount of pressure which in turn influenced what the group claims to be their [...] "darkest and most complex work to this day", their following album, [...] "După blocuri".|$|R
5000|$|In late 2009 a {{new song}} by Guess Who {{surfaced}} on the Internet in Romania, receiving a consistent amount of positive feedback. The track's original name was Anul 2000 (The Year 2000) but he later changed it as he stated the [...] "Anul 2000" [...] brand was registered in Romania and thus, not available for free public use. The song was discovered by Romanian radio host Şerban Huidu and he gave high praise to the track's original and intelligent lyrical delivery as he started promoting it on Kiss FM. Shortly afterwards, many other radio stations started airing the song, creating a new buzz around Guess Who and also sparking interest from Romanian music labels. He eventually signed with Cat Music for a one album deal similar to fellow hip <b>hop</b> acts <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia and Puya, who also released their albums with Romania's largest sports newspaper at the time, Gazeta Sporturilor to boost their cd sales. Locul Potrivit/Probe Audio included the re-release's lead single [...] "Locul Potrivit" [...] (The Right Place), two other new tracks, amongst which a collaboration with Romanian reggae group Camuflaj and a remix of the original album's second single [...] "Eugen".|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Tataee {{provided}} vocals {{and produced}} several tracks on La Familia's debut album, Băieți De Cartier (Hoodboys), paving the group's way to hip hop superstardom in Romania and remaining a frequent collaborator until the feud that occurred {{between them in}} 2003. Later, in 1998, he produced XXL&10 Grei's whole debut album, Personajul Negativ (The Bad Guy) and although the album sold poorly, it was met with unanimous positive reviews by music critics and fans as well, establishing Grasu XXL and his collaborator, Paco [...] "10 Grei" [...] as {{two of the most}} prominent figures in Romanian hip <b>hop.</b> The <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia Prezintă Casa (B.U.G. Mafia Presents Casa) album, released February 20, 2002, featured songs by his group, B.U.G. Mafia, as well as by newly signed Casa artists and the single Cine E Cu Noi (Who's With Us), intended as a new milestone in Romanian hip hop. Tataee mentioned the project in various interviews before 2002, the year the label was officially established, describing it initially as a record distribution company that later turned into a record label, so the group could independently produce their own albums and sign new artists. Also in 2002, he remixed Paraziţii's hit single [...] "În Focuri" [...] and the resulting track was included on the single's commercial release.|$|R
50|$|Just as Sam hops aboard {{his horse}} and rides off after the train, Bugs follows on another horse. Sam orders Bugs at gunpoint to go back so he can rob the train, but Bugs vows that he's going to save the train. Right after <b>Bugs</b> <b>hops</b> aboard the engine's cab of the train, and {{switches}} his cowboy hat with a train engineer's cap, Sam orders Bugs back at the count of five. Just as Sam reaches four, his horse makes him hit a telegraph pole. When Sam catches up again and tries counting to three, but {{when he gets to}} two, he runs into the wall of a tunnel. He catches up again and tries just counting two, but when he reaches two, he and his horse fall off a trestle bridge and into a river below.|$|R
5000|$|Bugs is {{traveling}} underground, and {{winds up in}} France {{at the headquarters of}} Napoleon Bonaparte, called Headquartiers du Napoleon. Napoleon is shown planning a military offensive and gets into an argument with Bugs over where the artillery should be placed. When Bugs agrees with his original idea Napoleon angrily places it where Bugs said it should go and takes snuff. Bugs takes some as well, but sneezes on the plans, knocking the models over. Napoleon thinks Bugs is a saboteur, and sends a guard after him. Bugs easily outwits the incompetent guard (who's actually [...] "Mugsy", previously seen in Bugs and Thugs) and causes him to hit Napoleon with a bayonet. Mugsy then gets the [...] "point" [...] of the bayonet from Napoleon offscreen-and goes howling into the air. Bugs then disguises himself as Josephine and asks Napoleon to dance. Napoleon sees Bugs' tail through the disguise and chases Bugs, who slides down a staircase. The guard sees Bugs and points his bayonet, intending to stab Bugs as he slides down. <b>Bugs</b> <b>hops</b> off of the staircase and Napoleon is stabbed instead offscreen-he comes back up the staircase screaming in pain. Mugsy then gets the [...] "point" [...] again.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s Romania, {{a country}} that had just overthrown its {{communist}} dictatorship, witnessed an explosion of popular music from Western culture as the youth quickly gained its access to information. The hip hop industry was {{at an all-time high}} by the time Pacha Man returned to Romania in 1997. He started emceeing in a club in his native Timişoara and quickly gained the public's attention for his innovative and refreshing style. One of his Timişoara friends was a club disk jockey going by the name of DJ Angelo. He suggested Pacha Man, derived from the Turkish military rank pasha, would be perfect as a stage name for the 21-year-old Nicorici, as he drew a considerable female audience in his early years. He recorded and released his debut album, Globul De Cristal (The Crystal Globe) in 1998 and, although the album was an independent, self-produced material, it created enough buzz around Pacha Man, enabling him to set many contacts in the Romanian music industry. He collaborated with hip <b>hop</b> veterans <b>B.U.G.</b> Mafia on their 2000 album Întotdeauna pentru totdeauna and in 2002 signed with hip hop powerhouse Rebel Music. While on Rebel Music, he released his second album, Drumul Către Rastafari (The Road To Rastafari), one of the highest regarded reggae albums ever released in Romania. The album was supported by the hit single Acelaşi Sânge (One Blood), a reggae-style social protest that catapulted him to superstardom. In 2004 he left Rebel Music and released his third album, Contra Curentului (Against The Stream), in 2006 via Nova Music. Zale member and producer Jaques Yolo produced the supporting single of the album, Crazy, making his affiliation with the band's label, Chill Brothers Records, public. He signed with Chill Brothers Records in 2007, but has since left the label without releasing any new material.In 2010 Pacha Man collaborated with Romanian R&B artist Smiley for his solo album Plec Pe Marte (I'm Leaving For Mars) on a track named [...] "Love Is For Free". He also recorded a verse for Romanian hip hop group Paraziţii's 2010 album Tot ce e bun tre' să dispară (Everything That's Good Is Gotta Go) but the song did not make the album. Later in his career, Nicorici became known as a contestant on MasterChef România ...|$|R
