5000|$|Under {{pressures}} {{higher than}} 110 GPa and temperatures around 2000 K nitrogen forms a network solid, bound by single covalent bonds {{in what is}} called a cubic-gauche structure, abbreviated as cg-N. This substance is very stiff with a bulk modulus around 298 GPa, similar to diamond. It is very high energy and is metastable when pressure is released. The cubic-gauche form has space group I213. [...] The unit cell edge is 3.805 Å. There are eight nitrogen atoms per unit cell. The bond angles are very close to tetrahedral. The structure contains rings of nitrogen atoms that are fused together. The position of the lone pairs of electrons is ranged so that their overlap is minimised. The difference in bond energy varies from 0.83 eV per atom in nitrogen gas to 4.94 eV per atom, so having a difference in energy of over 4 eV per atom. This cubic-gauche nitrogen is the highest <b>energy</b> <b>non-nuclear</b> material and is being investigated for use in explosives and rocket fuel. Its energy density is 33 kJ g−1 which is over three times the energy density of HMX. cg-N has all bonds the same length of 1.346 Å at 115 GPa. The cubic-gauche structure for nitrogen is predicted to have bond lengths of 1.40 Å, bond angles of 114.0° and dihedral angles of −106.8°. The term gauche refers to the odd dihedral angles, if it was 0° it would be called cis, and if 180° it would be called trans. The dihedral angle Φ is related to the bond angle θ by sec(Φ) = sec(θ) − 1. The coordinate of one atom in the unit cell at x,x,x also determines the bond angle by cos(θ) = x(x-1/4)/(x2+(x-1/4)2).|$|R

50|$|Paulscherrerite {{is named}} in {{recognition}} of the vital contributions to mineralogy and nuclear physics of Swiss physicist Paul Scherrer (1890-1969). While studying at the University of Göttingen in 1916, he and Peter Debye, Scherrer’s mentor and eventual Nobel Prize winner, developed the powder diffraction theory (the Scherrer equation) and designed the Debye-Scherrer X-ray powder diffraction camera. By 1920, Scherrer had become interested in nuclear physics, was appointed to a professorship at the ETH Zürich, and was involved in the early development of solid-state physics, nuclear physics, and electronics. He was named President of the Swiss Study Commission for Atomic Energy in 1946 and took part in establishing CERN near Geneva in 1954 (Hephaestus, 2011). Since 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute has been the largest Swiss national research institute, active in elementary particle physics, material sciences, and nuclear and <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> research. The name for the mineral was proposed by Joel Brugger, a native of Switzerland, currently a QEII fellow at the University of Adelaide, Australia (MMSN, 2011).|$|E
50|$|For Japan, {{there is}} a huge energy gap but it doesn't seem that {{there is a}} viable substitute. Japan's Economy, Trade and Industry Minister Yukio Edano said in April 2012 that he admits that Japan is facing a huge risk of huge energy shortage. The energy is {{expected}} to be short up to 16 percent, especially in western Japan. In order to make up the loss from the absence of nuclear power plants, Japan's utilities have increased use of gas and oil-fired power plants. Japan is trying to transfer to a <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> infrastructure. However, critics like Dr. Howard Hayden, a professor of Physics at Connecticut University, view that it will be very costly and Japan will probably go back to rely on nuclear power because of the money issue.A Japanese government panel's forecast also seem a bit grim. The panel expected that increased use of thermal power plants would reduce national wealth. Also, it would raise electricity bills for household and companies. For an instance, the Japanese Finance Ministry reported that because of extra fuel it imports, its deficit rose to $50 billion.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{industries}} {{account for}} {{a significant portion of}} total rare earth usage, both in the US and worldwide. Rare earth minerals are frequently collocated with naturally occurring radioactive material, imparting an occupational radiological dose during recovery. This paper explores the extent to which rare earths are used by various <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> industries and estimates the radiological dose which can be attributed to these industries on absolute and normalized scales. It was determined that typical rare earth mining results in an occupational collective dose of approximately 0. 0061 person-mSv/t rare earth elements, amounting to a total of 330 person-mSv/year across all <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> industries (about 60 % of the annual collective dose from one pressurized water reactor operated in the US, although for rare earth mining the impact is spread out over many more workers). About half of the collective dose from <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> production results from use of fuel cracking catalysts for oil refining, although given the extent of the oil industry, it is a small dose when normalized to the energy equivalent of the oil that is used annually. Another factor in energy industries’ reliance on rare earths is the complicated state of the regulation of naturally occurring radiological materials; correspondingly, this paper also explores regulatory and management implications...|$|E

40|$|Report of the {{independent}} expert panelLaunched in 1994, the Fourth Framework Programme (FP 4) covering research and demonstration aimed to improve the {{security of energy supply}} and to reduce the impact of the production and use of energy on the environment, in particular CO 2 and the other greenhouse gases. Other important EU objectives were also addressed including strengthening the technological basis of the energy industry (e. g. employment and export potential), improving European social and economic cohesion and contributing to co-operation with third countries. It also supported research on overall energy RTD strategy in the inter-disciplinary area of energy-environment-economy. Six years after the Programme’s launch, at a stage when most of the projects have been completed, and the Sixth Framework Programme is being planned, it was considered appropriate to assess not only the scientific and technical quality of the completed projects, but also their impact on society, the economy and the environment. The present analysis was organised to allow quick feedback for the preparation of the new Framework Programme. This was achieved by convening a panel of ten experts from different Member States. Using questionnaires, project final reports and direct contacts where necessary, the Panel investigated the expected overall impact by examining the scientific and technical results as well as the social and economic impact of a sample of about 90 already finished <b>Non-Nuclear</b> <b>Energy</b> projects, most of them three years ago (time necessary to expect some concrete results), representing in total a e 84 million investment by the Commission. The contribution to Community policies, particularly emphasised in the present Framework Programme, as well as the Programmes’s addition to European Added Value were both explored. The results of this impact assessment of about one-fifth of the projects funded under the <b>Non-Nuclear</b> <b>Energy</b> Programme of the Fourth Framework Programme for the period 1994 - 1998 (better known as JOULE), were analysed and critically reviewed and are presented in this report. Among the main conclusions of the report, {{it is worth noting that}} the vast majority of the examined projects have developed new technical advances. Furthermore, the commercial leverage of funded research projects is positive and its major non-commercial impact is on the improvement of the environment and particularly on CO 2 emissions. The social and economic impact remains, in general, limited, but could be improved through better understanding and application of the European Added Value principles. The Fifth Framework Programme made a further step towards refocusing European energy research and aiming to provide effective responses to the major challenges facing European society. It is important to fully exploit the experience and the results from the research undertaken under the FP 4 since the knowledge generated relates directly to the objectives of the next Energy Research Programme. It also provides the groundwork for launching effective and innovative approaches to implementing the “European Research Area”. Based on the present pilot exercise, the remaining projects of the <b>Non-Nuclear</b> <b>Energy</b> Programme of the FP 4 will be assessed to provide a full picture of the impact of the Programme. Finally, the present pilot exercise should help to provide a methodological base for other research programmes to develop quick-response, feedback to decision-makers to allow for the development of better informed research policies and actions. It should also help to bring more quickly the results and socio-economic implications of European research to European citizens, companies and institutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} and development of new or improved energy technologies is a time consuming process. In addition, long capital lock-up periods in the energy sector mean that new, innovative technologies only enter the market very slowly.

The IET is based both in Petten, the Netherlands, and Ispra, Italy, and has a multidisciplinary team of around 300 academic, technical, and support staff. The research areas include, among others, sustainable transport, renewable energies incl. solar, photovoltaics and biomass, sustainable & safe nuclear energy for present & future reactor system, pre-normative materials testing, energy techno-economic assessment, hydrogen and fuel cells, energy efficiency, and security of energy supply. To support implementation of the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-plan) and the Industrial Initiatives of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (ESNII and NC 2 I, under construction) the IET works on performance assessment, design optimization, and safety evaluation of various next generation nuclear fission (Generation IV) energy systems. In collaboration with the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and with European Technical Support Organizations, IET participates in development of an integrated safety assessment methodology for Generation-IV reactor systems aiming at establishment of a widely applicable, technology-neutral concept. Mostly as part of European collaborative projects, IET is also engaged in safety-relevant experimental research on advanced fuels, components and materials, in simulation as well as modelling to support experimental research and to assess performance of Generation-IV systems. This includes irradiation testing of fuels for fast reactors and high temperature reactors, of transmutation fuels and candidate structural materials for several advanced reactor concepts. Out-of-pile testing and qualification methods in corrosive environments up to very high temperatures are also being developed and applied.

40|$|During {{the summer}} 2000, I {{was given the}} {{opportunity}} to work for about three months as a technical trainee at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, or LLNL as I will refer to it hereafter. University of California runs this Department of Energy laboratory, which is located 70 km east of San Francisco, in the small city of Livermore. This master thesis in Radioecology is based on the work I did here. LLNL, as a second U. S. -facility for development of nuclear weapons, was built in Livermore {{in the beginning of the}} 1950 's (Los Alamos in New Mexico was the other one). It has since then also become a 'science center' for a number of areas like magnetic and laser fusion energy, <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy,</b> biomedicine, and environmental science. The Laboratory's mission has changed over the years to meet new national needs. The following two statements were found on the homepage of LLNL ([URL] at 2001 - 03 - 05, where also information about the laboratory and the scientific projects that takes place there, can be found. 'Our primary mission is to ensure that the nation's nuclear weapons remain safe, secure, and reliable and to prevent the spread and use of nuclear weapons worldwide'. 'Our goal is to apply the best science and technology to enhance the security and well-being of the nation and to make the world a safer place. ' The Marshall Islands Dose Assessment and Radioecology group at the Health and Ecological Assessments division employed me, and I also worked to some extent with the Centre for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS) group. The work I did at LLNL can be divided into two parts. In the first part Plutonium (Pu) measurements in sediments from the Rongelap atoll in Marshall Islands, using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) were done. The method for measuring these kinds of samples is well understood at LLNL since soil samples have been measured with AMS for Pu in the past. Therefore it was the results that were of main interest and not the technique. The second part was to take advantage of AMS's very high sensitivity by measure the Pu-concentrations in small volumes (0. 04 - 1 L) of seawater. The technique for using AMS at Pu-measurements in seawater is relatively new and the main task for me was to find out a method that could work in practice.

The study is {{in the context of}} a project, which is part of a PhD study that aims to develop a methodology to compare risks across different energy systems. Risk assessment and risk data collection efforts are under way in most energy sectors (nuclear, fossil, hydropower), making possible comparisons easier. The photovoltaic (PV) sector, as a new rapidly growing energy technology, offers opportunities for assessing possible risks mainly based on the quantity of dangerous chemicals used, but there seems to be a lack of reported information on its risk events. This situation makes it difficult to analyze the impact of the PV technology, especially if the attention is on human health. Therefore, other well-known methods to assess the safety level of PV manufacturing facilities, such as PRA, can be used to assess corresponding risk levels. The PRA methodology allows to evaluate preliminary quantification figures for failure frequencies, and to demonstrate the possible advantages in identifying the failure scenarios of the process itself, so that countermeasures can be considered. This paper presents first a detailed analysis of the PV manufacture process, conducted at a methodological level (knowledge of the single processes at every step, with chemicals introduced, and resulting as reaction products) as well as at a technical level (machinery involved, auxiliary systems). Next, on this basis, an event tree and fault tree model are constructed and the corresponding analysis performed, using data available from generic chemical industry data-bases. The results of this analysis show that it is possible to quantify the frequency of failures of such processes leading to health challenges and also to identify the scenarios leading to those end states. Even if the figures resulting from the existing models based on the information available so far indicate that such probabilities are unlikely in comparison with other industries, nevertheless the results indicate the existence of weak links. Such weak points could lead to possible health threats. The benefits of using such approaches in conjunction with other design tools are clear when performing risk reviews before events happen. Such an application would be in line with the best practice on these issues from other industrial fields (aviation, aero-space, nuclear, some other chemical processes). The use of such models in the framework of risk comparison could complement the data collected to support the development of the knowledge database on risks for various energy sources. JRC.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a European Innovation System (EIS), defined as common effort of the EU {{as a whole and}} not merely as sum on {{national}} undertakings of the EU member states, has never been far below the surface for those seeking to create a united Europe. However, it needed a lot of years to emerge on the surface, still these days mor an - partly already operationalised - idea than an elaborated conceptual policy. In a brief historical perspective the emergence of the EIS wil be elaborated. At the time being, the 4 th Framework Programme for European RTD (FP 4) is running. It covers the period from 1994 until 1998 and encompasses an overall budget of approx. 15 billion ECU, which is considerably higher than the respective budgets in the late 1980 s. However, the budget for FP 4 and FP 5 as well is still just around 4 % of the sum of all national public RTD-budgets of the 15 member states. Moreover, in terms of R&D expenditure, the EU is still lacking behind its main global competitors. While there is a slight but steady decreasing trend in those EU countries which already spend the largest proportion on R&D expenditure, most growth can be stated either in those countries starting from a relatively low base or the Nordic countries, while the Austrian value stagnates. The differences in the distribution of R&D expenditures by socio-economic objectives between the various national governments and the European Commission are remarkable. The objectives laid down in FP 4 can be regarded as an additional value for the Austrian innovation system. Due to its specific nature, FP 4 has some substantial advantages for the Austrian innovation system. First, Austria contributes roughly three per cent of the total FP 4 budget, but has access to considerably more know-how. Second, the EU RTD programme is based on inter-institutional networking. This forces and facilitates the entry of industrial enterprises in research consortia and thus stimulates the co-operation between academic and enrepreneurial research efforts. Third, {{there are a lot of}} EU RTD efforts which focus directly on the active participation of SMEs, which form the overall industrial structure in Austria. The fourth advantage of the EU RTD programmes for Austria lies in its obvious and highly necessary concentration on high-tech sectors. In Austria the rate of export specialisation on goods with high R&D-input is twice as low as in the EU. First results of the Austrian participation in FP 4 show some remarkable features. Out of 3972 submitted project proposals with Austrian participation, 1053 were funded by the EC. Especially successful were proposals with Austrian participants from the business sector (40 % of successful proposers), followed by participants from the universities (32 %) and non-university research institutions (16 %), both below their respective share in terms of application. Concerning the different technological programmes, Austria performed especially well in the <b>non-nuclear</b> <b>energy</b> programmes, in some of the environmental targeted research programmes, in information technologies and telematics as well as in transport targeted research. ...|$|E
