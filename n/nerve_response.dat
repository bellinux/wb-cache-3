Movable range of each antennal joint was obsered and <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to C-F joint movement were recorded. The <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to joint movement were classified to two type responses; one is tonic type response which continued firing as joint flexion, second is phasic type which showed fast adaptation. Almost of units (about 90 %) responded with increase of firing to flexion but few units showed inhibition. Firing {{rate of the}} tonic type response depended on angle of the joint and, to a sustained flexion, the firing remained with steady rate depending on the angle. These tonic type receptors coded a joint position information. The phasic type receptor responded to a joint movement and a single cell responded to movement of only one direction (unidirectional), a flexion or an extension. Notwithstanding of steady rate of angular movement, the firing frequency reached maximum immediately after the initiation of the movement and rapidly adapted. Firing rate of these phasic unit depend on movement velocity. This phasic type response coded a movement direction and a rate. Unnatural opposite directional movement or lateral movement of the C - F joint which an animal cannot move itself caused also <b>nerve</b> <b>responses.</b> So {{it is suggested that}} these receptors have a rule not only as proprioceptors but also as extraceptors.

40|$|A {{principal}} {{process in}} the homeostatic control of sodium levels is salt intake, {{and the sense of}} taste has a primary role in regulating ingestion. Because ingestion of sodium chloride (NaCl) is essential for life, the taste system for salt sensation might be expected to exhibit mature functional characteristics from very early development. However, major changes in gustatory <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to NaCl take place during development. In sheep and rat, the peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to NaCl are of low magnitude during early development. Progressively, the taste system acquires an increasing proportion of fibers that respond maximally to NaCl. The sodium responsiveness emerges in the context of shifting peripheral innervation patterns and the apparent addition of functional receptor membrane channels sensitive to the sodium transport blocker, amiloride. These developmental processes can be altered by early manipulation of sodium in the diet...|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis can be {{achieved}} through a specialized form of electromyographic (EMG) testing called the long exercise test. This test measures the amplitude of a <b>nerve</b> <b>response</b> (called the Compound Muscle Action Potential or CMAP) for 40 to 50 minutes following {{a few minutes of}} exercise. In affected patients, there is a progressive fall in the amplitude of the potential. Besides the patient history or a report of serum potassium low normal or low during an attack, the long exercise test is the current standard for medical testing. Genetic diagnosis is often unreliable as {{only a few of the}} more common gene locations are tested, but even with more extensive testing 20-37% of people with a clinical diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis have no known mutation in the two known genes. Standard EMG testing cannot diagnose a patient unless they are in a full blown attack at the time of testing. Provoking an attack with exercise and diet then trying oral potassium can be diagnostic, but also dangerous as this form of PP has an alternate form known as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. The symptoms are almost the same, but the treatment is different. The old glucose insulin challenge is dangerous and risky to the point of being life-threatening and should never be done when other options are so readily available.|$|E

In this report we examined hemodynamic and sympathetic <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) before and after 24 -hours of bed rest.

Objectives: To investigate the acute median <b>nerve</b> <b>response</b> to intense wheelchair propulsion by using ultrasonography {{and to examine}} the relationship between carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) signs and symptoms and the acute median <b>nerve</b> <b>response.</b> Design: Case series. Setting: Research room at the National Veterans Wheelchair Games. Participants: Manual wheelchair users (N= 28) competing in wheelchair basketball. Intervention: Ultrasound images collected before and after {{a wheelchair}} basketball game. Main Outcome Measures: Median nerve cross-sectional area, flattening ratio, and swelling ratio and changes in these after activity. Comparison of median nerve characteristics and patient characteristics between participants with and without positive physical examination findings and with and without symptoms of CTS. Results: Significant changes in median nerve ultrasound characteristics were noted after activity. The group as a whole showed a significant decrease in cross-sectional area at the radius of 4. 05 % (P=. 023). Participants with positive physical examinations showed significantly different (P=. 029) and opposite changes in swelling ratio compared with the normal group. Subjects with CTS symptoms had a significantly (P=. 022) greater duration of wheelchair use (17. 1 y) compared with the asymptomatic participants (9 y). Conclusions: Manual wheelchair propulsion induces acute changes in median nerve characteristics that can be visualized by using ultrasound.

In a recent study we demonstrated that pre- and postnatal ethanol exposure induced low minute ventilation in juvenile rats. The present study analysed in juvenile rats the respiratory response to hypoxia in vivo by plethysmography and the phrenic (Phr) <b>nerve</b> <b>response</b> to ischaemia in situ. Glycinergic neurotransmission was assessed in situ with strychnine application and [(3) H]strychnine binding experiments performed in the medulla. After chronic ethanol exposure, hyperventilation during hypoxia was blunted in vivo. In situ Phr <b>nerve</b> <b>response</b> to ischaemia was also impaired, while gasping activity occurred earlier and recovery was delayed. Strychnine applications in situ (0. 05 - 0. 5 microM) demonstrated a higher sensitivity of expiratory duration in ethanol-exposed animals compared to control animals. Moreover, [(3) H]strychnine binding density was increased after ethanol and was associated with higher affinity. Furthermore, 0. 2 microM strychnine in ethanol-exposed animals restored the low basal Phr nerve frequency, but also the Phr <b>nerve</b> <b>response</b> to ischaemia and the time to recovery, while gasping activity appeared even earlier with a higher frequency. Polycythaemia was present after ethanol exposure whereas lung and heart weights were not altered. We conclude that chronic ethanol exposure during rat brain development (i) induced polycythaemia to compensate for low minute ventilation at rest; (ii) impaired the respiratory network adaptive response to low oxygen because of an increase in central glycinergic tonic inhibitions, and (iii) did not affect gasping mechanisms. We suggest that ethanol exposure during early life can be a risk factor for the newborn respiratory adaptive mechanisms to a low oxygen environment...|$|E

40|$|Rationale: The {{hypothalamic}} {{arcuate nucleus}} (ARC) {{is considered a}} major site for leptin signaling that regulates several physiological processes. Objective: To test the hypothesis that leptin receptor in the ARC is required to mediate leptin-induced sympathetic activation. Methods and Results: First, we used the ROSA Cre-reporter mice to establish the feasibility of driving Cre expression in the ARC {{in a controlled manner}} with bilateral microinjection of adenovirus-expressing Cre-recombinase (Ad-Cre). Ad-Cre microinjection into the ARC of ObRflox/flox mice robustly reduced ObR expression and leptin-induced Stat 3 activation in the ARC but not in the adjacent nuclei, confirming the efficacy and selectivity of the ARC deletion of ObR. Critically, deletion of ObR in the ARC attenuated brown adipose tissue and renal sympathetic <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to leptin. We also examined whether ObR in the ARC is required for the preserved leptin-induced increase in renal sympathetic activity in dietary obesity. We found that deletion of ARC ObR abrogated leptin-induced increases in renal sympathetic discharge and resolved arterial pressure elevation in diet-induced obese ObRflox/flox mice. Conclusions: These data demonstrate a critical role for ObR in the ARC in mediating the sympathetic <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to leptin and in the adverse sympathoexcitatory effects of leptin in obesity.

This block requires a multi-stimulation technique that emphasizes {{the necessity of a}} rigorous and safe technique. Nerve injury associated with regional anesthesia can entail significant morbidity for patients. Thus, we investigated the brachial block sequence in terms of unintended nerve stimulation as a surrogate of potential nerve injury. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly allocated in two groups of 30. In Group I the radial nerve was blocked before the ulnar nerve. In Group II the ulnar nerve was blocked before the radial nerve. During the radial nerve approach we recorded, if present, an ulnar <b>nerve</b> <b>response.</b> During the ulnar nerve approach we recorded, if present, a radial <b>nerve</b> <b>response.</b> RESULTS: In Group I while looking for the radial nerve, in 50 % of the cases, an ulnar motor response was recorded.

However, the contribution of the CT in this process may depend upon the presence of other taste stimuli and/or differ in males and females. Accordingly, the present study investigated the role of the CT in free fatty acid taste processing by examining electrophysiological activity of the CT in response to the free fatty acid linoleic acid (LA), as well as by measuring behavioral responses to LA-taste mixtures. We recorded whole <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> from the CT in response to lingual application of LA with or without monosodium glutamate (MSG) in anesthetized male and female rats. In addition, we examined preferences for MSG + LA taste mixtures in behavioral tests. Although lingual application of LA alone did not produce CT whole <b>nerve</b> <b>responses,</b> coapplication of LA and MSG elicited greater CT responses than did MSG alone. These findings were paralleled by greater preferences for MSG + LA taste mixtures than for MSG alone. In both cases, the effect was particularly pronounced in male rats. Thus LA enhances CT activity and behavioral responses to LA + MSG taste mixtures, although there are sex differences in the effects. These results suggest that CT input is important in mediating behavioral responses to fat taste, but the effects depend upon other taste stimuli and differ in males and females...|$|R

Medial and lateral OC neurons make synapses with outer hair cells and with auditory nerve fibers, respectively. In addition to the OC system, there are also descending projections from the auditory cortex that are directed towards the thalamus, inferior colliculus, cochlear nucleus, and superior olivary complex. Olivocochlear function can be assessed by measuring a brainstem reflex mediated by auditory nerve fibers, cochlear nucleus neurons, and OC fibers. Although {{it is known that}} the OC reflex is activated by contralateral acoustic stimulation and produces a suppression of cochlear responses, the influence of cortical descending pathways in the OC reflex is largely unknown. Here, we used auditory cortex electrical microstimulation in chinchillas to study a possible cortical modulation of cochlear and auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>responses</b> to tones in the absence and presence of contralateral noise. We found that cortical microstimulation produces two different peripheral modulations: (i) changes in cochlear sensitivity evidenced by amplitude modulation of cochlear microphonics and auditory nerve compound action potentials and (ii) enhancement or suppression of the OC reflex strength as measured by auditory <b>nerve</b> <b>responses,</b> which depended on the intersubject variability of the OC reflex. Moreover, both corticofugal effects were not correlated, suggesting the presence of two functionally different efferent pathways.
