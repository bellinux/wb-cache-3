60|$|It will be said, perhaps, {{that the}} {{increased}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> in every article {{would give a}} spur to productive industry and that the whole produce of the island would be increased. This might in some degree be the case. But the spur that these fancied riches would give to population would more than counterbalance it, and the increased produce would be to be divided among a more than proportionably increased number of people. All this time I am supposing that the same quantity of work would be done as before. But this would not really take place. The receipt of five shillings a day, instead of eighteen pence, would make every man fancy himself comparatively rich and able to indulge himself in many hours or days of leisure. This would give a strong and immediate check to productive industry, and, in a short time, not only the nation would be poorer, but the lower classes themselves {{would be much more}} distressed than when they received only eighteen pence a day.|$|E
6000|$|In 1867 {{there were}} in Montserrat 400 squatters, holding lands of from 3 to 120 acres, planted with cacao, coffee, or provisions. [...] Some of the cacao {{plantations}} were valued at 1000 pounds. These people lived without paying taxes, and almost without law or religion. The Crown woods had been, of course, sadly plundered by squatters, and by others who should have known better. At every turn magnificent cedars might have been seen levelled by the axe, {{only a few feet}} of the trunk being used to make boards and shingles, while the greater part was left to rot or burn. These irregularities have been now almost stopped; and 266 persons, in Montserrat alone, have taken out grants of land, some of 400 acres. [...] But this by no means represents the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers,</b> as nearly an equal number have paid for their estates, though they have not yet received their grants, and nearly 500 more have made application.

60|$|About {{the time}} when the Pindaric odes of Cowley and his imitators, and the {{productions}} of that class of curious thinkers whom Dr. Johnson has strangely styled metaphysical Poets, were beginning to lose something of that extravagant admiration which they had excited, the 'Paradise Lost' made its appearance. 'Fit audience find though few,' was the petition addressed by the Poet to his inspiring Muse. I have said elsewhere that he gained more than he asked; this I believe to be true; but Dr. Johnson has fallen into a gross mistake when he attempts to prove, by the sale of the work, that Milton's Countrymen were 'just to it' upon its first appearance. Thirteen hundred Copies were sold in two years; an uncommon example, he asserts, of the prevalence of genius in opposition to so much recent enmity as Milton's public conduct had excited. But, be it remembered that, if Milton's political and religious opinions, {{and the manner in which}} he announced them had raised him many enemies, they had procured him numerous friends; who, as all personal danger was passed away at the time of publication, would be eager to procure the master-work of a man whom they revered, and whom they would be proud of praising. Take, from the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers,</b> persons of this class, and also those who wished to possess the Poem as a religious work, and but few I fear would be left who sought for it on account of its poetical merits. The demand did not immediately increase; 'for,' says Dr. Johnson, 'many more readers' (he means persons in the habit of reading poetry) 'than were supplied at first the Nation did not afford.' How careless must a writer be who can make this assertion in the face of so many existing title-pages to belie it! Turning to my own shelves, I find the folio of Cowley, seventh edition, 1681. A book near it is Flatman's Poems, fourth edition, 1686; Waller, fifth edition, same date. The Poems of Norris of Bemerton not long after went, I believe, through nine editions. What further demand there might be for these works I do not know; but I well remember, that, twenty-five years ago, the booksellers' stalls in London swarmed with the folios of Cowley. This is not mentioned in disparagement of that able writer and amiable man; but merely to show--that, if Milton's work were not more read, it was not because readers did not exist at the time. The early editions of the 'Paradise Lost' were printed in a shape which allowed them to be sold at a low price, yet only three thousand copies of the Work were sold in eleven years; and the Nation, says Dr. Johnson, had been satisfied from 1623 to 1664, that is, forty-one years, with only two editions of the Works of Shakspeare; which probably did not together make one thousand Copies; facts adduced by the critic to prove the 'paucity of Readers.'--There were readers in multitudes; but their money went for other purposes, as their admiration was fixed elsewhere. We are authorized, then, to affirm, that the reception of the 'Paradise Lost,' and the slow progress of its fame, are proofs as striking as can be desired that the positions which I am attempting to establish are not erroneous.[12]--How amusing to shape to one's self such a critique as a Wit of Charles's days, or a Lord of the Miscellanies or trading Journalist of King William's time, would have brought forth, if he had set his faculties industriously to work upon this Poem, every where impregnated with original excellence.|$|E

40|$|When {{the sales}} of land first took place under the Incumbered Estates Act, it was {{expected}} {{that there would be a}} very large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> English <b>purchasers.</b> So strong was this impression, that one of the Commissioners was selected from the conveyancing bar in England, with a view no doubt to give confidence to this class <b>of</b> <b>purchasers.</b> This expectation was founded on two economic fallacies; first, that Ireland was suffering from a want of capital; and secondly, that it required a very large amount of capital to buy incumbered estates. The first of these fallacies I endeavoured to expose in a paper read before the the British Association at Ipswich in 1851, and published in the Transactions of this society. The second fallacy admits of an easy refutation. If we only reflect that the incumbrances on land in Ireland are generally held by Irishmen, under such circumstances the more incumbered the estates are, the less capital is required in the aggregate to purchase them. The produce of each sale being applied in paying off incumbrances, sets free nearly as much capital as is absorbed in the purchase...|$|R

40|$|Common {{economic}} {{models of}} insurance theory assume that insurers play {{no role in}} modifying the loss potential. Individual loss prevention decisions tend to reduce risk and even often affect risk faced by others. Incorporating these important features into an insurance market, we argue that insurers may alter the loss potential via their pricing strategy. This is because the (market equilibrium) price of insurance affects the individuals' prevention decisions. Individuals weigh the cost associated with prevention against the price of insurance coverage. In particular, when the insurance market is monopolistic, the insurer {{will take advantage of}} this effect and determine loss propensities in a sense optimal for him. This is because different loss propensities affect the individuals' willingness to pay for insurance and thus the potential extent of expected profit per policy. Premiums are then optimally chosen to reflect the trade-off between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> and expected profit per policy. Such a strategic behavior of insurers may be a reason why they tend to invest in understanding the loss process: Insurers may indeed have an interest in understanding and eventually affecting underlying loss propensities in order to increase expected profits. Consistent with empirical evidence, we show that consumers are exposed to higher overall risk in a competitive insurance market compared with a monopolistic market...|$|E
30|$|As for {{positive}} consumption externalities, Katz and Shapiro (1985) observe the phenomenon whereby customer utility increases {{with the number}} of other customers consuming the same product. Positive externalities can be generated through a direct physical effect of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasers</b> {{on the quality of the}} product, or the indirect effects from complementary products and post-purchase service. Ellison and Fudenberg (1999) model a customer’s utility from a product with positive externalities as a function of the product’s inherent value and of the number of customers using the product. When it comes to pricing strategies, Teng et al. (2010) build a two-stage dynamic game model to study the optimal prices for the monopolist producing products with positive externalities. They find that the stronger the positive externalities are, the more necessary for the firm to decrease the prices in the first period and raise the prices in the second period. Winter and Sundqvist 2010 demonstrates that although penetration pricing can be recommended for these kinds of products in some cases, it is not suitable all the time. Premium prices can be charged depending on the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic product values. Different from Teng et al. (2010) and Winter and Sundqvist (2010), we model the positive externalities in customer utility, instead of in total demand function. We take both positive and negative consumption externalities into account at the same time. Note that a relevant paper of Wang, Wang and Lai (2017), which deals with both pricing and production strategies, facing customers with both Veblen and network effects. However, different from their paper, excluding the firm’s production strategy, we explicitly model customers as heterogeneous in their intrinsic valuations of the product.|$|E

One cost that is not included in calculations of housing stress, but which may be important, is the difference transport costs make. Especially in city areas, paying a premium for a house that is close to work may offset the additional transport costs incurred getting to work. So a measure of housing stress which includes transport costs may give a different picture of housing stress to a measure that ignores transport costs. In this paper, we argue that transport costs need {{to be taken into account}} in measuring housing stress not only in the capital cities but also outside capital cities. We find that in capital cities, bringing transport costs into a housing stress measure increases the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> both <b>purchasers</b> and renters in housing stress by 25 per cent, and it particularly affects households with children.

A questionnaire was completed by approximately 1000 households in each of eight EU countries (N[*]=[*] 8171).
