The song was first played on radio stations on July 29, 2009, following a leak of the track on the Internet on July 28, 2009. [...] "Party in the U.S.A."

Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne, Tove Lo, and Sky Ferreira have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently {{been recognized as}} the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for [...] "subverting [...] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." [...] According to music journalist Maria Raha, [...] "Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." [...] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: [...] "I hate genderizing things... when I heard Hole, I was amazed to hear a girl sing like that.

[...] Gallaher's biographer Matt Elliott asserts that in the century since his playing retirement [...] "his reputation as a player and leader have only enhanced". According to historian Terry McLean: [...] "In a long experience of reading and hearing about the man, one has never encountered, from the New Zealand angle, or from his fellow players, criticism of his qualities as a leader." [...] In the view of the English rugby journalist E. H. D. Sewell, writing soon after Gallaher's death, the New Zealand captain was [...] "a very quiet, taciturn sort of cove, who spoke rarely about football or his own achievements... I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> soul who met him on that famous trip, say a disparaging word about him." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{quadraphonic}} mix of {{the album}} was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. [...] The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo {{mix of the}} album was presented through a poor-quality public address system. [...] Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Makers Roy Hollingworth described side one as [...] "so utterly confused with itself {{it was difficult to}} follow", but praised side two, writing: [...] "The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night." [...] Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: [...] "I don't care if you've <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon". [...] In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side [...] "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement". In his 1981 review of the album, Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious, but called it a [...] "kitsch masterpiece" [...] that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the first}} and second season of {{promenade}} concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford's new opera Shamus O'Brien at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen's Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. [...] In January 1897 Wood took on the direction of the Queen's Hall's prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday". Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen's Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, [...] "Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "This Is It" [...] is a pop ballad with {{a simple}} mid-tempo {{keyboard}} that lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The song begins with Jackson singing, “This is it, here I stand / I’m {{the light of the}} world, I feel grand / Got this love I can feel / And I know yes for sure it is real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known [...] "since 1,000 years." [...] Jackson's brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon (credited as The Jacksons) are featured as background vocals throughout the song. Background music includes fingersnaps, a [...] "soaring chorus," [...] big-build strings and [...] "bubbly guitars." [...] The song is played in the key of Bb major. Throughout the song, Jackson's vocal range spans from F4 to C6. The song's tempo is moderate, and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute. According to the music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing and the Winnipeg Sun, the song is written in common time. The lyrics [...] "toggle between grandiosity" [...] ("This is it, here I stand / I'm the light of the world, I feel grand") and [...] "shy, romantic yearning" [...] ("I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> single word about you / Falling in love wasn't my plan"). Darrly Sterdan of the Winnipeg Sun felt that Jackson's voice and the background music sounded [...] "like a demo that's been fleshed out with overdubs and doowoppy backup vocals from his brothers." [...] Anthony McCartney, of the Associated Press felt that the finger-snap percussion [...] "echoes" [...] that present in Jackson's 1982 song [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] with Paul McCartney.|$|E
500|$|In April 1967, the Australian {{government}} committed No.2 Squadron and its Canberra bombers {{to action}} in the Vietnam War. Operating from Phan Rang Air Base outside Saigon, {{under the direction of}} the US 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW), the Canberras were initially engaged in medium-altitude missions against Viet Cong forces, guided by Sky Spot ground radar, usually at night. Promoted to wing commander, Evans assumed control of the squadron in December 1967. Having <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> shot fired in anger in his 24 years of service, he was anxious for a combat assignment. The Japanese surrender in August 1945 had prevented him from seeing action in World WarII, and the Korean War had ended just as he was on the verge of a posting for active duty with No.77 Squadron. [...] "Vietnam", he reasoned, [...] "would be my last chance". By the time he took command, the Canberras were flying a greater proportion of their missions at lower levels in daylight, using visual bomb-aiming methods honed during their earlier service in Malaysia; this gave the bombers an average circular error probability (CEP) of 50metres. Evans introduced intensive post-mission analysis to refine their technique, and permitted his pilots to bomb at the lowest level possible at which the bombsight would operate. The CEP was eventually reduced to 20metres, making the Canberras the most accurate bombing force in the region. In January 1968, the unit participated in the air campaigns to defend Huế and Khe Sanh during the Tet Offensive. Phan Rang itself was often subjected to harassing attacks and mortar fire from the Viet Cong, requiring Evans to undertake improvements to the airfield's ground defences. He completed his posting to Vietnam in November 1968 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his performance as commanding officer of No.2 Squadron. The decoration was gazetted on 2May 1969 and backdated to 13March.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a clip of a poster in Gary {{pointing}} fans toward Jackson's childhood home, {{at the corner of}} 2300 Jackson Street and Jackson Family Boulevard and the sound of a vintage recording of one of Jackson's siblings yelling [...] "Michael" [...] repeatedly. An image, that is shown several times during the video, shows a one-way traffic sign near Jackson's old house that is covered in graffiti honoring Jackson, including [...] "we luv yuh Michael." [...] Images, shown as a slide-show, of Jackson performing as a child are mixed in with shots of play sets, baseball bats and Gary's gritty industrial skyline. A central image captured by Lee is a 'plea' for tolerance etched onto a stop sign in Gary, where someone had written the message [...] "This Is It" [...] above the word [...] "Stop" [...] under which they've added [...] "hatin'." [...] Interspersed is archival footage of Jackson throughout his career and of him greeting his fans {{in various parts of the}} world. There are also shots of the musician's fans paying tribute in their own Jackson memorabilia to him following his death. At one point in the video, one of the lyrics from the song, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> single word about you," [...] floats up out of the concrete, fading into two more shots of fan tributes from around the world and multiple flowers and messages laid at the gates of Jackson's Neverland Ranch. The video, several times, shows a single red balloon floating in the air and empty swings swaying in the breeze. Towards the end of the video, there is footage of Jackson doing one of his signature dance moves, the moonwalk. It [...] ends with footage of a black stool with Jackson's trademark black fedora and silver glove on top of it under a spotlight in front of his family's Gary residence at night.|$|E
