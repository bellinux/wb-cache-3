50|$|Isolation {{cells are}} used to prevent short circuit current. As the name suggests, these cells isolate the power gated block from the <b>normally-On</b> block. Isolation cells are {{specially}} designed for low short circuit current when input is at threshold voltage level. Isolation control signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state retention schemes are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.|$|E

40|$|Using {{conventional}} AlGaN/GaN HEMT {{structures that}} typically deliver <b>normally-on</b> (or depletion-mode) operation, a novel metal- 2 DEG tunnel junction FET {{has been successfully}} demonstrated. The AlGaN/GaN heterojunction delivers high-density 2 DEG without any intentional doping, allowing {{the formation of a}} thin tunnel barrier with minimum impurity scattering when a Schottky contact is made to the 2 DEG from the sideway. The TJ-FETs exhibit normally-off operation in an otherwise <b>normally-on</b> as-grown sample owing to a current controlling scheme different from that in the conventional FETs. The thickness of the tunnel barrier is controlled by the bias at an overlaying gate electrode. A positive gate bias results in a nanometer-thick barrier that leads to efficient tunnelling current, while a zero gate bias results in a thicker barrier that effectively blocks the current flow. High on-state tunnel current (326 mA/mm), low off-state leakage (10 (- 8) mA/mm) and high off-state breakdown voltage (557 V) are obtained on a standard AlGaN/GaN heterostructure grown on 4 -inch (111) Si substrate...|$|E

40|$|Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, such as {{gallium nitride}} (GaN), {{are more and}} more being used in {{switching}} power devices. An AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN Double Heterojunction Field Effect transistor (DHFET) was developed in previous work and needed to be tested. The used test circuit was a buck converter. This type of converter, in addition with the <b>normally-on</b> switching behaviour of the GaN-based transistors, requires dedicated gate drive circuitry, resulting in the development of three types of gate-drivers. This paper presents the topology and performance of these drivers. Because of the type of converter, the drivers need to be galvanically isolated. Furthermore, because the experimental GaN transistors are <b>normally-on,</b> the drivers need to be robust so that they apply a negative gate-to-source voltage to switch off the transistor in case an error occurs in the driver. A third requirement for the drivers is {{that it has to be}} easy to adjust the voltage levels, in order to test the devices at different gate-to-source voltage conditions. A final requirement is that it has to be possible to construct the drivers with readily available electronic components. Because the drivers are galvanically isolated, there is a parasitic isolation capacitance in the DC-DC-converter of the drivers. This gives rise to a common-mode current which possibly can disturb the operation of the driver. The article also discusses this common-mode problem. status: publishe...|$|E
