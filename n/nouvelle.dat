5|$|Mary Shelley's {{studies were}} broad during these years. She {{began to study}} Greek in 1820 and read widely on education.

5|$|After this, Lemoine {{published}} another {{series of}} papers, including {{a series on}} what he called transformation continue (continuous transformation), which related mathematical equations to geometrical objects. This meaning stood separately from the modern definition of transformation. His papers on this subject included, Sur les transformations systématiques des formules relatives au triangle (1891), Étude sur une <b>nouvelle</b> transformation continue (1891), Une règle d'analogies dans le triangle et la spécification de certaines analogies à une transformation dite transformation continue (1893), and Applications au tétraèdre de la transformation continue (1894).|$|E
5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, <b>Nouvelle</b> Expérience was created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E
5|$|With Saltimbanco {{finished}} and touring in the United States and Canada, Cirque du Soleil toured Japan {{in the summer}} of 1992 {{at the behest of the}} Fuji Television Network. Taking acts from <b>Nouvelle</b> Expérience and Cirque Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced a show that took place in an arena rather than a big top. It was also the first that Cirque du Soleil performed outside of North America.|$|E

5|$|Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent led the {{scientific}} expedition. Additionally, he made detailed botanical studies. He gathered {{a multitude of}} specimens: Flore de Morée (1832) lists 1,550 plants, of which 33 were orchids and 91 were grasses (just 42 species {{had not yet been}} described); <b>Nouvelle</b> Flore du Péloponnèse et des Cyclades (1838) described 1,821 species. In Morea, Bory de Saint-Vincent was content to collect plants. He proceeded to classify, identify and describe them upon his return to France. Then he was aided, not by his collaborators from Greece, but by Louis Athanase Chaubard, Jean-Baptiste Fauché and Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart. Similarly, the naturalists Étienne and Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire helped edit the expedition’s scientific works.|$|E
5|$|The keel for San Martino {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne, France, on 22 July 1862. She was launched on 21 September 1863, and completed on 9 November 1864. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.|$|E
5|$|Asar-i Tevfik {{was ordered}} in 1865 by the {{government}} of Egypt as Ibrahimiye and laid down two years later at the French Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipyard in La Seyne. The ship was launched in 1868 and completed by 1869 for sea trials. In the meantime, Egypt had transitioned from a state directly ruled by the Ottoman government to the autonomous Khedivate of Egypt, and on 29 August 1868 the Khedivate transferred the ship to the Ottoman Navy. She was commissioned as Asar-i Tevfik in 1870. Upon completion, Asar-i Tevfik and the other ironclads then being built in Britain and France were sent to Crete to assist in stabilizing the island {{in the aftermath of the}} Cretan Revolt of 18661869. During this period, the Ottoman fleet, under Hobart Pasha, remained largely inactive, with training confined to reading translated British instruction manuals.|$|E

5|$|Formidabile {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne, France in December 1860, originally ordered by the Navy of the Kingdom of Sardinia. She was launched on 1 October 1861 and was completed in May 1862; by this time, the Sardinian fleet had been reformed as the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much weaker than his own.

5|$|Four shipbuilders {{submitted}} bids: the Italian Gio. Ansaldo & C. led a {{group that}} also included the Austro-Hungarian Škoda Works and the French Marrel Freres Forges de La Loire et du Midi; the French Schneider-Creusot firm partnered with Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée and Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde; the Spanish Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), which was formed by Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company; {{and a group of}} Spanish industrialists backed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and William Beardmore and Company. Only the first three proposals were seriously considered, as the fourth was considered to be too vague. The Junta Superior de la Armada (the Navy Staff) and the Navy Minister were responsible for reviewing the three proposals. Ansaldo prepared two design variants; the first called for four twin gun turrets for the main battery, with one forward, one aft, and two offset amidships. The second proposal had two triple turrets, fore and aft, with a twin turret on the centerline amidships. Artillery experts in the Navy rejected the second variant. The SECN and Schneider designs also featured the same arrangement as the first Ansaldo proposal.|$|E
5|$|Lehuby's company readied a ship at Le Havre {{and began}} to gather French emigrants, of whom about 30 {{obtained}} passports to travel to Poyais. Discarding the idea of co-operation with Spain, MacGregor published a new Poyaisian constitution in Paris in August 1825, this time describing it as a republic—he remained head of state, with the title Cazique—and on 18 August raised a new £300,000 loan through Thomas Jenkins & Company, an obscure London bank, offering 2.5% interest per annum. No evidence survives {{to suggest that the}} relevant bonds were issued. The Sketch was condensed and republished as a 40-page booklet called Some Account of the Poyais Country. French government officials became suspicious when an additional 30 people requested passports to travel to this country they had never heard of, and ordered the <b>Nouvelle</b> Neustrie company's ship to be kept in port. Some of the would-be emigrants became concerned themselves and made complaints to the police, which led to the arrest of Hippisley and MacGregor's secretary Thomas Irving in Paris in the early hours on 4 September 1825. Lehuby's ship never left Le Havre, and his colonists gradually dispersed.|$|E

5|$|Marceau {{was ordered}} in October 1880, {{but was not}} laid down until 27 January 1882 at the Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée {{shipyard}} in La Seyne-sur-Mer. Work proceeded slowly, {{and she was not}} launched until April 1890. This was a result of the influence of Admiral Théophile Aube, who was the Minister of Marine in 188687; Aube was a staunch advocate of the so-called Jeune École and opposed new battleship construction. Fitting out work was completed much more quickly, however, and she was commissioned into the French fleet on 14 March 1891. After her commissioning, she joined a French fleet that visited Kronstadt and was inspected by Czar Alexander III of Russia. On the return voyage, the fleet stopped in Spithead, where Queen Victoria reviewed the ships. This {{turned out to be the}} only time Marceau operated in the Atlantic; after returning to France, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, where she remained for the duration of her career.|$|E
5|$|Regina Maria Pia {{was built}} at the French {{shipyard}} Société <b>Nouvelle</b> des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne. Her keel was laid down on 22 July 1862 and her completed hull was launched on 28 April 1863. The ship was completed on 17 April 1864 and delivered to the Italian fleet. In June 1866, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} placement of object pronouns in Middle French infinitival constructions.
