25|$|The Lake Erie water snake, a {{subspecies}} of the <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snake</b> (Nerodia sipedon), {{lives in}} the vicinity of Ohio's Put-in-Bay Harbor, and had been put on the threatened species list. A threatened species is one which may soon become an endangered species. By 2010, the water snake population was over 12,000 snakes. While they have a non-venomous bite, they are a key predator in the lake's aquatic ecosystem since they feed on mudpuppies and walleye and smallmouth bass. The snake was helpful in keeping the population of goby fish in check. They mate from late May through early June and can be found in large mating balls with one female bunched with several males.|$|E
2500|$|Timber rattlesnakes—one of two venomous snake {{species in}} the Smokies—are found at all {{elevations}} in the range. [...] The other venomous snake, the copperhead, is typically found at lower elevations. [...] Other reptiles include the eastern box turtle, the eastern fence lizard, the black rat snake, and the <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Paulins Kill {{watershed}} {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of other animals. Other mammals include eastern chipmunk, [...] porcupine, black bear, striped skunk, river otter, and bobcat. Common northeastern American reptiles found there include snakes such as the American copperhead, [...] eastern diamondback rattlesnake, <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snake,</b> common garter snake and milk snake, and turtles, including the eastern box turtle, and common snapping turtle.|$|E
50|$|Large {{populations of}} turtles inhabit Cootes Paradise, {{including}} Painted Turtles, Common Snapping Turtles, and Northern Map Turtles. Several species of snakes {{are also found}} in the area, including <b>Northern</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Snakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{pickerel}} frog's poisonous secretions cannot {{stop all}} creatures; green frogs, bull frogs, <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snakes,</b> eastern ribbon snakes, and common garter snakes are their usual predators. When threatened, pickerel frogs will {{jump into the}} water and dive to the bottom to escape predators like birds and snakes.|$|R

50|$|The park's {{combination}} of freshwater swamp and upland, {{as well as}} its location between northern and southern physiographic regions, allows for a great diversity of plant and animal life. Notable plant species include flowering dogwood and mountain laurel in the spring, bald cypress, tupelo, yellow pond lily, and loblolly pine. Animals observed include northern river otters, muskrat, prothonotary warblers, pileated woodpeckers, bald eagles, <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snakes,</b> and broad-headed skinks as well as over 50 species of fish, including largemouth bass and chain pickerel.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the animals}} {{that live in the}} Northeastern coastal {{deciduous}} forests are white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, red foxes, sparrows, chickadees, Copperheads, rattlesnakes, <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snakes,</b> Box turtles, Snapping Turtles, garter snakes, snails, coyotes, black bears, beavers, woodchucks and raccoons. Chickadees, white-tailed deer, and eastern gray squirrels can be seen quite often. Gray wolves used to be quite common, but are extirpated, causing endemic growth in deer populations near suburban areas, with eastern coyotes generally taking their place by the mid-20th century.|$|R

25|$|The Upper Peninsula {{contains}} a large variety of wildlife. Some of the mammals {{found in the}} U.P. include shrews, moles, mice, white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, cougar, gray and red foxes, wolves, river otters, martens, fishers, muskrats, bobcats, coyotes, snowshoe hares, cotton-tail rabbits, porcupines, chipmunks, squirrels, raccoons, opossum and bats. There is a large variety of birds, including hawks, osprey, owls, gulls, hummingbirds, chickadees, robins, woodpeckers, warblers, and bald eagles. In terms of reptiles and amphibians, the U.P. has common garter snakes, red bellied <b>snakes,</b> pine <b>snakes,</b> <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snakes,</b> brown snakes, eastern garter snakes, eastern fox snakes, eastern ribbon back snakes, green snakes, northern ringneck snakes, Eastern Milk Snakes (Mackinac and Marquette counties) and Eastern Hognose snakes (Menominee County only), plus snapping turtles, wood turtles, and painted turtles (the state reptile), green frogs, bullfrogs, northern leopard frogs, and salamanders. Lakes and rivers contain many fish such as walleye, muskie, northern pike, trout, salmon, bullhead catfish, and bass. Invasive species like the alewife and sea lamprey {{can be found in}} the Great Lakes. The U.P. also contains many shellfish, such as clams, aquatic snails, and crayfish. The American Bird Conservancy and the National Audubon Society have designated several locations as internationally Important Bird Areas.|$|R
50|$|Bullfrogs are an {{important}} item of prey to many birds (especially large herons), North American river otters (Lontra canadensis), predatory fish, and occasionally other amphibians. Predators of American bullfrogs once in their adult stages can range from 150 g belted kingfishers (Megaceryle alcyon) to 1,100 pound American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis). The eggs and larvae are unpalatable to many salamanders and fish, but {{the high levels of}} activity of the tadpoles may make them more noticeable to a predator not deterred by their unpleasant taste. Humans hunt bullfogs as game and consume their legs. Adult frogs try to escape by splashing and leaping into deep water. A trapped individual may squawk or emit a piercing scream, which may surprise the attacker sufficiently for the frog to escape. An attack on one bullfrog is likely to alert others in the vicinity to danger and they will all retreat into the safety of deeper water. Bullfrogs may be at least partially resistant to the venom of copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix) and cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus) snakes, though these species are known natural predators of bullfrogs as are <b>northern</b> <b>water</b> <b>snakes</b> (Nerodia sipedon).|$|R
5000|$|MacLeay’s <b>Water</b> <b>Snake</b> is {{a largely}} nocturnal species that is {{typically}} found in coastal <b>Northern</b> Territory. The <b>water</b> <b>snakes</b> {{spend most of}} their time in or near water where they feed; they will only leave to bask in the sun or breed. They are found mostly in freshwater lagoons, swamps and creeks and can also be found sheltering in vegetation near water. Their range increases markedly during wet season flooding. Their most defining characteristic is their stout bodies and strongly keeled scales. In terms of breeding, <b>water</b> <b>snakes</b> are viviparous which means that they give birth to up to 15 [...] live offspring instead of laying eggs. They are a mildly venomous species with rear-facing fangs.|$|R
