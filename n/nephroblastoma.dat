40|$|Aberrant wnt-signaling {{caused by}} {{mutations}} in CTNNB 1 occurs in about 15 % of Wilms tumors. Nuclear beta-catenin protein, a substitute marker of active wnt-signaling, has been detected {{in an even}} higher proportion (< 50 %) of Wilms tumors suggesting alternative genetic pathways leading to beta-catenin activation. Thus, targeting wnt-signaling may become an important future therapeutic strategy in Wilms tumor patients. Currently, chemically-induced rat <b>nephroblastomas</b> provide the only available rodent model for this tumor. To determine the contribution of active wnt-signaling in this model, we investigated 25 chemically-induced rat <b>nephroblastomas</b> for beta-catenin protein expression and for Ctnnb 1 exon 3 mutations. Using immunohistochemistry 16 of 25 tumors showed strong nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin protein although in a heterogenous pattern. Blastemal and mesenchymal compartments displayed nuclear positive cells more frequently than areas of epithelial differentiation. Interestingly, we found no mutation of exon 3 of Ctnnb 1 {{in any of the}} 25 tumors analysed. In conclusion, our findings suggest activation of wnt-signaling {{in the vast majority of}} chemically-induced rat <b>nephroblastomas.</b> Nuclear expression of beta-catenin in the absence of Ctnnb 1 mutations implies, however, alternate mutational targets in rat <b>nephroblastomas.</b> Chemically-induced rat <b>nephroblastomas</b> may constitute a suitable model system to test future anti-cancer drugs targeting the wnt-signaling pathway. betabeta...|$|R

40|$|Avian myeloblastosis-associated virus-induced <b>nephroblastomas</b> are tumors {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} mesenchymal and epithelial renal elements with variable degrees of differentiation. The {{spatial distribution of}} developmental stages reflects a gradient of differentiation from less differential structures in the periphery towards more differentiated structures {{in the center of}} the lobules formed in the <b>nephroblastomas.</b> These heterogenic tumors contain discrete virus-cell DNA junction fragments and are therefore clonal outgrowths of a single transformed cell. These findings support the hypothesis that a mesenchymal, nephrogenic cell residual in the postembryonic kidney is the origin of the tumor, which grows by proliferation and differentiation of this target cell. All the tumors expressed higher levels of viral genomic and env messages than nontransformed tissue from the same kidney. A screening of oncogene expression with 13 different oncogenes revealed enhanced myc levels. There was, however, no rearrangement of c-myc or of the other oncogenes detected with EcoRI-digested tumor DNAs. This suggests that there is no insertion of viral elements adjacent to a c-myc. The levels of myc expression in embryonic kidneys were as high as in the tumors. Therefore, the enhanced myc expression in <b>nephroblastomas</b> is a reflection of the embryonic status of the tumor rather than a newly acquired function. This finding, plus the similarity of development and morphology of <b>nephroblastomas</b> and embryonic kidneys, suggests that the tumors arise as a result of a deficiency in a function which turns the embryonic status off...|$|R

40|$|Wilms' tumors, or <b>nephroblastomas,</b> {{are thought}} to arise from {{abnormal}} postnatal retention and dysregulated differentiation of nephrogenic progenitor cells that originate as a condensed metanephric mesenchyme within embryonic kidneys. We have previously shown that the transcriptional regulator CITED 1 (CBP/p 300 -interacting transactivators with glutamic acid [E]/aspartic acid [D]-rich C-terminal domain) is expressed exclusively in these nephrogenic progenitor cells and is downregulated as they differentiate to form nephronic epithelia. In the current study, we show that CITED 1 expression persists in blastemal cell populations of both experimental rat <b>nephroblastomas</b> and human Wilms' tumors, and that primary human Wilms' tumors presenting with disseminated disease show {{the highest level of}} CITED 1 expression. Unlike the predominantly cytoplasmic subcellular localization of CITED 1 in the normal developing kidney, CITED 1 is clearly detectable in the nuclear compartment of Wilms' tumor blastema. These findings indicate that CITED 1 is a marker of primitive blastema in Wilms' tumors and suggest that persistent expression and/or altered subcellular localization of CITED 1 in the condensed metanephric mesenchyme could play a role in Wilms' tumor initiation and pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Subgroup F avian {{leukosis}} viruses, such as RAV- 61 and ring-necked pheasant virus, are recombinants between exogenous chicken retroviruses and endogenous pheasant viruses and contain new envelope (env) genes. Chickens infected as 10 -day-old embryos with subgroup F viruses develop fibrosarcomas, <b>nephroblastomas,</b> osteopetrosis, B-cell lymphomas, {{and a high}} incidence of a proliferative disorder involving the lung. Fibrosarcomas, <b>nephroblastomas,</b> and lymphomas appear after long latent periods (3 to 12 months). They contain discrete virus-cell junction fragments and are therefore clonal outgrowths of a single infected cell. Two ring-necked pheasant virus-induced B-cell lymphomas and an adenocarcinoma of the abdomen contained proviruses integrated at the c-myc locus and elevated levels of myc mRNA. At least four of the fibrosarcomas appeared to contain proviruses integrated at a common site, suggesting that a specific cellular gene may be involved in these tumors. The host gene has not been identified, however; 16 different oncogene probes failed to hybridize to fibrosarcoma junction fragments. In contrast to these neoplasms, lung lesions appeared rapidly (4 to 5 weeks), showed no evidence of clonality, and lacked long terminal repeat-initiated transcripts other than viral 35 S and 21 S mRNA. We conclude, therefore, that subgroup F retroviruses induce the proliferative disorder of the lung by a different mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to define the {{structural}} response of unresectable Wilms' tumor following preoperative chemotherapy by computed tomography (CT). We also compared CT changes in relation to histopathological nature. The study included 36 patients with 41 <b>nephroblastomas.</b> All were examined by CT before preoperative chemotherapy using multiphasic CT protocol study. The unresectability was diagnosed by CT imaging. All patients were subjected to fine-needle biopsy (FNB) to confirm the diagnosis and to define the histopathological type before preoperative chemotherapy. Five patients had unfavorable pathology and 31 patients with 36 <b>nephroblastomas</b> had favorable pathology. All patients received first line of treatment. Follow-up of these patients by CT at the 6 th week was reviewed. All of our patients were diagnosed as unresectable Wilms' tumor by CT. Preoperative chemotherapy was started. Among our patients, 28 (77. 8 %) gave good response in the form of significant reduction in tumor size, disappearance of one tumor in two cases with bilateral WT and inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus, and increased nonenhancing necrotizing content. Two patients with unfavorable pathology did not show any response. The remaining six patients gave partial response. CT can be used to evaluate tumor response and resectability after preoperative chemotherapy with high accuracy. The response to preoperative chemotherapy is not related to the histopathological classifications...|$|R

40|$|Histological and anatomopathological studies {{performed}} on 152 independent myeloblastosis-associated virus type 1 (MAV 1) -induced <b>nephroblastomas</b> {{allowed us to}} precisely define the chronology of tumor development in chickens. Three tumors representing increasing developmental stages were used to construct genomic libraries and to study both the state of proviral genomes and the sites of MAV 1 integration in genomic DNA. We established that increasing levels of proviral rearrangement, eventually leading to the elimination of infectious MAV genomes, were associated with tumor progression and that 22 individual tumors, representative of different developmental stages, did not contain any common MAV 1 integration site. Cloning of cellular fragments flanking the MAV 1 -related proviruses in tumor DNA showed that each one of eight <b>nephroblastomas</b> tested expressed {{a high level of}} an as yet unidentified cellular gene (nov) whose transcription is normally arrested in adult kidney cells. Cloning of the normal nov gene established that in one tumor, fused long terminal repeat-truncated nov mRNA species were expressed, indicating that at least in that case, the high level of nov expression was {{under the control of the}} MAV long terminal repeat promoter. The normal nov gene encodes a putative 32 -kDa secreted polypeptide, which is a member of a new family of proteins likely to be involved in cell growth regulation.

Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded tissue sections were stained with monoclonal anti-p 53 antibody (DO- 7, Dako) using a peroxidase-labelled streptavidin biotin kit. Five of seven tumours (71. 4 %) with unfavourable histology, but only 3 of 86 favourable histology tumours, showed 'high' p 53 immunoexpression (P < 0. 001). p 53 expression in unfavourable histology tumours was present in both anaplastic and non-anaplastic components. Moreover, there was uniform staining of blastema, epithelium and stroma in unfavourable histology tumours. No statistical difference in p 53 expression was found between patients who had received {{and those who had}} not received preoperative chemotherapy (P = 0. 678).

50|$|Lim-1’s {{expression}} is controlled {{in part by}} the sonic hedgehog-Gli signaling pathway. Recent studies in mice have shown that Lim-1 silencing halts tumor growth and impairs tumor cell movement via inhibition of protein expression involved in metastatic spread. Therefore, in tumor cells Lim-1 acts as an oncogene. Thus, targeting Lim-1 can be a potential cancer therapy. In addition, Lim-1 is important in rodent renal development. Lim-1 deficiency results in development of multicystic kidney, whereas, its expression can contribute to pathogenesis of <b>nephroblastomas.</b> Also, Lim-1 plays a role in embryonic retinal development.
