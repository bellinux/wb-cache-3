The chromosomes are composed of multiple genes, each gene encoding a smaller sub-program.

50|$|In 1872 after {{completing}} {{a course in}} engineering at Ghent University, Moens began to study medicine at Leiden University. He became a pathology assistant in 1874 and in 1875 (probably) he took up an appointment as assistant to Adriaan Heynsius, Professor of Physiology at Leiden. In this role he began his work on arterial wave travel using reservoirs, elastic tubes and air chambers. These studies {{formed the basis of}} this doctorate in 1877 and were published in a 145-page monograph, Die Pulscurve, in 1878. The key finding of this work was an empirical relationship that described the velocity of pulse propagation in elastic tubes. Except for a <b>numerical</b> <b>constant</b> {{this turned out to be}} identical to the theoretical prediction derived by Diederik Korteweg in 1878 and the relationship is now known as the Moens-Korteweg equation. In 1878 he retired from physiological research and became a medical practitioner in Goes. He was offered the chair of physiology in Leiden in 1885 when Hynsius died, but he turned it down. Willem Einthoven was subsequently appointed to the post.|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} of 1/f noise spectrum in voltage or current {{is done in}} the same way as the {{measurement of}} other types of noises. Sampling spectrum analyzers take a finite-time sample from the noise and calculate the Fourier transform by FFT algorithm. Then, after calculating the squared absolute value of the Fourier spectrum, they calculate its average value by repeating this sampling process by a sufficiently large number of times. The resulting pattern is proportional to the power-density spectrum of the measured noise. It is then normalized by the duration of the finite-time sample and also by a <b>numerical</b> <b>constant</b> in the order of 1 to get its exact value. This procedure gives correct spectral data only deeply within the frequency window determined by the reciprocal of the duration of the finite-time sample (low-frequency end) and the digital sampling rate of the noise (high-frequency end). Thus the upper and the lower half decades of the obtained power density spectrum are usually discarded from the spectrum. Conventional spectrum analyzers that sweep a narrow filtered band over the signal have good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), since they are narrow-band instruments. Unfortunately, these instruments do not operate at frequencies low enough to fully measure flicker noise. Sampling instruments are broadband, and hence high noise. They reduce the noise by taking multiple sample traces and averaging them. Conventional spectrum analyzers still have better SNR due to their narrow-band acquisition.|$|E
