50|$|Many <b>nano-optics</b> designs {{look like}} common {{microwave}} or radiowave circuits, but shrunk {{down by a}} factor of 100,000 or more. After all, radiowaves, microwaves, and visible light are all electromagnetic radiation; they differ only in frequency. So other things equal, a microwave circuit shrunk down {{by a factor of}} 100,000 will behave the same way but at 100,000 times higher frequency. For example, researchers have made nano-optical Yagi-Uda antennas following essentially the same design as used for radio Yagi-Uda antennas. Metallic parallel-plate waveguides (striplines), lumped-constant circuit elements such as inductance and capacitance (at visible light frequencies, the values of the latter being of the order of femtohenries and attofarads, respectively), and impedance-matching of dipole antennas to transmission lines, all familiar techniques at microwave frequencies, are some current areas of nanophotonics development. That said, {{there are a number of}} very important differences between <b>nano-optics</b> and scaled-down microwave circuits. For example, at optical frequency, metals behave much less like ideal conductors, and also exhibit interesting plasmon-related effects like kinetic inductance and surface plasmon resonance. Likewise, optical fields interact with semiconductors in a fundamentally different way than microwaves do.|$|E

5000|$|Because of {{the small}} size of the fluidic conduits, nanofluidic {{structures}} are naturally applied in situations demanding that samples be handled in exceedingly small quantities, including Coulter counting, analytical separations and determinations of biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, and facile handling of mass-limited samples. One of the more promising areas of nanofluidics is its potential for integration into microfluidic systems, i.e. micrototal analytical systems or lab-on-a-chip structures. For instance, NCAMs, when incorporated into microfluidic devices, can reproducibly perform digital switching, allowing transfer of fluid from one microfluidic channel to another, selectivity separate and transfer analytes by size and mass, mix reactants efficiently, and separate fluids with disparate characteristics. In addition, there is a natural analogy between the fluid handling capabilities of nanofluidic structures and the ability of electronic components to control the flow of electrons and holes. This analogy has been used to realize active electronic functions such as rectification and field-effect and bipolar transistoraction with ionic currents. Application of nanofluidics is also to <b>nano-optics</b> for producing tuneable microlens array ...|$|E
40|$|In the 1990 s, optical {{technology}} and photonics industry developed fast, but further progress became difficult {{due to a}} fundamental limit of light known as the diffraction limit. This limit could be overcome using the novel technology of <b>nano-optics</b> or nanophotonics in which {{the size of the}} electromagnetic field is decreased down to the nanoscale and is used as a carrier for signal transmission, processing, and fabrication. Such a decrease beyond the diffraction limit is possible by using optical near-fields. The true nature of <b>nano-optics</b> and nanophotonics involves not only their abilities to meet the above requirements but also their abilities to realize qualitative innovations in photonic devices, fabrication techniques, energy conversion and information processing systems. The objective of this work is to review the innovations of optical science and technology by <b>nano-optics</b> and nanophotonics. While in conventional optical science and technology, light and matter are discussed separately, in <b>nano-optics</b> and nanophotonics, light and matter have to be regarded as being coupled to each other, and the energy flow between nanoparticles is bidirectional. This means that <b>nano-optics</b> and nanophotonics have to be regarded as a technology fusing optical fields and matter. This unique work reviews and covers the most recent topics of <b>nano-optics,</b> applications to device operations, fabrication techniques, energy conversion, information processing, architectures and algorithms. Each chapter is written by the leading scientists in the relevant field. Thus, this work will provide high-quality scientific and technical information to scientists, engineers, and graduate students who are and will be engaged in R&D of <b>nano-optics</b> and nanophotonics.

40|$|<b>Nano-optics</b> {{is a new}} {{approach}} to the investigation of nano-scale light-matter interactions. The main branch, Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy (SNOM), however, is su®ering from a major technological shortcomings, namely the di±culty to generate suitable probes. Therefore, routine operation at high resolution is still rare and requires the achievement of failure-free operation conditions. Another new research area is the investigation of nano-scale matter transport by means of solid state electrolysis and scanning probe microscopes. Solid sample as well as solid probes made of such material permit nano-scale electrolytic reaction areas where highly localized structures can be deposition and removed.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of focusing light to an ever tighter spot {{has important implications}} for many applications and fields of optics research, such as <b>nano-optics</b> and plasmonics, laser-scanning microscopy, optical data storage and many more. The size of lateral features of the field at the focus depends on several parameters, including the numerical aperture of the focusing system, but also the wavelength and polarization, phase and intensity distribution of the input beam. Here, we study the smallest achievable focal feature sizes of coherent superpositions of two co-propagating beams carrying opposite orbital angular momentum. We investigate the feature sizes for this class of beams not only in the scalar limit, but also use a fully vectorial treatment to discuss the case of tight focusing. Both our numerical simulations and our experimental results confirm that lateral feature sizes considerably smaller than those of a tightly focused Gaussian light beam can be observed. These findings may pave the way for improving the resolution of imaging systems or may find applications in <b>nano-optics</b> experiments. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

30|$|Recently, <b>nano-optics</b> are {{attracting}} great attentions {{not only}} for measuring physical properties such as optical responses [1, 2], Raman scattering [3], and magnetic properties but also for reactions of molecules and/or controlling of spins. In those cases, polarization states in <b>nano-optics</b> are very important, because those phenomena are dependent on the polarization of light. For example, spin manipulation with light is attracting attentions because light may have abilities of controlling the direction of magnetization in a time scale of several tenth nanoseconds. Stanciu et al. reported that magnetization direction of GdFeCo is optically switched by a 40  fs circularly polarized light (CPL) pulse [4]. Satoh et al. demonstrated the spin-wave emission and the directional control of propagation using the CPL or linearly polarized light (LPL) [5]. These new phenomena may lead to controlling single spin with light. On the other hand, CPL has been also used to measure circular dichroism (CD) due to the geometric and electromagnetic chiral properties of single molecule [6], biomolecules [7], and singe-wall carbon nanotube [8]. In those cases, obviously, each single molecule can be selectively investigated if nano-sized CPL is available.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} and localized electric field distribution of nanostructures {{are the most}} important parameters in the plasmonic field for <b>nano-optics</b> and nanobiosensors. In this paper, we propose a novel nanostructure which may be used for nanobiosensor applications. The effect of nanoholes on the plasmonic properties of star nanostructure was studied via numerical simulation, using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In the model, the material type and size of the nanostructures was fixed, but the distance between the monotor and the surface of the nanoholes was varied. For example, nanoholes were located {{in the center of the}} nanostructures. The simulation method was as follows. Initially, the wavelength of incident light was varied from 400 to 1200 nm and the transmission spectrum and the electric field distribution were simulated. Then at the resonance wavelength (wavelength where the transmission spectrum has a minimum), the localized electric field distribution was calculated at different distances from the surface of the nanostructures. This study shows that the position of nanoholes has a significant effect on the {{transmission and}} localized electric field distribution of star nanostructures. The condition for achieving the maximum localized electric field distribution can be used in <b>nano-optics</b> and nanobiosensors in the future...|$|E
