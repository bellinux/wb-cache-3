40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} outcome of {{pregnancy}} in chromosomally normal fetuses with increased nuchal translucency thickness (NT), with respect to fetal loss, structural defects and genetic syndromes with developmental delay, and to provide information that would be helpful for parental counseling on the residual risk of adverse outcome when ultrasound findings are normal. METHODS: We reviewed {{the outcome of}} all pregnancies presenting at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam with increased NT between January 1994 and March 2005. Fetal karyotyping and two-step ultrasound investigation at 13 - 18 and 20 - 24 weeks' gestation were offered in all cases. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the relationship between normal karyotype, ultrasound findings at the 20 - 24 -week scan and subsequent pregnancy outcome. An adverse outcome was defined as miscarriage, intrauterine death, termination of pregnancy at parental request or the finding of one or more structural defects or genetic disorders. RESULTS: A total of 675 fetuses with increased <b>NT,</b> <b>known</b> karyotype and known pregnancy outcome was analyzed. A chromosomal anomaly was detected in 224 (33 %) fetuses. In 451 (67 %) fetuses, the karyotype was normal. The overall incidence of an adverse pregnancy outcome in this group was 19 % and, when analyzed according to the initial degree of increase in NT, the likelihood of an adverse outcome increased with increasing NT, ranging from 8 % to 80 %. 425 fetuses underwent a detailed second-trimester ultrasound scan. Anomalies were detected, at the time of ultrasound or after birth, in 54 (13 %) of these fetuses (17 isolated cardiac defects, 14 other structural defects and 23 genetic disorders). An adverse pregnancy outcome was recorded in 4 % of cases in which there were normal findings at the 20 -week scan. Seven of these cases were classified as 'potentially amenable' to ultrasound detection. With exclusion of these cases, the chance of a healthy baby, if the 20 -week scan was completely normal, was 98 %. Genetic syndromes with dysmorphic features and neurodevelopmental delay occurred in seven (1. 6 %) of the fetuses with normal karyotype. In three of these pregnancies, non-specific suspicious ultrasound findings (nuchal edema, mild pyelectasis, pericardial effusion) were observed at the mid-trimester scan and in two others, subtle cardiac defects were detected after delivery. In the remaining two cases (0. 5 %) the mid-trimester scan was completely normal and no structural defects were observed after delivery. CONCLUSION: After exclusion of chromosomal anomalies, one out of five fetuses with increased NT has an adverse pregnancy outcome. The chance of an uneventful pregnancy outcome depends on the initial degree of increase in NT. However, if the detailed ultrasound examination at around 20 weeks is normal, a favorable outcome can be expected with confidence, irrespective of initially increased N...|$|R

However, it is still unknown whether the actions of NTs in dark-reared animals involve interaction with neurotransmitter systems.

This regulation is dependent on activation of PKC, a well known effector of the type 1 NT receptor (NTR 1). Because PKC phosphorylation of the D 2 R has recently been shown to induce its internalization, we hypothesized that NT acts to reduce D 2 R function through heterologous desensitization of the D 2 R. In the present study, we first used HEK- 293 cells to demonstrate that NT induces PKC-dependent D 2 R internalization. Furthermore, internalization displayed faster kinetics in cells expressing the D 2 R short isoform, known {{to act as an}} autoreceptor in DA neurons, than in cells expressing the long isoform, known to act as a postsynaptic D 2 R. In patch clamp experiments on cultured DA neurons, overexpression of a mutant D 2 S lacking three key PKC phosphorylation sites abrogated the ability of NT to reduce D 2 R-mediated cell firing inhibition. Short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of β-arrestin 1 and dynamin 2, proteins important for receptor desensitization, reduced agonist-induced desensitization of D 2 R function, but only the inhibition of β-arrestin 1 reduced the effect of NT on D 2 R function.

Comprehensive profiling revealed 151 miRs were expressed in the soleus muscle and expression of 18 miRs were significantly (P < 0. 01) changed after 2 and/or 7 days of hindlimb suspension. The significant decrease (16 %) in expression of muscle-specific miR- 499 in response to hindlimb suspension was confirmed by RT-PCR and suggested activation of the recently proposed miR encoded by myosin gene (MyomiR) network during atrophy.

40|$|Abstract Background Neurotensin (<b>NT)</b> is <b>known</b> {{to act on}} {{dopamine}} (DA) neurons at the somatodendritic {{level to}} regulate cell firing and secondarily enhance DA release. In addition, anatomical and indirect physiological data suggest the presence of NT receptors at the terminal level. However, a clear demonstration of the mechanism of action of NT on dopaminergic axon terminals is lacking. We hypothesize that NT acts to increase DA release by inhibiting the function of terminal D 2 autoreceptors. To test this hypothesis, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FCV) to monitor in real time the axonal release of DA in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Results DA release was evoked by single electrical pulses and pulse trains (10 Hz, 30 pulses). Under these two stimulation conditions, we evaluated the characteristics of DA D 2 autoreceptors and the presynaptic action of NT in the NAcc shell and shell/core border region. The selective agonist of D 2 autoreceptors, quinpirole (1 μM), inhibited DA overflow evoked by both single and train pulses. In sharp contrast, the selective D 2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (5 μM), strongly enhanced DA release triggered by pulse trains, without any effect on DA release elicited by single pulses, thus confirming previous observations. We then determined the effect of NT (8 – 13) (100 nM) and found that although it failed to increase DA release evoked by single pulses, it strongly enhanced DA release evoked by pulse trains that lead to prolonged DA release and engage D 2 autoreceptors. In addition, initial blockade of D 2 autoreceptors by sulpiride considerably inhibited further facilitation of DA release generated by NT (8 – 13). Conclusion Taken together, {{these data suggest that}} NT enhances DA release principally by inhibiting the function of terminal D 2 autoreceptors and not by more direct mechanisms such as facilitation of terminal calcium influx. </p...|$|R

In addition, the fi ndings for adsorbed NT at di ff erent pH of silver sol were fully supported by a generalized two-dimensional correlation analysis (G 2 DCA) ...|$|R
40|$|Biomarkers are {{biological}} {{measures of}} a biological state. An ideal marker should {{be safe and}} easy to measure, cost efficient, modifiable with treatment, and consistent across gender and ethnic groups. To date none of the available biomarkers satisfy all of these criteria. In addition the major limitations of these markers are low specificity, sensitivity and false positive results. Recently identified, microRNAs are endogenous, evolutionarily conserved small non-coding RNA (about 22 - 25 <b>nt</b> long), also <b>known</b> as micro-coordinators of gene expression, which {{have been shown to}} be an effective tools to study the biology of diseases and to have great potential as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity. In fact it has been demonstrated that microRNAs play a pivotal role in the regulation of a wide range of developmental and physiological processes and their deficiencies have been related to a number of disease. In addition microRNAs are stable and can be easily isolated and measured from tissues and body fluids. In this review, we provide a perspective on emerging concepts and potential usefulness of microRNAs as diagnostic markers, emphasizing the involvement of specific microRNAs in particular tumor types, subtypes, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, infectious diseases and forensic test...|$|R

The atrioventricular valve E- and A-wave peak velocity, E/A-velocity ratio and E/TVI ratio, myocardial performance index, semilunar valves acceleration time (AT) and peak velocity, stroke volume and cardiac output as well as DV pulsatility index for veins at 11 - 14 weeks' gestation, were measured. A multilevel analysis was performed using the NT (multiples of the median) as a continuous variable. The male : female ratio was 1. 56 : 1. The tricuspid valve E/TVI was significantly higher and pulmonary valve AT significantly lower in females compared to males. No other significant differences in cardiac function were found.

40|$|The {{survival}} of pancreatic beta cells {{depends on the}} balance between external cytotoxic and protective molecular systems. The neuropeptide neurotensin (NT) {{has been shown to}} regulate certain functions of the endocrine pancreas including insulin and glucagon release. However, the mechanism of action of NT as well as the identification of receptors involved in the pancreatic functions of the peptide remained to be studied. We demonstrate here that NT is an efficient protective agent of pancreatic beta cells against cytotoxic agents. Both beta-TC 3 and INS- 1 E cell lines and the mouse pancreatic islet cells express the three <b>known</b> <b>NT</b> receptors. The incubation of beta cells with NT protects cells from apoptosis induced either by staurosporine or by IL- 1 beta. In beta-TC 3 cells, NT activates both MAP and PI- 3 kinases pathways and strongly reduces the staurosporine or the Il- 1 beta-induced caspase- 3 activity by a mechanism involving Akt activation. The NTSR 2 agonist levocabastine displays the same protective effect than NT whereas the NTSR 1 antagonist is unable to block the effect of NT suggesting the predominant involvement of the NTSR 2 in the action of NT on beta cells. These results clearly indicate {{for the first time that}} NT is able to protect endocrine beta cells from external cytotoxic agents, a role well correlated with its release in the circulation after a meal...|$|R
40|$|The normal {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) is a poorly innervated organ supplied only by sensory (mainly nociceptive) and postganglionic sympathetic (vasomotor efferents) nerve fibers. Interestingly, upon degeneration, the IVD becomes densely innervated even in regions that in normal conditions lack innervation. This increased innervation {{has been associated}} with pain of IVD origin. The mechanisms responsible for nerve growth and hyperinnervation of pathological IVDs have not been fully elucidated. Among the molecules that are presumably involved in this process are some members of the family of neurotrophins (<b>NTs),</b> which are <b>known</b> to have both neurotrophic and neurotropic properties and regulate the density and distribution of nerve fibers in peripheral tissues. NTs and their receptors are expressed in healthy IVDs but much higher levels have been observed in pathological IVDs, thus suggesting a correlation between levels of expression of NTs and density of innervation in IVDs. In addition, NTs also play a role in inflammatory responses and pain transmission by increasing the expression of pain-related peptides and modulating synapses of nociceptive neurons at the spinal cord. This article reviews current knowledge about the innervation of IVDs, NTs and NT receptors, expression of NTs and their receptors in IVDs {{as well as in the}} sensory neurons innervating the IVDs, the proinflammatory role of NTs, NTs as nociception regulators, and the potential network of discogenic pain involving NTs...|$|R
