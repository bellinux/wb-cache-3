An intrinsically strong coupling view, involving a charge density wave state arising as a Bose condensation of preformed excitons emerges as an attractive, albeit scantily investigated alternative.

40|$|We {{present the}} full {{analysis}} of the normal state of the spin-fermion model near the antiferromagnetic instability in two dimensions. This model describes low-energy fermions interacting with their own collective spin fluctuations, which soften at the antiferromagnetic transition. We argue that in 2 D, the system has two typical energies - an effective spin-fermion interaction g̅ and an energy ω_sf below which the system behaves as a Fermi liquid. The ratio of the two determines the dimensionless coupling constant for spin-fermion interaction λ^ 2 ∝g̅/ω_sf. We show that λ scales with the spin correlation length and diverges at criticality. This divergence implies that the conventional perturbative expansion breaks down. We developed a novel approach to the problem - the expansion in either the inverse number of hot spots in the Brillouin zone, or the inverse number of fermionic flavors - which allowed us to explicitly account for all terms which diverge as powers of λ, and treat the remaining, O(λ) terms in the RG formalism. We applied this technique to study {{the properties of the}} spin-fermion model in various frequency and temperature regimes. We present the results for the fermionic spectral function, spin susceptibility, optical conductivity and other observables. We compare our results in detail with the <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> <b>data</b> for cuprates, and argue that the spin-fermion model is capable to explain the anomalous normal state properties of high T_c materials.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of optical conductivity in the <b>normal</b> and superconducting <b>states</b> is {{considered in the}} frame of the standard Isotropic Single wide Band (ISB) model using the theory proposed by Nam. The exact analytical inversion of the <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> Nam equations is performed and applied for the recovery of the reliable information from the experimental data. The Allen formula is derived in the strong coupling approximation and the phenomenological "generalised" Drude formula in a high temperature approximation. It is shown, that the reconstruction of the shape of the spectral function from the <b>normal</b> <b>state</b> optical <b>data</b> at T>Tc is not unique. A novel adaptive method of the exact numerical inversion of the superconducting state equations is presented. It is shown that, the fine structure of the spectral function can be recovered from optical data in the case of s-wave pairing symmetry. In contrast, in the d-wave case the resulting image is approximately the convolution of the input electron-boson interaction function and the wide Gauss distribution function.
