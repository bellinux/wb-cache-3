[...] Preppy fashions are associated with classic and conservative style of dressing and clothing brands such as Izod Lacoste, Brooks Brothers, and Polo Ralph Lauren. An example of preppy attire would be a button-down <b>Oxford</b> <b>cloth</b> shirt, Ascot tie, cuffed khakis, and tasseled loafers, Keds, or Boat shoes.

It was also considered [...] "preppy" [...] to wear a cable knit cardigan or argyle pattern sweater tied loosely around the shoulders. The European equivalent, known as Sloane Rangers, dressed similarly but frequently incorporated tweed cloth British country clothing, burberry mackintoshes, mustard corduroy pants, rain boots, padded hairbands, and ancestral jewellery such as pearl necklaces.|$|R

50|$|The two {{principal}} donors for church were the 13th Earl of <b>Oxford</b> and the <b>cloth</b> merchant, Thomas Spring of Lavenham. As such, {{the building is}} decorated with the coat-of-arms of the Spring and de Vere families. The Spring arms, {{as well as the}} merchant's mark of Thomas Spring, appears over thirty times on the exterior of the building, while the star of the de Vere family surrounds the top of the tower. A screen in the south aisle was possibly intended as a chantry chapel for the clothier Thomas Spourne, although his remains do not lie here, whilst the parclose screen in the north aisle was to the chantry of the Spring family, later ennobled by Charles I. The remains of Thomas Spring lie in the church and there are several monuments erected to his descendents, such as Francis Spring. North of the chancel is the Branch Chapel dating from around 1500 and south of the chancel is the Spring Chapel dating from around 1525.|$|R
