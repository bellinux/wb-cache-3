5|$|Dunne {{had hoped}} that by moving to New York to write full-time, {{he would be able}} to greatly expand his output, and he signed to do several projects, {{including}} a play featuring Mr. Dooley, and for a series of third-person stories featuring Molly Donahue, Bridgeport's resident suffragist. But Dunne found that he could not increase his production, and that some of the Dooley projects were ill-suited to the character: the play went unwritten and the Molly Donahue stories were abandoned after four pieces. Dooley appears as a character in some of them. Fanning found them unsatisfactory, with a misplaced Dooley, deprived of his bar and control of the dialogue. Dunne was not happy with them either: a <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> author appeared in the Ladies' Home Journal after the fourth piece was published there, alleging ill-health and dissatisfaction with the product.|$|E
5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{begins with}} a <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> author, which is an {{integral}} part of it. Unusually, the note describes entirely fictional events. It serves to establish and enforce one of the book's main themes: the relativity of truth.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Wikileaks {{released}} a leaked 1994 diplomatic <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US Embassy in Manila, recounting a private conversation between a diplomat and Joel de los Santos, a retired Filipino university professor {{who specialized in}} Islamic affairs.

25|$|Attending Justin F. Kimball High School {{during the}} early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, {{including}} music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved {{by many of the}} school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> principal about his grooming.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, even numbers such as 8, 10 and 12 can be added. However, these {{double the}} main triad, {{and as such}} are fairly rare. 10 {{tends to be the}} most common; it can be used both in {{suspended}} chords and (with an accidental) in major or minor chords to produce a major–minor clash (e.g., C710 indicating the Hendrix chord of C–E–G–B–E). However, because of enharmonics, such chords can more easily, and perhaps more intuitively, be represented by 2 (or 9) for a minor over a major or 4 for a major over a minor. In any other case, an 8, 10 or 12 simply indicates the respective <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> triad doubled up one octave.|$|E
25|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, sought {{to stop the}} shooting. The 53-year-old presidente municipal took a white handkerchief, tied it to his cane {{and ran into the}} streets of his city hoping to quell {{the violence}}. As US troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to put down their weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by US military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where nothing could be done to save him.” He died a half-hour later.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} beats of silence that open the score, a tubular bell is struck three times very quietly (pianissimo), with 12 beats between the strikes and gap of 18 beats {{between the groups}} of three. This bell tells {{of the death of}} Britten—it is the funeral bell. It {{continues}} to be struck in groups of three widely spaced intervals for most of the piece, fading out for a time in the last 21 bars, only to reappear at the last. After the bell has struck there is a brief pause for three beats of silence, and then the first violins begin setting the pattern which the rest of the ensemble will follow at slower speeds. Half of the first violins begin playing the descending A minor scale, playing first one <b>note</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> very top of their range, then returning to the beginning and playing two notes, and then three and four and so on. The other half of the violins play notes from an A minor chord. These notes start a fourth lower and drop in pitch only when it is overrun by the first. This creates a swirling effect of increasing tension which is relieved by dropping the note. They begin playing very quietly (pianississimo) but gradually over the piece build up until they are playing very loudly (fortississimo).|$|E

Such isolated tracks were not available through the new 2009 remasters, so the team started with the original master recordings.|$|E
