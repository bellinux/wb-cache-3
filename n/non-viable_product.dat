In an experiment on dairy cows with daily dosing of 3 mL Rumen-Zyme, milk yields were shown to increase over a four-week period to a relative 2 litres per cow per day over control. The results on sheep and dairy cows are interpreted in light of current knowledge of probiotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} sugarcane {{industry is}} {{on the brink of}} commercialising genetically modified (GM) varieties for the first time. Various countries, including South Africa, Brazil and Australia, have recently announced collaborative research and development programmes specifically aimed at developing GM varieties. It is therefore not only an opportune time for the South African sugar industry to evaluate these developments, but also the status of GM crops in the country and the multitude of unique aspects associated with the commercialisation of a GM crop. Although most GM technology developers realise that they have to consider the biosafety requirements as stipulated by national and international regulatory frameworks, the scope, extent and impact of these are often misjudged – resulting in a <b>non-viable</b> <b>product.</b> Risk assessment and risk management play critical roles in the successful commercialisation of GM crops and should therefore from a very early stage be considered as an integrated part of a GM research and development programme. In addition, to extract the full potential benefits from biotech crops, technology developers should more carefully consider market related factors such as the relevance and accessibility of a particular GM product to ensure its sustainability. This will not only help ensure the sustainability of individual products but also improve the efficiency of the innovation process. This paper will develop these concepts and present a sustainability assessment framework which {{can be used in a}} research and development programme to identify, assess and mitigate potential biosafety and deployment risks of GM products...|$|E
40|$|Disease {{agents and}} pests {{associated}} with freshwater crayfish fall into six main categories—viruses, bacteria, rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs), fungi, protists and metazoans. Data {{and information on}} specific disease agents and pests from each of these categories are presented in this synopsis. Each agent or group of agents is considered under the following headings—condition, causative agent(s), life cycle/life history, epizootiology, pathology, pathogen viability. Information for the synopsis {{was obtained from the}} published literature and from personal contact with internationally recognised experts in freshwater crayfish aquaculture, biology and disease. Data of relevance for import risk analysis are summarised. Import risk analysis is the process by which the risks associated with importation of animals and plants, and products derived from animals and plants, are assessed and managed. Hazard identification is essential and is the first component of an import risk analysis. In 1996, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) commenced a review of policy relating to the importation of <b>non-viable</b> freshwater crayfish <b>products,</b> along with a suite of other aquatic animal products. AQIS commissioned a synopsis of freshwater crayfish pests and pathogens for use as a resource document for hazard identification in the formal IRA process...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} was defined by a poorly characterised filtration train employed to clarify culture broth containing monoclonal antibodies secreted by GS-NSO cells: the filtration train blinded unpredictably and the ability of the positively charged filters to adsorb DNA from process material was unknown. To direct the development of an assay to quantify the ability of depth filters to adsorb DNA, the molecular weight of DNA from a large-scale, fed-batch, mammalian cell culture vessel was evaluated as process material passed through the initial stages of the purification scheme. High molecular weight DNA was substantially cleared from the broth after passage through a disc stack centrifuge and the remaining low molecular weight DNA was largely unaffected by passage through a series of depth filters and a sterilising grade membrane. Removal of high molecular weight DNA was shown to be coupled with clarification of the process stream. The DNA from cell culture supernatant showed a pattern of internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin when fractionated by electrophoresis but the presence of both necrotic and apoptotic cells throughout the fermentation meant that the origin of the fragmented DNA could not be unequivocally determined. An intercalating fluorochrome, PicoGreen, was elected for development of a suitable DNA assay because of its ability to respond to low molecular weight DNA. It was assessed for its ability to determine the concentration of DNA in clarified mammalian cell culture broths containing pertinent monoclonal antibodies. Fluorescent signal suppression was ameliorated by sample dilution or by performing the assay above the pI of secreted IgG. The source of fluorescence in clarified culture broth was validated by incubation with RNase A and DNase I. At least 89. 0 % of fluorescence was attributable to nucleic acid and pre-digestion with RNase A was shown to be a requirement for successful quantification of DNA in such samples. Application of the fluorescence based assay resulted in characterisation of the physical parameters governing adsorption of DNA by various positively charged depth filters and membranes in test solutions and the DNA adsorption profile of the manufacturing scale filtration train. Buffers that reduced or neutralised the depth filter or membrane charge, and those that impeded hydrophobic interactions were shown to affect their operational capacity, demonstrating that DNA was adsorbed by a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Production-scale centrifugation of harvest broth containing therapeutic protein resulted in the reduction of total DNA in the process stream from 79. 8 μg m 1 - 1 to 9. 3 μg m 1 - 1 whereas the concentration of DNA in the supernatant of pre-and post-filtration samples had only marginally reduced DNA content: from 6. 3 to 6. 0 μg m 1 - 1 respectively. Hence the filtration train was shown to ineffective in DNA removal. Historically, blinding of the depth filters had been unpredictable with data such as numbers of viable cells, <b>non-viable</b> cells, <b>product</b> titre, or process shape (batch, fed-batch, or draw and fill) failing to inform on the durability of depth filters in the harvest step. To investigate this, key fouling contaminants were identified by challenging depth filters with the same mass of one of the following: viable healthy cells, cells that had died by the process of apoptosis, and cells that had died through the process of necrosis. The pressure increase across a Cuno Zeta Plus 10 SP depth filter was 2. 8 and 16. 5 times more sensitive to debris from apoptotic and necrotic cells respectively, when compared to viable cells. The condition of DNA released into the culture broth was assessed. Necrotic cells released predominantly high molecular weight DNA in contrast to apoptotic cells which released chiefly low molecular weight DNA. The blinding of the filters was found to be largely unaffected by variations in the particle size distribution of material in, and viscosity of, solutions with which they were challenged. The exceptional response of the depth filters to necrotic cells may suggest the cause of previously noted unpredictable filter blinding whereby a number of necrotic cells have a more significant impact on the life of a depth filter than a similar number of viable or apoptotic cells. In a final set of experiments the pressure drop caused by non-viable necrotic culture broths which had been treated with DNase I or benzonase was found to be smaller when compared to untreated broths: the abilities of the enzyme treated cultures to foul the depth filter were reduced by 70. 4 % and 75. 4 % respectively indicating the importance of DNA in the blinding of the depth filter studied...|$|R
40|$|The short chain {{fatty acid}} (SCFA) butyrate, a main end product of {{microbial}} fermentation of dietary fibers in human intestine, {{plays an important}} role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and overall health status. The effects exerted by butyrate are multiple and involve several distinct mechanisms of action including epigenetic modifications owing to its inhibitory effects on histone deacetylases, inhibition of NF-κB signaling, or direct agonism on the free fatty acid receptors. 	At intestinal level, butyrate is the major energy source for colonocytes and acts regulating epithelial cell proliferation, defense barrier, visceral sensitivity and motility, preventing and inhibiting colonic carcinogenesis. Recent experimental evidence has suggested potential extra-intestinal therapeutic applications of butyrate, including the treatment of systemic diseases, among these not only metabolic and inflammatory disorders but also cystic fibrosis, urea cycle enzyme deficiency, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. 	Data from literature and clinical evidence of several research groups show a wide spectrum of possibilities for potential therapeutic use of butyrate by oral administration without having serious adverse effects. Some butyrate-based products are marketed, but their spread is still very limited and greatly understaffed in view of the wide spectrum of possible indications, especially in chronic diseases, where it is possible to predict a lasting use of the compound. The main problem is the availability of butyrate formulations that could overcome the main limitations to the use of butyrate in the therapeutic field, namely its instability and poor palatability. In fact, the unpleasant taste and odour make oral administration of butyrate extremely difficult, especially in children. On the basis of its characteristics, butyrate can be considered a “postbiotic” being a <b>non-viable</b> bacterial metabolic <b>product</b> obtained from probiotic microorganisms that have biologic activity in the host. The direct use of postbiotics, such as butyrate, may be potential alternatives to the use of live probiotic organisms or to dietary fiber intake as prebiotics exerting several and similar beneficial regulatory effects on host biological functions. Even if a growing number of studies has revealed new mechanisms and effects of butyrate with a wide range of potential clinical applications from the intestinal tract to peripheral tissues, more data are needed to elucidate the efficacy of butyrate in gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal diseases and new solutions for an easier administration. To date, several studies have evaluated butyrate effectiveness in several animal models of colitis. In humans few studies have been performed probably due to low compliance for the oral route (for its rancid taste) or rectal enemas administration (for its cumbersome application to the patient and irritability due to acid property). Here, about its intestinal effects, we examined the efficacy of oral butyrate and its derivative N-(1 -carbamoyl- 2 -phenyl-ethyl) butyramide (FBA), as preventive or therapeutic treatment in a murine model of DSS-induced colitis. Both compounds are able to recover the imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators, altered in colitis and restore gut permeability, avoiding bacterial translocation and modulating immune cell recruitment. Butyrate anti-inflammatory effects are associated not only to the reduction in neutrophil infiltration and HDAC 9 transcription in colonic mucosa, but also the restoration of PPAR-γ expression and inhibition of NF-kB activation, protecting colonocytes from inflammation. 	Alterations in the microbiota have now been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases, including food allergy. Intestinal microbiota influences immune system network and impairs its regulatory functions. Allergic infants exhibit an accelerated evolution of microbiota more typical of the adult one with a significantly reduced abundance of butyrate-producing species, such as Lactobacillales and Bifidobacteriales, and increased abundance of Clostridiales. Animal models of food allergy have emerged as tool for identifying mechanisms involved in the development of sensitization to normally harmless food allergens, as well as delineating the critical immune components of the effect or phase of allergic reactions to food. One of the critical advantages of using mouse models to study food allergy is that allergic sensitization or tolerance can be induced to specific allergens under controlled environmental conditions within defined genetic backgrounds, which is not possible in human subjects. This aspect of mouse models allows extensive and precise investigations into the mechanisms involved in disease etiology and responsible for loss of tolerance in patients, identifying new targets and efficacious therapies. Increasing evidence from several mouse models indicates that alterations in regulatory T (Treg) cell function and environmental factors, such as microbiota, are likely important contributors to allergic sensitization and food allergy. Here, we used a model of cow's milk allergy (CMA) induced in mice. 	In this experimental model of CMA the preventive and therapeutic effects of oral sodium butyrate administration were evaluated. Butyrate was able to suppress acute skin response to the β-lactoglobulin (BLG) allergen, one of the most important cow’s milk proteins, and to reduce anaphylactic symptoms and immediate immune response. Furthermore, butyrate ability to improve gut permeability was also shown, reducing plasma levels of FITC-Dextran evaluated after oral administration. Butyrate reduced ear swelling, hypersensitivity symptoms and limited the decrease of body temperature after BLG challenge. Moreover, butyrate decreased the innate immune response, reducing IgE and IL- 4 levels. 	About butyrate extra-intestinal effect, our study was focused on osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis worldwide, whose development is increased by aging, obesity and biomechanical injury. It is a cartilage degenerative disease where chondrocytes play a central role. In fact, in OA chondrocyte phenotype changes and apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation occur. Using an in vitro model, we demonstrated the effect of sodium butyrate in reducing inflammatory mediators and pathways in chondrocytes activated by IL- 1, and, more interestingly, we showed that its chemoattractant activity is mediated by GPR 43. Butyrate, not only reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and adipokines involved in OA, but also decreased the expression of several adhesion molecules, inhibiting inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways. We also show the butyrate capability to reduce MMPs production and the loss of collagen type 2, suggesting an improvement of cartilage disruption. Interestingly, butyrate anti-inflammatory effects were associated to its capability to stimulate neutrophil recruitment, increasing the expression of important chemokines (Ccl 3 and Cx 3 cl 1) and anti-inflammatory protein AnxA 1, suggesting butyrate pro-resolving activity during inflammatory response. The novelty of our data is the involvement of GPR 43 in the chemoattractant activity of butyrate in IL- 1 -stimulated chondrocytes. In fact, butyrate failed to induce the expression of Cx 3 cl 1 and AnxA 1 in GPR 43 -silenced cells, missing its chemoattractant effect. The pro-resolving effect of butyrate was also analyzed in two models of wound healing induced by doxorubicin or mechanical damage. In tissue repair the immediate goal is to achieve tissue integrity, homeostasis and wound healing. Tissue injury causes the immediate onset of acute inflammation. The healing process involves three phases that overlap in time and space: inflammation, tissue formation, and tissue remodeling. Synthesis, remodeling, and deposition of structural extracellular matrix molecules and soluble mediators, are indispensable for initiating repair and progression into the healing state. In our study, we demonstrated that butyrate and FBA treatments accelerate and promote wound resolution process. In our experimental models, we showed that butyrate and its derivative FBA reduced the repair time when used systemically (by oral administration) or topically (by intradermal injection). This protective effect appeared to be time- and concentration-dependent. 	In summary, we have demonstrated the multiple protective effect of butyrate in limiting molecular events underlying the onset of several inflammatory-based pathologies, suggesting a potential clinical relevance for this compound. In particular, we have also showed the efficacy of its synthetic derivative N-(1 -carbamoyl- 2 -phenyl-ethyl) butyramide or FBA, demonstrating that it could represent an alternative therapeutic option to sodium butyrate, sharing a comparable efficacy, but better palatability and compliance...|$|R
