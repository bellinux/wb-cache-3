25|$|There {{are other}} sources for surnames. Many Filipinos also have Chinese-derived surnames, {{which in some}} cases could {{indicate}} Chinese ancestry. Many Hispanicised Chinese numerals and other Hispanicised Chinese words, however, were also among the surnames in the Catálogo alfabético de apellidos. For those whose surname may indicate Chinese ancestry, analysis of the surname may help to pinpoint when those ancestors arrived in the Philippines. A Hispanicised Chinese surname such as Cojuangco suggests an 18th-century arrival while a Chinese surname such as Lim suggests a relatively recent immigration. Some Chinese surnames such as Tiu-Laurel are composed of the immigrant Chinese ancestor's surname {{as well as the}} <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ancestor's godparent on receiving Christian baptism.|$|E

25|$|It {{is hardly}} probable, however, {{that the present}} Book of Jubilees is incomplete, and a much more {{plausible}} view of Epstein's is that which regards the Midrash Tadshe {{as the work of}} Rabbi Moses ha-Darshan. Either on account of its beginning, or for some other reason, R. Phinehas ben Jair was regarded as the author of this midrash, and Num. R. xiii. 10 and xiv. 12, 18 contain several expositions and maxims from it cited under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> tanna. The midrash, from which Yalḳuṭ excerpted several passages and which has been cited by various authors, has been edited according to manuscript sources by Adolf Jellinek (B. H. iii. 164-193) and by A. Epstein (Beiträge zur Jüdischen Alterthumskunde, Vienna, 1887).|$|E

The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E
25|$|Although {{counties}} {{are no longer}} used for local governmental purposes, they remain a popular means of describing where places are. They are officially used while applying for an Irish passport, which requires one to state one's county of birth. The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> county then appears in both Irish and English on the passport's information page, {{as opposed to the}} town or city of birth on the United Kingdom passport. The Gaelic Athletic Association still uses the counties as its primary means of organisation and fields representative teams of each GAA county. The original system of car registration numbers largely based on counties still remains in use. In 2000, the telephone numbering system was restructured into an 8 digit scheme with (except for Belfast) the first digit approximately reflecting the county.|$|E

25|$|The {{status of}} {{painters}} {{in relation to}} that of potters remains somewhat unclear. The fact that, e.g., Euphronius was able to work as both painter and potter suggests {{that at least some}} of the painters were not slaves. On the other hand, some of the known names indicate that there were at least some former slaves and some perioikoi among the painters. Additionally, some of the names are not unique: for example, several painters signed as Polygnotos. This may represent attempts to profit from the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> great painter. The same may be the case where painters bear otherwise famous names, like Aristophanes (vase painter). The careers of some vase painters are quite well known. Apart from painters with relatively short periods of activity (one or two decades), some can be traced for much longer. Examples include Douris, Makron, Hermonax and the Achilles Painter. The fact that several painters later became potters, and the relatively frequent cases where it is unclear whether some potters were also painters or vice versa, suggest a career structure, perhaps starting with an apprenticeship involving mainly painting, and leading up to being a potter. This division of labours appears to have developed along with the introduction of red-figure painting, since many potter-painters are known from the black-figure period (including Exekias, Nearchos and perhaps the Amasis Painter). The increased demand for exports would have led to new structures of production, encouraging specialisation and division of labour, leading to a sometimes ambiguous distinction between painter and potter. As mentioned above, the painting of vessels was probably mainly the responsibility of younger assistants or apprentices. Some further conclusions regarding the organisational aspects of pottery production can be suggested. It appears that generally, several painters worked for one pottery workshop, as indicated by the fact that frequently, several roughly contemporary pots by the same potter are painted by various painters. For examples, pots made by Euphronios have been found to be painted by Onesimos, Douris, the Antiphon Painter, the Triptolemos Painter and the Pistoxenos Painter. Conversely, an individual painter could also change from one workshop to another. For example, the bowl painter Oltos worked for at least six different potters.|$|E

500|$|The {{somewhat}} tenuous {{hold the}} Vijayanagara centre had on its southern periphery resulted only partly from the latter's remoteness. The centralisation {{imposed by the}} empire was resisted by the southern chiefs (sometimes called rajas, or [...] "little kings") for moral and political reasons as well; according to historian Burton Stein: [...] 'Little kings', or rajas, never attained the legal independence of an aristocracy from both monarchs and the local people whom they ruled. The sovereign claims of would-be centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources demanded in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used {{as a kind of}} royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.|$|E

500|$|Of Human Feelings {{features}} {{shorter and}} more distinct compositions than Dancing in Your Head. [...] "Sleep Talk", [...] "Air Ship", and [...] "Times Square" [...] were originally performed by Coleman during his concerts in 1978 under the names [...] "Dream Talking", [...] "Meta", and [...] "Writing in the Streets", respectively. [...] "What Is the <b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>That</b> Song?" [...] was titled as a sly reference {{to two of}} his older compositions, [...] "Love Eyes" [...] and [...] "Forgotten Songs" [...] (also known as [...] "Holiday for Heroes"), whose themes were played concurrently and transfigured by Prime Time. The theme from [...] "Forgotten Songs", originally from Coleman's 1972 album Skies of America, {{was used as a}} refrain. [...] "Jump Street" [...] is a blues piece, [...] "Air Ship" [...] comprises a six-bar riff, and the atonal [...] "Times Square" [...] has futuristic dance themes. [...] "Love Words" [...] heavily uses polymodality, a central feature of harmolodics, and juxtaposes Coleman's extended solo against a dense, rhythmically complex backdrop. Nicholson observed West African rhythms and collective improvisation rooted in New Orleans jazz on [...] "Love Words", and suggested that [...] "Sleep Talk" [...] was derived from the opening bassoon solo in Igor Stravinsky's 1913 orchestral work The Rite of Spring.|$|E
