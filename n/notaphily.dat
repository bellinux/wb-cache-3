It is an area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of engraving. Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.|$|E
50|$|Postal order {{collecting}} {{has become}} a branch of <b>notaphily,</b> especially in England since the 1980s. Some countries, such as Basutoland, the British Somaliland Protectorate, and Northern Rhodesia never issued their own banknotes, but they did issue their own postal orders, however. Great Britain, the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland also issued Old Age Pension Orders as well as postal orders. These have become collectible in recent years.|$|E
50|$|Pick {{started a}} {{collection}} of banknotes {{as a child in}} 1930. Later, after his war service (including a year as a P.O.W. in the United States), he went on to study philosophy, literature and history. He worked as the manager of a publishing house while amassing his collection of banknotes, at a time when <b>notaphily,</b> the collecting and study of paper money, was still in its infancy and a relatively cheap hobby.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that people have been}} collecting paper money {{for as long as it}} has been in use. While people began collecting paper currency more systematically in the 1940s, the turning point occurred in the 1970s when <b>notaphily</b> was established as a separate area by collectors. The term was devised in this decade by a group of employees working for the collectors and investments firm Stanley Gibbons, in a successful attempt to formalise and encourage interest in the area.|$|E
40|$|Summary: On {{the example}} of the issue of {{contemporary}} coined and paper money, the author observes and proves the possibility to manage this monetary form and to achieve a number of effects such as the issuing profit, numismatic and <b>notaphily</b> benefits as well as promotional effects. By incorporating new approaches in the issuing of contemporary money in cash form proves that these approaches are apart of the financial science, especially the science about the money, and that the contemporary numismatics and <b>notaphily</b> are also its integral part. In this way, the issuing of the contemporary metal and paper money is treated as apart of the national economy. ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{starts from}} {{the thesis that}} it is {{especially}} necessary to manage the production of cash money, taking into consideration and applying the conceptions of modern management. Cash money (metallic and paper) is a specific “product” that is produced according {{to the needs of}} monetary traffic, as well as meeting the standards related to modern <b>notaphily,</b> i. e. numismatics. For several reasons, the author elaborates his thesis on the example of the issuing of Croatian contemporary metallic money. The most important of these reasons are that Croatia has its own mint, that issuing metallic money makes it possible to attain significant non-fiscal effects through its management, and that the issuing of national money has wider cultural, social, legal and other dimensions. In the elaboration of his thesis, the author takes into account the influence of the globalization and integration processes in which Croatia is a participant. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{scholarly}} {{study of}} banknotes (<b>notaphily)</b> {{is not a}} new phenomenon. But it did not take sys-tematic modern form until the 1920 s. (Ironically, it emerged under the Weimar Republic just as Germany was entering a three-year period of hyperinflation.) Since then, the number of numis-matic associations has grown considerably, as have specialized publications. Banknote News is one relevant example. Banknote News issues breaking stories about international paper and polymer money. Collectors are the primary audience, and the website contains hundreds of links to vendors for people who wish to purchase the bank notes they covet. One of the links directs collectors to the 2014 edition of The Banknote Book. It includes 205 stand-alone chapters, each of which can be purchased separately as a country-specific catalog. (The Vietnam chapter provides detailed infor-mation on notes the State Bank of Vietnam issued, but only from 1964 to present, color copies of them, as well as their current market valuations.) The four-volume set currently runs 2, 554 pages and details more than 21, 000 types and varieties of currency, some dating back centuries. The global community of currency collectors and the desires that shape their relationships to different forms of money provides a useful entry point into Allison Truitt’s fascinating book, Dream-ing of Money in Ho Chi Minh City. Truitt is similarly interested in state-issued currencies, espe...|$|E
