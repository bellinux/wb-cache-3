50|$|An {{important}} development during World War II was {{the addition}} of another explosive, <b>nitroguanidine,</b> to the mixture to form triple-base propellant or Cordite N and NQ. The formulations were slightly different for artillery and naval use. This solved two {{problems associated with the}} large naval guns fitted to British Navy's capital ships: gun flash and muzzle erosion. <b>Nitroguanidine</b> produces large amounts of nitrogen when heated, which had the benefit of reducing the muzzle flash, and its lower burning temperature greatly reduced the erosion of the gun barrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitroguanidine</b> {{exists in}} two {{tautomeric}} forms, as a nitroimine (left) or a nitroamine (right). In solution {{and in the}} solid state, the nitroimine form predominates (resonance stabilized).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 20th century new {{propellant}} formulations started to appear. These {{are based on}} <b>nitroguanidine</b> and high explosives of the RDX (detonation velocity 8750 m/s) type.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitroguanidine</b> {{can also}} be {{generated}} by treatment of urea with ammonium nitrate. Owing to problems of reliability and safety, this process has not been commerciallized despite its attractive economic features.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{composed}} of ingredients including 2,4-dinitroanisole (DNAN) and nitrotriazolone (NTO). [...] The nominal composition is DNAN, NQ (<b>nitroguanidine),</b> NTO. Trace amounts of MNA (N-methyl-p-nitroaniline) are included in some formulations to aid in processing.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{facility}} {{modernization program}} {{was started in}} August 1967. The program included the construction, between 1975 and 1979, of a facility {{for the production of}} <b>nitroguanidine.</b> This facility was {{the first of its kind}} in North America and began production in 1984 and continued until 1992, when the plant was again placed on standby. <b>Nitroguanidine</b> (NQ) is an essential component of triple-base gun propellant. In addition to being an oxidizer and energy carrier, it is loaded with hydrogen and this provides cooling in the gun tube which reduces the erosion rate of the tube metal so more rounds can be fired before refit.

50|$|<b>Nitroguanidine</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (NH2)2CNNO2. It is a colorless, crystalline solid that melts at 232 °C and decomposes at 250 °C. It is not flammable {{and is a}} low-sensitivity explosive; however, its detonation velocity is high. It {{is used as a}} propellant (air bags), fertilizer, and for other purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitroguanidine</b> is {{produced}} commercially by a two step process {{starting with the}} reaction of calcium cyanamide with ammonium nitrate. Via the intermediacy of biguanidine, this ammonolysis step affords the salt guanidinium nitrate. In the second step, the nitrate salt is treated with sulfuric acid, a process that dehydrates the salt and forms the N-N bond.|$|E
50|$|Cordite {{began as}} a double-base propellant. In the 1930s triple-base was {{developed}} by including a substantial proportion of <b>nitroguanidine.</b> Triple-based propellant reduced the disadvantages of double-base propellant - its relatively high temperature and significant flash. Imperial Chemical Industries's (ICI) World War 2 double-base AN formulation also had a much lower temperature, but it lacked the flash reduction properties of N and NQ triple-base propellants.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of weapons such as mortar bombs, artillery shells, barrel bombs, aircraft bombs and missiles have {{taken a toll}} {{on the environment and}} the population’s health. These weapons have ammunitions with common metal parts that contain lead (Pb), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), antimony (Sb) and tungsten (W). Missiles and rockets contain solid or liquid propellants and nitroglycerin (NG), <b>nitroguanidine</b> (NQ), nitrocellulose (NC), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT).|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} major {{industrial}} applications of nitration in the strict sense; {{the most important}} by volume are {{for the production of}} Nitroaromatic compounds such as nitrobenzene. Nitration reactions are notably used for the production of explosives, for example the conversion of guanidine to <b>nitroguanidine</b> and the conversion of toluene to trinitrotoluene. However, they are of wide importance as chemical intermediates and precursors. Millions of tons of nitroaromatics are produced annually.|$|E
50|$|The same {{reaction}} occurs upon {{heating the}} salt to approximately 300 °C. The sodium that is formed {{is a potential}} hazard alone and, in automobile airbags, it is converted by reaction with other ingredients, such as potassium nitrate and silica. In the latter case, innocuous sodium silicates are generated. Sodium azide is also used in airplane escape chutes. Newer generation air bags contain <b>nitroguanidine</b> or similar less sensitive explosives.|$|E
50|$|Many other {{formulations}} {{were developed}} in the following decades, generally {{trying to find the}} optimum characteristics of a good artillery propellant; low temperature, high energy, non-corrosive, highly stable, cheap, and easy to manufacture in large quantities. Broadly, modern gun propellants are divided into three classes: single-base propellants which are mainly or entirely nitrocellulose based, double-base propellants composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, and triple base composed of a combination of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin and <b>Nitroguanidine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Flash {{suppressors}} {{are commonly}} used on small arms to reduce the flash signature, but this approach is not practical for artillery. Artillery muzzle flash up to 150 ft from the muzzle has been observed, and can be reflected off clouds and be visible for distances up to [...] For artillery the most effective method is a propellant that produces {{a large proportion of}} inert nitrogen at relatively low temperatures that dilutes the combustible gases. Triple based propellants are used for this because of the nitrogen in the <b>nitroguanidine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Smokeless powders were {{originally}} developed using nitrocellulose {{as the sole}} explosive ingredient. Therefore, they were known as single-base propellants. A range of smokeless powders that contain both nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin, known as double-base propellants, were also developed. Smokeless powders {{were originally}} supplied only for military use, {{but they were also}} soon developed for civilian use and were quickly adopted for sports. Some are known as sporting powders. Triple-base propellants contain nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and <b>nitroguanidine,</b> but are reserved mainly for extremely high-caliber ammunition rounds such as those used in tank cannons and naval artillery.|$|E
50|$|During the 1930s triple-base {{propellant}} containing nitrocellulose, nitroglycerin, and {{a substantial}} quantity of <b>nitroguanidine</b> (detonation velocity 8200 m/s) as explosive propellant ingredients was developed. These propellant mixtures have reduced flash and flame temperature without sacrificing chamber pressure compared to single and double base propellants, albeit {{at the cost}} of more smoke.In practice, triple base propellants are reserved mainly for large caliber ammunition such as used in (naval) artillery and tank guns. During World War II it had some use by British artillery. After that war it became the standard propellant in all British large caliber ammunition designs except small-arms. Most western nations, except the United States, followed a similar path.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971 Tsuyoshi Uchida, in the {{laboratory}} of Alwin Pappenheimer at Harvard, used <b>nitroguanidine</b> to create mutants of diphtheria toxin, which were called Cross Reacting Materials, or CRMs. One of these mutants, called CRM197, interested researchers because its lack of toxicity suggested a better starting material for diphtheria vaccine than the wild-type protein, and the protein was found to enhance the immunogenicity of bacterial polysaccharides. The pharmaceutical company Wyeth took advantage of this immunogenicity in the 1990s when it conjugated seven polysaccharides from Streptococcus pneumoniae to CRM197 to create the original Prevnar vaccine which was FDA approved in February 2000. A 13-polysaccharides Prevnar was FDA-approved in 2010. The meningococcal vaccine Menveo, from Novartis, is four Neisseria meningitidis polysaccharides plus CRM197. This vaccine gained FDA approval in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} propellants may incorporate, for example, {{a combination}} of <b>nitroguanidine,</b> phase-stabilized ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) or other nonmetallic oxidizer, and a nitrogen-rich fuel different from azide (e.g. tetrazoles, triazoles, and their salts). The burn rate modifiers in the mixture may be an alkaline metal nitrate (NO3-) or nitrite (NO2-), dicyanamide or its salts, sodium borohydride (NaBH4), etc. The coolants and slag formers may be e.g. clay, silica, alumina, glass, etc. Other alternatives are e.g. nitrocellulose based propellants (which have high gas yield but bad storage stability, and their oxygen balance requires secondary oxidation of the reaction products to avoid buildup of carbon monoxide), or high-oxygen nitrogen-free organic compounds with inorganic oxidizers (e.g., di or tricarboxylic acids with chlorates (ClO3-) or perchlorates (ClO4-) and eventually metallic oxides; the nitrogen-free formulation avoids formation of toxic nitrogen oxides).|$|E
50|$|The {{workforce}} {{fell from}} about 3,000 {{in the late}} 1970s to 2,000 {{at the time of}} privatisation in 1984. British Aerospace in 1987 bought the Royal Ordnance Factories. During the 1990s, significant investment was made to the site automating its nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose and <b>nitroguanidine</b> manufacturing plants which improved manufacturing capabilities and process safety. Prior to its closure the site was producing gun and rocket propellant for use in numerous weapons systems. The workforce was about 1,000 in 1991 and was reduced to about 600 in 1993. There was a further reduction in 1996 to 450 employees as the business tried to reduce costs. It was announced in 1998 that the site would close after the loss of a major government contract for the supply of 155mm ammunition to the South African defence contractor, Denel.

40|$|Protonated nitroarginine, [R(NO 2) + H](+), which {{contains}} the <b>nitroguanidine</b> 'explosophore,' undergoes homolytic N - N nitro-imine bond cleavage to expel NO 2 (•) {{and form a}} radical cation of arginine in high yield (100 % relative abundance) upon low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID). Other ionization states of nitroarginine, including [R(NO 2) - H](-), and a fixed-charge derivative of nitroarginine do not expel NO 2 (•) (< 1 %), but instead dissociate via heterolytic bond cleavage with abundant losses of small molecules (N 2 O and H 2 N 2 O 2) from the <b>nitroguanidine</b> group. The effects of proton mobility on the CID reactions of nitroarginine containing peptides was investigated for peptide derivatives of leucine enkephalin, including XYGGFLR(NO 2), X = D, G, K, and R, by examining the different protonation states: [M - H](-); [M + H](+); and [M + 2 H](2 +). For [M + H](+) containing the less basic N-terminal residues (X = D, G) and all [M + 2 H](2 +), mobile proton fragmentation reactions that result in peptide sequence ions dominate. In contrast, for peptides containing the basic N-terminal residues (R and K), the CID spectra of both the [M - H](-) and [M + H](+) are dominated by the losses of small even-electron neutrals from the nitroarginine side-chain. The fraction of <b>nitroguanidine</b> directed fragmentation of the nitroarginine side chain that results in bond homolysis to form [XYGGFLR](+•) by expulsion of NO 2 (•) increases by more than 10 times as the protonation state changes from [M - H](-) (< 10 %) to [M + 2 H](2 +) (ca. 90 %) and by about four times as the acidity of the [M + H](+) N-terminal residue increases from R (19. 0 %) to D (76. 5 %).

40|$|The thesis may he {{conveniently}} {{considered in}} two sections - a cryoscopic {{study of the}} behaviour of guanidine salts in 99. 9 % H 2 SO 4 and {{a study of the}} denitration of methylnitroguanidine in sulphuric acid of strength above 75 % H 2 S 04. In the first section it is established that guanidine is diprotonated to the doubly charged cation to the extent of about 28 % in 99. 9 % H 2 SO 4, and hence the concentration of such a cation in media of less than 98 % H 2 SO 4 is shown to be very small; a fact of importance in theoretical considerations of the effect of sulphuric acid on nitro-guanidine-guanidine equilibria. In the second section the position of equilibrium between methylnitroguanidine and methylguanidine is established for 0. 02 molar solutions in 75 - 99 % H 2 S 04 and the rate of denitration of methylnitroguanidine solutions in 75 - 81 % H 2 S 04 measured. An analytical technique using the ultra violet absorption spectrum of methylnitroguanidine is used. The equilibria are satisfactorily accounted for by theoretical considerations for the media 75 - 87 % H 2 SO 4 but above 88 % H 2 S 04 no quantitative agreement is found. The velocity constants for the denitration reactions, initial concentration 0. 02 molar methylnitroguanidine, are successfully related to the activities of the sulphuric acid molecules and hydroxonium ions in 75 - 81 % H 2 S 04. The effect of a methyl group on both the forward and back reaction in the equilibrium, <b>nitroguanidine</b> H 2 SO 4 guanidine, is discussed by comparing the present work on methylnitroguanidine with the results of work by Simkins and Williams on <b>nitroguanidine</b> and with the result from an experiment using N,N'-dimethyl-N"-nitro guanidine.

40|$|The {{importance}} and tremendous {{advantages of a}} truly flashless propellent for combat use by army, naval and anti-craft units, particularly at night, are self-evident.

40|$|The {{reversible}} denitration {{of several}} nitroguanidines in sulphuric acid media above 67 %, in perchloric acid of 59 - 72 % strength and in sulphuric acid-acetic acid media of 49 - 85 % strength, has been investigated. The {{state of the}} <b>nitroguanidine</b> molecule in strong acid and {{the condition of the}} acid molecules themselves have been discussed. The equilibrium position between the <b>nitroguanidine</b> and corresponding guanidine has been established in all the media used and a correlation of equilibrium position with activity of water in the medium, deduced by Simkins and Williams, has been applied in suitable cases. The rate of denitration over the measurable range has been obtained for several compounds in sulphuric acid-water mixtures, for one in sulphuric acid-acetic acid mixtures and for two in perchloric acid-water mixtures. The rate of guanidine nitration was also measured in sulphuric acid-acetic acid. Rates in perchloric acid are directly proportional to the Hammett acidity function ho. In sulphuric acid this relation does not hold but a relation with ho together with the activities of certain solvent species does apply. The ultra-violet absorption spectra of the nitroguanidines in dilute acid were measured for use in the analysis of reactions.

40|$|The <b>nitroguanidine</b> {{insecticide}} imidacloprid {{along with}} a second generation of related compounds including nitenpyram, all nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor ligands, are used increasingly in many countries. Site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes have been deployed to investigate mutants (G 189 D and G 189 E) of the chicken α 7 homomer-forming nicotinic receptor subunit which are predicted to enhance the negative charge at the negative subsite (loop D) of the ACh binding site. Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type α 7 nicotinic receptors respond to imidacloprid with rapid inward currents. Imidacloprid and nitenpyram are partial agonists, whereas ACh, (−) -nicotine and (+) -epibatidine are full agonists. Compared to wild-type α 7, the mutant G 189 D and G 189 E receptors are much less sensitive to the insecticides, whereas their sensitivity to (−) -nicotine, ACh and (+) -epibatidine is only slightly reduced. In contrast, G 189 N and G 189 Q mutants are sensitive not only to ACh, (−) -nicotine and (+) -epibatidine, {{but also to the}} two insecticides. Thus reduction of the insecticide-sensitivity by the mutations G 189 D and G 189 E are attributed to an increase in negativity of loop D. Desnitro-imidacloprid (DN-IMI), an imidacloprid derivative lacking the nitro group is a potent agonist on the G 189 D and G 189 E mutants suggesting an important role of loop D in nicotinic receptor interactions with the nitro group of <b>nitroguanidine</b> insecticides...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} many {{publications}} {{dealing with the}} thermal decomposition of the cyclic nitramines RDX and HMX, the decomposition behavior of <b>nitroguanidine</b> (nigu), especially in the low temperature range, has not been investigated fundamentally in the past. Because <b>nitroguanidine</b> is an important explosive component for triple base propellants, {{a better understanding of}} the thermal decomposition at low temperatures is of interest. For example, aging studies of triple base propellants exhibited a different decomposition behavior from single and double base propellants. Therefore nigu is supposed to influence the safe life time of propellants containing nitric acid esters. The investigations of the decomposition of nigu published in the past, have been performed at temperatures between 190 degree C and 240 degree C. The aim of this work was to study the decomposition behavior of nigu at temperatures as low as possible. In this connection, temperatures between 110 degree C and 240 degree C hav e been used. In this temperature range, nitroguanidines with different grain sizes have been investigated by measuring the weight loss and analyzing the decomposition gases by mass spectrometry. Also solid residues, like ammeline and melamine, remaining after the degradation tests were analyzed quantitatively by using high performance liquid chromatography. The formation of melamine and ammeline was found to depend strongly on the amount of the weight loss of nigu. The better stability behavior of triple base propellants is possibly due to the formation of NH sub 3 which is being formed in the decomposition process of nigu. Ammonia reacts with nitric oxides and behaves therefore similar as a stabilizer...|$|E
