30|$|The τ’s are cutpoints on the {{measurement}} scale {{that are used}} to distinguish the ordinal categories. In the case of crash severity models, the ordinal response categories are fatality, <b>injury,</b> and <b>no</b> <b>injury</b> crashes. Category 1 (fatal) is defined by the open-ended interval on the lower end of {{the measurement}} scale; Category 3 (<b>no</b> <b>injury),</b> is defined as the portion of the scale above cut point τ_ 2 and Category 2 (injury) is the portion between the two cutpoints. Note that the crash severities are divided into 3 categories instead of 5 levels due to the data availability issues in this paper. In other words, if 5 levels are used, all the 3 injury categories (except fatal and <b>no</b> <b>injury</b> categories) will each involve only a very limited amount of data for modeling, which may cause some data underrepresentation issues. As such, to avoid such issues, the crash severities are classified into only 3 categories, which are used for modeling in this paper.|$|R
