5|$|Annette O'Toole plays Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive mother. She and her husband, Jonathan, give Clark wise {{advice about}} coping with his {{increasing}} abilities. In season five Martha takes a state-senate seat, and in season six {{she leaves the}} show. Although Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, during filming everyone (including Ettinger) {{realized that she was}} <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the part. O'Toole was committed to the television series The Huntress when Ettinger filmed the original pilot. Around the time the creators wanted to recast Martha Kent when The Huntress was canceled, allowing O'Toole to join the cast. The actress had played Lana Lang in Superman III.|$|E
5|$|Gilliam {{originally}} {{believed that}} Pitt was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> {{the role of}} Jeffrey Goines, but the casting director convinced him otherwise. Pitt was cast for a comparatively small salary, as he was still relatively unknown at the time. By the time of 12 Monkeys release, however, Interview with the Vampire (1994), Legends of the Fall (1994), and Se7en (1995) had been released, making Pitt an A-list actor, which drew greater attention to the film and boosted its box-office standing. In Philadelphia, months before filming, Pitt spent weeks at Temple University's hospital, visiting and studying the psychiatric ward to prepare for his role.|$|E
5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, and who was fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E

5|$|Lynch {{has been}} known to allow his {{collaborative}} partners a large degree of control over their roles when working with him; Kyle MacLachlan has several times persuaded Lynch to rewrite scenes, including in 1986's Blue Velvet and the television series Twin Peaks, as he felt they were <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> his characters. The following lists include all of the cast and crew members with whom Lynch has worked on three or more separate projects.|$|E

5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of guys at Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money.

5|$|Lana {{attempts}} to convince everyone {{that it is}} just a rumour by dating Brendan Bond (Michael Wahr). When Sky finds out that Lana is planning to have sex with Brendan during a party, Sky tries to stop her. Lana tells Sky to leave, but then decides to tell Brendan that she cannot have sex with him because she likes girls. Lana receives anonymous notes in her locker praising her for being brave. However, she is also targeted by a gang of girls who threaten to cut her hair off. Susan decides to get the school involved in a tolerance campaign, but many of the parents protest about it. Sky and Lana begin drawing a cartoon strip together called Freak Girl and The Enigma and Buffy Only (Laura Gordon), the editor of a gay magazine, becomes interested in publishing it. Buffy later asks Lana out on a date, but comes to realise that they are <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> each other.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Napoleon in 1815, there were calls {{for the return of}} the Portuguese Monarch to Lisbon; the Portuguese Prince Regent enjoyed life in Rio de Janeiro, where the monarchy was at the time more popular and where he enjoyed more freedom, and he was thus unwilling to return to Europe. However, those advocating the return of the Court to Lisbon argued that Brazil was only a colony and that it was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> Portugal to be governed from a colony. On the other hand, leading Brazilian courtiers pressed for the {{elevation}} of Brazil from the rank of a colony, so that they could enjoy the full status of being nationals of the mother-country. Brazilian nationalists also supported the move, because it indicated that Brazil would no longer be submissive to the interests of Portugal, but would be of equal status within a transatlantic monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Fatboy and Poppy's {{relationship}} turns sour when Poppy {{suggests that}} they should buy a house together. Fatboy eventually pulls himself together and tells her that they haven't been together long enough yet. She then ends their relationship and Fatboy moves in with Tamwar. Fatboy later suggests to Poppy that they rent a flat to begin with and take it from there. The couple reunite with a romantic kiss. However, when Denise feels uncomfortable with the way her new fiancée Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is currently treating her, she gets comfort from Fatboy and the pair are unable to resist each other. When Poppy finds out that they shared a kiss, they realise that they are <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> each other and Poppy returns to go and live with her mum. Upset by the couple's break-up, Fatboy gently tells Dot that her and Poppy are still friends. He supports Dot when he learns that her son Nick Cotton (John Altman) dies and is surprised {{by the arrival of}} her estranged grandson, Charlie Cotton (Declan Bennett). When Fatboy is told that he is no longer needed at The Queen Vic, he accepts a job at Ian's restaurant as a waiter. Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name. Fatboy spends time away from Walford caring for his uncle when he falls ill, and, on his return, Dot suggests that he finds a new place to live, due to Charlie moving in with her and her only being allowed one lodger by council regulations. When Charlie's son is born, Fatboy is unsuccessful in persuading Charlie to take the baby home. He follows Charlie home and discovers that Nick is alive. When Charlie later moves out, Fatboy moves back in with Dot. On Ladies' Night at the Vic, Fatboy consoles Denise when their kiss during the engagement party is revealed. Tina visits Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) to find Fatboy with her.|$|E

Although the director felt she was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the part, he encouraged her to begin including her talent as a singer on her résumé when looking for other work.|$|E

Curbishley made an {{impressive}} start with a victory over the current Premiership leaders Manchester United, his first ever victory over them in his managerial career, in which he won the game 1–0 with a late 75th-minute winner from captain Nigel Reo-Coker.|$|E
25|$|David O. Stewart, on {{the other}} hand, insists that while Burr was not {{explicitly}} guilty of treason according to Marshall's definition, evidence exists that links him to treasonous crimes. For example, Bollman admitted to Jefferson during an interrogation that Burr planned to raise an army and invade Mexico. He said that Burr believed {{that he should be}} Mexico's monarch, as a republican government was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the Mexican people. Many historians believe the extent of Burr's involvement may never be known.|$|E

25|$|When President Gates {{resigned}} in 1912, Fisk trustees began a national search to select his replacement. Although some Fisk alumni and the Nashville Banner, the city's Black newspaper, {{argued that a}} Black man should replace Gates, Booker T. Washington, a Fisk trustee {{and perhaps the most}} important voice in the presidential search process, counseled the timing was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> a Black Fisk president. Instead, the trustees, in consultation with Dr. Wallace Buttrick, Executive Officer of the General Education Board, turned to Thomas Jesse Jones.|$|E
25|$|Swanson was {{angered by}} the response, as she felt those very studios had {{produced}} questionable films themselves, and were jealous at not having the chance to produce Rain. After another threatening telegram, she decided to first appeal to the MPAA, and then the newspapers. She only heard back from Marcus Loew, who promised to appeal on her behalf, and since he owned a chain of theatres this eased some of her concerns. Figuring the silence meant the matter had been dropped, Swanson began filming on Sadie Thompson which already had $250,000 invested in it. Before casting began, the young Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. wanted to audition {{for the role of}} Handsome O'Hara. However, Swanson felt he was too young and <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the role. Lionel Barrymore had been first picked to play Davidson but was thought to be too ill at the time, though he eventually won the role. Barrymore wore the same outfit for an entire week, aggravating Swanson. She asked some of the crew to tell him to change and wash, which he did. Aside from this, Swanson was happy with his performance. Walsh had not appeared {{in front of a camera}} in eight years, and feared he would not be able to direct and act at the same time. However, two days into filming, his fears had disappeared.|$|E

500|$|The part of Philip Padgett {{had been}} written {{specifically}} for the actor John Hawkes. Several weeks before the casting for [...] "Milagro" [...] began, Hawkes had auditioned for the part of Pinker Rawls in the episode [...] "Trevor". Both Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz felt that Hawkes was <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the part; however, they believed he possessed a [...] "dignity and simplicity" [...] that would prevent the main character in [...] "Milagro" [...] from becoming a simple caricature.

[...] After one week of shooting with Deneuve, both Bava and De Laurentiis felt that she should be replaced.
