Marine autogenic input appears to be a major source of organic matter. Generally, non-aromatic hydrocarbons are the most dominant fraction of solvent-extractable organic matter (EOM) followed by the other four fractions in decreasing amounts: fatty acids and asphaltenes, ketones, alcohols and aromatic hydrocarbons. On average, both <b>non-aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fraction and fatty acid and asphaltene fraction account for similar to 40 % of EOM. The sources of acyclic methyl ketones, alkanols and fatty acids were examined. For n-alkan- 2 -ones, allochthonous input is a more important source than marine autogenetic input; the reverse is true for n-fatty acids; for n-alkanols, allochthonous and autogenetic inputs seem comparable. Both n-alkan- 2 -ones and n-fatty acids in the surface sediments of different areas appear to be derived from common sources. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Organic carbon contents are an order of magnitude greater than those typically found in deep sea sediments, suggesting an anoxic depositional environment and elevated levels of primary productivity.

In 1979, individuals of E. purpurata were captured as they collected DDT from walls of remote, rural houses in Brazil. Reported herein are quantities and identities of DDT, DDT metabolites, and other organohalogen compounds in four samples of bees stored since 1979. The concentrations of DDT (sum of p,p′-DDT, -DDE, and -DDD) ranged from 23 to 314 μg/bee which is up to twelve fold higher than the LD 50 value of DDT in the honey bee (Apis mellifera) but significantly lower than the no-effect concentration in E. purpurata.

40|$|Despite {{the crucial}} role of aromatic-derived {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) in deteriorating air quality, its formation mechanism is not well understood, and the dependence of aromatic SOA formation on nitrogen oxides (NOx) is not captured fully by most SOA formation models. In this study, NOx-dependent mechanisms of toluene and m-xylene SOA formation are developed using the gas-phase Caltech Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (CACM) coupled to a gas/aerosol partitioning model. The updated models were optimized by comparison to eighteen chamber experiments performed under both high- and low-NOx conditions at the University of California – Riverside. Correction factors for vapor pressures imply uncharacterized association chemistry, likely in the aerosol phase. The newly developed model can predict strong decreases of m-xylene SOA yield with increasing NOx. Simulated SOA speciation implies the importance of ring-opening products in governing SOA formation (up to ~ 40 - 60 % for both aromatics). Speciation distributions under varied NOx levels imply that competition between hydroperoxide radical and NO for reaction with a bicyclic peroxide radical {{may not be the}} only factor influencing SOA formation. The reaction of aromatic peroxy radicals with NO competing with self-cyclization also affects NOx-dependence of SOA formation. Comparison of SOA formation yield and composition between toluene and m-xylene suggests aldehyde/ketone chemistry from a ring-opening route and a phenolic route play important roles in governing SOA formation, with their relative importance likely varying due to the number of methyl groups on the aromatic ring. Sensitivity studies of the NOx/Aromatic/SOA system with a range of NOx and hydrocarbon concentrations are carried out for toluene, m-xylene, and a mix of toluene and m-xylene. The impact of a <b>non-aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> not expected to form SOA (propene) also is investigated. The effect of temperature variations on model predictions of the NOx effect on SOA formation is also explored.

40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years {{considerable}} progress in observational techniques {{has been achieved}} in the middle infrared (5000 to 500 cm(- 1), 2 to 20 microns m), the spectral region most diagnostic of molecular vibrations. Spectra of many different astronomical infrared sources, some deeply embedded in dark molecular clouds, are now available. These spectra provide a powerful probe, {{not only for the}} identification of interstellar molecules in both the gas solid phases, but also of the physical and chemical conditions which prevail in these two very different domains. By comparing these astronomical spectra with the spectra of laboratory ices one can determine the composition and abundance of the icy materials frozen on the cold (10 K) dust grains present in the interior of molecular clouds. These grains and their ice mantles may well be the building blocks from which comets are made. As an illustration of the processes which can take place as an ice is irradiated and subsequently warmed, researchers present the infrared spectra of the mixture H 2 O:CH 3 OH:CO:NH 3 :C 6 H 14 (100 : 50 : 10 : 10 : 10). Apart from the last species, the ratio of these compounds is representative of the simplest ices found in interstellar clouds. The last component was incorporated into this particular experiment as a tracer of the behavior of a <b>non-aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> The change in the composition that results from ultraviolet photolysis of this ice mixture using a UV lamp to simulate the interstellar radiation field is shown. Photolysis produces CO, CO 2, CH 4, HCO, H 2 CO, as well as a family of moderately volatile hydrocarbons. Less volatile carbonaceous materials are also produced. The evolution of the infrared spectrum of the ice as the sample is warmed up to room temperature is illustrated. Researchers believe that the changes are similar to those which occur as ice is ejected from a comet and warmed up by solar radiation. The warm-up sequence shows that the nitrile or iso-nitrile bearing compound produced during photolysis evaporates between 200 and 250 K, suggesting that it is carried by a small molecular species. These molecules could be similar to the source material in Comet Halley that is ejected in grains into the coma, freed by sublimation, and photolyzed by solar radiation to produce the observed jets...|$|E

A unique feature of this mechanism is the use of a computerized system to estimate and generate complete reaction schemes for most <b>non-aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and oxygenates in the presence of NOx, from which condensed mechanisms for the model can be derived. The mechanism was evaluated against the results of almost 1700 environmental chamber experiments carried out at the University of California at Riverside, including experiments to test ozone reactivity predictions for over 80 types of VOCs. The mechanism was used to update the various ozone reactivity scales developed by Carter (1994 a), including the widely used Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) scale. However, the reactivity estimates for many VOC classes are uncertain, which must be taken into account when using these data for regulatory applications. To aid this, uncertainty classifications have been assigned to all VOCs, and upper limit MIRs for VOCs with uncertain mechanisms are presented. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...|$|R
40|$|The quantity, type, and {{maturity}} {{of the organic}} matter of Quaternary and Tertiary sediments from the Japan Trench (DSDP Leg 56, Sites 434 and 436; and Leg 57, Sites 438, 439 and 440) were determined. The hydrocarbons in lipid extracts were analyzed by capillary- column gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Kerogen concentrates were investigated by microscopy, and vitrinite-reflectance values were determined. Measured organic-carbon values were {{in the range of}} 0. 13 to 1. 00 per cent. Extract yields, however, were extremely low. Normalized to organic carbon, total extracts ranged from 4. 1 to 15. 7 mg/g Corg. Gas chromatography of <b>non-aromatic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> showed that all sediments, except one Oligocene sample, contained very immature, mainly terrigenous organic material. This was indicated by n-alkane maxima at C 29 and C 31 and high odd-carbon-number predominances. Unsaturated steroid hydrocarbons were found to be major cyclic compounds in lower- and middle-Miocene samples from the upper inner trench slope (Sites 438 and 439). Perylene was the dominating aromatic hydrocarbon in all but the Oligocene sample. Microscopy showed kerogens rich in terrigenous organic particles, with a major portion of recycled vitrinite. Nevertheless, almost all the liptinite particles appeared to be primary. This is a paradox, as the bulk of the samples were composed of hemipelagic mineral matter with a major siliceous biogenic (planktonic) component. A trend of reduced size and increased roundness can be seen for the vitrinite/ inertinite particles from west to east (from upper inner trench slope to outer trench slope). All sediments but one are relatively immature, with mean huminite-reflectance values (Ro) in the range of 0. 30 to 0. 45 per cent. The oldest and deepest sediment investigated, an Oligocene sandstone from Site 439, yielded a mean vitrinitereflectance value of 0. 74 per cent and a mature n-alkane distribution. This sample may indicate a geothermal event in late Oligocene time. It failed to affect the overlying lower Miocene and may have been caused by an intrusion. Boulders of acidic igneous rocks in the Oligocene can be interpreted as witnesses of nearby volcanic activity accompanied by intrusions...|$|R
40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of a methane and ethylene mixture to gasoline range hydrocarbons {{has been studied}} over W/HZSM- 5 catalyst. The effect of process variables such as temperature, % vol. of ethylene in the methane stream, and catalyst loading {{on the distribution of}} hydrocarbons was studied. The reaction was conducted in a fixed-bed quartz - micro reactor in the temperature range of of 300 to 500 C using % vol. of ethylene in methane stream between 25 - 75 % and catalyst loading of 0. 2 - 0. 4 gram. The catalyst showed good catalytic performance yielding hydrocarbons consisting of gaseous products along with gasoline range liquid products. The mixed feed stream can be converted to higher hydrocarbons containing a high liquid gasoline product selectivity (> 42 %). Non-aromatics C 5 â€“ C 10 hydrocarbons selectivity in the range of 12 - 53 % was observed at the operating, conditions studied. Design of experiment was employed to determine the optimum conditions for maximum liquid hydrocarbon products. The distribution of the gasoline range hydrocarbons (C 5 -C 10 <b>non-aromatics</b> and aromatics <b>hydrocarbons)</b> was also determined for the optimum conditions...|$|R
