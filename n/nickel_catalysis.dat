However the synthesis {{of these types of}} compounds require harsh conditions such as high temperatures and pressures. Dr. Louie’s research aims to mediate these transitions via metal catalyzed reactions, mainly involving <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Dr. Louie and her team focuses on nickel-based systems not only because it is much less expensive than the more widely used palladium and platinum, but also because it offers a wider range of chemical activity, such as nickel, being a more electropositive transition metal which allows it to undergo oxidative addition readily; oxidize Nickel and lessens the electron density around the atom itself.6 This allows for the cross-coupling of electrophiles to occur which is pivotal in the formation of carbocycles and heterocycles. Dr. Loui and her colleagues further enhance the catalytic ability by combining nickel   with N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands.   The NHC ligands are largely sterically hindered and electron donating, which allows improved and less harsh reactions conditions by expanding the chemical scope of the substrate. (Taking all these chemical factors into account, the Ni/NHC catalyst can effectively couple diynes and nitriles to create pyridines using a hetero-oxidative coupling mechanism. Also, this <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis</b> method (Figure 1) offers a wider range of substrates for which nickel can perform cyclo-additions on, substrates such as; vinylcyclopropanes, aldehydes, ketones, tropones, 3-azetidinones, and 3-oxetanones).|$|E

In alcoholic solvents, magnesium metal and a catalytic amount of mercury(II) chloride may be used. A wide variety of functional groups are unaffected by these conditions, including many that are transformed by dissolving metal reductions. Reductive desulfonylation with these reagents does not occur in reactions of β-hydroxy sulfones, due to the poor leaving group ability of the hydroxyl group.A significant issue associated with the reduction of allylic sulfones is transposition of the allylic double bond, which occurs in varying amounts during reductions by metal amalgams. and tin hydrides Palladium-catalyzed reductive desulfonylations of allylic sulfones do not have this issue, and afford allylic sulfones with high site and stereoselectivity.Aluminum amalgam (Al/Hg) {{may be used for}} the chemoselective reduction of α-sulfonylated carbonyl groups. Carboxylic acid derivatives, acetals, thioacetals, amines, alcohols, and isolated double bonds are all inert to Al/Hg. Selective desulfonylation may be carried out on β-hydroxy sulfones without reductive elimination. Transition metal catalysis is also useful for the stereospecific reduction of alkenyl sulfones. In the presence of an excess of a Grignard reagent, a palladium(II) or nickel(II) catalyst, and a phosphorus or nitrogen ligand, alkenyl sulfones are converted to the corresponding alkenes stereospecifically in good yield.

Palladium catalysis is generally superior to <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis,</b> giving higher yields and stereoselectivities.Alkyl and alkenyl sulfones with good leaving groups in the β position undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and carbonyl compounds. Addition of an α-sulfonyl anion to a carbonyl compound, followed by quenching with an acyl or sulfonyl chloride, leads to a β-acyloxy or -sulfonyloxy sulfone, which undergoes elimination under reductive conditions. Sodium amalgam may be used to accomplish the elimination step; however, the combination of samarium(II) iodide and HMPA is milder than strongly basic sodium amalgam and leads to higher yields in reductive elimination processes.|$|E

One approach employed {{to address this}} challenge has been to draw inspiration from biological systems, which utilize base metal ions {{in a wide variety}} of catalytic reactions. The recent discovery of a nickel containing dioxygenase enzyme has triggered an interest in <b>nickel</b> based oxidation <b>catalysis.</b> This thesis addresses the synthesis of a variety of pincer ligand supported nickel complexes and their reactivity with dioxygen. Two pincer ligand systems were investigated, namely PCP and NCN pincer ligands. The synthesis and characterization of [PCPCy 2 Ni(OH 2) ]BF 4, PCPCy 2 Ni(BF 4), [PCPCy 2 Ni(CN-t-Bu) ]BF 4, and [PCPCy 2 Ni(CO) ]BF 4, are detailed, as well as attempts to reduce these complexes to give a NiI species. The strongly pi-accepting ligands were introduced in the hope that they would stabilize a NiI species and prevent disproportionation. The only discernible products of reduction attempts were colloidal nickel and starting material, suggesting that disproportionation occurs even in the presence of strongly pi-accepting ligands. Nickel complexes supported by the NCN pincer ligand system were also examined. The synthesis and characterization of [NCN(iPr) 2 Ph]NiBr is discussed. Reduction of [NCN(iPr) 2 Ph]NiBr with KC 8 gives a bimetallic complex featuring a NiI-NiI bond. This bimetallic core is supported by two NCN ligands. While each ligand is bound in a mu-eta(2) :eta(1) fashion, the overall structure is asymmetric, with the two Ni ions displaying tau(4) values of 0. 46 and 0. 65. This species, [NCN(iPr) 2 PhNi] 2, readily reacts with dioxygen to give the terminal hydroxo complex, [NCN(iPr) 2 Ph]NiOH, which has been independently synthesized. No intermediate species were detected in the activation of dioxygen by [NCN(iPr) 2 PhNi] 2 at - 78 ??C by UV-Vis. In an attempt to further understand the effect of ligand substituents on the structure of [NCNRNi] 2 complexes, a new, general synthetic route for [NCNR]NiX complexes was investigated. This new route focused on metalation of a protoligand, followed by installation of the imine arms.

The synthesis, characterisation and chemical reactivity of the cations [Ni(tBu CC meth) 2] 2 +, [(tBu CC meth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + and [(tBu CC eth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + is detailed, and their X-ray structures are compared. The unsuccessful preparation of [Ni(tBu CC eth) 2] 2 + and the relative stability of the monocations with respect to dicarbene substitution is discussed and attributed to steric factors. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis, characterisation, reactivity and catalytic studies of simple nickel and palladium cis -dimethyl complexes of the chelating dicarbene ligands. Variable temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy showed contrasting rates of thermal hydrocarbon elimination from Ni(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Ni(tBu CC eth) Me 2, which has previously been observed for chelating bis -phosphine analogues with various P,P' linkages (CH 2) n. These observations further corroborate the analogy between dicarbene and 6 /s-phosphine ligands. It was demonstrated that the compounds Pd(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Pd(tBu CC eth) Me 2 are effective pre-catalysts for the Heck coupling of 4 -bromoanisole and n-butyl acrylate. In addition cations of the type [(tBu CC meth/eth) PdMe(L) ] + (L = pyridine, THF) which are relevant to olefin / CO copolymerisation were prepared.

40|$|Watson, Donald A. Allyl and vinylsilanes are {{important}} nucleophiles in organic synthesis. They are stable reagents that {{can participate in}} a variety of transformations including mainly Hosomi-Sakurai crotylations, Hiyama-Denmark crosscouplings, Tamao-Fleming oxidations, and fluorination reactions. Prior to this work there were few methods that allowed for the synthesis of these valuable compounds from simple alkenes. Using transition metal catalysis, I sought to develop a method to access unsaturated organosilanes using a reaction analogous to the Heck reaction. This endeavor proved valuable, as a powerful new method was developed that allows for the synthesis of vinylsilanes from styrenes and related molecules, and the synthesis of allylsilanes from simple α-olefins containing allylic hydrogen atoms. The latter reaction is highly selective for the linear E-allylsilane. This thesis describes the initial discovery and optimization of the silyl- Heck reaction using palladium catalysis. Methods were developed for use of silyl iodides or silyl chlorides with lithium iodide additives as coupling reagents. The design and synthesis of second-generation ligands have allowed for the synthesis of allylsilanes in high yield by overcoming alkene isomerization. With these ligands I have identified a simplified method to prepare vinyl and allylsilanes. The general transformation has been expanded to <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis,</b> using silyl triflates as coupling partners without the need for iodide additives.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes synthetic endeavors {{aimed at}} harnessing the reactivity of arynes and cyclic alkynes toward {{the synthesis of}} heterocycles. Arynes and cyclic alkynes are highly reactive intermediates that act as electrophilic arene and alkyne surrogates. Additionally, this dissertation outlines the strategic activation of the amide C–N bond using <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> This recently discovered mode of reactivity is employed for the generation of molecular complexity. Chapter One describes a systematic experimental and computational study of a particularly important class of arynes, 3 -halobenzynes. Our efforts show that aryne distortion, rather than steric factors or charge distribution, {{are responsible for the}} regioselectivities observed in 3 -halobenzyne trapping reactions. Experiments also validate the synthetic utility of 3 -halobenzynes for the synthesis of heterocycles, using a tandem aryne trapping / cross-coupling sequence involving 3 -chlorobenzyne. Chapter Two outlines synthetic studies pertaining to two heterocyclic aryne intermediates: the 2, 3 -pyridyne and the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne. 2, 3 -pyridyne generation and trappings were used to access a variety of functionalized pyridines in a regioselective manner. Additionally, synthetic routes to two isomeric silyl triflates, which were intended to serve as precursors to the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne, are disclosed. Subsequent 4, 5 -pyrimidyne generation and trapping experiments were ultimately unfruitful. Chapter Three reports on the synthesis of poly(benzonorbornadiene) polymers via a strategic blend of benzyne chemistry and ROMP. Through a comparative study, we demonstrate that substitution at the benzylic / allylic position prevents oxidative deformation and polymer decomposition, yet does not inhibit polymerization by common ruthenium catalysts with good control over molecular weight dispersity. Chapter Four illustrates the strategic use of cyclohexyne and the more elusive intermediate, cyclopentyne, as efficient tools for the synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds with high sp 3 character. Experimental and computational studies of the first 3 -substituted cyclohexyne are also described. The observed regioselectivities are explained by the distortion / interaction model. Chapter Five describes the generation of the first 3, 4 -piperidyne and its use as a building block for the synthesis of highly decorated piperidines. Experimental and computational studies of this intermediate are disclosed, along with comparisons to the well-known 3, 4 -pyridyne aromatic analogue. Additionally, the distortion / interaction model is used to explain the observed regioselectivities. Chapter Six pertains to the generation of two stained oxacyclic intermediates, the 4, 5 -benzofuranyne and the 3, 4 -oxacyclohexyne. In situ trapping of these intermediates affords an array of heterocyclic scaffolds. Across all trapping reactions performed, product distributions are consistent with predictions made with the distortion / interaction model. Oxygen-containing strained intermediates were also found to react with higher selectivities when compared to their corresponding nitrogen-containing analogues. Chapter Seven depicts the first non-decarbonylative Mizoroki–Heck reactions of amide derivatives. The transformation relies on the use of <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis</b> and proceeds with sterically hindered tri- and tetrasubstituted olefins to yield products containing quaternary centers. Moreover, a diastereoselective variant of this reaction demonstrates its utility for accessing adducts bearing vicinal stereocenters. Our results demonstrate that amide derivatives can be used as building blocks for the assembly of complex scaffolds...|$|E
40|$|Nickel-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming {{reactions}} {{provide a}} potentially useful strategy {{to generate a}} variety of organic compounds efficiently,regioselectively, chemoselectively, and stereoselectively. The versatility {{of these types of}} reactions makes them a powerful tool in organic synthesis. This dissertation mainly focuses on methodology development involving <b>nickel</b> <b>catalysis.</b> In this work, a number of highly selective reactions of readily available precursors, such as alkynes, enals and enones were developed. In one application, a novel, nickel-catalyzed [3 + 2] cycloaddition of enals and alkynes was explored. This reaction provides a diastereoselective and chemoselective entry to five-membered rings, which are a common structural motif in many architecturally complex and biologically active natural products. In another application, a novel, nickel-catalyzed intermolecular reductive coupling of enones and alkynes was developed. The key feature of this reaction is the chemoselective coupling of two potential Michael acceptors such as enones and alkynoates. The direct participation of alkynes as an alternative to preparing and handling sensitive vinyl cuprate reagents provides potentially significant improvements in accessing γ,δ-unsaturated ketones. An intriguing, nickel-catalyzed, intermolecular reductive coupling of enals and alkynes has also been developed. The unique features of this reaction are the construction of geometrically pure Z-enol silanes and high functional group tolerance. The direct participation of enals, alkynes and silanes as an alternative to existing methods provides potentially significant improvements in accessing enol silanes. Additionally, this reaction provides direct evidence for the catalytic involvement of a seven-membered oxametallacycle intermediate. A novel, nickel-catalyzed intermolecular three-component coupling of aldehydes, alkynes, and enones has been developed. This new process involves an internal redox mechanism and proceeds in the absence of reducing agents that have previously been required in related nickel-catalyzed couplings. The high extent of chemoselectivity is unusual, particularly for aldehyde, enone, alkyne couplings that involve three different π-components. Together, these new methods provide access to interesting chemical scaffolds and greatly expand the versatility of nickel-catalyzed reactions...|$|E
