5|$|As Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, peak wind gusts of 165km/h, (105mph) were reported, with {{extensive}} damage also reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita all buildings except for the church were flattened with an estimated cost to rebuild the houses exactly as they were was estimated at A$12,000 (US$10,000 1997), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$84,000 (63,000 USD 1997). Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Keli {{struck the}} islands of Tuvalu on June 12 and 13, with {{extensive}} damage reported throughout the Islands with trees uprooted by wind and waves. On Nivalakita, all buildings except for the church were flattened; an estimated cost to rebuild all of the houses as they were before the cyclone hit was estimated at A$ (US$), while {{it was estimated that}} the cost of rebuilding the houses with an improved, cyclone-resistant design would be about A$ (US$). The whole of Tepuka Savilivili was left uninhabitable, as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> area of jagged coral left behind. In Fiji, strong winds and rough seas were reported from the cyclone as it was moving to the north of Fiji, and while the cyclone was weakening it dropped 3.76inches (95.5mm) of rain on American Samoa.|$|E

25|$|Westonzoyland {{airfield}} {{originated in}} the mid-1920s as a landing ground, being in use by 1926 for drogue tugs using the anti-aircraft gunnery range off Watchet in the Bristol Channel.

25|$|On 19 April 1800, Revolutionnaire and Dryad {{arrived in}} Milford Haven in a distressed state. Dryad {{had been on}} a cruise out of Cork and was on her way home when on 2 April, with her rigging much damaged by hurricanes, when she had {{encountered}} Revolutionnaire, which had lost her rudder. Dryad escorted Revolutionnaire to Cork, but when they were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour out of the port, the winds blew them towards Plymouth. On 16 April they were close to the rocks at Waterford when Dryad succeeded in getting a cable on to Revolutionnaire. Unfortunately, the cable broke and Dryad pulled away, expecting Revolutionnaire to wreck on the rocks. However, providentially, the wind shifted and pushed her away from shore. On 19 April both vessels succeeded in safely reaching Milford Haven.|$|E
25|$|Unexpectedly, {{the lack}} of {{practice}} in 1907 affected his bowling severely when Wass and Hallam failed to repeat their 1907 form in the following two seasons. Indeed, by 1909 John Gunn was clearly <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> occasional bowler – he had taken only 42 wickets for 30 each in 1908 and 1909 – besides failing to recover his batting form. In the extremely dry summer of 1911, {{he was back in}} form as a batsman, but though called upon to bowl a good deal he was never formidable and always expensive. Nonetheless, his batting remained a major force right up to the early 1920s: he averaged over 40 in 1911, 1913, 1914, 1919 and 1920 and was at times the side's outstanding batsman. After this, time gradually took its toll and Gunn dropped out of the Nottinghamshire side after a few matches in 1925. He did play one match at the age of fifty-six for Sir Julien Cahn's XI in 1932.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{transferring}} responsibility, {{the hurricane}} {{was given the}} name Kanoa, the Hawaiian name meaning [...] "the free one". As the storm approached Hawaii, it began to weaken as convection filled the eye. The storm's track mirrored that of the shipping lane between the Panama Canal and Hawaii, leading to several ships being affected. Colder air also began to enter the circulation, leading to further weakening. By the time the system reached Hawaii, it was <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> area of disturbed weather. The remnants of Kanoa persisted until July26, at which time they dissipated over the Hawaiian Islands. The remnants of the storm brought beneficial rainfall to most of Hawaii, with heavy rains being reported {{in parts of the}} Big Island.|$|E

500|$|During this period, Warner {{showed little}} {{foresight}} in {{his treatment of}} the studio's cartoon operation. [...] Animated characters such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig, while embraced by cartoon lovers, [...] "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." [...] As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, [...] "Jack Warner...considered cartoons <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." [...] In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't [...] "even know where the hell the cartoon studio is", and Harry added, [...] "The only thing I know is that we make Mickey Mouse," [...] {{a reference to the}} flagship character of a competing company, Walt Disney Productions. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece.

500|$|Asturias shows how, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running [...] "aimlessly, with his mouth opened and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting". Just a few lines later, the Zany is [...] "whin like an injured dog". In what is in part {{a critique of the}} book, Jorge Barrueto argues that [...] depicts Latin America as a whole as [...] "Other". [...] Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this [...] "otherness" [...] as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> [...] "imitation of the European ways". [...] Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be a land where [...] "Otherness" [...] prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot [...] "evolve" [...] or reach truly European levels of modernity. [...] For Barrueto, [...] "this narrative's goal is to prove that Latin American societies, though they are aware of the blueprint of Modernity, are unable to act accordingly." ...|$|E
