In comparison, the Australia-United States trade negotiation (AUSFTA: 3 / 2003 - 2 / 2004) {{was conducted}} consecutively, after these two negotiations. I use the temporal difference among these three treaty negotiations {{to investigate the}} role of time in negotiation and the influence that one negotiation can have on another negotiation (past, present and future are treated as independent variables, and negotiation process and outcome are treated as dependent variables in this study). In exploring concurrently linked negotiations (SAFTA and USSFTA) I examine {{the role of the}} link-pin party (Singapore), both linked parties (Australia and the U.

In exploring consecutively linked negotiations, I consider how past events influence current negotiations (e. g., influence of USSFTA and SAFTA on AUSFTA) and how perceived future negotiations influence current negotiations (e. g., precedent building). The temporal framework developed through this study serves to enlarge our understanding of linkage behavior, which will assist in the strategic management of <b>negotiation</b> linkage <b>dynamics.</b> This temporal framework may also enhance the current theoretical paradigm of negotiation by providing a foundation that includes the past, present and future.

40|$|Structure Matters in Negotiation 2 We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} framework and associated propositions for interpreting {{a key component of}} <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics</b> – offer exchange. We view negotiation as collaborative search of a complex offer space, whereby negotiators simplify and coordinate search via information contained in offer exchanges, isolating sub-regions of the offer space for potential solutions. We suggest that early search is influenced more by value of offers to the negotiators, but later is influenced more by structure of offers in the exchange, whereby {{there appears to be a}} heuristic for selecting offers that are structurally similar to prior offers. As both negotiators tend to engage this heuristic, the result is a joint-focusing on subsets of the offer space and a bias toward structural proximity of offers and agreements...|$|E
40|$|In the thesis, a {{theoretical}} synthesis is constructed, predicting two opposing mechanisms affecting negotiation tactics applied by central {{parties of the}} UNFCCC during COP 19. The first mechanism hypothesizes that certain conditions facilitate a value-creating negotiation tactic, while the second mechanism suggest causes for parties adopting a value-claiming tactic. In order to make inferences about the mechanisms, knowledge about parties negotiation positions is required. By coding the parties' ADP-submissions in 2013, a quantitative analysis of the parties positions is performed. Minutes from the conference meetings constitute {{the foundation of the}} analysis of <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Contrary to prior beliefs, the analysis of the first mechanism shows that the hypothesized conditions do not result in value-creating negotiation tactics in all analyzed cases.

Under right-to-manage wage bargaining we assume that wage is negotiated after the decision on the capital stock.

This is because higher bargaining power of the trade union will induce workers to save more thus boosting the capital stock, ceteris paribus.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} hypothesis that strategic behavioral mimicry can facilitate negotiation outcomes. Study 1 used an employment negotiation with multiple issues, and demonstrated that strategic behavioral mimicry facilitated outcomes at both the individual and dyadic levels: Negotiators who mimicked the mannerisms of their opponents both secured better individual outcomes, and their dyads as a whole also performed better when mimicking occurred compared to when it did not. Thus, mimickers created more value and then claimed most of that additional value for themselves, though {{not at the expense}} of their opponents. In Study 2, mimicry facilitated negotiators’ ability to uncover underlying compatible interests and increased the likelihood of obtaining a deal in a negotiation where a prima facie solution was not possible. Results from Study 2 also demonstrated that interpersonal trust mediated the relationship between mimicry and deal-making.

40|$|This paper tackles {{the problem}} of {{irreversible}} investment and price negotiation under Knightian uncertainty using the real options lens. We present a multiple-priors based formulation of utility in continuous-time that permits a distinction between risk and uncertainty in decision-making to study the impact of vagueness/ambiguity on bilateral price negotiation and investment. Specifically, we examine <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics</b> between a buyer and a seller in a dual options context (i. e., call for buyer and put for seller) to 1) derive thresholds for optimal commitment, 2) identify conditions under which mutual agreement is warranted (with and without bargaining power), and 3) estimate likelihood of agreement, all in an environment fraught with deep economic uncertainty. Besides generalizing risk uncertainty results found in previous research, our findings highlight the moderating effect of negotiators ’ perceived ambiguity (i. e., pessimism and optimism) {{on the process of}} negotiation and its related outcomes and provide insights into the formulation of robust optimal (buying/selling) strategies for negotiation under high uncertainty. ...|$|E

The negotiation process, as opposed to ``herding-like'' or ``bounded confidence'' driven processes, {{is based on a}} microscopic dynamics where memory and feedback play a central role. Our model displays a non-equilibrium phase transition from an absorbing state in which all agents reach a consensus to an active stationary state characterized either by polarization or fragmentation in clusters of agents with different opinions. We show the exystence of at least two different universality classes, one for the case with two possible opinions and one for the case with an unlimited number of opinions. The phase transition is studied analytically and numerically for various topologies of the agents' interaction network. In both cases the universality classes do not seem to depend on the specific interaction topology, the only relevant feature being the total number of different opinions ever present in the system.

40|$|Social media play in today's {{societies}} {{a fundamental}} {{role for the}} <b>negotiation</b> and <b>dynamics</b> of crises. However, classical crisis communication theories neglect {{the role of the}} medium and focus mainly on the interplay between crisis type and crisis communication strategy. Building on the recently developed " networked crisis communication model" we contrast effects of medium (Facebook vs. Twitter vs. online newspaper) and crisis type (intentional vs. victim) in an online experiment. Using the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster as crisis scenario, we show that medium effects are stronger than the effects of crisis type. Crisis communication via social media resulted in a higher reputation and less secondary crisis reactions such as boycotting the company than crisis communication in the newspaper. However, secondary crisis communication, e. g. talking about the crisis communication, was higher in the newspaper condition than in the social media conditions because people consider traditional media as more credible. We also found higher levels of anger in the intentional crisis condition than in the victim crisis condition. Anger in turn was related to reputation, secondary crisis communication and secondary crisis reaction. The results stress the need for more complex models of crisis communication. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|Managing {{behaviour}} {{has always}} been a vital part of youth work and helps to protect the safety and wellbeing of young people. Based on interviews with 20 young people and 15 youth workers in New South Wales, Australia, a range of strategies used by youth workers for managing behaviour are identified that could be placed on a continuum from coercive to non-coercive. Coercive strategies included physical restraint, calling the police and exclusion. Non-coercive strategies included building relationships, using group <b>dynamics,</b> <b>negotiation</b> and mediation, establishing clear boundaries and structure, and preventing problems from escalating.

40|$|International {{organizations}} sometimes institutionalize country groupings by specifying differentiated {{commitments that}} may, in turn, affect <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Drawing on incentive-based and socialization arguments, we develop a “constructed peer group” hypothesis suggesting that by creating these groups those organizations may actually construct new lines of confrontation {{over and above}} the substance-based disagreements existing between countries. This generates a particular type of path dependence, rendering broad-based international agreements more difficult in the future. We analyze this question at the example of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's increasingly politicized split between Annex I and non-Annex I countries. Using a self-coded dataset of country oral statements during the negotiations between December 2007 and December 2009 we assess whether Annex I membership influences a country's stance toward other countries’ arguments, while controlling for country characteristics that may drive their preferences and the affiliation to Annex I. We find that the split between Annex I and non-Annex I has indeed influenced negotiation behavior and amplified the divide between developing and industrialized countries in the climate negotiations...|$|E

40|$|Following the Middle East Peace Conference in Madrid in 1991, the Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS) {{working group}} was {{launched}} {{as the first}} and so far only official regional arms control negotiations.

This paper takes an inter-disciplinary approach to studying negotiations: it zooms in on the ACRS process, integrating Middle East studies, decision making processes and nonproliferation literature with negotiations theory and oral history techniques, in the first attempt at a more comprehensive methodology to one of the highlights in the modern Middle Eastern diplomacy. To convey the multiple vantage points of participants, a three-stage methodological process is discussed: individual interviews with negotiating team members and facilitators, followed by group interviews of national delegations, and finally, a group session with representatives from each delegation. Ultimately, this model helps preserve a more accurate historical account, and significantly complements the technical insights on the <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics</b> with unexpected inter-personal relations angles, assisting in the design of more promising future frameworks...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{multilateralism}} can mean different things.

Multilateralism is a tool for organising complexity and making it amenable to negotiation in multilateral settings, by working towards a single negotiating text and goal. A number of theories have been developed to explain the internal <b>dynamics</b> of multilateral <b>negotiations.</b> These range from different international and integration theories to <b>negotiation</b> analysis, cultural <b>dynamics,</b> systems theory, decision theory, game theory, coalition theory, organisation theory, network theories, agency and agenda setting, globalisation and new institutionalism, and so on.

40|$|It {{is unusual}} {{to find a}} {{negotiation}} not linked {{to at least one}} other negotiation. In some domains, such as international trade policy, we can identify negotiation networks with parties simultaneously involved in negotiations in global, multilateral, regional and bilateral trade policy settings. A single party (i. e., a national government) will manage similar issues in all four settings and also manage these same issues with multiple parties in a single setting. International trade policy is one of many "linkage-rich" environments. This study examines the relationship between two discrete but linked treaty negotiations: the Singapore - Australia Free Trade Agreement of 2003 (SAFTA) and the United States - Singapore Free Trade Agreement of 2003 (USSFTA). Case analysis identifies five structural factors that enhance the potential and fundamentally shape the nature of <b>negotiation</b> linkage <b>dynamics.</b> If linkage occurs then role theory can be employed to define two functional role types, a link-pin party (Singapore in this study) and linked parties (Australia and the U. S.). Such theory and case analysis support the development of propositions and help establish guidance for managing negotiation behavior. Key structural characteristics that appear to create linkage dynamics in this study are used to build a four-part structural framework that maps the universe of negotiation linkage phenomena and determines the fundamental nature of four discrete linkage conditions. This framework also provides descriptive and prescriptive guidance for managing strategy and power in linked negotiations.

40|$|The European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) {{began on}} January 1, 1999. The European Central Bank {{has been set}} up in Frankfurt, Germany, and the Euro created. Looking at the {{intergovernmental}} negotiations that led to the establishment of the EMU, it is not initially clear, however, which European Union governments actually supported the EMU (and the specificities of its structure, as contained in the Treaty on European Union and its Protocols). With an analysis of a small data set on government preferences as regards the EMU, this paper sheds some light onto the <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Essentially, the paper finds that the German government, through the negotiations surrounding the EMU, obtained an outcome fairly close to its initial policy preferences. Similarly, bargaining outcomes are found to be close to the references of Italy and of some middle-sized members of the EU.

40|$|Given that a {{negotiation}} outcome {{is determined to}} a large extent by the successive offers exchanged by negotiating agents, it is useful to analyze dynamic patterns of the bidding, what Raiffa calls the “negotiation dance”. Patterns in such exchanges may provide additional insight into the strategies used by the agents. The current practice of evaluating {{a negotiation}} strategy, however, is to primarily focus on fairness and quality aspects of the agreement. There is a lack of tools and methods that facilitate a precise analysis of the <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics.</b> To fill this gap, this paper introduces a method for analysis based on a classification of negotiation steps. The method provides the basic tools to perform a detailed and quantified analysis of a negotiation between two agents in terms of dynamic properties of the negotiation trace. The method can be applied to well-designed tournaments, but {{can also be used to}} analyze single 1 -on- 1 negotiation. Example findings of applying the method to analyze the ABMP and Trade-Off strategies show that sensitivity to the preferences of the opponent is independent, respectively dependent, on a correct model of that opponent. Furthermore, the results illustrate that having domain knowledge is not always enough to avoid making unintentional steps. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Predictive {{decision}} making is characteristic to {{current state of the}} art socio-technical systems that guide negotiation processes under electronic settings. Back end participants are particularly benefited by the use of models of computational intelligence, which help them adapt their strategy and evaluate risks and dynamics of the current negotiation. In this paper, the skill of forecasting the counterpart’s future offers with the use of neural networks is investigated. Current systems base their learning models on data acquired from previous interactions. Such systems are once trained in an offline mode and are thereafter expected to operate in a real environment. However, when data distributions change, the systems no longer provide accurate estimations. A new perspective to the issue is introduced, by highlighting the need of learning during the negotiation session, with the use of “session-long learning ” agents. These agents prove capable of capturing the <b>negotiation</b> <b>dynamics</b> by training their learning models with the data from the current negotiation thread. In this paper a static session-long learning agent, based on a simple neural network model, as well as an adaptive session-long learning agent, based on a neural network which evolves its structure and input features {{with the use of a}} genetic algorithm in each negotiation round, are presented and assessed.

40|$|The system {{described}} herein {{represents the}} first example of a recommender system in digital ecosystems where agents negotiate services on behalf of small companies. The small companies compete not only with price or quality, but with a wider service-by-service composition by subcontracting with other companies. The final result of these offerings depends on negotiations at the scale of millions of small companies. This scale requires new platforms for supporting digital business ecosystems, as well as related services like open-id, trust management, monitors and recommenders. This {{is done in the}} Open Negotiation Environment (ONE), which is an open-source platform that allows agents, on behalf of small companies, to negotiate and use the ecosystem services, and enables the development of new agent technologies. The methods and tools of cyber engineering are necessary to build up Open Negotiation Environments that are stable, a basic condition for predictable business and reliable business environments. Aiming to build stable digital business ecosystems by means of improved collective intelligence, we introduce a model of <b>negotiation</b> style <b>dynamics</b> {{from the point of view}} of computational ecology. This model inspires an ecosystem monitor as well as a novel negotiation style recommender. The ecosystem monitor provides hints to the negotiation style recommender to achieve greater stability of an open negotiation environment in a digital business ecosystem.

The negotiation style recommender is implemented with a simulated annealing algorithm at a constant temperature, and its impact is shown by applying it to a real case of an open negotiation environment populated by Italian companie...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{research on}} multiparty negotiation, no prior attempt {{has been made}} to organize and describe knowledge from the various disciplines represented within this field of study. The present article seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of multiparty negotiation.

Development of this framework begins by defining fundamental concepts and identifying essential dynamics that structure the field of multiparty negotiation. This article then describes the building blocks and boundaries of the field. A review of the three most developed multiparty negotiation bodies of literature or domains - international negotiations, public disputes, and organizational and group negotiations - follows. Similarities and differences between the three domains are identified, as are points of theoretical integration. This examination of multiparty <b>negotiation</b> concepts and <b>dynamics,</b> building blocks, boundaries, and domains constitutes a framework that defines multiparty negotiation as a field of practice.

40|$|This paper {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the perspective that civil society participation in governance—particularly policy {{processes such as}} the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and related policy developments—largely takes on a mere consultative rather than a transformative role when initiated and driven by government or donors. In order to understand attempts at changing this situation, the paper explores the experiences and strategies of civil society organisations specifically linked to the Policy Forum network in Tanzania in its objective to transform the consultative engagement to a more meaningful re-politicised participatory engagement. The emerging factors and key findings indicate that the following aspects require considerable attention: (1) engagement in both invited and autonomous spaces to avoid co-optation; (2) strategic coalitions to avoid situations of dominance and control; (3) representation informed by political responsibility; (4) frontstage local engagement with back-stage international support; and (5) linking the macro and micro policy considerations within larger political processes. These factors point to an increasing awareness and strategic <b>negotiation</b> of the <b>dynamics</b> affecting civil society participation in policy processes. Furthermore, they indicate that these dynamics need to be continually assessed and evaluated within the changing political landscape so that civil society is able to position itself more effectively to influence policy towards transforming the structural conditions which perpetuate poverty...|$|R
