5|$|The {{attacks in}} the Tory periodicals, soon {{extended}} to other works by Hazlitt, killed <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> sales of Characters of Shakespear's Plays but, as far {{as much of the}} general public was concerned, his reputation as a literary critic.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E

25|$|The former Cabinet {{minister}} Leo Amery {{delivered a}} fierce {{attack on the}} Chamberlain government, criticising <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the Norwegian campaign but also the government's unpreparedness for it despite intelligence warning of likely German intervention and the clear possibility of some such response to the planned British infraction of Norwegian neutrality by the mining of Norwegian territorial waters.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} and kinematics of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, {{suggest a}} mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. Alternatively, as lenticular galaxies {{are likely to be}} more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they are <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Rather, lenticular galaxies might result from galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and give the newly merged galaxy its disk-like, arm-less appearance.|$|E

Saints re-open on 25 December 1918 and are beaten 20 points to nil by St Helens Recs in a friendly fixture at City Road. In the shortened 1918—1919 season, St Helens played only nine times. The clubs lack of success and disappointing league finishes continued for another seven seasons.|$|E
25|$|The high rents {{and poor}} {{maintenance}} of housing stock, which Harlem residents suffered {{through much of}} the 20th century, was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> product of racism by white landlords. By 1914, 40% of Harlem's private houses and 10% of its tenements were owned by blacks. Wealthier blacks continued to purchase land in Harlem, and by 1920, {{a significant portion of the}} neighborhood was owned by blacks. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.|$|E
25|$|Deliberative {{democracy}} {{is based on}} the notion that {{democracy is}} government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 8th century both Judah and Israel were vassals of Assyria. Israel rebelled, and was {{destroyed}} c.722BC. Refugees fleeing to Judah {{brought with them}} {{a number of new}} traditions (new to Judah, at least). One of these was that the god Yahweh, already known and worshiped in Judah, was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> most important of the gods, but the only god who should be served. This outlook influenced the Judahite landowning elite, who became extremely powerful in court circles after they placed the eight-year-old Josiah on the throne following the murder of his father, Amon of Judah.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> {{earth to}} which Hutton {{directed}} his attention. He had long studied the {{changes of the}} atmosphere. The same volume in which his Theory of the Earth appeared contained also a Theory of Rain. He contended {{that the amount of}} moisture which the air can retain in solution increases with temperature, and, therefore, that on the mixture of two masses of air of different temperatures a portion of the moisture must be condensed and appear in visible form. He investigated the available data regarding rainfall and climate in different regions of the globe, and {{came to the conclusion that}} the rainfall is regulated by the humidity of the air on the one hand, and mixing of different air currents in the higher atmosphere on the other.|$|E
25|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from successive governments, from approximately 1977 RTÉ extended Section 31 to censor all Sinn Féin members, <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> Sinn Féin spokespersons {{specified in the}} Section 31 Order. This extension of the Order {{came to a head}} In the early 1990s. Sinn Féin member Larry O'Toole was not permitted to talk on RTÉ about a strike in Gateaux, a cake factory in Finglas north Dublin, where O'Toole worked. He was informed in writing by RTÉ that his Sinn Féin membership was the reason for the censorship. O'Toole challenged what he contended was RTÉ self-censorship in the High Court. After the court found in O'Toole's favour in August 1992, RTÉ appealed the ruling that liberalised its Section 31 regime. Consequently, RTÉ were accused of appealing to be censored. RTÉ then lost in the Supreme Court in March 1993.|$|E

25|$|In the 1040s it {{came into}} the hands of the counts of Albon (later dauphins of the Viennois) and thenceforth shared the fate of the Dauphiné. The Briançonnais {{included}} <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> upper valley of the Durance (with those of its affluents, the Gyronde and the Guil), but also the valley of the Dora Riparia (Césanne, Oulx, Bardonnèche and Exilles), and that of the Chisone (Fénestrelles, Pérouse, Pragelas)—these glens all lying on the eastern slope of the chain of the Alps. But by the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) all these valleys were handed over to Savoy in exchange for that of Barcelonnette, on the west slope of the Alps. In 1815 Briançon successfully withstood a siege of three months at the hands of the Allies, a feat which is commemorated by an inscription on one of its gates, Le passé répond de l'avenir.|$|E

500|$|The Unemployed Assistance Board (UAB, {{established}} by the Unemployment Act 1934) was largely Chamberlain's creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as [...] "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> <b>the</b> absence of disease or infirmity". Women's health is an example of population health, the health of a specific defined population.|$|E
500|$|Du Bois became incensed in 1961 {{when the}} U.S. Supreme Court upheld the 1950 McCarran Act, a key piece of McCarthyism {{legislation}} which required communists {{to register with}} the government.
