50|$|Daily inflation-indexed bonds pay a {{periodic}} coupon that {{is equal to}} the product of the daily inflation index and the <b>nominal</b> <b>coupon</b> rate. The relationship between coupon payments, breakeven daily inflation and real interest rates is given by the Fisher equation. A rise in coupon payments is a result of an increase in inflation expectations, real rates, or both.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{asks the}} {{question}} of whether the newly available TIPS yields data can help us achieve a better understanding of the real term structure and the inflation expectations. The yield differential between TIPS and comparable <b>nominal</b> <b>coupon</b> securities is not a direct measure of inflation expectations, because it contains inflation risk premium, and because the TIPS yield may depart from the true "real yield," due to low investor demand especially in the early years. Without using data from the (indexed) real bond market, we cannot fully identify the real interest rate from the inflation risk premium, unless we assume that all information affecting the real term structure is reflected in the nominal bond prices. Even with this assumption, empirical identification of the real term structure is hard to achieve because of the poor measurement and the frequent revisions of the price series. We develop a flexible multifactor term-structure model to allow for suitable specifications of liquidity premium on TIPS, as well as complications caused by lagged indexation. We estimate the model by the Kalman filter using TIPS yields, nominal bond yields, realized inflation and survey data on interest rates and inflationTIPS, Inflation risk premium, term structure of interest rates...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three original articles {{in the field of}} general equilibrium with incomplete markets and general equilibrium with asymmetric information, and an introduction to the theory, which traces its development and embeds the following chapters in a common framework. In Pareto Improving Trade Restrictions in an Incomplete Markets Economy, we consider a stylised three period one good general equilibrium model with incomplete security markets. We show that the introduction of an indiscriminate marginal constraint on security trades can lead to a Pareto improvement, even though all prices are endogenous and agents are fully rational and have symmetric information. In Signaling Credit Quality Independently of Contract Choice: a Non-Transaction Cost Approach to Swaps in Anonymous Markets, we demonstrate that under two conditions, swaps are non-redundant securities in anonymous financial markets. Firstly, there is asymmetric information over the project payoff which is financed by swaps. And secondly, borrowers are restricted from being investors at the same time. If either of this condition fails, then swaps are redundant assets. Swaps permit a constrained optimal solution to an asymmetric information problem. Finally, Anonymous Corporate Bond Markets with Asymmetric Information, the main article of this thesis, shows that in an anonymous credit market which is characterised by limited liability and asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders, the nominal rate of interest on tradable debt (the coupon rate) sorts borrowers by their riskiness and in this way has an indirect influence on the price and quantity of bonds traded in equilibrium. This is in contrast to symmetric information models, in which the <b>nominal</b> <b>coupon</b> rate has no function. The paper claims that the adverse sorting effect of the nominal interest rate, as in Stiglitz-Weiss (1981), is maintained in a competitive setting, but that, even though changes in the nominal interest rate result in non-monotonic changes in the deliveries of agents, the orderly functioning of markets is not impaired...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} term {{structure}} {{implications of the}} fiscal theory of price level determination. We introduce the intertemporal budget constraint {{of the government in}} a general equilibrium model in continuous time. Fiscal policy is set according to a simple rule whereby taxes react proportionally to real debt. We show how to solve for the prices of real and <b>nominal</b> zero <b>coupon</b> bonds. bond pricing; fiscal policy; mathematical methods...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses an HJM {{model to}} price TIPS and related {{derivative}} securities. First, using the market prices of TIPS and ordinary U. S. Treasury securities, both {{the real and}} nominal zero-coupon bond price curves are obtained using standard coupon-bond price stripping procedures. Next, a three-factor arbitrage- free term structure model is fit to the time series evolutions of the CPI-U and the real and <b>nominal</b> zero- <b>coupon</b> bond price curves. Then, using these estimated term structure parameters, {{the validity of the}} HJM model for pricing TIPS is confumed via its hedging performance. Lastly, the usefulness of the pricing model is illustrated by valuing call options on the inflation index...|$|R
40|$|A {{contract}} to insure $ 1 against inflation {{is equivalent to}} a European call option on the consumer price index. When there is no deductible this call option is equivalent to a forward contract on the CPI. Its price {{is the difference between}} the prices of a zero coupon real bond and a zero <b>coupon</b> <b>nominal</b> bond, both free of default risk. Provided that the risk-free real rate of interest is positive, the price of such an inflation insurance policy first rises and then falls with time to maturity. It is a decreasing function of the real interest rate and an increasing function of both the expected rate of inflation and the real risk premium on nominal bonds. When a deductible is introduced, the insurance policy can no longer be priced like a CPI forward contract. The option feature has its greatest value when the deductible is close to the forward rate of inflation, defined as the difference between the risk-free nominal and real interest rates. Such inflation insurance contracts are priced using the model developed by Black-Merton-Scholes. Pricing an inflation insurance policy with a cap requires only a minor modification of the model. The approach presented in this paper permits fairly precise quantification of the cost of implementing proposals to index pension benefits for inflation. It also gives us a way of estimating the savings to the Social Security system that would result from introducing a deductible. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} European Central Bank''s (ECB''s) {{response}} to the global financial crisis. Our results suggest that even during the crisis, the core part of ECB''s monetary policy transmission-from policy rates to market rates-has continued to operate, but at a decreased efficiency. We also find some evidence that the ECB''s non-standard measures, namely the lengthening of the maturity of monetary policy operations {{and the provision of}} funds at the fixed rate, reduced money market term spreads, facilitating the pass-through from policy to market rates. Furthermore, the results imply that the substantial increase in the ECB''s balance sheet may have contributed to a reduction in government bond term spreads.
