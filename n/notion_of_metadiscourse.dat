40|$|The paper {{moves from}} a broad <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> {{focusing}} on ‘locational metatext’ comprising “linguistic elements that refer to the text itself or parts of it” (Dahl 2004 : 1811), and “rhetorical metatext” (Dahl 2004 : 1812), whereby the writer interacts with the reader by making explicit the rhetorical acts he performs in the argumentative process. The aim of the paper is to explore the frequency and use of metadiscursive patterns involving these elements in English research article openings, by comparing two soft-science disciplines, i. e. economics and history. More specifically, data are examined through corpus linguistics tools, in order to focus on disciplinary similarities and differences in terms of common metadiscourse functions. Furthermore, more distinctive aspects are investigated bearing on authorial presence in the organisation of discourse towards both its content and the readership {{right from the beginning}} of research articles. Finally, the overall epistemological configurations revealed by collocational and phraseological patterns are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> – {{the ways}} in which writers and {{speakers}} interact through their use of language with readers and listeners (also referred to as metalanguage and metapragmatics) – has received considerable attention in applied linguistics in recent years, particularly in the study of academic discourse. Conceptualised within the applied linguistics context of developing optimal descriptions of genres as a basis for a genre-based pedagogy, this article first reviews some of the different approaches to metadiscourse, highlighting how the concept is construed in different ways by different researchers. The article then discusses a number of problematic issues in metadiscourse research: metadiscourse as textual or interpersonal; the size of the linguistic unit in metadiscourse research; the multi-functionality <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> items; and the issue of representativeness in corpus research on metadiscourse. The second part of the article focuses on the concept of signalling nouns (SNs) (abstract nouns which carry particular pragmatic meanings in discourse), a feature of discourse not usually included under the rubric <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> It is argued, however, that SNs represent an important resource for making writers’ (or speakers’) intended meanings clear. In this second part of the article, a first section introduces the <b>notion</b> <b>of</b> SN and a second section discusses how SNs might be incorporated into a model <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> A final section of the paper concludes with a summary and some comments on pedagogic application...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation <b>of</b> gender and <b>metadiscourse</b> to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> the study further aims to compare the use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the metadiscourse devices were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, engagement markers, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of interactive and interactional metadiscourse, and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the study of written texts reflect a growing {{interest}} in interaction between readers and writers. Several studies have focused on metadiscourse as an important interactive feature that is believed to facilitate the reading process. While several authors have studied metadiscourse from the descriptive and contrastive perspectives, {{there is a lack of}} experimental work on this topic. This paper describes exploratory classroom research with a group of Italian university students to gain further insight into the effect <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> on ESP reading comprehension. Two groups of students read selected extracts from two versions of the same text differing according to quantity and type <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> Each group then took a reading comprehension test and their mean scores were compared. The findings suggest that a more pronounced use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> may be associated with improved comprehension in some cases.

The study has been conducted in three steps. The first part focuses on the theory and categorization <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers, followed by an analysis of the use and development of these markers in learners of L 2 Spanish. The second part deals with the categorization and operationalization of aspects of fluency and conversational participation that can be associated with the use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers; followed by an analysis of these aspects in the performance of the learners. The third part of the study is a summary of the results obtained and a discussion {{of the relationship between the}} use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers and the development of fluency and conversational participation. The data underlying the current study consists of a selection of 17 recorded conversations between learners of L 2 Spanish and native speakers of Spanish taken from the AKSAM database. The conversations belong in two activity types: discussions and simulated negotiations. The selected sample has a duration of approx. 10 hours and comprises 87   683 words. The study focuses on nine learners who have been recorded at the beginning and at the end of their five month study-abroad stay. Results show that frequency <b>of</b> use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers has increased considerably at the end of the stay in the majority of the learners under study. A qualitative development can also be found, through which the metadiscourse markers that characterize the learners’ L 1 and/or interlanguage have been substituted by more target-like expressions. Furthermore, both their fluency and level of conversational participation have generally increased. Within this development, however, a notable individual variation can be found. The learners who show the strongest development as regards fluency and conversational participation are also found to exhibit the most salient development <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers. Since disfluency is reduced to a lesser degree in those participants who also exhibit a less developed use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers, it is argued that the development <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in the L 2 learner runs parallel to the development of discourse skills, but also that acquiring an adequate use of metadiscourse markers helps developing these skills. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the misuses of two main categories <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers used by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number <b>of</b> misuses <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were counted with regard to their use of textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors. Finally, using a Pearson correlation to investigate the correlation between the participants’ TOEFL score and essay score, it was concluded that language proficiency has a positive relationship with the uses <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers and essays quality...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} {{development}} {{of interest in}} the interpersonal dimensions of academic communication in the 1980 s, the analytic potentials of the concept <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> have motivated a large number of investigations.

The data collected using non-participant observation method and note taking techniques were analyzed with the theory of rhetorical moves in abstracts and metadiscourse. The results show that from 42 abstracts, only few abstracts from science belong to informational abstracts. Humanities tends to use three moves with the pattern PMR (Purpose, Method, Results); meanwhile, science andsocial science tend to use four moves with the pattern BPMR (Background, Purpose, Method, Results). On the whole, interactional metadiscourse is infrequently used. In terms <b>of</b> functions <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in relation to moves, discourse goal (sub-type of frame markers) characterizes Move 2.

A case study evaluation of a chapter in a typical sixth grade social studies textbook is described and several problems related to metadiscourse discovered in the case study are revealed. An experimental study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> and interpersonal voice on retention an...|$|R

Metadiscourse is defined as an author's overt or non-overt presence in the discourse in order to direct rather than inform readers [...] the linguistic material given to readers so they will understand what is said and what is meant in the primary discourse. Three general categories <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> [...] information, voice, and attitude [...] were added in varying combinations to a passage from a social studies textbook. One hundred twenty mostly white middle-class sixth-graders were tested for learning from these passages. Analyses of covariance, controlling for reading ability, revealed significant interaction effects Involving metadiscourse and anxiety. As expected, high anxious students showed their best performance with first person voice and n...|$|R
40|$|Metadiscourse {{refers to}} {{aspects of a}} text which {{explicitly}} organise the discourse, engage the audience and signal the writer's attitude. Its use by writers to guide readers and display an appropriate professional persona is {{an important aspect of}} persuasive writing. Its role in establishing and maintaining contact between the writer and the reader and between the writer and the message also makes it a central pragmatic concept. Based on a textual analysis of 28 research articles in four academic disciplines, this paper seeks to show how the appropriate use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> crucially depends on rhetorical context. The study identifies a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> functions and suggests that metadiscourse reflects one way in which context and linguistic meaning are integrated to allow readers to derive intended interpretations. It is argued that metadiscourse provides writers with a means of constructing appropriate contexts and alluding to shared disciplinary assumptions. The study <b>of</b> academic <b>metadiscourse</b> can therefore offer insights into our understanding of this concept and illuminate an important dimension of rhetorical variation among disciplinary communities. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} cultural {{variations in the}} use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> between Turkish and USA postgraduate students’ abstracts in MA thesis written in English. The taxonomy was borrowed from Hyland (2005). The corpora {{in the present study}} comprise a total of 52 thesis abstracts written in English from the department of English Language Teaching, 26 thesis from USA students and 26 from Turkish students. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to analyse the texts in the corpora. The analysis revealed that there were some cultural differences in the amounts and types <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> The incidence <b>of</b> evidential, endophorics, code glosses, boosters, attitude markers, self-mentions were fewer in Turkish students’ master thesis abstracts. However, Turkish students used metadiscourse transitions, frame markers and hedges more than USA students. Pedagogical implications were provided in light of empirical data...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{occupies}} a paramount position in any logical endeavor and research article is consensually considered a predominant site {{of such an}} endeavor. One interesting area of rhetoric which addresses the source and reliability of evidence is quality metadiscourse. In this qualitative study, quality metadiscourse strategies (i. e., evidentials, hedges, boosters and disclaimers) are examined to investigate their contribution to evidentiality in research articles. Through analyzing authentic examples taken from research articles, it is concluded that evidentials mark the source of evidence and the other strategies are employed to condition propositions proportionate {{to the strength of}} relevant evidence. In fact, this study helps to argue that reliability markers demonstrate the author-perceived distance of propositions from the impact range of evidence. Contrary to the broad definition <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> the paper concludes that without appropriate types of markers, propositions could lose their quality, and as such, they are an indispensable part of the propositions they modify in the broader pragmatic context. Thus, in addition to a contribution to the definition <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> this conceptualization is hoped to facilitate teaching and learning quality metadiscourse in that it defines a more plausible base to the appropriate employment <b>of</b> quality-related <b>metadiscourse</b> strategies...|$|R
