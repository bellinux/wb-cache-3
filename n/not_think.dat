5|$|A USA Today/CNN/Gallup {{poll showed}} that 63percent of the American public did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Baird should be confirmed; the {{reaction}} was broad, with majorities of Republicans and Democrats, men and women, and young and old all opposing it.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing down}} rules {{about how the}} music was to be used, such as {{specific}} scenes certain songs should be used in, or ways a certain song should not be used, the game's scripters implemented the music at points they found fitting. During debugging, Nakazawa would request fixes for songs that he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> fit the scenes they were used in. For the PlayStation Portable release, Asami Imai performed the opening theme.|$|E

5|$|Emily Osment as Cassie Keller, a goth {{girl who}} likes to read and enjoys pulling pranks on {{students}} and her brother. While walking to the library, Cassie visits a Halloween shop, which she did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> was there before. After ignoring the warning within the book to not read it aloud, a monster known as the Evil Thing escapes into the city after her brother thinks about it.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it felt outdated. Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 {{appreciated the}} game's lowered difficulty compared to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|I do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Europeans {{understand}} {{the implications of}} a systemic banking crisis.... When all banks are forced to raise capital at the same time, the result {{is going to be}} even weaker banks and an even longer recession—if not depression.... Government intervention should be the first resort, not the last resort.|$|E

5|$|They {{decide to}} name their new baby Bart, {{as it is}} the first name they could think of that Homer did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> other {{children}} would make fun of. The two marry in a small wedding chapel across the state line. They spend their wedding night at Marge's family's house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma.|$|E
5|$|Though Wilhelm was {{primarily}} a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective {{for more than a}} few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.|$|E
5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she {{would return to the}} backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E

5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|As Chen {{was born}} in a culture other than the culture he now lives in, he tries to make games that appeal universally to all people. His goal with his games is to help video games mature as a medium by making games that inspire {{emotional}} responses in the player that other games are lacking. Although he and Thatgamecompany can and have made more traditional games, he does not plan on commercially developing any of them, as he does <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that it fits with their goals as an independent video game developer.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect on free speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E

5|$|Hanuman Chalisa (हनुमान चालीसा), literally, Forty Verses to Hanuman, is an Awadhi work of 40 Chaupais and two Dohas in obeisance to Hanuman. Popular belief {{holds the}} work to be {{authored}} by Tulsidas, and it contains his signature, though some authors do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the work was written by him. It {{is one of the}} most read short religious texts in northern India, and is recited by millions of Hindus on Tuesdays and Saturdays. It is believed to have been uttered by Tulsidas in a state of Samadhi at the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar.|$|E
5|$|He {{was buried}} at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Chicago. Upon hearing reports of Sebille's death, commanders in Korea did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> highly of Sebille's act, likening it to a kamikaze action. In spite of reluctance, Lieutenant Donald Bolt, the squadron's {{assistant}} awards officer, forwarded a citation {{of the event}} to Washington D.C. where Sebille would be evaluated for the Medal of Honor. Shortly after the incident, both Bolt and Sebille's second-in-command, Captain Robert Howell, were killed in separate combat engagements. A short obituary for Sebille appeared in Time Magazine after his death. The United States Air Force Academy also created a memorial to Sebille in Harmon Hall, the academy's administration building.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, Grove {{played two}} {{games for the}} White Sox, {{pitching}} seven innings and allowing eight runs during the two outings. He spent {{the start of the}} 1941 season at Oklahoma City, though on May 19 he was sent to the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League, where he {{spent the rest of the}} season. Grove concluded the year at Oklahoma City with a 17–7 record, an improvement over the previous season. However, Grove received a knee injury late in the season, which he did <b>not</b> <b>think</b> much of at the time. In October, Grove injured his other knee when he was involved in an automobile accident in Missouri.|$|E
