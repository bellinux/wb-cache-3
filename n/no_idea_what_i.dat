500|$|Ramirez {{was seen}} by ABC executives, in her Broadway {{performance}} of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, and she chose Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking for." [...] Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after she met her. Ramirez's character was initially given recurring status in the second season and received star billing in the third season, alongside fellow cast member Dane, who portrayed Mark Sloan.

500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three {{nights in a row}} because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her success}} on Broadway, Ramirez joined {{the cast of}} Grey's Anatomy in a {{recurring}} role as Dr. Calliope 'Callie' Torres, a love interest for Dr. George O'Malley, in the show's second season. On a special Grey's Anatomy-themed episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, she revealed that top executives from ABC, who were greatly impressed by her performance in Spamalot, offered her a role in any ABC show she wanted. She picked Grey's, as she was already {{a fan of the}} show. [...] Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. The series creator and executive producer, Shonda Rhimes explained: [...] "I was looking for a girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking for."

2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E

6000|$|Of course Howells {{promptly}} {{replied that}} he would read the story, [...] adding: [...] "You've <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may {{ask you to do}} for me, some day.

60|$|Naturally I {{was much}} {{handicapped}} {{by the presence}} of the girl. But I could not abandon her, though I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do with her after rejoining my companions. That she would prove a burden and an embarrassment I was certain, but she had made it equally plain to me that she would never return to her people to mate with Buckingham.|$|E
6000|$|Then a fresh {{apprehension}} assailed me. Suppose Bellairs {{had given}} me the slip? Suppose he was now rolling {{on the road to}} Stallbridge-le-Carthew? or perhaps there already and laying before a very white-laced auditor his threats and propositions? A hasty person might have instantly pursued. Whatever I am, I am not hasty, and I was aware of three grave objections. In the first place, I could not be certain that Bellairs was gone. In the second, I had no taste whatever for a long drive at that hour of the night and in so merciless a rain. In the third, I had no idea how I was to get admitted if I went, and <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should say if I got admitted. [...] "In short," [...] I concluded, [...] "the whole situation is the merest farce. You have thrust yourself in where you had no business and have no power. You would be quite as useful in San Francisco; far happier in Paris; and being (by the wrath of God) at Stallbridge-Minster, the wisest thing is to go quietly to bed." [...] On the way to my room I saw (in a flash) that which I ought to have done long ago, and which it was now too late to think of--written to Carthew, I mean, detailing the facts and describing Bellairs, letting him defend himself if he were able, and giving him time to flee if he were not. It was the last blow to my self-respect; and I flung myself into my bed with contumely.|$|E
30|$|Susan noted “as a high schooler I have <b>no</b> real <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to {{do after}} school and I feel that {{sometimes}} they push university… on you as a student.” As Claire’s quote above suggests, Claire’s digital story, in particular emphasised how she and many of her peers were not encouraged {{to think about their}} aspirations and desires, if those were not directly related to university attendance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sessions}} with White, however, proved unsuccessful, with Smith stating: [...] "I had these glorified ideas about San Francisco and its drug culture. I thought inspiration would just hit me and I would get these San Francisco drugs in my system {{and all of}} a sudden an amazing record would come out. But that's not really what happened at all. We sat down in a studio and, instead of picking up a guitar and having some beautiful thing come out, <b>I</b> just had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the fuck <b>I</b> was doing there and gave up before I even started." ...|$|R
500|$|During October and November 1988, Starr and Bach {{attended}} a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona, each receiving a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: [...] "Years I've lost, absolute years … I've <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> happened. <b>I</b> {{lived in a}} blackout." [...] Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band gave their first performance {{to an audience of}} ten thousand in Dallas, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.|$|R
6000|$|And what a style it is, {{that great}} man's! What hoighth of foine {{language}} entoirely! How he can discoorse you in English {{for all the}} world as if it was Latin! For instance, suppose you and I had to announce the important news that some writers published what are called Christmas books; that Christmas books are so called because they are published at Christmas: and {{that the purpose of the}} authors is to try and amuse people. Suppose, I say, we had, by the sheer force of intellect, or by other means of observation or information, discovered these great truths, we should have announced them in so many words. And there it is that the difference lies between a great writer and a poor one; and we may see how an inferior man may fling a chance away. How does my friend of the Times put these propositions? [...] "It has been customary," [...] says he, [...] "of late years for the purveyors of amusing literature to put forth certain opuscules, denominated Christmas books, with the ostensible intention of swelling the tide of exhilaration, or other expansive emotions, incident upon the exodus of the old or the inauguration of the new year." [...] That is something like a sentence; not a word scarcely but's in Latin, and the longest and handsomest out of the whole dictionary. That is proper economy--as you see a buck from Holywell Street put every pinchbeck pin, ring, and chain which he possesses about his shirt, hands, and waistcoat, and then go and cut a dash in the Park, or swagger with his order to the theatre. It costs him no more to wear all his ornaments about his distinguished person than to leave them at home. If you can be a swell at a cheap rate, why not? And I protest, for my part, I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was really about in writing and submitting my little book for sale, until my friend the critic, looking at the article, and examining it with the eyes of a connoisseur, pronounced that what I had fancied simply to be a book was in fact [...] "an opuscule denominated so-and-so, and ostensibly intended to swell the tide of expansive emotion incident upon the inauguration of the new year." [...] I can hardly believe as much even now--so little do we know what we really are after, until men of genius come and interpret.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Dorian Gray, [...] "there {{is nothing}} fearful about it. It {{is one of}} the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or {{faithful}} wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean--middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played--the night you saw her--she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from the proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp, there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realised how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said." ...|$|E

5000|$|In May 1997, {{her boyfriend}} of three years, {{musician}} Jeff Buckley, drowned accidentally in Memphis. She found it [...] "such a traumatic experience of loss. I needed to grieve but I didn't know how." [...] She {{continued to play}} with Those Bastard Souls, a band started in 1995 by {{a close friend of}} the couple, Dave Shouse of the Grifters. They made a record entitled Debt & Departure attempting to respond to Buckley's death. In late 1997, she created a band with the remaining members of Buckley's band called Black Beetle and finished an eponymous album that was never released. This was the first project where she was writing as well as fronting a band. She commented that [...] "I found singing terrifying at first, I didn't know about the boundaries of my voice and <b>I</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> words <b>I</b> wanted to say. The violin had been my voice for so long." ...|$|R

I never suspected that the point was going to stick into the entire nation; but of course you know your nation better than I do, and if you think it punctures them all, I have to yield to your judgment. But you are to blame, your own self. Your remark misled me. I supposed the industry was confined to that little unnumerous upper layer.|$|R

Acknowledgements Many people have contributed to my {{dissertation}} research and to the earlier path that brought me to this point. First, I thank my parents, Matthew and Georgia, for their lifelong support and constant encouragement of my interests in science, the outdoors, and all things herpetological. I also thank my sister, Sara, and extended family for their encouragement. My family's appreciation of education, hard work, and the natural world has strongly influenced my career choices and contributed to my love of biology. I am truly grateful to the research opportunities provided to me by Brad Shaffer and Arthur Shapiro during my undergraduate career. Their mentorship was critical to my development as an academic biologist. In particular, in my first month as an undergraduate researcher in Brad Shaffer's lab, I went from a stressed out senior with <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do after graduating to knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do {{for the rest of}} my life. This is a gift for which I will always be grateful.
