500|$|The first-person {{protagonist of}} Ms. Welch’s song ("Caleb Meyer") {{may be a}} young girl from {{a time and place}} that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the {{feelings}} the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of [...] "the black dust towns of East Tennessee" [...] about which she sings in [...] "Miner's Refrain" [...] because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.|$|E

500|$|Breaking Benjamin's musical {{style is}} {{primarily}} classified as hard rock and alternative rock, more specifically post-grunge and alternative metal, and has commonly been {{noted for its}} consistency. Corey Apar felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin are <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> consistent", and Alex Young felt that [...] "Breaking Benjamin {{is one of the}} few modern rock bands on the radio that, if you have heard any song in its catalog prior, could be immediately recognized." [...] Despite a complete lineup change prior to the release of Dark Before Dawn, Dan Marsicano stated, [...] "Breaking Benjamin hardly deviate from the hooky jams that were present on Dear Agony. They have had an established sound since their breakout We Are Not Alone – hard-edged riffs with emotional upheaval – and that isn't tampered with on Dark Before Dawn." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of Paris permeates La Comédie: nature defers to the artificial metropolis, {{in contrast to}} descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the countryside. [...] "If in Paris", Rogers says, [...] "we are in a man-made region where even the seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting". Balzac said, [...] "the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds." [...] His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. The centrality of Paris in La Comédie Humaine is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. [...] "Realism is <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> urban", notes critic Peter Brooks; {{the scene of a}} young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as Illusions Perdues.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} not without controversy, however. There {{are a number of}} episodes with scenes of one {{teenager}} being beaten by his father. When reviewing those episodes, the Ryerson University of Toronto said the show [...] "stands on its own" [...] in reflecting [...] "the kinds of issues [...] facing in their own lives ... handled with care and consideration, without all the glamour of a Hollywood soap opera." [...] A two-part storyline about date-rape proved too risqué for The N officials, who delayed its broadcasting until suitable edits could be made, and other special treatments were available in the form of panel discussions, online parental guides and separately filmed introductions. The Gazette said, [...] "You've got to hand it to the creative team behind CTV's justly celebrated teen series, Degrassi: The Next Generation. They're <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> a clever bunch", and Brian Orloff of the St. Petersburg Times praised the series as it [...] "stays in touch with teens' lives".|$|E

Veeck wrote that he told Landis, who reacted with shock, and soon moved to block the purchase. In his book, Veeck placed {{some of the blame}} on National League President Ford Frick, but later reserved blame exclusively for Landis, whom he accused of racism, stating in a subsequent interview, [...] "fter all, a man who is named Kenesaw Mountain was not {{born and raised in the}} state of Maine." [...] However, when Veeck was asked for proof of his allegations against Landis, he stated, [...] "I have no proof of that. I can only surmise." [...] According to baseball historian David Jordan, [...] "Veeck, <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> a storyteller, seems to have added these embellishments, sticking in some guys in black hats, simply to juice up his tale." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{also appears}} on the soundtrack of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge! and is sung by the {{characters}} Harold Zidler, played by Jim Broadbent, and The Duke of Monroth, played by Richard Roxburgh. In 2004, The Meat Purveyors covered the song in a bluegrass medley, pairing it with Madonna's [...] "Lucky Star" [...] and [...] "Burning Up." [...] In the 2004 film , the title character teaches the song to women in a Thai prison, after becoming annoyed that they are singing the song badly. She tells them, [...] "Madonna is <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> a perfectionist!" [...] In one of the episodes of the TV show Grey's Anatomy, the character of Cristina Yang hums the song during surgery to take the focus off herself. However, when her assisting surgery, Lexie Grey starts singing along, Christina looks venomously at her until she quiets down. Katy Perry, Travis Barker and DJ AM covered the song at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2009, the song was namechecked in the Train hit single [...] "Hey, Soul Sister" [...] with the lyric [...] "I believe in you/Like a virgin you're Madonna/And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind".|$|E
500|$|According to The Kansas City Star Smith, [...] "Frank hasn’t changed, {{and neither}} has his brand of Machiavellian {{political}} theater" [...] and [...] "Spacey has lost {{none of his}} smarmy magnetism as the cartoon-ish villain". According to Variety Brian Lowry, [...] "Kevin Spacey’s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician" [...] is foremost among the show's strengths, but the show's weakness is the [...] "failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes". Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is, it is unfathomable that [...] "nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him". Goodman says [...] "Spacey is <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> constantly magnetic". The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever. Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that [...] "Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano, Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power, and {{reminds us of the}} fact in his asides to the camera...he may be a ruthless sociopath, but there's something to admire there". [...] However Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2 noting that the season was [...] "...delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before." ...|$|E

500|$|Under the Jennisons, {{the main}} {{priorities}} for Belle Vue were the zoological and botanical gardens; amusements were provided {{merely as a}} distraction. The Jennisons laid out formal gardens in various styles between 1836 and 1898, including mazes, grottoes, an Italian garden, [...] "billiard-table lawns" [...] and constructed Tropical Plant Houses. There were also exotic constructions like the Indian temple and grotto, designed by George Danson, Belle Vue's scenic artist. Built to resemble a ruined temple, it housed snakes and crocodiles as well as flowers. At {{the end of the}} 19th century, [...] "the resort relied almost entirely for its attraction on its delightful gardens", but by 1931 the formalism had entirely disappeared. The gardens were also used to stage large political rallies for a wide spectrum of opinion, such as the Great Liberal Demonstration of 1924, at which Lloyd George addressed a crowd of 50,000, the first political meeting at which loudspeakers were used. The British Union of Fascists, popularly known as the Blackshirts, also held a meeting there, in September 1934. One contemporary commentator observed that [...] "perhaps the Ku Klux Klan will be found in session there one day, for Belle Vue is <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the book's achievement, Shone remarks [...] "He {{now stands}} at year zero – creatively, psychologically." [...] However, typical {{features}} of Ellis' earlier works remain intact; for example, in its depictions of violence. Commenting on its self-referential aspects, Janelle Brown of the San Francisco Chronicle recommends [...] "for his next endeavor, Ellis should stop worrying and start looking for the exit of his own personal rabbit hole." [...] The Buffalo News awarded the novel its Editor's Choice. Jeff Simon comments that it [...] "brings an excessive Reaganesque flavor to Obama America". With regards to the novel's writing style, he comments [...] "The first-person sentences run on and on, but the individual sections of the book are <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> minimal... ghastly narcissism or not, Bret Easton Ellis has a fictional territory all his own and, heaven forbid, a mastery there." [...] The Wall Street Journal on the other hand, described this prose style as [...] "flat and fizzless". Such is the book's violent aesthetic that, for Eileen Battersby of The Irish Times, [...] "the book is closer to his remarkable third novel, American Psycho". She further compliments Ellis as [...] "a bizarrely moral writer who specializes in evoking the amoral." [...] Concerning his writing, she notes its [...] "despair is blunt, factual and seldom approaches the laconic unease of JG Ballard." ...|$|E
500|$|Dance Again... The Hits {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on four reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Sal Cinquenmani of Slant Magazine {{wrote that the}} [...] "most immediately striking thing" [...] about the compilation is [...] "just how many hits [...] has racked up over the years". [...] "So many, in fact, that there's a hefty handful of singles missing from the standard edition of the album", using her number-one single [...] "All I Have" [...] {{as an example of}} this. He stated that Lopez's [...] "output has been <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> on trend", and that Dance Again... The Hits plays not only as a chronicle of her music career, but of [...] "pop music as a whole since just {{before the turn of the}} century", with genres spanning Latin pop, dance, and R. According to Cinquenmani, the album also serves as a [...] "historical record" [...] of who the rappers du jour were [...] "over the last dozen years or so", from Big Pun, Fat Joe, Ja Rule, and Lil Wayne. He concluded by stating that if the compilation [...] "proves anything" [...] it's that Lopez is, [...] "if not the queen, then at least the duchess of reinvention and should never be counted out".|$|E

500|$|... "Angry Dad: The Movie" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with many of}} them praising the [...] "visual gags" [...] featured in the episode. TV Squad writer Brad Trechak praised the episode's use of Hollywood references writing that [...] "that's what good episodes of 'The Simpsons' are made of". He also praised Gervais's performance calling his two monologues [...] "classic". The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser praised the multiple references layered in the episode commenting that they saved the episode from being [...] "mediocre". Despite this, he criticized the plot commenting {{that it did not}} come [...] "from the heart of the show". He ultimately gave the episode a B-, being beaten only by Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Hamburger Dinner Theater". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly mostly praised the short films competing against [...] "Angry Dad" [...] calling them [...] "the truly amusing stuff" [...] and adding that Condiments was a [...] "very accomplished replication of Pixar". However, he was critical of the guest stars, noting that, [...] "None of them were very funny, but that was the joke — they were parodying the toadying tone of awards patter. Well, Brand and Berry were; Gervais seemed to have improvised a lot of Gervais-y stream-of-jokiness blather that he may well have intended to be funny". Aly Semigran of MTV praised the episode for its animation parodies, writing, [...] "Sure, Toy Story and Wallace and Gromit might enjoy more Oscar love than their animated brethren, but The Simpsons send-ups were <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> a brilliant tip-of-the-hat to all of those films".|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Robert Christgau said Meddle {{was a fairly}} good progression over the group's previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies, although he lamented the lyrics to [...] "A Pillow of Winds": [...] "The word 'behold' should never cross their filters again". In his critique of [...] "Echoes", he believed the lyrics imitate [...] "Across the Universe" [...] by the Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a [...] "timeless calm" [...] similar to [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Daryl Easlea of BBC felt it is a similar, but more consistent and tuneful version of Atom Heart Mother highlighted by [...] "Echoes", which he said [...] "dominates the entire work" [...] and is [...] "everything right about progressive rock; engaging, intelligent and compelling". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield said [...] "Echoes" [...] showed Pink Floyd {{to be a more}} developed group than before, [...] "coloring the slow guitar ripples with deep-in-the-studio sonic details that only the truly baked would notice, much less appreciate." [...] Writing for AllMusic, editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called Meddle the best album from their transitional years leading up to The Dark Side of the Moon, as it [...] "spends most of its time with sonic textures and elongated compositions, most notably on its epic closer, 'Echoes'". He noted a [...] "uniform tone", but not song structure, and wrote of the album's significance in the group's catalogue: [...] "Pink Floyd were <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> masters of texture, and Meddle is one of their greatest excursions into little details, pointing the way to the measured brilliance of Dark Side of the Moon and the entire Roger Waters era." ...|$|E
500|$|Kofi Outlaw, Editor-in-Chief at Screenrant.com, gave Man of Steel a 4 out of 5 star review, {{stating that}} [...] "Man of Steel {{has more than}} earned its keep, and deserves to be THE iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation". He {{would go on to}} name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action {{sequences}} and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III, wrote, [...] "The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is <b>nothing</b> <b>if</b> <b>not</b> the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of [...] "The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time" [...] as voted by the magazine's readers.|$|E
