In 1999, Claude Omnibus, the husband of a deceased follower, accused the movement of having killed his wife after her refusal of an organ transplant, and created an association of victims <b>named</b> <b>Association</b> of Victims of the Christian Open Door (Association des Victimes de la Porte Ouverte Chrétienne, AVIPOC).

The COD was considered [...] "a dangerous cult" [...] in a book by two journalists and in many press articles. Activities of the group that are criticized include anti-social speech, family breakdowns, false promises of healing which led to abandonment of medical treatments, theological deviances and financial disclosures. Meanwhile, the COD sought support from French Evangelical Association (Association Évangélique Française AEF) and unsuccessfully tried to integrate the Protestant Federation of France.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a new fast method for {{matching}} stereo images acquired by a stereo sensor embedded in a moving vehicle. The method consists in exploiting the matching results obtained in one stereo pair (frame) for computing the disparity map of the following stereo pair. This {{can be achieved by}} finding a temporal relationship, which we <b>named</b> <b>association,</b> between consecutive frames. The disparity range of the current frame is deduced from the disparity map of the preceding frame and the association between the two frames. Dynamic programming technique is considered for matching the image features. The proposed approach is tested on virtual and real stereo image sequences and the results are satisfactory. The method is fast and able to provide about 20 millions disparity maps per second on a HP Pavilion dv 6700 2. 1 GHZ. I...|$|E

40|$|Background: Several QTLs {{have been}} {{identified}} for major economically relevant traits in livestock, such as growth and meat quality, revealing the complex genetic architecture of these traits. The use of network approaches considering the interactions of multiple molecules and traits provides useful insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits. Here, a network based methodology, <b>named</b> <b>Association</b> Weight Matrix, was applied to study gene interactions and pathways affecting pig conformation, growth and fatness traits. Results: The co-association network analysis underpinned three transcription factors, PPARc, ELF 1, and PRDM 16 involved in mesoderm tissue differentiation. Fifty-four genes in the network belonged to growth-related ontologies and 46 of them were common with a similar study for growth in cattle supporting our results. The functional analysis uncovered the lipid metabolism and the corticotrophin and gonadotrophin release hormone pathways {{among the most important}} pathways influencing these traits.

The use of network approaches considering the interactions of multiple molecules and traits provides useful insights into the molecular underpinnings of complex traits. Here, a network based methodology, <b>named</b> <b>Association</b> Weight Matrix, was applied to study gene interactions and pathways affecting pig conformation, growth and fatness traits. [br/] The co-association network analysis underpinned three transcription factors, PPARγ, ELF 1, and PRDM 16 involved in mesoderm tissue differentiation. Fifty-four genes in the network belonged to growth-related ontologies and 46 of them were common with a similar study for growth in cattle supporting our results. The functional analysis uncovered the lipid metabolism and the corticotrophin and gonadotrophin release hormone pathways {{among the most important}} pathways influencing these traits. Our results suggest that the genes and pathways here identified are important determining either the total body weight of the animal and the fat content. For instance, a switch in the mesoderm tissue differentiation may determinate the age-related preferred pathways being in the puberty stage those related with the miogenic and osteogenic lineages; on the contrary, in the maturity stage cells may be more prone to the adipocyte fate. Hence, our results demonstrate that an integrative genomic co-association analysis is a powerful approach for identifying new connections and interactions among genes. [br/] This work provides insights about pathways and key regulators which may be important determining the animal growth, conformation and body proportions and fatness traits. Molecular information concerning genes and pathways here described may be crucial for the improvement of genetic breeding programs applied to pork meat production...|$|E

40|$|This PHD thesis {{deals with}} the {{evolutionary}} algorithms for mining frequent patterns and discovering useful and interesting Boolean association rules from large data sets. Initially, the classical algorithms for mining frequent patterns and single and multi- objective evolutionary algorithms for discovering association rules using different measures are studied. Secondly, the problem of extracting frequent patterns using classical algorithms and obtaining a set of high quality association rules relying on the evolutionary algorithms are addressed. The objectives of this thesis are as follows: 1. Designing evolutionary algorithms for extracting frequent patterns from large data sets. 2. Designing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for discovering a reduced set of high quality Boolean association rules from categorical data sets. 3. Improving the single seed based genetic algorithm by designing a multiple seeds based genetic algorithm for mining Boolean association rules. To accomplish these objectives, this research evolved different evolutionary algorithms for mining frequent patterns efficiently, and obtaining high quality Boolean association rules (BARs). Firstly, the method named GeneticMax, a new approach based on a genetic algorithm, is used to mine maximal frequent item sets by accessing a large data set for fewer number of nodes. This method is improved by another approach named Hybrid GeneticMax. This new model which outperforms the GeneticMax algorithm if there are {{a reasonable amount of}} infrequent items in 1 - item sets. This proposal shows the power of using an evolutionary algorithm along with a local search mechanism for generating maximal frequent item sets from a lexicographic tree. On the other hand, this research proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) based approach, a new heuristic algorithm for mining association rules for both frequent and infrequent items. This approach can mine rules for more than three items. Secondly, a new multi-objective evolutionary model <b>named</b> <b>Association</b> Rules Mining with Genetic Algorithm Using an Adaptive Mutation Method (ARMGAAM), which is very useful for mining reduced sets of Boolean association rules from categorical data sets. Another method named Mining Boolean Association Rules with Evolutionary Algorithm (MBAREA), a new evolutionary model which extends the existing Association Rule Mining with Genetic Algorithm (ARMGA) and Multi-objective Association Rule Mining with Genetic Algorithm (ARMMGA), maximizes two objectives; performance and interestingness. The former method uses a re-initialization technique along with an adaptive mutation method whereas the latter uses a class based mutation method along with a best population technique. Both methods discover a reduced set of BARs from different data sets with a good trade-off among the number of generated rules and different measures. Finally, MSGA, a new genetic algorithm based on multiple seeds for producing an effective initial population, has a higher search efficiency along with good convergence speed, prevents the limitation of selecting an effective single seed for generating an initial population for mining BARs. Of particular note, the selection of above mentioned evolutionary algorithms depends on the specific needs of users...|$|E
