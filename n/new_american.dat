40|$|The Baltimore <b>News</b> <b>American</b> Collection {{consists}} of materials that document {{the long history}} of the <b>News</b> <b>American</b> and its predecessors. The <b>News</b> <b>American</b> traced its lineage back to Baltimore's first newspaper, the Maryland Journal and the Baltimore Advertiser, which was started by William Goddard on August 20, 1773. However, historically, the connection between the two newspapers is ambiguous. Instead, the likely origins of the <b>News</b> <b>American</b> date to May 14, 1799, when Alexander Martin launched the American and Daily Advertiser. The collection dates from 1773 - 2006 with the bulk of material dating 1930 - 1973. It includes many different types of materials, such as newspaper clippings, library files, correspondence, scrapbooks, unpublished and published manuscripts and employee newsletters. Prominent individuals documented in the collection include H. L. Mencken, Frank A. Munsey, R. P. Hariss, William Randolph Hearst, Sr., William Randolph, Hearst, Jr. and John Steadman.

5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969.

5|$|Despite being rapidly surpassed by <b>new</b> <b>American</b> dreadnoughts, New Hampshire had {{an active}} career.

New Hampshire was particularly active in the Caribbean during this period, as several countries, including Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico devolved into internal political conflicts. These actions included the United States occupation of Veracruz, during which the ship's commander was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the <b>New</b> <b>American</b> Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
