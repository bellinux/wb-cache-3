40|$|Background/Context: The {{prevailing}} {{theory of}} action underlying <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind’s</b> high-stakes testing and accountability ratings is that schools and students held accountable to these measures will automatically increase educational output as educators try harder, schools will adopt more effective methods, and students will learn more. In Texas, {{the centerpiece of}} high school accountability is the pressure to improve exit test scores, a battery of minimum competency exams that students have to pass {{to graduate from high}} school.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} impact of several public {{policies}} on civic participation. Using a unique combination of school administrative and public–use voter files and methods for causal inference, I evaluate {{the impact of}} three new, as of yet unexplored, policies: one informational, one institutional, and one skill–based. Chapter 2 examines the causal effect of <b>No</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Left</b> <b>Behind’s</b> performance-based accountability school failure signals on turnout in school board elections and on individuals’ use of exit. I find that failure signals mobilize citizens both {{at the ballot box}} and by encouraging them to vote with their feet. However, these increases in voice and exit come primarily from citizens who already active—thus exacerbating inequalities in both forms of participation. Chapter 3 examines the causal effect of preregistration—an electoral reform that allows young citizens to enroll in the electoral system before turning 18, while also providing them with various in-school supports. Using data from the Current Population Survey and Florida Voter Files and multiple methods for causal inference, I (with my coauthor listed below) show that preregistration mobilizes and does so for a diverse set of citizens. Finally, Chapter 4 examines the impact of psychosocial or so called non-cognitive skills on voter turnout. Using information from the Fast Track intervention, I show that early– childhood investments in psychosocial skills have large, long-run spillovers on civic participation. These gains are widely distributed, being especially large for those least likely to participate. These chapters provide clear insights that reach across disciplinary boundaries and speak to current policy debates. In placing specific attention not only on whether these programs mobilize, but also on who they mobilize, I provide scholars and practitioners with new ways of thinking about how to address stubbornly low and unequal rates of citizen engagement.

Analysis was conducted on the archived data from 1311 current and former Spanish-speaking ELLs, including students who qualify for Special Education (SpEd) and Talented and Gifted (TAG) programs. One-way chi-square analysis, contingency table analysis, relative frequency histograms, z-tests and t-tests were used to test hypotheses regarding statistically significant differences in TAG and SpEd identification rates and differences in acquisition timelines based on TAG or SpED classification, as well as instructional program model (bilingual versus English immersion). Results determined that Spanish-speaking ELLs were underidentified for TAG programs, despite extensive bilingual resources and staffing. Results further determine that ELLs as a whole require a mean 7. 13 years to reach proficiency. Average ELLs without exceptionalities require 7. 354 compared with 8. 933 years for ELLs with disabilities (ELL-Ds), while TAG ELLs require 5. 423 years, all longer than allowed by NCLB (five years) to reach proficiency. Significant differences were found in acquisition rates among TAG ELLs, ELL-Ds and average ELLs without exceptionalities. Analysis of timelines for ELLs in bilingual versus English immersion programs for ELLs as a whole, average ELLs and ELL-Ds with specific learning disabilities also found statistically significant differences, favoring bilingual programs.

40|$|Each year brings administrators greater {{challenges}} {{in meeting the}} needs of students with serious mental health problems. There are three main trends that have caused this. The first is the reduced availability of out-of-home placements for mentally ill children. At one time, these young people were deemed either too ill or too unpredictable to get along in the real world of general classrooms and were maintained in residential settings in their own states or elsewhere. Or else, if students had disruptive behavior disorders, they could be excluded from school altogether, as these were not considered to be true mental health problems and such youths were rarely considered for special education.

However, a more alarming statistic shows a decrease in U.

40|$|The {{premise of}} the Children in North America Project lies {{in the kind of}} world we live in today, an {{increasingly}} interdependent, complex, and connected world. It is a small world where school children living in a desert state or a prairie province know all about a tsunami because of images of wreckage from a giant wave half a world away. As the globe shrinks, so too does North America. The continent that is shared by three nations, each with its own proud history, is becoming more economically, socially, and culturally integrated- through trade, investment, communications, human migration, education, travel, and cultural exchange. Children in the three nations are increasingly being exposed to similar consumer goods, media messages, and social trends. Moreover, for some children, increased economic ties imply drastic changes to their immediate surroundings and prospects - whether it is a child living in an American family without work because the local employer moved its operations to Mexico or a child living without a father in a Mexican town because many working-age men have left to seek jobs in the United States or Canada. The sheer scale of migration from Mexico to the United States and, to a lesser extent, to Canada is changing the face of the region and the lives of countless children. The Mexican-born population in the United States more than doubled between 1990 and 2000, going to over 9 million people, according to U. S. Census data. Remittances from Mexicans working in the United States to families back home amounted to over 16 billion U. S. dollars in 2004 (as estimated by the Central Bank of Mexico), roughly 1. 5 percent of the country's GDP. Added together, the sums that migrants send back home surpass Mexico's revenues from tourism, foreign aid, and foreign direct investment. The Children in North America Project is exploring these new realities. It is building a new knowledge base about children across the continent. That knowledge base includes measures of child well-being and the local, national, and tri-national contexts or environments in which families live. These data tell the story of a diverse population of children characterized by profound differences in their well-being and security both within countries and across the region. Through this project, we hope to build {{a better understanding of how}} our children are faring and the opportunities and challenges that they face looking to the future. Our goal is to inspire and mobilize action to make the lives of all children in North America better, to ensure that <b>no</b> <b>child</b> is <b>left</b> <b>behind...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT INTERVENTION FOR THE WHOLE CHILD: A TEACHER???S GUIDE TO DOCUMENTATION by ?? Teresa Lynn Tindill 2009 Master of Arts in Education Reading/Language Arts Option California State University, Chico Spring 2009 A reading {{teacher in}} the primary grades has one goal: to have every child reading fluently, with good comprehension, {{by the end of}} third grade. However, as a reading teacher, it appears that more {{students}} are tested at my school site every year for a reading disability. When students have lesser reading abilities, it makes it difficult to achieve this higher-level reading goal for all children. The Chico Unified School District has begun using Response to Intervention procedures to identify and serve all children who are below standards. Teachers were asked to use scientifically based interventions with these students. This project includes a review of relevant literature in the area of Response to Intervention and scientific, research-based evidence and provides a handbook for ix primary-grade classroom teachers to use in meeting the needs of children with special needs in the regular classroom setting. This handbook focuses on specific information which will guide a team of school personnel to adequately focus on the interventions provided to a student, to determine the success or lack of success of intervention offered to the student, review steps taken to ensure future success for the student, and/or refer this student for special education services if needed. As professionals, teachers who use this handbook will be able to successfully document their work in order to follow the appropriate legal procedures in ensuring that <b>no</b> <b>child</b> is <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> The information provided in this handbook has focused on scientific, research-based evidence in order to provide the most powerful interventions for children. If the use of the intervention suggests referral for special services, blackline masters of specific information needed to refer a child for these services are included. The handbook includes: information explaining scientific research-based intervention, characteristics of effective intervention, key aspects to developing and maintaining an effective intervention system, helpful suggestions of how to keep records of student information, how to set up a successful intervention, and a sample case-study. This handbook was reviewed by a group of educational experts at Emma Wilson Elementary School in Chico, California. The group of educational experts consisted of two primary teachers, two intermediate teachers, one school psychologist, one reading specialist and the school principal. This group was asked to read the handbook and provide feedback as to the effectiveness, in their judgment, of the handbook towards meeting the needs of their students.
