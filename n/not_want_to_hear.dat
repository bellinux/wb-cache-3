25|$|Another part of {{restructuring}} the movement comes from education; bell hooks {{points out that}} there is an anti-intellectual stigma among the masses. Poor people do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from intellectuals because they are different and have different ideas. As bell hooks points out though, this stigma against intellectuals leads to poor people who have risen up to become graduates of post secondary education, to be shunned because they are no longer {{like the rest of the}} masses. In order for us to achieve equality, people must be able to learn from those who have been able to smash these stereotypes. This separation leads to further inequality and in order for the feminist movement to succeed, they must be able to bridge the education gap and relate to those in the lower end of the economic sphere. If they are able to do this, then there will be more success and less inequality.|$|E

500|$|The album sold {{a million}} copies in the United States, and five million worldwide. Taraborrelli felt that at that moment, riding on Madonna's coattails proved {{profitable}} for everyone involved, including Warner Bros. Records, which notched up big sales with a compilation soundtrack album that was basically a showcase for its marginal artists. But still they wanted to [...] "milk-in" [...] the success of Madonna, a view shared by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, executive producers of the film. Hence they felt a worldwide concert tour was the appropriate thing to do, since it would promote both the soundtrack and the film, as well as Madonna's successful third studio album True Blue, released the year before. As Madonna's first world tour, Who's That Girl ended up being a resounding success, although by its end, Madonna declared that she did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> any of her songs again {{and she did not}} know whether she would ever write another one. [...] "I returned feeling so burned out and I was convinced that I wouldn't go near music for quite a while", she said.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're {{not going to have any}} excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

2500|$|Baseball Prospectus, as well {{as other}} sabermetric analysts, are criticized for taking the human aspect out of the game of {{baseball}}. For example, Murray Chass of The New York Times wrote in an article that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> or read about new-age baseball statistics any more (referencing Value over replacement player specifically), saying: [...] "I suppose that if stats mongers want to sit at their computers and play with these things all day long, that's their prerogative. But their attempt to introduce these new-age statistics into the game threatens to undermine most fans' enjoyment of baseball and the human factor therein. People play baseball.

2500|$|He {{has been}} doing {{research}} into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found {{what he called a}} [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] conspiracy because believers did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but {{they did not want to}} lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind.|$|E

2500|$|For his own part, Zhirinovsky {{has done}} a great deal to foster a {{reputation}} as a loud and boisterous populist who speaks on behalf of the Russian nation and people, even when the things he says are precisely what many people, at home or abroad, do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Zhirinovsky infamously promised voters in 1991 that if he were elected, free vodka would be distributed to all. Similarly, he once remarked, during a political rally inside a Moscow department store, that if he were made president, underwear would be freely available. Zhirinovsky has on several occasions become involved in altercations with other politicians and debate opponents. As a candidate, he also took part in the 2000 and 2008 presidential elections, promising a [...] "police state", and to institute summary executions. A BBC documentary from 1995 showed Zhirinovsky telling the crowd at a campaign rally: [...] "Help us, and you'll never have to vote again! I'm not saying, [...] "Vote for us and maybe in 20 years' time somebody will do something". No, these will be the last elections! The last ones!". Some commentators call Zhirinovsky a fascist or a neo-fascist.|$|E
2500|$|Some saw {{the case}} as a vindication of the UK's strict libel laws. Others noted that Justice Gray [...] "indicated {{that he did not}} 'regard it as being a part' of his {{function}} 'as the trial judge to make findings of fact as to what did and what did not occur during the Nazi regime in Germany', but he then spent hundreds of pages arguing about his position on such issues," [...] claiming that it was the overly-strict libel laws that forced a judge to determine historical fact. A minority of reporters who covered the case were either sympathetic to Irving (for his general career, not for his denial) or non-fans of Lipstadt (one reporter called her boring and said people would <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> from her when the trial was concluded); in his book on the trial, Richard C. Evans noted that some articles assumed that Lipstadt was suing Irving even though the plaintiff's name appears first in the court filing and they could have figured this out, and also that Lipstadt was accused of [...] "trying to silence" [...] Irving by launching a defense against Irving's own lawsuit (a lawsuit that would have ended in Lipstadt being silenced in the UK by having her book removed from circulation if Irving had won the case).|$|E
2500|$|After Amber {{failed to}} {{break-up}} with Josh, Daniel {{tried to keep}} his distance from her. However, Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) had already noticed their growing closeness, so she kissed Daniel to prompt a reaction and work out what was truly going on with them. Amber was [...] "gutted" [...] when she witnessed the kiss and it caused her to give into her feelings for Daniel and they kissed. Daniel was left feeling guilty about Josh and Phillipps commented [...] "He {{wants to be with}} Amber, but it's not in his nature to just walk all over people." [...] Phillipps liked that Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle as it was [...] "quite relatable" [...] for everyone. He thought the reaction to it had been mixed, but there had been support for Amber and Daniel. A few weeks later, Josh walked in on Amber and Daniel kissing. Bonner told an Inside Soap reporter that Josh was devastated by the scene and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Amber's apology. Josh eventually went to the penthouse to speak with Daniel and came close to hitting him. He then smashed up Amber and Daniel's darkroom, knowing that is where they had spent a lot of their time together. Phillipps confirmed that Amber and Daniel would stay together despite the fallout and that they would grow closer because of it. The couple were given the portmanteau Damber by fans and critics.|$|E

40|$|Torture {{narratives}} and {{the burden of}} giving evidence in the Dutch asylum procedure Janus Oomen Asylum requests by victimsof torturewhohave£ed to the Netherlands are often rejected. In these cases, the torture stories of the asylum seekers have failed to convince o⁄cials judging their asylum request. The author studied the cases of asylum seekers whose claims were ¢rst rejected, but then supported by Amnesty International, and eventually, after a court appeal, received residency. The author, therefore, concludes that the initial rejections {{are the result of}} the manner in which these asylum seekers were interrogated by civil servants of the immigration authority. These civil servants appear <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the details of torture, and their attitude colludes with a tendency in the asylum seekers to avoid discussing painful experiences...|$|R

Two weeks later, in May 1968, Lennon suggested Cynthia take a holiday in Greece with Mardas, Donovan, and two friends, as he would be very busy recording songs for what would become The White Album. She arrived back at Kenwood from Greece earlier than expected, at 4 o'clock on 22 May 1968, to discover Lennon and Ono sitting cross-legged on the floor in matching white robes, staring into each other's eyes, and then found Ono's slippers outside the Lennons' bedroom door. Shocked, she asked Jenny Boyd and Mardas if she could spend the night at their apartment. At the apartment Boyd went straight to bed, but she and Mardas drank more alcohol, with Mardas trying to convince her to run away together. After she had vomited in the bathroom, she collapsed on a bed in the spare bedroom, with Mardas joining her and trying to kiss her until she pushed him away.|$|R
