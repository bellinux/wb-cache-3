5|$|In 1989 {{a project}} {{commenced}} to re-introduce the country's rarest amphibian, the <b>natterjack</b> toad, to Hengistbury Head. The <b>natterjack</b> was last recorded on the headland in the 1950s before its extinction, probably {{as the result}} of a lack of suitable ponds. The project has been a great success, and today there are thriving populations at various locations. The ideal time to witness their mating rituals is in May as dusk approaches, when the distinctive call of the <b>natterjack</b> can be heard for miles around.|$|E
5|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare <b>natterjack</b> toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the common frog, common toad and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.|$|E
5|$|Matsalu National Park is a {{home for}} a number of {{endangered}} species, many of which are listed in the Estonian IUCN Red List, including the white-tailed eagle of the highest conservation category, a lot of bird species of the second and third protection categories, 22 strongly protected plant species, the <b>natterjack</b> toad, and ten species of mammals of the second conservation category.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Natterjacks</b> have a {{very loud}} and {{distinctive}} mating call amplified by the single vocal sac found under the chin of the male, so their name literally means the chattering toad - the jack (or toad) that natters [...] (or chatters).|$|R
50|$|<b>Natterjacks</b> {{live for}} up to 15 years and feed mainly on insects, {{especially}} beetles. At night they move around open terrain with sparse vegetation, and in loose sand their tracks can often be seen. They move considerable distances each night, enabling the species to colonize new habitats very quickly.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of environmentally-induced changes in phenotype or reaction norm implies both the existence {{at some time}} of genetic variation within a population for that plasticity measured {{by the presence of}} genotype x environment interaction (G x E), and that phenotypic variation affects fitness. Otherwise, the genetic structure of polygenic traits may restrict the {{evolution of}} the reaction norm by the lack of independent evolution of a given trait in different environments or by genetic trade-offs with other traits that affect fitness. In this paper, we analyze the existence of G x E in metamorphic traits to two environmental factors, larval density and pond duration in a factorial experiment with Bufo calamita tadpoles in semi-natural conditions and in the laboratory. Results showed no plastic temporal response in metamorphosis to pond durability at low larval density. The rank of genotypes did not change across different hydroperiods, implying a high genetic correlation that may constrain the evolution of the reaction norm. At high larval density a significant G x E interaction was found, suggesting the potential for the evolution of the reaction norm. A sibship (1) attained the presumed 'optimal' reaction norm by accelerating developmental rate in short duration ponds and delaying it in longer ponds. This could be translated in fitness by an increment in metamorphic survival and size at metamorphosis in short and long ponds respectively with respect to non-plastic sibships. However, genetic variability for plasticity suggests that optimal reaction norm for developmental rates may be variable and hard to achieve in the heterogeneous pond environment. Mass at metamorphosis was not plastic across different pond durations but decreased at high larval density. Significant adaptive plasticity for growth rates appeared in environments that differed drastically in level of crowding conditions, both in the field and in the laboratory. The fact that survival of juveniles metamorphosed at high density ponds was a monotonic function of metamorphic size, implies that response to selection may occur in this population of <b>natterjacks</b> and that genetic variability in plasticity may be a reliable mechanism maintaining adaptive genetic variation in growth rates in the highly variable pond environment.

5|$|Habitats {{within the}} SSSI include reed beds, salt marshes, {{freshwater}} lagoons and sand or shingle beaches. The wetlands {{are important for}} wildlife, including some scarce breeding birds such as pied avocets, western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The location also attracts migrating birds including vagrant rarities. Ducks and geese winter along this coast in considerable numbers, and several nature reserves provide suitable conditions for water voles, <b>natterjack</b> toads and several scarce plants and invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species with}} which the common toad could be {{confused}} include the <b>natterjack</b> toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals {{can be seen at}} the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The common frog, common toad and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare <b>natterjack</b> toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.|$|E

25|$|The {{intertidal}} {{system of}} the estuary of the River Humber has local seagrass beds that provide feeding and wintering areas for over 133,000 waders and wildfowl. It is rich in invertebrate communities. The estuary also provides for breeding birds, grey seals and <b>natterjack</b> toads.|$|E
25|$|In November 2007 the Dew pond was {{reinstated}} {{on the top}} common by Sheringham Town Council. Many {{years ago}} there were shallow ponds on {{this part of the}} common and in 1939 <b>natterjack</b> toads were recorded in and around the ponds along with common and great crested newts. The reinstatement is an attempt to attract more wildlife back to this part of the common. Until the Second World War, goats, ponies and geese were a common sight grazing in and around the ponds.|$|E
25|$|Blackheath's {{heathland}} habitat {{was well}} known to early botanists – in the 18th century Carl Linnaeus {{is reported to have}} fallen to his knees to thank God when he first saw the gorse growing there (but this disputed account is more often attributed to Putney Heath). This environment supported both the flora and fauna of wild grassland. In 1859, Greenwich Natural History Society recorded a wide list of animal species, including <b>natterjack</b> toads, hares, common lizards, bats, quail, ring ouzel and nightingale. Today, bats are still found on Blackheath and migrating ring ouzel may occasionally be seen in spring.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{sand dunes}} stretch for several miles between Birkdale and Woodvale {{to the south}} of the town. The Ainsdale sand dunes have been {{designated}} as a national nature reserve and a Ramsar site. Local fauna include the <b>Natterjack</b> toad and the Sand lizard. The town contains examples of Victorian architecture and town planning, on Lord Street and elsewhere. A particular feature of the town is the extensive tree planting. This was one of the conditions required by the Hesketh family when they made land available for development in the 19th century. Hesketh Park at the northern end of the town is named after them, having been built on land donated by Rev. Charles Hesketh.|$|E
500|$|The SSSI is {{designated}} as a Special Protection Area for birds because its variety of coastal habitats give it year-round importance {{for a number of}} species. The breeding colonies of Sandwich terns and little terns, especially those at Blakeney and Scolt Head Island, are of [...] European importance, and the coast is of national significance for common terns, pied avocets and reed bed specialists like western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The SSSI also holds large numbers of wintering ducks and geese, the endangered water vole, and scarce species like <b>natterjack</b> toad, starlet sea anemone, lesser centaury, sea barley and bee orchid.|$|E
500|$|A study {{published}} in 2012 examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Eurasian and North African species in the Bufobufo group and indicated a long evolutionary history for the group. [...] Nine to thirteen million years ago, Bufoeichwaldi, a recently described species from south Azerbaijan and Iran, split from the main lineage. Further divisions occurred with Bufospinosus splitting off about five million {{years ago when the}} Pyrenees were being uplifted, an event which isolated the populations in the Iberian Peninsula from those in the rest of Europe. The remaining European lineage split into Bufobufo and Bufoverrucosissimus less than three million years ago during the Pleistocene. Very occasionally the common toad hybridizes with the <b>natterjack</b> toad (Bufo calamita) or the European green toad (Bufo viridis).|$|E
2500|$|How can {{understanding}} of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? [...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, <b>natterjack</b> toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E
60|$|But I {{have only}} time {{to point out}} to you a few curious facts with regard to reptiles, which should be {{specially}} interesting to a Hampshire bio- geologist. You know, of course, that in Ireland there are no reptiles, save the little common lizard, Lacerta agilis, and a few frogs on the mountain-tops--how they got there I cannot conceive. And you will, of course, guess, and rightly, that the reason of the absence of reptiles is: that Ireland was parted off from England before the creatures, which certainly spread from southern and warmer climates, had time to get there. You know, of course, that we have a few reptiles in England. But you may not be aware that, as soon as you cross the Channel, you find many more species of reptiles than here, as well as those which you find here. The magnificent green lizard which rattles about like a rabbit in a French forest, is never found here; simply because it had not worked northward till after the Channel was formed. But there are three reptiles peculiar to this part of England which should be most interesting to a Hampshire zoologist. The one is the sand lizard (L. stirpium), found on Bourne-heath, and, I suspect, in the South Hampshire moors likewise--a North European and French species. Another, the Coronella laevis, a harmless French and Austrian snake, which has been found about me, in North Hants and South Berks, now about fifteen or twenty times. I have had three specimens from my own parish. I believe it not to be uncommon; and most probably to be found, by those who will look, both in the New Forest and Woolmer. The third is the <b>Natterjack,</b> or running toad (Bufo Rubeta), a most beautifully spotted animal, with a yellow stripe down his back, which is common with me at Eversley, and common also in many moorlands of Hants and Surrey; and, according to Fleming, on heaths near London, and as far north-east as Lincolnshire; in which case it will belong to the Germanic fauna. Now, here again we have cases of animals which have just been able to get hither before the severance of England and France; and which, not being reinforced from the rear, have been forced to stop, in small and probably decreasing colonies, on the spots nearest the coast which were fit for them.|$|E
