5000|$|The {{court held}} that the defendants' status as [...] "commercial actors" [...] did not deny them the protections of the CDA. The court began its {{discussion}} of this issue with a reminder that, although CDA immunity is most often used to preempt defamation claims, it has also been applied to a variety of other causes of action including housing anti-discrimination laws and <b>negligent</b> <b>publication</b> of advertisements. In the court's view, the title or wording of the cause of action is not dispositive of whether a defendant is acting as a [...] "publisher or speaker." [...] Rather, CDA § 230(c)(1) precludes liability where [...] "the duty that the plaintiff alleges the defendant violated derives from the defendant's status or conduct as a 'publisher or speaker.'" ...|$|E

The main objective of these codes {{is to improve the}} Corporate Governance of firms by providing recommendations for companies. One of the frequent recommendations is to create an audit committee within the company, with a view to guaranteeing the independence of the auditors, as well as the integrity and reliability of accounting information. Among other reasons, the lack of the auditors' independence, managers' <b>negligent</b> behaviour, the <b>publication</b> of fraudulent financial information, the loss of the shareholders' confidence in this information, as well as the lack of adequate internal control systems, has given rise to the establishment of audit committees in the countries of the Anglo-Saxon environment. The objective {{of this article is to}} emphasise the role that audit committees play in companies and how this results in better quality information and fraud avoidance. Althoug,n theory, audit committees are conceived as effective, some empirical studies seem to suggest that this effectiveness is not really found in practice. In this way, the study of previous literature allows us to analyse to what extent the effectiveness of audit committees can be questioned...|$|R
