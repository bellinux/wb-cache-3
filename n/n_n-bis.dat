40|$|Problem statement: How the {{thickness}} of the tris (8 -hydroxyquinolinato) Aluminum (Alq 3) effect the optical and electrical properties of organic light emitting diode. Approach: The optimum thickness, photoluminescence and current-voltage characteristic of Alq 3 layer on <b>N,</b> <b>N-bis</b> (inaphthyl) - N,N-diphenyl- 1, 1 -biphenyl- 4, 4 -diamine (55 nm) layer in Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLED) structure are reported. Alq 3 and NPB organic layers are used as Electron Transport Layer (ETL) and as Hole Transport Layer (HTL) in Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLED). The thin layers of the NPB and Alq 3 were prepared by thermal evaporation method. Results: The Alq 3 layer was evaporated on the NPB layer for thickness ranging from 16 to 134 nm and photoluminescence and I-V characteristic were studied using fiber optics spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics- USB 2000 FLG) and current-voltage source (Keithley, model 2400). Conclusion: It was found that the Alq 3 with 84 nm thicknesses gives the highest photoluminescence peak at 520 nm wavelengths, as well as the lowest turn on voltage of the device. The optical reflectance spectra for every sample were also reported...|$|E
40|$|<b>N,</b> <b>N-Bis</b> (2 -hydroxypropyl) aniline (BHPA) {{reacts with}} nitrite ion in an acidic medium {{to form a}} red product, which has the maximum {{absorption}} at 500 nm. On {{the basis of this}} color reaction, FIA of nitrate was established. Nitrate ion could be reduced to nitrite ion by passing through the reduction column(2 mm× 30 cm) packed with copperized cadmium {Cu(Cd) : particle size, about 0. 5 mm}, which was installed just behind the sample injection valve. The carrier solution(10 (- 3) M EDTA, pH 8) and the reagent solution (8 × 10 (- 4) M BHPA, 0. 35 M HCl, 0. 15 M H(3) PO(4)) were propelled at the flow rate of 0. 7 ml/min by using a double-plunger pump. The sample(120 μl) was injected into the carrier stream by using a 6 -way injection valve. The reaction coil(0. 5 mm× 2 m) was kept in a thermostatically controlled water bath(80 ℃). The cooling coil(0. 5 mm× 50 cm), which was installed just behind the reaction coil, was kept in a water bath (tap water temperature). A calibration curve was linear up to 2 × 10 (- 4) M nitrate. The detection limit corresponding to S/N= 2 was 10 (- 6) M nitrate, and the relative standard deviation (10 injections) was 0. 4 %, and the sampling rate was 40 samples per hour. Nitrate in river water at concentrations of 10 (- 5) M level was determined...|$|E
40|$|A Coordination {{chemistry}} based {{historical perspective}} of contrast agents which are utilised in various imaging modalities, {{forms the basis}} of Chapter 1. Chapter 1 also highlights the various latest advancements and the challenges confronted therein. Chapter 1 culminates in highlighting the need for dual purpose contrast agents. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 deals with rx) lyarnino poly carboxylate derivatives based on EDTA and DTPA respectively. Chapter 2 sheds light upon Teslascan and other related manganese based potential contrast agents. It also highlights the emergence of Mn (II) as the direct competitor for Gd (HI) {{in the face of}} Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) reported for Gd based contrast agents. The chapter culminates in describing the synthesis of a library of EDTA bisamides, including four new EDTA bisamides. Chapter 3 in turn takes a detailed look at a series of DTPA analogues and DTPA bisamides synthesized by scientists all over the world. It also highlights the various synthetic methodologies undertaken by the able scientists. The chapter culminates in describing four new multidentate ligands synthesized in this project, namely two new DTPA analogues and two new DTPA Bisamides. It has been shown that the synthetic methodology utilised to synthesize symmetric naphtha derivative L 5 is fairly unique. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 report the investigations carried out on these new multidentate ligands in terms of relaxometry, potentiometry and luminescence. Interesting results were obtained from relaxometric and luminescence measurements. For instance, symmetric naphtha derivative, reported a relaxivity of 8. 8 mM'V 1, relaxivity obtained for Mn (II) complex of EDTA bisamide of 4 -aniinomethylpyridine is also highly commendable. Investigations on the optical properties of the multidentate ligands require a separate chapter. Thus it is has been allotted Chapter 5. DTPA bisamide of <b>N,</b> <b>N-Bis</b> (tert- butoxycarrx) nyl) memyl- 2 -bromcmylamine was found to quench the fluorescence upon binding with Cu (II), indicating its application as luminescent sensor for Cu (II) ...|$|E
