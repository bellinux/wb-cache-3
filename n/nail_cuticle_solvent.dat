40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{pathogenesis}} {{of bleeding}} associated with thrombolytic therapy remains largely unknown, although spontaneous bleeding appears to correlate with bleeding time prolongation. Here, the comparative effects on cuticle bleeding times (CBT) and ear puncture bleeding times (EBT) of recombinant staphylokinase (Sak) and alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, rt-PA) at equivalent doses, alone and {{in combination with}} aspirin and heparin, were studied in rabbits. METHODS AND RESULTS: Groups of 4 to 9 rabbits were allocated {{to one of the}} 8 following intravenous infusions: saline; aspirin 15 mg/kg and heparin - 100 IU/kg bolus and 10 IU/kg infusion over one hour; 1. 5 mg/kg rt-PA; 1. 5 mg/kg rt-PA plus aspirin and heparin; 4. 5 mg/kg rt-PA; 0. 5 mg/kg Sak; 0. 5 mg/kg Sak plus aspirin and heparin and 1. 5 mg/kg Sak. Bleeding times were determined 30 and 15 min before and 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after the administration over one min of saline, rt-PA or Sak, by simultaneously severing a <b>nail</b> <b>cuticle</b> (CBT) and by puncturing the ear (EBT). Bleeding times were unaffected by saline and by both doses of Sak in monotherapy. Heparin-aspirin and low dose rt-PA significantly lengthened EBT but not CBT. Both CBT and EBT were significantly prolonged (to a mean of > 4 times pretreatment at 5 min) after high-dose rt-PA and after the combined administration of heparin and aspirin with either Sak or tr-PA. rt-PA provoked significantly longer bleeding than Sak in the CBT (p = 0. 001; mean estimated difference = 23 min), but not in the EBT. rt-PA but not Sak degraded plasma fibrinogen dose-dependently. CBT correlated inversely with fibrinogen (r= - 0. 66, p= 0. 001) but EBT did not. CONCLUSION: At equivalent doses Sak displays a significantly higher fibrin specificity and prolongs bleeding time less than rt-PA, particularly in the <b>nail</b> <b>cuticle</b> bleeding time model in which larger vessels are injured that require fibrinogen for hemostasis. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|A {{herpetic}} whitlow is a lesion (whitlow) on {{a finger}} or thumb {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. It is a painful infection that typically affects the fingers or thumbs. Occasionally infection occurs on the toes or on the <b>nail</b> <b>cuticle.</b> Herpes whitlow {{can be caused by}} infection by HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-1 whitlow is often contracted by health care workers that come in contact with the virus; it is most commonly contracted by dental workers and medical workers exposed to oral secretions. It is also often observed in thumb-sucking children with primary HSV-1 oral infection (autoinoculation) prior to seroconversion, and in adults aged 20 to 30 following contact with HSV-2-infected genitals. Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include swelling, reddening and tenderness of the skin of infected finger. This may be accompanied by fever and swollen lymph nodes. Small, clear vesicles initially form individually, then merge and become cloudy. Associated pain often seems large relative to the physical symptoms. The herpes whitlow lesion usually heals in two to three weeks. It may reside in axillary sensory ganglia to cause recurrent herpetic lesions on that arm or digits.|$|R
25|$|Nail growth record {{can show}} the history of recent health and {{physiological}} imbalances, and {{has been used as}} a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep transverse grooves known as Beau's lines may form across the nails (not along the <b>nail</b> from <b>cuticle</b> to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury.|$|R

5000|$|Tablets by mouth {{are often}} {{prescribed}} {{for the treatment}} of onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection, typically by a dermatophyte or Candida species. Fungal nail infections are located deep under the <b>nail</b> in the <b>cuticle</b> to which topically applied treatments are unable to penetrate in sufficient amounts. The tablets may, rarely, cause hepatotoxicity, so patients are warned of this and may be monitored with liver function tests. Alternatives to by mouth administration have been studied.|$|R
50|$|Cutex {{produced}} the first nail tints in 1914. In 1917, using a “paint” derived from automobile paint finish, Cutex introduced a liquid nail polish. Prior to this time nail polish {{in the form}} of paste, cake or powder hadn’t change much from ancient times. By 1925, due to the example of Cutex, liquid was virtually the only type of nail polish. By 1928, Cutex introduced an acetone based nail polish remover, safe for home use, removing the last obstacle to mass adoption of nail polish. Its remover was sold in tandem with its newest liquid polishes. Then in 1934, Cutex released a new remover formulation called “Cutex Oily Polish Remover” that included special oils that mitigated the effects of acetone and conditioned <b>nails</b> and <b>cuticles.</b> Also introduced in 1934 was a new cream polish that was more opaque and glossier than other polishes on the market. Following that, in 1938 Cutex released the first nail treatment product. Called Polish Foundation, it was a treatment with wax that smoothed ridges, protected nails and allowed nail polish to last longer with less chipping.|$|R
5000|$|Carved from {{a single}} block of tun (red cedar) wood, the sarangi has a box-like shape with three hollow chambers: pet (stomach), chaati (chest) and magaj (brain). It is usually around 2 ft long and around 6 in wide though it can vary as there are smaller as well as larger variant sarangis as well. The lower {{resonance}} chamber or pet is covered with parchment made out of goat skin on which a strip of thick leather is placed around the waist (and nailed {{on the back of}} the chamber) which supports the elephant-shaped bridge that is made of camel or buffalo bone usually (made of ivory or Barasingha bone originally but now that is rare due to the ban in India). The bridge in turn supports the huge pressure of approximately 35-37 sympathetic steel or brass strings and three main gut strings that pass through it. The three main playing strings - the comparatively thicker gut strings - are bowed with a heavy horsehair bow and [...] "stopped" [...] not with the finger-tips but with the <b>nails,</b> <b>cuticles</b> and surrounding flesh. (talcum powder is applied to the fingers as a lubricant). The neck has ivory/bone platforms on which the fingers slide. The remaining strings are resonance strings or tarabs (see: sympathetic strings), numbering up to around 35-37, divided into 4 [...] "choirs" [...] having two sets of pegs, one on the right and one on the top. On the inside is a chromatically tuned row of 15 tarabs and on the right a diatonic row of 9 tarabs each encompassing a full octave plus 1-3 extra notes above or below that. Both these sets of tarabs pass from the main bridge to the right side set of pegs through small holes in the chaati supported by hollow ivory/bone beads. Between these inner tarabs and on the either side of the main playing strings lie two more sets of longer tarabs, with 5-6 strings on the right set and 6-7 strings on the left set. They pass from the main bridge over to two small, flat and wide table like bridges through the additional bridge towards the second peg set on top of the instrument. These are tuned to the important tones (swaras) of the raga. A properly tuned sarangi will hum and cry and will sound like melodious meowing, with tones played on any of the main strings eliciting echo-like resonances. A few sarangis use strings manufactured from the intestines of goats — these harken back to the days when rich musicians could afford such strings.|$|R
40|$|The {{nail plate}} is the {{permanent}} {{product of the}} nail matrix. Its normal appearance and growth depend on the integrity of several components: the surrounding tissues or perionychium and the bony phalanx that are contributing to the nail apparatus or nail unit. The nail is inserted proximally in an invagination practically parallel to the upper surface of the skin and laterally in the lateral nail grooves. This pocket-like invagination has a roof, the proximal nail fold and a floor, the matrix from which the nail is derived. The germinal matrix forms {{the bulk of the}} nail plate. The proximal element forms the superficial third of the nail whereas the distal element provides its inferior two-thirds. The ventral surface of the proximal nail fold adheres closely to the nail for a short distance and forms a gradually desquamating tissue, the cuticle, made of the stratum corneum of both the dorsal and the ventral side of the proximal <b>nail</b> fold. The <b>cuticle</b> seals and therefore protects the ungual cul-de-sac. The nail plate is bordered by the proximal nail fold which is continuous with the similarly structured lateral nail fold on each side. The nail bed extends from the lunula to the hyponychium. It presents with parallel longitudinal rete ridges. This area, by contrast to the matrix has a firm attachment to the nail plate and nail avulsion produces a denudation of the nail bed. Colourless, but translucent, the highly vascular connective tissue containing glomus organs transmits a pink colour through the nail. Among its multiple functions, the nail provides counterpressure to the pulp that is essential to the tactile sensation involving the fingers and to the prevention of the hypertrophy of the distal wall tissue, produced after nail loss of the great toe nail.
