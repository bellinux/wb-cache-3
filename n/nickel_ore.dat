5|$|Marble {{quarrying}} {{and processing}} are major activities in Romblon. Among {{the most common}} marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> and gold mostly {{to be found in}} Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E

25|$|One notable {{phenomena}} {{in and around}} the domes which host the majority of the komatiitic <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> deposits in Australia is the high degree of parallelism of the ore shoots, especially at the Kambalda Dome and Widgiemooltha Dome.|$|E
25|$|Kambalda type komatiitic <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> {{deposits}} are a {{class of}} magmatic iron-nickel-copper-platinum-group element ore deposit in which the physical processes of komatiite volcanology serve to deposit, concentrate and enrich a Fe-Ni-Cu-(PGE) sulfide melt within the lava flow environment of an erupting komatiite volcano.|$|E

25|$|The greater Kambalda {{district}} hosts {{a world-class}} nickel-sulfide mining district {{with a total}} pre-mining resource of 2 megatons (Mt) of nickel metal. Approximately 1.1 Mt of nickel metal has been produced since 1967, at an average rate of 35,000 tons of nickel per year. The Kambalda Dome {{is located in the}} south-central part of the Archaean Norseman-Wiluna greenstone belt in the southeastern Yilgarn Craton. Kambalda type komatiitic <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> deposits are the primary source of nickel metal within the Yilgarn Craton.|$|E
25|$|The {{major areas}} of {{production}} in 2004 were coal (nearly 2billiontons), iron ore (310milliontons), crude petroleum (175milliontons), natural gas (41million cubic meters), antimony ore (110,000tons), tin concentrates (110,000 tons), <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> (64,000tons), tungsten concentrates (67,000tons), unrefined salt (37milliontons), vanadium (40,000tons), and molybdenum ore (29,000tons). In order of magnitude, produced minerals were bauxite, gypsum, barite, magnesite, talc and related minerals, manganese ore, fluorspar, and zinc. In addition, China produced 2,450tons {{of silver and}} 215tons of gold in 2004. The mining sector accounted for less than 0.9% of total employment in 2002 but produced about 5.3% of total industrial production.|$|E
25|$|Haudaudine left Koné, New Caledonia, on 3 January 1905. She {{had arrived}} earlier from Yokohama, Japan, in ballast and was loaded for her homeward voyage with 3,042 tons of <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> from the Katavite mines bound for Rotterdam, Germany. After having been towed {{clear of the}} reefs by tugboat SS St. Pierre, she set sail in a fresh breeze. However, at sunset the wind died out and the strong {{currents}} began pushing Haudaudine towards the Contrariété Reef between Cape Goulvain and Porondu Island. Powerless to stop the ship or alter the course, the captain ordered soundings to be taken every few minutes to determine the water depth.|$|E

40|$|Neutron {{activation}} analysis {{has been used}} to determine palladium, iridium, and gold and, occasionally, ruthenium and osmium in the ores and ultramarie host rocks of 14 nickel sulfide deposits in Western Australia. The deposits range from low-grade dis-seminated sulfides (typically pentlanditc, pyrite, millerite, heazlewoodite) in intrusive ultramarie bodies to high-grade massive or matrix-type pyrrhotite and pentlanditc at the base of volcanic-ultramafic units. The total precious metal tenor of typical Western Australian <b>nickel</b> sulfide <b>ore</b> {{is similar to that of}} average Sudbury ore although gold, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium are higher (and platinmn may be lower) in the West-crn Australian ores. Both palladium and platinum are distinctly lower than in average ore from the Merensky Reef. Palladium ranges from 5, 000 ppb in high-grade massive ores with 20 weight percent nickel to 0. 2 ppb in unmineralized ultramarie rocks; iridium varies from 1, 000 to 3 ppb in the same rocks. Palladium and iridium correlate strongly with the nickel sulfide content of the rocks. Deviations from perfect correlations are explained by fractionation of the metals during solidification of the parent sulfide melts or by redistribution during metamorphism or secondary alteration of the sulfides. The distribution of palladium and iridium strongly supports a magmatic origin for the <b>nickel</b> sulfide <b>ores</b> and permits assessment of the effect of exotic processes such as talc-carbonate alteration in the upgrading of low-grade <b>nickel</b> <b>ores.</b> The evidence in hand indicates that although such a process may produce local redistribution of nickel, it is not responsible for large-scale mobilization of nickel. However, it may release significant quantities of gold and sulfur. The ultramarie host rocks of the <b>nickel</b> sulfide <b>ores</b> have very low Pd/Ir ratios rela-tive to the <b>nickel</b> <b>ores</b> and also to "normal " ultramarie rocks that are not known to be associated with major amounts of nickel sulfides. This relation may be a valuable x-ploration guide...|$|R
25|$|The Tilt Train service connects Townsville {{railway station}} to Brisbane {{in the south}} and Cairns in the north. Townsville is a major {{destination}} and generator of rail freight services. The North Coast railway line, operated by Queensland Rail, meets the Western line in the city's south. Container operations are also common and the products of the local nickel and copper refineries, as well as minerals from the western line (Mount Isa), are transported to the port via trains. The Port of Townsville has bulk handling facilities for importing cement, <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> and fuel, and for exporting sugar and products from North Queensland's mines. The port has three sugar-storage sheds, with the newest being the largest under-cover storage area in Australia.|$|E
25|$|Real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011, {{boosted by}} rising {{worldwide}} nickel prices {{and an increase}} in domestic demand due to rising employment, as well as strong business investments. In 2011, exports of goods and services from New Caledonia amounted to 2.11billion US dollars, 75.6% of which were mineral products and alloys (mainly <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> and ferronickel). Imports of goods and services amounted to 5.22billion US dollars. 22.1% of the imports of goods came from Metropolitan France and its overseas departments, 16.1% from other countries in the European Union, 14.6% from Singapore (essentially fuel), 9.6% from Australia, 4.5% from the United States, 4.2% from New Zealand, 2.0% from Japan, and 27.0% from other countries.

25|$|In September 1944 Storm was {{deployed}} to Fremantle in Western Australia. The {{distance to the}} cruising grounds around Java and Celebes were so great {{that one of her}} ballast tanks was converted to carry diesel fuel in order to manage the 4,800-mile round trip. In November several schooners and other small craft carrying <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> were sunk. In January 1945 Storm briefly held the record – 37 days – for a patrol by an S-class boat, covering 7,151 miles in the process. However this was her last patrol, and she received orders to return home. She finally did so on 8 April 1945, flying the traditional Jolly Roger flag to signify the end of a successful patrol. Since leaving her builders she had travelled 71,000 miles and spent over 1,400 hours under water - the equivalent of 60 days and nights.|$|E

On 21 June 2011, after having been anchored off Muara Asam Asam in Kalimantan, Indonesia, for almost two months due to a commercial dispute on a quality of loaded <b>nickel</b> <b>ore,</b> seven crew members managed to purchase three litres of pure spirits from a ship chandler to have a party. Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had asked the ship chandler to deliver ethanol for the ship's medical kit, but had rejected the suspicious-looking bottles because they had no prints proving that the content was suitable for medical use. Instead of 90–95% ethanol spirit the liquid in the bottles contained 36% of methanol, and four of the seven crew members involved in the party {{died as a result of}} methanol poisoning.|$|E

500|$|With {{precious}} metal federal coinage hoarded during the economic turmoil of the American Civil War, including the silver three-cent piece, {{and even the}} copper-nickel cent commanding a premium, Congress issued paper money in denominations as small as three cents to replace the hoarded coins in commerce. These small slips of paper became ragged and dirty, and the public came to hate [...] "shinplasters". After the issuance in 1864 of a lighter bronze cent and a two-cent piece of that metal, both of which circulated freely, there were proposals for a three-cent piece in copper-nickel to replace the three-cent note. The advocates were led by Pennsylvania industrialist Joseph Wharton, who then controlled the domestic supply of <b>nickel</b> <b>ore.</b> On the last legislative day of the congressional session, March 3, 1865, a bill for a three-cent piece in copper-nickel alloy was introduced in Congress, passed both houses without debate, and was signed by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

500|$|In 1870, Treasury Secretary George Boutwell sent Congress a draft bill {{to replace}} the {{outdated}} 1837 Mint Act and the bits of legislation passed over the years regarding the mint and coinage. [...] Even in the draft bill, no provision was made for the three-cent silver, though some in Congress wished to retain the coin {{in anticipation of the}} resumption of specie payments. [...] After much debate in Congress, President Ulysses S. Grant signed the Coinage Act of 1873 on February 12 of that year. [...] The law abolished the two-cent piece, three-cent silver, half dime, and standard silver dollar (later restored in 1878). Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces [...] "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage". Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might have directly competed with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to industrialist Joseph Wharton, whose mines produced much of the <b>nickel</b> <b>ore</b> used in coinage. According to numismatist R.W. Julian, the three-cent silver [...] "had played its part well in the U.S. monetary system, but there was no longer any need for it".|$|E
