Second, we dynamically adjust the admission threshold to alleviate the server loads and improve bandwidth utilization.

40|$|We {{consider}} designing <b>near</b> <b>video</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> (VoD) {{systems that}} minimize start-up latency while maintaining high image quality. Recently non-uniform segmentation {{has been used}} to develop periodic broadcasting techniques for near VoD. These techniques give significant reductions in start-up latency as compared with more conventional uniform segmentation. All of these schemes assume, however, that the videos are CBRencoded. Since a CBR-encoded video has a larger average rate than an open-loop VBR encoding with the same image quality, there is potential to obtain further performance improvements by using VBR video. In this paper we develop a series of multiplexing schemes for the periodic broadcasting of VBR-encoded video, which are based on smoothing, server buffering and client prefetching. Two key but conflicting performance measures exist when using VBR video: latency and packet loss. By introducing small additional delays in our multiplexing schemes, our traced-based numerical work sho [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Scalable Architecture for Video on Demand (SAVoD), {{based on the}} {{starting}} point that it is worth wasting bandwidth to meet latency goals, provided the number of users is high {{enough to pay for}} the bandwidth. The design further assumes that eliminating communication with the server is worth a considerable amount of overall bandwidth, as the resulting system can scale to unlimited users who can collectively cover the cost of any wasted bandwidth. A SAVoD entry-level system is proposed, with {{a relatively small number of}} movies at relatively low-quality video, which can nonetheless accomodate unlimited numbers of viewers. The entry-level system, once deployed, can scale up to offer close to a full VoD service. Because of the scalability from a small to a large system, SAVoD offers a more practical deployment strategy than other VoD proposals, with fewer compromises than other partial solutions. Furthermore, it is much simpler than other proposed <b>Near</b> <b>Video</b> <b>on</b> <b>Demand</b> (NVoD) solutions, and has the useful property (hence its scalability) of no load or cost impact on the server side or main interconnect for adding another user. Even with a modest 32 Kbit/s bandwidth budget per user, a SAVoD system with a large numbers of movies can be supported, with a requirement of 69, 000 new users for adding capacity of one new HDTV movie, 23, 000 for analog broadcast-quality or 5, 800 for an entry-level MPEG- 1 system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis studies {{distribution}} {{schemes for}} stored video over broadcast networks {{and over the}} Internet. In {{the first part of}} the thesis we consider designing <b>near</b> <b>Video</b> <b>on</b> <b>Demand</b> (VoD) systems that minimize start-up latency while maintaining high-image quality. We propose a novel scheme for near VoD which is based on periodic broadcasting of VBRencoded video, and develop a series of multiplexing schemes for broadcasting VBR video that are based on smoothing, buffering and client prefetching. Our multiplexing schemes achieve high link utilization with negligible packet loss, and result in significant reductions in the start-up latency relative to the CBR case. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the design of stored video streaming applications for the current Internet. We first develop a theoretical formulation and analysis for the streaming of layered-encoded video. We suppose that the video is encoded into two layers and model the bandwidth available to the application as a stochastic process whose statistical characteristics are unknown a priori. We address the problem of dynamically allocating the available bandwidth among the two layers in order to minimize the impact of client starvation on the quality of the decoded video stream. We next consider streaming stored video over actual fair-share bandwidth conditions. We perform a series of Internet experiments in which we collect TCP throughput traces. We find that fair-share bandwidth varies over a broad range of time scales. We investigate the impact of the long-term behavior of fair-share bandwidth on several data transmission schemes for streaming video. We quantify the performance gains achieved with prefet [...] ...|$|E

40|$|IPTV is now {{offered by}} several {{operators}} in Europe, US and Asia using broadcast video over private IP networks that are isolated from Internet. IPTV services rely ontransmission of live (real-time) video and/or stored video. Video on Demand (VoD) and Time-shifted TV are implemented by IP unicast and Broadcast TV (BTV) and <b>Near</b> <b>video</b> <b>on</b> <b>demand</b> are implemented by IP multicast. IPTV services require QoS guarantees and can tolerate {{no more than}} 10 - 6 packet loss probability, 200 ms delay, and 50 ms jitter. Low delay is essential for satisfactory trick mode performance(pause, resume,fast forward) for VoD, and fast channel change time for BTV. Internet Traffic Engineering (TE) is defined in RFC 3272 and involves both capacity management and traffic management. Capacity management includes capacityplanning, routing control, and resource management. Traffic management includes (1) nodal traffic control functions such as traffic conditioning, queue management, scheduling, and (2) other functions that regulate traffic flow through the network orthat arbitrate access to network resources. An IPTV network architecture includes multiple networks (core network, metronetwork, access network and home network) that connects devices (super head-end, video hub office, video serving office, home gateway, set-top box). Each IP router in the core and metro networks implements some queueing and packet scheduling mechanism at the output link controller. Popular schedulers in IP networks include Priority Queueing (PQ), Class-Based Weighted Fair Queueing (CBWFQ), and Low Latency Queueing (LLQ) which combines PQ and CBWFQ. The thesis analyzes several Packet Scheduling algorithms that can optimize the tradeoff between system capacity and end user performance for the traffic classes. Before in the simulator FIFO,PQ,GPS queueing methods were implemented inside. This thesis aims to implement the LLQ scheduler inside the simulator and to evaluate the performance of these packet schedulers. The simulator is provided by ErnstNordstr√∂m and Simulator was built in Visual C++ 2008 environmentand tested and analyzed in MatLab 7. 0 under windows VISTA...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} overall solution for interactive <b>Near</b> <b>Video</b> <b>On</b> <b>Demand</b> (NVOD) systems, where limited server and network resources prevent the system from servicing all customers‚Äô requests. The interactive nature of recent workloads complicates matters further. Interactive requests require additional resources to be handled. This dissertation analyzes the system performance under a realistic workload using different stream merging techniques and scheduling policies. It considers {{a wide range}} of system parameters and studies their impact on the waiting and blocking metrics. In order to improve waiting customers experience, we propose a new scheduling policy for waiting customers that is fairer and delivers a descent performance. Blocking is a major issue in interactive NVOD systems and we propose a few techniques to minimize it. In particular, we study the maximum Interactive Stream (I-Stream) length (Threshold) that should be allowed in order to prevent a few requests from using the expensive I-Streams for a prolonged period of time, which starves other requests from a chance of using this valuable resource. Using a reasonable I-Stream threshold proves very effective in improving blocking metrics. Moreover, we introduce an I-Stream provisioning policy to dynamically shift resources based on the system requirements at the time. The proposed policy proves to be highly effective in improving the overall system performance. To account for both average waiting time and average blocking time, we introduce a new metric (Aggregate Delay). We study the client-side cache management policy. We utilize the customer‚Äôs cache to service most interactive requests, which reduces the load on the server. We propose three purging algorithms to clear data when the cache gets full. Purge Oldest removes the oldest data in the cache, whereas Purge Furthest clears the furthest data from the client‚Äôs playback point. In contrast, Adaptive Purge tries to avoid purging any data that includes the customer‚Äôs playback point or the playback point of any stream that is being listened to by the client. Additionally, we study the impact of the purge block, which is the least amount of data to be cleared, on the system performance. Finally, we study the effect of bookmarking on the system performance. A video segment that is searched and watched repeatedly is called a hotspot and is pointed to by a bookmark. We introduce three enhancements to effectively support bookmarking. Specifically, we propose a new purging algorithm to avoid purging hotspot data if it is already cached. On top of that, we fetch hotspot data for customers not listening to any stream. Furthermore, we reserve multicast channels to fetch hotspot data...|$|E

The result of the simulation shows that our mechanism fairs better in all aspects of performance metrics than the existing mechanism such as standard, advanced, optimal and accelerated chaining...|$|R
