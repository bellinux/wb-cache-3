40|$|Canada {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} to establish a geographical <b>names</b> <b>authority</b> and has participated in the work of standardization at the United Nations since the first conference in 1967. Over the past forty years the approval of geographical names in Canada has been primarily the responsibility of the provinces and, for a shorter time, the territories. The <b>names</b> <b>authority</b> for the Province of Ontario, the Ontario Geographic Names Board (OGNB), comprises seven members (including representatives from Ontario First Nations, and the province’s English- and French-speaking communities). Between 2000 and 2007, the OGNB considered some 380 names submissions, recommending approximately 330 for official recognition and general dissemination. This paper looks at some of the main challenges to the Board during this period. Among the questions considered were issues relating to such themes as commemorative naming, urban community naming, and handling existing names considered derogatory. Sometimes bearing on the Board’s approaches to these issues were the need for names for emergency reference purposes (911 dialling), a sparse population in northern areas of the province to support local usage, and conflicting submissions to replace derogatory names. Issues, approaches, examples, and preliminary guidelines are presented...|$|E
40|$|Several {{cultural}} domain {{resources in}} different languages have become available as Linked Open Data (LOD) {{in the last few}} years. However, there is little re-use of this data in multilingual information retrieval applications. The paper discusses Linked Data driven approaches in providing integrated multilingual access to diverse Japanese humanities databases by linking and re-using LOD resources dynamically. It proposes a method, which dynamically generates links across databases using Linked Data when users perform keyword searches. We built a prototype information retrieval system based on LOD resources, personal <b>names</b> <b>authority</b> data, subject headings, and links to other Linked Data resources. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this approach is integrated in real-life retrieval systems and how linking and accessing diverse databases can be enhanced {{to make use of the}} available LOD resources. The proposed method also enables to access multiple databases {{in different languages}} by using the notations in various languages, which were obtained from the authority data resources. It allows to access to additional data not only in Japanese databases but also multilingual databases in other countries without depending on languages and formats of each database...|$|E

As early as 2011 RDA will replace the German cataloguing standard “Rules for Alphabetical Cataloguing” (RAK). RDA is the successor system to AACR 2 and RAK. The benefits of implementing RDA are (theoretically) internationalisation of national catalogue data and easier usage. Parallel to that implementation the Office for Library Standards of the German National Library is planning to combine the authority files for bibliographic description, namely the Corporate Body Authority File (GKD), the Subject Headings Authority File (SWD) and the <b>Names</b> <b>Authority</b> File (PND) to create one common authority file (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND). If everything goes as planned, by 2011 we can expect a completely new body of rules and regulations for formal and subject cataloguing (RDA), a new exchange format (MARC 21 Authority) and a new authority file (GND). Nearly all of the now existing systems will be overhauled, updated or mapped to the new applications. The result will be the internationalisation and harmonisation of cataloguing which will facilitate the exchange of data across borders. We developed an online questionnaire for the qualitative evaluation of problems, opportunities and challenges which will emerge when RDA is finally put into practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{geographic}} names is never {{mentioned in the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However, any discussion of delimitation of ocean space and sovereignty carries with it implication of naming rights. For the marine scientific research community, geographic names {{are an important part}} of effectively communicating information about discoveries. Additionally, the various jurisdictions established in UNCLOS have become referenced “limits ” for geographic <b>names</b> <b>authority</b> as well as other activities actually specified by UNCLOS. As many Law of the Sea experts are aware, the United Nations is also involved in the field of geographic names, or toponymy, primarily through its Group of Experts on Geographic Names (UNGEGN). Additionally, and also well-known to many, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and Intergovernmental Oceanic Commission (IOC) are involved in undersea feature names through the activities of the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN). An increasing number of nations are becoming involved with and paying more attention to the subject of undersea feature names. This is often directly related to the subject nation’s ratification of UNCLOS. In researching the topics of maritime boundaries and maritime nomenclature, the interrelationship between the two has become evident. This paper will seek to address a variety of issues where geographic names issues arise as part of activities under the purview of UNCLOS. The subject discussion will range from heated disputes over certain geographic names to the effects of UNCLOS on geographic names databasing. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of the Union Catalogue (UC) {{was included in the}} project of the «Networking of Libraries of Tertiary Education Institutions» of the SPECIAL TRAINING PROGRAM I (EPEAEK I). A workgroup (WG) was created for the study of {{creation of}} a UC and the drawing of specifications. The WG recorded the current situation in the Academic Libraries (AL), searched the bibliography, contacted experts from the international field, evaluated {{the pros and cons of}} each type, weighed the difficulties and the expectations and having concluded to the type of central UC of «slave» type, drew up the basic bibliographic and technical specifications. According to the results of the WG it was foreseen the utilisation of an existing software with development of additional programmes, and two implementation phases, A) Constitution and homogenisation of the initial database of the UC, and B) Normal operation and update of UC. Moreover, the minimum levels of the bibliographic records were defined, methods and tools for the subjects and <b>names</b> <b>authority</b> files were proposed, the questions of the language of the subjects, the local data, as well as rules for common confrontation of certain categories of works were examined and subjects for training of academic librarians were suggested. Finally the creation of an organisation for the implementation and continuity of UC was proposed after the end of the EPEAEK. The project of the implementation of the UC was included in the EPEAEK II. Based on the specifications of the WG the equipment was installed in the space of the Library of the National Technical University of Athens. The ADVANCE software of Geac was selected, which was installed by ELiDOC. Data were collected from the libraries and samples of 70. 000 records were received for tests by 7 representative libraries of various programs, character sets and formats. The ELiDOC developed transformation programs for different coding of character sets, structure of the data from USMARC in UNIMARC and holdings. The necessary changes in the basic software for its adaptation to the requirements of UC were also realised. The librarians of the UC were trained in the operation of ADVANCE. The “UC Designing and Parameterisation Committee” drew up a draft of a scenario for the updating and the functional specifications on the import of records. Based on this scenario GEAC France developed a special program for the management of the records of the UC. Its know-how originated from its participation in the consortium for the drawing of the study on the creation of a UC of the French Higher Education Institutions and the implementation of the UC of French Municipal Libraries was exploited. The basic algorithm of identification and unification of records and the algorithm of management of holdings were designed. The first trials of unification of bibliographic records took place and a part of the operation of the algorithms that had been developed, was checked. The algorithm of unification of subjects was also completed. At the same time seminars on issues more generally and not narrowly on the UC were organised in various cities for cataloguers from all the libraries, in the frame of the Horizontal Action of the Programme. Integrated tests and improvements, mainly concerning the identification algorithm were followed. In May 2003 the implementation of the project was assigned to a coordinator. An action plan was drawn up, for the speeding up of the implementation, in three levels: technical, procedural, supporting. Particular emphasis was given in the final configuration of the algorithms. The systematic tests of all algorithms in three stages were completed: a) with a small number of checked data in all the operations: identification of duplicate records, import of the unique records, creation of a file of records considered as duplicate, unification of duplicate records, comparison between duplicate and selection of main record, management of subjects of duplicate, management of copies of duplicate, b) with bigger files and wider variety of cases and c) in quasi real conditions with bigger files of three catalogues. The interjection of an additional stage for the internal check (self-check or the catalogues for import) and the individualised use of different modules of the algorithm for each case were decided. A checklist was prepared describing in detail the steps to be followed for the librarians of each library and the UC team. All the findings of the trials have been recorded in order to be forwarded to the Permanent Committees of the Thematic and Descriptive cataloguing to prepare guidelines. The launching of the UC website was also planned. The authority files of Subjects and Names of the Library of Congress have already been ordered for remote access by all the libraries-members of the UC. The authority files produced by the National Library have also been prepared for remote access from the UC website. The creation of UC is not only a technical question. As it was foreseen by the study of the WG, a legal entity that will ensure the continuity and viability of the UC will be needed. However this should not be examined apart from the other cooperative activities that take place the same period in the same field (e. g. HEAL-Link). A serious discussion should begin concerning the institutional consolidation of the efforts, achievements and expectations of so many people...|$|E
