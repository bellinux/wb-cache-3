25|$|Zuma {{has faced}} {{significant}} legal challenges. He {{was charged with}} rape in 2005, but was acquitted. He fought a long legal battle over allegations of racketeering and corruption, resulting from his financial advisor Schabir Shaik's conviction for corruption and fraud. On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority dropped the charges, citing political interference, although the decision was successfully challenged by opposition parties, and the charges are <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> NPA for reconsideration. After extensive state-funded upgrades to his rural homestead at Nkandla, the Public Protector found that Zuma had benefited improperly from the expenditure, and the Constitutional Court unanimously held in 2016's Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker of the National Assembly that Zuma had failed to uphold the country's constitution, resulting in calls for his resignation and a failed impeachment attempt in the National Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|Barasch {{was called}} upon again, <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Permanent Investigations Senate Subcommittee on July 20, 1965 in Washington, D.C., to testify for {{approximately}} 2 hours {{during which he}} notably refused to answer {{on the grounds of}} possible self-incrimination 128 times: [...] "I respectfully decline to answer this question {{on the grounds that it}} might tend to incriminate me." [...] In the opening statement, Barasch's attorneys stated they had advised him to refuse to answer questions.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{strike was}} {{considered}} [...] "...a bold gamble by an isolated union." [...] GDL represented a mere 3 percent of Deutsche Bahn's workforce. [...] No other Deutsche Bahn union supported the engineers' strike, {{nor did the}} German federation of trade unions, Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund (DGB). But GDL had a tradition of breaking with other unions in wage negotiations. GDL also believed the time was ripe for a nationwide strike. Chancellor Angela Merkel's government had planned to sell a 49 percent stake in Deutsche Bahn to the public. The union believed it had to seek its wage demands <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> privatization effort began.|$|E
2500|$|Records {{show the}} {{government}} was considering it in 1784. The London newspapers announced in November 1784 that: [...] "A plan has been presented to the [...] Minister, and is <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet, for instituting a new colony in New Holland. In this vast tract of land....every sort of produce and improvement of which the various soils of the earth are capable, may be expected". The Government also incorporated the settlement of Norfolk Island into their plan, with its attractions of timber and flax, proposed by Banks' Royal Society colleagues, Sir John Call and Sir George Young.|$|E
2500|$|Roberts then {{laid out}} the {{requirements}} of such a suit under D. C. 42 U. S. C. §§1973b. [...] He noted that §§4 and 5 were temporary provisions—they were originally {{expected to be in}} effect for only five years. §4(a), 79 Stat. 438. [...] However, Congress reauthorized the Act in 1970 (for 5 years), 1975 (for 7 years), and 1982 (for 25 years); each reauthorization was litigated as unconstitutional, and each time the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality. [...] Most recently, in 2006, Congress extended §5 for yet another 25 years. It was this latest extension that was <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> court.|$|E

2500|$|In Victoria, Berry, by {{voracious}} reading, {{acquired the}} education {{he had missed}} in England, and taught himself economics, literature and philosophy. But all his life he retained a broad London accent, which many Victorian conservatives found offensive or amusing. In Parliament he once asked the Speaker: [...] "What is <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 'Ouse?" [...] To which the Leader of the Opposition interjected: [...] "An H!" [...] He developed a powerful rhetorical style modelled on that of his hero Gladstone, equally effective in the rough-house of the colonial Parliament or on the hustings. The conservative newspaper The Argus conceded: [...] "His oratory might not be polished: it certainly was notbut it was passionate, and it told." [...] Noted for his humour, Berry was nevertheless a tough and determined politician.|$|E
2500|$|Procedurally, the Lohier order {{also seemed}} to obviate an earlier stay motion (i.e. an [...] "stay" [...] pending Judge Forrest's {{resolution}} of the government's request to stay her injunction during the government's appeal to the Second Circuit), which the government filed in the district court—but which the district court {{said it would not}} resolve until September 19, 2012. Court papers clarified later this issue. The lawyers for Hedges & Co, Carl J. Mayer and Bruce I. Afran, wrote on September 27, 2012: The district court... never ruled on the government's motion for a stay pending appeal because the Government insisted to the District Court judge that if the judge did not grant an interim stay, it would immediately seek an interim or administrative stay from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. This demand was made by letter on Friday, September 14, 2012 after Judge Forrest granted a permanent injunction on Wednesday February 12, 2012. Though Judge Forrest denied the government's request for what the government originally in its papers described as an [...] "interim" [...] stay (now characterized as an [...] "administrative" [...] stay) of the injunction, Judge Forrest issued an order by email on Friday, September 14 informing the government and all parties that she would decide the government's motion for a stay pending appeal on Wednesday, September 19, 2012 and setting a briefing schedule for all parties. The government neglected to inform this Court of that fact... After neglecting to inform this Court of that development, the government sought both an administrative stay and a stay pending appeal from this Court and this Court granted an interim stay on September 17, 2012. Because of the government's action and this Court's decision, Judge Forrest concluded that she could not rule on a stay pending appeal. The U.S. government dismissed this neglect alligation by putting forward an email from Judge Forrest to Bruce Afran. Four days after Forrest's 2012-09-14 Mail Forrest informed on September 18, 2012 Bruce Afran by email that [...] "All issues, including the stay, are <b>now</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Second Circuit. Nothing further should be filed in this Court until further notice." ...|$|E
