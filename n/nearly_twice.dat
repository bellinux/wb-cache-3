However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to <b>nearly</b> <b>twice</b> the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E
