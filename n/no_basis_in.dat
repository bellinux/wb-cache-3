5|$|The {{widespread}} urban legend {{that one}} swallows {{a high number}} of spiders during sleep in one's life has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> reality. A sleeping person causes all kinds of noise and vibrations by breathing, the beating heart, snoring etc. all of which warn spiders of danger.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the custom}} had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> law and {{frequently}} resulted in prosecution, {{particularly from the}} mid-19th century onwards, {{the attitude of the}} authorities was equivocal. At least one early 19th-century magistrate is on record as stating that he did not believe he had the right to prevent wife sales, and there were cases of local Poor Law Commissioners forcing husbands to sell their wives, rather than having to maintain the family in workhouses.|$|E
5|$|However, Black {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in Korematsu v. United States, which upheld Japanese internment during World War II. Black also consistently opposed the doctrine of substantive due process (the anti-New Deal Supreme Court's interpretation of this concept {{made it impossible for}} the government to enact legislation that interfered with the freedom of business owners) and believed that there was <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the words of the Constitution for a right to privacy, voting against finding one in Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|If {{rights are}} let to expire, they don't count as a {{deductible}} loss, {{as they have}} <b>no</b> tax <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> this case.|$|R
50|$|Many anarchists also {{oppose the}} concept of race itself, arguing that it has <b>no</b> {{biological}} <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> science and is a social construction designed to divide the working class and preserve capitalism.|$|R
50|$|Some sources {{describe}} Donghu {{people of}} 7th century BC to 2nd century BC Manchuria as Proto-Tungusic. Other sources sharply criticize {{this as a}} random similarity in pronunciation that has <b>no</b> real <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> fact.|$|R
5|$|In 1913, another Hull House ghost story began circulating. According to this legend, after a man {{claimed that}} he would rather have the Devil in his house than a picture of The Virgin Mary, his child was born with pointed ears, horns, scale-covered skin, and a tail. The mother {{was said to have}} taken the baby to Hull House, where Addams was said to have {{attempted}} to have it baptized and wound up locking it in the attic. While initially annoyed about the story, which had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> fact, Addams became fascinated by the effect the episode had on old women in the neighborhood and used the episode as a basis for her book, The Long Road of Woman's Memory.|$|E
5|$|Competing with Spain, {{the first}} English colony in the Americas {{was founded in}} 1585 by {{explorer}} Walter Raleigh in Virginia and named Roanoke. The Roanoke colony failed and {{is known as the}} lost colony, after it was found abandoned on the return of the late-arriving supply ship. With the East India Company, England also competed with the Dutch and French in the East. In 1588, during the Elizabethan period, an English fleet under Francis Drake was going to face Spanish Armada which failed because of the storms. The political structure of the island changed in 1603, when the King of Scots, James VI, a kingdom which was a longtime rival to English interests, inherited the throne of England as James I — creating a personal union. He styled himself King of Great Britain, although this had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> English law. Under the auspices of King James VI and I the Authorised King James Version of the Holy Bible was published in 1611. It has not only been ranked with Shakespeare's works as the greatest masterpiece of literature in the English language but also was the standard version of the Bible read by most Protestant Christians for four hundred years, until modern revisions were produced in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|It was {{probably}} Stangl's brother-in law who informed Wiesenthal of Stangl's whereabouts in 1964. Concerned that Stangl would be warned and escape, Wiesenthal quietly prepared a dossier {{with the assistance}} of Austrian Minister of Justice Hans Klecatsky. Stangl was arrested outside his home in São Paulo on 28 February 1967 and was extradited to Germany on 22 June. A month later Wiesenthal's book The Murderers Among Us was released. Wiesenthal's publishers advertised that he had been responsible for locating over 800 Nazis, a claim that had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> fact but was nonetheless repeated by reputable newspapers such as the New York Times. Stangl was {{sentenced to life in prison}} and died of heart failure in June 1971, having confessed his guilt to biographer Gitta Sereny the previous day.|$|E
50|$|Mystical Rose (2000), a dementing woman's {{prayer and}} life, has <b>no</b> literal <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> Scrimger's own {{past or present}} - except, as he says, insofar as we are all only one corner away from {{personal}} disintegration.|$|R
25|$|Tight {{social groups}} and authoritarian personality, {{suppression}} of dissent, and groupthink {{can enhance the}} adoption of beliefs that have <b>no</b> rational <b>basis.</b> <b>In</b> attempting to confirm their beliefs, the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.|$|R

5|$|The most {{powerful}} British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved England {{on the path}} to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both English law and the English courts system; he sped up the system for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop, he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in Somersett's Case (1772), where he held that slavery had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> common law and had never been established by positive law (legislation) in England, and therefore was not binding law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).|$|E
25|$|He {{concluded}} that the majority found <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the Due Process Clause to strike down the challenged provisions of the Agriculture and Markets law.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have accused}} {{the book of}} {{depicting}} the order as misogynistic, a claim which the order's defenders say has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> reality because half of the leadership positions in Opus Dei are held by women.|$|E
2500|$|Antonin Scalia {{joined the}} majority, but added in passing {{that he found}} <b>no</b> <b>basis,</b> either <b>in</b> the Constitution or in case law, to {{conclude}} that executing an innocent but duly convicted defendant would violate the Eighth Amendment. He sharply criticized the dissenting justices' appeal to conscience: ...|$|R
2500|$|Later {{episodes in}} {{particular}} included many leading characters that had <b>no</b> direct <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> Montgomery's written work. [...] As well, Montgomery's most famous character, Anne Shirley (i.e., Anne of Green Gables herself) never appeared on Road To Avonlea, {{although she was}} referred to on very few occasions.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} when the Women's Volunteer Labour Corps started in Korea. Women's {{shipbuilding}} began with <b>no</b> legal <b>basis.</b> <b>In</b> August 23, 1944, the legal basis [...] was carried out and the troops were officially launched. The Act was also applied to colonial Korea and Taiwan.|$|R
25|$|In 2007 the Cairo-based Al-Azhar Supreme Council of Islamic Research, {{an entity}} {{belonging}} {{to what is}} generally {{regarded as one of}} the most significant theological universities in the OIC, ruled that female genital mutilation has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> Islamic law.|$|E
25|$|These {{functions}} are often incorrectly {{referred to as}} the basis functions of the (continuous) transform. In fact, as in the continuous Fourier transform, there is <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the continuous wavelet transform. Time-frequency interpretation uses a subtly different formulation (after Delprat).|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{characters}} in Peter Ackroyd's 2004 novel The Lambs of London, though the contacts with Charles and Mary Lamb have <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the historical record, and Ackroyd took many liberties with the story.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal judge {{concluded}} that: [...] "there is <b>no</b> reasonable <b>basis,</b> <b>in</b> {{the sense}} of an adequate foundation, in medical science to enable the First Respondent and the Second Respondent to state that HomeopathicTreatments are safe and effective {{as an alternative to}} the Vaccine for the Prevention of Whooping Cough".|$|R
5000|$|Others have {{addressed}} the specific word relationships proposed. Russell Spittler (1973) says of the [...] "disputable" [...] etymological claims made by the British Israelists that they [...] "have <b>no</b> ample <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> linguistic scholarship and are based on coincidences only." [...] William Ingram (1995) would present arguments made by British Israelism as examples of [...] "tortured etymology".|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} from a proper basis is an ontological {{argument for the}} existence of God related to fideism. Alvin Plantinga argued that belief in God is a properly basic belief, and so <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> for belief <b>in</b> God is necessary.|$|R
25|$|On {{his blog}} in 2007, Myers {{reviewed}} Stuart Pivar's book Lifecode, which argues that self-organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determine {{the development and}} final structure of organisms. Myers reviewed the book negatively, stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from Pivar's imagination and had <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> actual evidence.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{has been}} criticised as not {{following}} the possession by bank/seller requirements and risks taken by the financier are non-existent (being insured or guarantees provided by the customer). Additionally, Khattab has criticised the whole two-tier mudarabah system as having <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> Islamic law, as there are no instances where the mudharib passed funds onto another mudharib, and as such is questionable.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{account of}} the toponym's derivation {{can be attributed to}} Geoffrey of Monmouth. In Historia Regum Britanniae, the name is described as originating from King Lud, who seized the city Trinovantum and ordered it to be renamed in his honour as Kaerlud. This was then eventually slurred into Karelundein and then London. However, Geoffrey's work contains many fanciful suppositions about place-name derivation and the suggestion has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> linguistics.|$|E
50|$|Rumours that Comerford (like his {{brother-in-law}} Sir Nicholas Walsh) converted to Catholicism {{on his deathbed}} seem to have <b>no</b> solid <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> fact, although {{at least one of}} his sons was a priest.The rumour in both cases seems to have originated with David Rothe, Bishop of Ossory, who was, admittedly, a cousin of Comerford, and would have known him personally.|$|R
5000|$|The traditionalists' Papal Oath, {{if indeed}} {{based on the}} text in the Liber Diurnus, is a serious mistranslation. Much of it has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> {{whatever}} <b>in</b> the historical document, including the paragraphs [...] "I swear ... defined and declared" [...] and [...] "Accordingly, without exclusion ... blasphemous venture" [...] and the phrase [...] "I will put outside the Church whoever dares to go against this oath, may it be somebody else or I".|$|R
50|$|On 13 January 2010, China Daily {{published}} a front-page splash {{photo of a}} Chinese couple, Zeng Anquan, a divorced architect aged 45, and Pan Wenjie, a demobilized PLA soldier aged 27, being married at a gay bar in Chengdu. The marriage is understood as having <b>no</b> legal <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the country, and the families of both men reacted negatively to the news of their marriage.|$|R
25|$|A {{decision-maker}} acts in an {{ultra vires}} manner {{when it did}} not have the power that it purported to have, and therefore there was <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> law for the impugned action. In Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), the court held that the Corporation was only empowered by statute to provide washing facilities for the residents to wash their clothes adequately. Hence, a laundry service implemented by the Corporation was ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|The myth of pirate {{night vision}} has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> fact. While {{it does take}} time for the human eye to adjust to optimum vision when {{switching}} between dark and brightly lit areas, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that such a tactic was ever employed by pirates or anyone else. No naval combat manual or historical account of the era makes any reference to such tactics ever being used.|$|E
25|$|Some later traditions, like Shantideva and Gampopa, feature {{restrictions}} on non-vaginal sex (including homosexuality). A medieval commentary of the Digha Nikaya mentions examples of immorality in society, {{and one of}} the examples is homosexuality, whereas this has <b>no</b> <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the Sutta. Other Buddhist texts such as the Abhidharma-kosa and the Jataka tales make no mention of homosexuality in this regard. According to Jose Ignacio Cabezon, Buddhist cultures' attitudes towards homosexuality have generally been neutral.|$|E
50|$|Parts of China's Nine-Dash Line overlap Indonesia's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} near the Natuna islands. Indonesia believes China's claim over parts of the Natuna islands has <b>no</b> legal <b>basis.</b> <b>In</b> November 2015, Indonesia's security chief Luhut Panjaitan said Indonesia could take China before an international court if Beijing's claim {{to the majority of}} the South China Sea and part of Indonesian territory is not resolved through dialogue.|$|R
25|$|Both {{the dream}} {{argument}} and the simulation hypothesis {{can be regarded}} as skeptical hypotheses; however in raising these doubts, just as Descartes noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his own existence, the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have <b>no</b> physical <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the real world is called psychosis though psychosis may have a physical <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> the real world and explanations vary.|$|R
25|$|The fourth law of {{thermodynamics}} and {{the concept}} of material entropy as proposed by Georgescu to redress his first mistake have <b>no</b> scientific <b>basis</b> <b>in</b> physics whatsoever, and it was a theoretical mistake by Georgescu to make these propositions at all (Georgescu's second mistake); but by itself, this does not imply that complete and perpetual recycling of material resources is possible, as it most probably is impossible on other grounds (see below).|$|R
