2500|$|The term [...] "normative assessment" [...] {{refers to}} the process of {{comparing}} one test-taker to his or her peers. A <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> (NRT) is a type of test, assessment, or evaluation which yields an estimate of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population. This type of test identifies whether the test taker performed better or worse than other students taking this test. A criterion-referenced test (CRT) is a style of test which uses test scores to show whether or not test takers performed well on a given task, not how well they performed compared to other test takers. Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests. In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material.|$|E

5000|$|Both terms criterion-referenced and norm-referenced were {{originally}} coined by Robert Glaser. Unlike a criterion-reference test, a <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> indicates whether the test-taker did {{better or worse}} than other people who took the test.For example, if the criterion is [...] "Students {{should be able to}} correctly add two single-digit numbers," [...] then reasonable test questions might look like [...] "" [...] or [...] "" [...] A criterion-referenced test would report the student's performance strictly according to whether the individual student correctly answered these questions. A <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> would report primarily whether this student correctly answered more questions compared to other students in the group.Even when testing similar topics, a test which is designed to accurately assess mastery may use different questions than one which is intended to show relative ranking. This is because some questions are better at reflecting actual achievement of students, and some test questions are better at differentiating between the best students and the worst students. (Many questions will do both.) A criterion-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by students who know the specific material. A <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> will use questions which were correctly answered by the [...] "best" [...] students and not correctly answered by the [...] "worst" [...] students (e.g. Cambridge University's pre-entry 'S' paper).Some tests can provide useful information about both actual achievement and relative ranking. The ACT provides both a ranking, and indication of what level is considered necessary to likely success in college. Some argue that the term [...] "criterion-referenced test" [...] is a misnomer, since it can refer to the interpretation of the score as well as the test itself. In the previous example, the same score on the ACT can be interpreted in a norm-referenced or criterion-referenced manner.|$|E

50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>tests</b> {{is that they}} cannot measure progress of {{the population as a}} whole, only where individuals fall within the whole.

50|$|Robert Glaser {{introduced}} “criterion-referenced measures” in 1962.

50|$|A <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> (NRT) {{is a type}} of test, assessment, or {{evaluation}} which yields {{an estimate}} of the position of the tested individual in a predefined population, with respect to the trait being measured. The estimate is derived from the analysis of test scores and possibly other relevant data from a sample drawn from the population.

50|$|Norms do not {{automatically}} imply a standard. A <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>test</b> does {{not seek to}} enforce any expectation of what test takers should know or be able to do.

It does not identify which test takers are able to correctly perform the tasks {{at a level that}} would be acceptable for employment or further education.|$|E

5000|$|Many college {{entrance}} exams and nationally used school tests use norm-referenced tests. The SAT, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) compare individual student performance {{to the performance}} of a normative sample.

5000|$|The macabre {{constant}} is a theorized bias {{in educational}} assessment {{that happens when}} a professor unconsciously splits students into three subjective categories—good, average and poor—regardless of their actual objective scholarly level.

5000|$|Ipsative ( [...] ; Latin: , [...] "of the self") is a {{descriptor}} used {{in psychology}} {{to indicate a}} specific type of measure in which respondents compare two or more desirable options and pick the one that is most preferred (sometimes called a [...] "forced choice" [...] scale). This is contrasted with measures that use Likert-type scales, in which respondents choose the score (e.g. 1 to 5) which best represents {{the degree to which they}} agree with a given statement (see also <b>Norm-referenced</b> <b>test).</b> [...] "Ipsative Comparisons" [...] are also sometimes used in standardized testing to compare significant differences in subtest scores.|$|E

30|$|In {{the field}} of {{language}} testing, placement testing is a major issue (e.g., Bachman 1990; Brown 2005). In order for students to receive appropriate academic support and optimal levels of instruction, language programs have generally adopted <b>norm-referenced</b> <b>tests</b> to place students based on their language ability. As a result of successful placement, students are unlikely to experience academic boredom, frustration, and in the worst case, failure of the course. Thus, placement is a crucial element in most language programs.|$|R
