5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later visited with Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> formally taught by him.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search for novelty.|$|E
500|$|The decision, by Judge Paul Breckenridge, {{found that}} Armstrong's fears of {{persecution}} by the Church were reasonable, and thus his conduct in {{turning over the}} documents in his possession to his attorneys was also reasonable. The judge issued a wide-ranging verdict, commenting of Hubbard that [...] "the evidence portrays {{a man who has}} been virtually a pathological liar {{when it comes to his}} history, background and achievements." [...] A few weeks later, a British judge ruled in a case heard at the Royal Courts of Justice that Hubbard had made a number of [...] "false claims" [...] about his military career: [...] "That he was a much decorated war hero. He was not. That he commanded a corvette squadron. He did <b>not.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> awarded the Purple Heart, a gallantry decoration for those wounded in action. He was not wounded and was not decorated. That he was crippled and blinded in the war and cured himself with Dianetics techniques. He was not crippled and was not blinded." [...] The judge, Mr. Justice Latey, noted: [...] "There is no dispute about any of this. The evidence is unchallenged." ...|$|E

500|$|At 23:45, Farenholt and Laffey—still {{unaware of}} Gotō's {{approaching}} warships—increased speed to resume their stations {{at the front}} of the U.S. column. Duncans crew, however, thinking that Farenholt and Laffey were commencing an attack on the Japanese warships, increased speed to launch a solitary torpedo attack on Gotō's force without telling Scott what they were doing. San Franciscos radar registered the Japanese ships, but Scott was not informed of the sighting. By 23:45, Gotō's ships were only [...] away from Scott's formation and visible to Helenas and Salt Lake Citys lookouts. The U.S. formation at this point was in position to cross the T of the Japanese formation, giving Scott's ships a significant tactical advantage. At 23:46, still assuming that Scott was aware of the rapidly approaching Japanese warships, Helena radioed for permission to open fire, using the general procedure request, [...] "Interrogatory Roger" [...] (meaning, basically, [...] "Are we clear to act?"). [...] Scott answered with, [...] "Roger", only meaning that the message was received, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> confirming the request to act.

2500|$|Ambrose (ca. 340-400) took [...] "I am" [...] not {{as merely}} related to Abraham, but a {{statement}} including from before Adam. In his Exposition of the Christian Faith, Book III wrote: [...] "In its extent, the preposition “before” reaches {{back into the}} past without end or limit, and so “Before Abraham was, ” clearly need not mean “after Adam,” just as “before the Morning Star” need not mean “after the angels.” But when He said “before ,” He intended, <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> included in any one's existence, but that all things are included in His, for thus it is the custom of Holy Writ to show the eternity of God.|$|E

I spent all my time there – playing with a ball, wandering with my friends, sneaking into the ballerinas' trailers, acting scenes from films I'd just watched, so I often forgot to go home until late at night. The school was something in between, but never became a part of this triangle".|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards Gao {{became one}} of Emperor Xuanzong's closest confidants, and it was often Gao that Emperor Xuanzong sent to {{communicate}} his wishes with key officials. [...] For example, later in 713, when the chancellor Yao Chong was initially surprised and dismayed when Emperor Xuanzong refused to discuss the commissions of low-level officials with him, Gao spoke with Emperor Xuanzong {{and was told that}} the reason was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> displeased with Yao, but rather that these were decisions that Yao himself, as chancellor, had the authority to make. [...] After Gao informed Yao this, Yao's apprehensions were dissolved. [...] In 726, when Zhang Shuo was accused of corruption and arrested, it was Gao that Emperor Xuanzong sent to visit Zhang to see how he was doing, and it was at Gao's subsequent intercession that Zhang's punishment was reduced.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was another}} point on {{which there was}} no agreement. A large {{minority}} wished to retain episcopacy, and to keep the Book of Common Prayer [...] unaltered, whilst the majority were at least willing to consider the question of abolishing the one and modifying the other. On this subject the parties which ultimately divided the House and the country itself were fully formed as early as 8 February 1641. It is enough to say that Hampden fully shared in the counsels of the opponents of episcopacy. It is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a theoretical Presbyterian, but the bishops had been in his days so fully engaged in the imposition of ceremonies regarded by the Puritans as verging on Papacy that it was difficult, if not impossible, to dissociate them from the cause in which they were embarked. [...] Closely connected with Hampden's distrust of the bishops was his distrust of monarchy as it then existed. The dispute about the church therefore soon attained the form of an attack upon monarchy, and, when the majority of the House of Lords arrayed itself on the side of episcopacy and the Prayer Book, of an attack upon the House of Lords as well.|$|E

2500|$|As is {{traditionally}} depicted, the group wished {{to escape the}} intrigues, corruption and stifling atmosphere of court life during {{the tail end of}} the politically fraught Three Kingdoms period of Chinese history and into the early period of the newly established Jin dynasty. According to tradition, the members, Liu Ling (221 - 300), Ruan Ji (210–263), Ruan Xian (fl. 3rd century), Xiang Xiu, Wang Rong (234–305) and Shan Tao (205–283) gathered in a bamboo grove near the house of Xi Kang (aka Ji Kang) (223–262), in Shanyang (now in Henan province) where they enjoyed, and praised in their works, the simple, rustic life. Modern criticism suggests that these gatherings may have been to some extent virtual. Either way, this way of living was contrasted with the life of politics at court. The Seven Sages stressed the enjoyment of ale, personal freedom, spontaneity and a celebration of nature. The various 7 sages had their own specialties. However, they shared philosophical discussion, musical production, and drinking. Burton Watson considers Ruan Ji (whose name he transcribes as Juan Chi) to be the [...] "first important poet" [...] following the Jian'an poetry style. Ruan Ji helped to define the Six Dynasties poetic development of the themes of reclusion and friendship. He helped to develop the five-character shi poetry form which had just newly developed with the Jian'an poets, but he moved it away from its initial starkly realistic descriptions of particular scenes which could be right before the poets' eyes towards more generalized, abstract, and symbolic poetic statement. Ruan Ji also developed the nature theme, focusing on [...] "the passing of time and the cycle of the seasons", which lead towards the death of the individual. Ruan Ji was also used to deploy the imagery of birds as symbols of freedom and ability to escape their given situation. Burton Watson further notes the evident lack of the imagery of wine in Ruan's surviving poems. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unacquainted with it, even recorded as having remained continuously drunk for 2 months to avoid an undesirable marriage which was urged upon him with great political pressure such that he could not overtly refuse.|$|E
