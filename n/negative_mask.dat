40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel circuit fabrication process using UV laser direct-write lithography {{in combination with}} conventional mask photolithography to produce a dense, multilayer, resin-coated-foil (RCF) build-up substrate. Using this process, a multilayer HDI substrate was produced featuring an FR 4 layer with two RCF build-up layers. The top RCF circuit was patterned with a 10 x 10 array of pads at 250 micron pitch, fully connected through all layers of the substrate to a larger pitched periphery pad pattern, demonstrating a chip-scale package interconnect capability. The fine-line features of the top layer include 30 micron traces, which are patterned on conventional dry film negative photoresist using a tripled-YAG, UV laser drilling system (Electro Scientific Industries 5100) with highly attenuated output, after conventional mask exposure of larger trace features. This process allows fine-l ne features to be patterned in select areas of the HDI substrate, using the laser exposure process after conventional features are patterned using mask photolithography, significantly enhancing the ability to build dense multilayer circuits. An alternative approach, using the laser to subtractively ablate previously exposed photoresist, was also developed allowing a <b>negative</b> <b>mask</b> to produce traces as small as 10 microns. The demonstrated process is compatible with existing resist materials and circuit processing methods and adds only one process step of additional exposure or ablation of the resist.

However, application of these findings to irradiance detection in intact animals is problematical because retinal degeneration or manipulation can induce secondary changes in the retina. Among responses dependent on irradiance detection, the suppression of activity by light (<b>negative</b> <b>masking)</b> has had limited study. To further understand the function of classical and melanopsin photoreceptors we studied irradiance and spectral sensitivity of masking by light, primarily in mice with intact retinae. The sensitivity of <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> was equivalent for medium (approximately 500 nm) and short wavelengths (approximately 365 nm) in three strains of wild-type mice, identifying a marked short-wavelength-sensitive-cone input. At medium wavelengths, spectral sensitivity above 500 nm had closest fit to the nomogram for the medium-wavelength-sensitive-cone, but a combined input of cone and melanopsin photoreceptors in wild-type mice seems likely. Under white light a decompression of the irradiance range of masking in C 3 H rd/rd cl mice, lacking rods and cones, identified a functional deficiency presumably resulting from the absence of classical photoreceptor input. Together the evidence demonstrates a pronounced and sustained classical photoreceptor input to irradiance detection for <b>negative</b> <b>masking,</b> and suggests one role of classical photoreceptor input is to constrain dynamic range...|$|R

The photopigment melanopsin has recently been identified in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), and olivary pretectal nucleus, suggesting that melanopsin might influence a variety of irradiance-driven responses. We have found novel projections from RGCs that express melanopsin mRNA to the ventral subparaventricular zone (vSPZ), a region involved in circadian regulation and <b>negative</b> <b>masking,</b> and the sleep-active ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) and determined the subsets of melanopsin-expressing RGCs that project to the SCN, the pretectal area (PTA), and the IGL division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).

Two-thirds of RGCs containing melanopsin transcript projected to each of the SCN and contralateral PTA, and one-fifth projected to the ipsilateral IGL. Double-retrograde tracing from the SCN and PTA demonstrated a subpopulation of RGCs projecting to both sites, most of which contained melanopsin mRNA.

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} {{behavior}} and physiology, such as sleep and wakefulness, blood pressure, body temperature, and hormone secretion exhibit daily oscillations known as circadian rhythms. These circadian rhythms are orchestrated by an intrinsic biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus which is adjusted to the daily environmental cycles of day and night {{by the process of}} photoentrainment. In mammals, the neuronal signal for photoentrainment arises from a small subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that send a direct projection to the SCN. ipRGCs also mediate other non-image-forming (NIF) visual responses such as <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> of locomotor activity by light, and the pupillary light reflex (PLR) via co-release of neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) from their synaptic terminals. The relative contribution of each neurotransmitter system for the circadian photoentrainment and other NIF visual responses is still unresolved. We investigated the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission for circadian photoentrainment and NIF behaviors by selective ablation of ipRGC glutamatergic synaptic transmission in mice. Mutant mice displayed delayed re-entrainment to a 6 h phase shift (advance or delay) in the light cycle and incomplete photoentrainment in a symmetrical skeleton photoperiod regimen (1 h light pulses between 11 h dark periods). Circadian rhythmicity in constant darkness also was reduced in some mutant mice. Other NIF responses such as the PLR and <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> responses to light were also partially attenuated.

40|$|International audienceThe retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) is a retinofugal {{neuronal}} pathway which, in mammals, mediates nonimage-forming {{vision to}} various {{areas in the}} brain involved in circadian timing, masking behavior, and regulation of the pupillary light reflex. The RHT costores the two neurotransmitters glutamate and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP), which in a rather complex interplay are mediators of photic adjustment of the circadian system. To further characterize the role of PACAP/PACAP receptor type 1 (PAC 1) receptor signaling in light entrainment of the clock and in <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> behavior, we extended previous studies in mice lacking the PAC 1 receptor (PAC 1 KO) by examining their phase response to single light pulses using Aschoff type II regime, their ability to entrain to non- 24 -h light-dark (LD) cycles and large phase shifts of the LD cycle (jet lag), {{as well as their}} <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> response during different light intensities. A prominent finding in PAC 1 KO mice was a significantly decreased phase delay of the endogenous rhythm at early night. In accordance, PAC 1 KO mice had a reduced ability to entrain to T cycles longer than 26 h and needed more time to reentrain to large phase delays, which was prominent at low light intensities. The data obtained at late night indicated that PACAP/PAC 1 receptor signaling is less important during the phase-advancing part of the phase-response curve. Finally, the PAC 1 KO mice showed impaired <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> behavior at low light intensities. Our findings substantiate a role for PACAP/PAC 1 receptor signaling in nonimage-forming vision and indicate that the system is particularly important at lower light intensities...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMelanopsin (OPN 4) is a retinal {{photopigment}} that mediates a {{wide range}} of non-image-forming (NIF) responses to light [1, 2] including circadian entrainment [3], sleep induction [4], the pupillary light response (PLR) [5], and <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> of locomotor behavior (the acute suppression of activity in response to light) [6]. How these diverse NIF responses can all be mediated by a single photopigment has remained a mystery. We reasoned that the alternative splicing of melanopsin could provide the basis for functionally distinct photopigments arising from a single gene. The murine melanopsin gene is indeed alternatively spliced, producing two distinct isoforms, a short (OPN 4 S) and a long (OPN 4 L) isoform, which differ only in their C terminus tails [7]. Significantly, both isoforms form fully functional photopigments [7]. Here, we show that different isoforms of OPN 4 mediate different behavioral responses to light. By using RNAi-mediated silencing of each isoform in vivo, we demonstrated that the short isoform (OPN 4 S) mediates light-induced pupillary constriction, the long isoform (OPN 4 L) regulates <b>negative</b> <b>masking,</b> and both isoforms contribute to phase-shifting circadian rhythms of locomotor behavior and light-mediated sleep induction. These findings demonstrate that splice variants of a single receptor gene can regulate strikingly different behaviors...|$|R

Furthermore, light-induced <b>negative</b> <b>masking,</b> mediated by rods, cones and/or melanopsin cells, was missing in the mice lacking melanopsin cells. Therefore, Provencio suggested that cells containing melanopsin might be required to transmit rod and/or cone information for certain non-image forming visual responses.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{circadian}} {{clock is}} thought to adjust retinal sensitivity to ambient light levels, yet the involvement of specific clock genes is poorly understood. We explored the potential role of the nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (REV-ERB; or NR 1 D 1) in this respect. In light-evoked behavioral tests, compared with wild-type littermates, Rev-Erb(-/-) mice showed enhanced <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> at low light levels (0. 1 lx). Rev-Erb(-/-) mouse retinas displayed significantly higher numbers of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs; 62 % more compared with wild-type) and more intense melanopsin immunostaining of individual ipRGCs. In agreement with a pivotal role for melanopsin, <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> at low light intensities was abolished in Rev-Erb(-/-) Opn 4 (-/-) (melanopsin gene) double-null mice. Rev-Erb(-/-) mice showed shortened latencies of both a and b electroretinogram waves, modified scotopic and photopic b-wave and scotopic threshold responses, and increased pupillary constriction, all of which suggested increased light sensitivity. However, wild-type and Rev-Erb(-/-) mice displayed no detectable differences by in vivo fundus imaging, retinal histology, or expression of cell type-specific markers for major retinal cell populations. We conclude that REV-ERB {{plays a major role}} in retinal information processing, and we speculate that REV-ERB and melanopsin set sensitivity levels of the rod-mediated ipRGC pathway to coordinate activity with ambient light.

The intensity of illumination was 10 lux in L and 0. 25 lux in darkness (D). Under LD 4 : 20 and 12 : 12, the intensity of D was increased daily at the same zeitgeber time to 1 lux for 1 hr (L pulse) during about 8 consecutive days. This sequence was followed by 8 days without L pulses before giving another series of L pulses at a different zeitgeber time. Under LD 20 : 4, the intensity of L was decreased to 1 lux for 1 hr (D pulse). The activity of all birds was more or less increased by the L pulses (positive masking) and decreased by the D pulses (<b>negative</b> <b>masking).</b> The level of masking activity during the L and D pulses depended on the circadian phase at which the pulses were administered.

40|$|Non-image related {{responses}} to light, {{such as the}} synchronization of circadian rhythms to the day/night cycle, are mediated by classical rod/cone photoreceptors and by a small subset of retinal ganglion cells that are intrinsically photosensitive, expressing the photopigment, melanopsin. This {{raises the possibility that}} the melanopsin cells may be serving as a conduit for photic information detected by the rods and/or cones. To test this idea, we developed a specific immunotoxin consisting of an anti-melanopsin antibody conjugated to the ribosome-inactivating protein, saporin. Intravitreal injection of this immunotoxin results in targeted destruction of melanopsin cells. We find that the specific loss of these cells in the adult mouse retina alters the effects of light on circadian rhythms. In particular, the photosensitivity of the circadian system is significantly attenuated.

The location of food-entrainable oscillators (FEOs) necessary for FAA remains uncertain. The most common procedure for inducing circadian FAA is to limit food {{access to a}} few hours {{in the middle of the}} light period, when activity levels are normally low. Although light at night suppresses activity (<b>negative</b> <b>masking)</b> in nocturnal rodents, it does not prevent the expression of daytime FAA. Nonetheless, light could reduce the duration or magnitude of FAA.

To assess the plausibility of light as a potential mediating variable in studies of FAA mechanisms, we quantified FAA in rats and mice alternately maintained in a standard full photoperiod (12 h of light/day) and in a skeleton photoperiod (two 60 min light pulses simulating dawn and dusk). In both species, FAA was significantly and reversibly enhanced in the skeleton photoperiod compared to the full photoperiod.

40|$|Flies of {{the genus}} Arachnocampa are sit-and-lure predators that use {{bioluminescence}} to attract flying prey to their silk webs. Some species are most common in rainforest habitat and others inhabit both caves and rainforest. We have studied the circadian regulation of bioluminescence in two species: one found in subtropical rainforest with no known cave populations and the other found in temperate rainforest with large populations in limestone caves. The rainforest species is typical of most nocturnal animals in that individuals are entrained by the light:dark (LD) cycle to be active at night; in this case, their propensity to bioluminesce is greatest at night. The dual-habitat species shows an opposite phase response to the same entrainment; its bioluminescence propensity rhythm is entrained by LD exposure to peak during the day. Nevertheless, in LD environments, individuals do not bioluminesce during the day because ambient light inhibits their bioluminescence (<b>negative</b> <b>masking),</b> pushing bioluminescence into the dark period. This unusual and unexpected phenomenon {{could be related to}} their association with caves and has been suggested to be an adaptation of the circadian system that promotes synchronization of a colony 2 ̆ 7 s output of bioluminescence. Here, we use controlled laboratory experiments to show that individuals do synchronize their bioluminescence rhythms when in visual contact with each other. Entrainment of the bioluminescence rhythm to the biological photophase causes colony-wide synchronization, creating a daily sinusoidal rhythm of the intensity of bioluminescence in the many thousands of individuals making up a colony.

40|$|Arachnocampa species, {{commonly}} called glowworms, are flies whose larvae use light to attract prey. Here we compare rhythmicity {{in two of}} the nine described species: the Tasmanian species, Arachnocampa tasmaniensis, which inhabits caves and wet forest, and the eastern Australian mainland species, A. flava, primarily found in subtropical rainforest. Both species show the same nocturnal glowing pattern in external (epigean) environments and the same inhibition of bioluminescence by light and both species show circadian regulation of bioluminescence. We find that the underlying circadian bioluminescence propensity rhythm (BPR) of the two species peaks at opposite phases of the day: night cycle. Larvae of A. flava, placed in constant darkness in the laboratory, bioluminesce during the subjective scotophase, typical of nocturnal animals, whereas A. tasmaniensis shows the opposite tendency, bioluminescing most intensely during the subjective photophase. In A. tasmaniensis, which are exposed to natural day: night cycles, light exposure during the day overrides the high bioluminescence propensity through <b>negative</b> <b>masking</b> and leads to a release of bioluminescence after dusk when the BPR is on the wane. A consequence is that A. tasmaniensis is able to start glowing at any phase of the light: dark cycle as soon as masking by light is released, whereas A. flava is locked into nocturnal bioluminescence. We suggest that the paradoxical BPR of A. tasmaniensis is an adaptation for living in the cave environment. Observations of bioluminescence in colonies of A. tasmaniensis located in the transition from a cave mouth to the dark zone show that glowing is inhibited by light exposure but a peak bioluminescence follows immediately after "dusk" at their location. The substantial difference in the circadian regulation of bioluminescence between the two species probably reflects adaptation to the cave (hypogean) habitat in A. tasmaniensis and the forest (epigean) habitat in A. flava.

40|$|Light {{signals from}} {{intrinsically}} photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) entrain the circadian clock and regulate <b>negative</b> <b>masking.</b> Two neurotransmitters, glutamate and Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Polypeptide (PACAP), {{found in the}} ipRGCs transmit light signals to the brain via glutamate receptors and the specific PACAP type 1 (PAC 1) receptor. Light entrainment occurs during the twilight zones and has little effect on clock phase during daytime. When nocturnal animals have access to food {{only for a few}} hours during the resting phase at daytime, they adapt behavior to the restricted feeding (RF) paradigm and show food anticipatory activity (FAA). A recent study in mice and rats demonstrating that light regulates FAA prompted us to investigate the role of PACAP/PAC 1 signaling in the light mediated regulation of FAA. PAC 1 receptor knock out (PAC 1 -/-) and wild type (PAC 1 +/+) mice placed in running wheels were examined in a full photoperiod (FPP) of 12 : 12 h light/dark (LD) and a skeleton photoperiod (SPP) 1 : 11 : 1 : 11 h L:DD:L:DD at 300 and 10 lux light intensity. Both PAC 1 -/- mice and PAC 1 +/+ littermates entrained to FPP and SPP at both light intensities. However, when placed in RF with access to food for 4 - 5 h during the subjective day, a significant change in behavior was observed in PAC 1 -/- mice compared to PAC 1 +/+ mice. While PAC 1 -/- mice showed similar FAA as PAC 1 +/+ animals in FPP at 300 lux, PAC 1 -/- mice demonstrated an advanced onset of FAA with a nearly 3 -fold increase in amplitude compared to PAC 1 +/+ mice when placed in SPP at 300 lux. The same pattern of FAA was observed at 10 lux during both FPP and SPP. The present study indicates a role of PACAP/PAC 1 signaling during light regulated FAA. Most likely, PACAP found in ipRGCs mediating non-image forming light information to the brain is involved...|$|R

The workers used different models: part of respirators had forced supply of {{air from the}} cleaning unit, and a part was the usual <b>negative</b> pressure half <b>masks.</b> The results showed that if the workers use respirators intermittently, their efficiency are low, and significantly lower than expected: In the first type respirators 85-91% values of protection factors were lower than expected Assigned PF = 50; and {{the second type of}} RPE provide protection factor in 82-89% of cases lower than the expected APF = 10.|$|R
40|$|Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy (ADOA) is a {{progressive}} optic neuropathy affecting mainly the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It {{is associated with}} mutations in the Opa 1 gene and is phenotypically characterized by decreased visual acuity, central field deficits and colour vision defects. Experimental work on Opa 1 mutant mice (B 6; C 3 -Opa 1 Q 285 STOP) has permitted further characterisation of the pathophysiology of the disease. A specific functional visual deficit in the photopic negative response of the electroretinogram has been described in these mice, possibly due to altered dendritic pruning of RGCs. However, non-image-forming (NIF) visual function, which is regulated by a subset of RGCs that express the photopigment melanopsin, {{has not yet been}} extensively investigated in Opa 1 mutant mice. We were interested in whether RGC dysfunction in Opa 1 mutants affects NIF behaviours. We evaluated circadian behaviour, sleep behaviour and melanopsin expression in Opa 1 mutant mice (Opa 1 +/-) and littermate controls (Opa 1 +/+). Opa 1 mutant mice were able to entrain their behaviour rhythm to a normal 12 : 12 hr light/dark cycle, confining their activity to the dark phase. The suppression of activity by acute light exposure at night (<b>negative</b> <b>masking)</b> was equivalent between genotypes. Circadian phase shift responses to 480 nm or 520 nm light pulses during the subjective night were preserved in Opa 1 +/- mice relative to wildtype controls. The acute induction of sleep by light exposure at night was also present in Opa 1 +/- mice and not significantly different to Opa 1 +/+ animals. Immunohistochemical characterisation of melanopsin cells in flatmount retinae revealed no significant differences in cell numbers betweeen genotypes. Melanopsin (Opn 4) transcript levels were also equivalent between Opa 1 wildtype and mutant mice. There was also no obvious difference in melanopsin cell stratification patterns. The data overwhelmingly support the preservation of the NIF visual system in Opa 1 mutant mice. The findings are consistent with patient studies suggesting increased resistance of melanopsin-expressing RGCs in conditions of mitochondrial optic atrophy. Further work is needed to extend our understanding of the possible neuroprotective mechanism involved which could lead to exciting therapeutic strategies.
