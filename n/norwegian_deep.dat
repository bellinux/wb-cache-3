40|$|Copepoda (Calanus finmarchicus n= 1, 722, Paraeuchaeta norvegica n= 1, 955), Hyperiidae (n= 3, 019), Euphausiacea (Meganyctiphanes norvegica n= 4, 780), and the fishes Maurolicus muelleri (n= 500) and Pollachius virens (n= 33) were {{collected}} in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep</b> (northern North Sea) during summer 2001 to examine the importance of pelagic invertebrates and vertebrates as hosts of Anisakis simplex and their roles in the transfer of this nematode to its final hosts (Cetaceans). Third stage larvae (L 3) of A. simplex were found in P. norvegica, M. muelleri and P. virens. The prevalence of A. simplex in dissected P. norvegica was 0. 26 %, with an intensity of 1. Prevalences in M. muelleri and P. virens were 49. 6 % and 100. 0 %, with mean intensities of 1. 1 – 2. 6 (total fish length ≥ 6. 0 – 7. 2) and 193. 6, respectively. All specimens of C. finmarchicus and M. norvegica examined were free of anisakid nematode species and no other parasites were detected. P. norvegica, which harboured the third stage larvae, is the obligatory first intermediate host of A. simplex in the investigated area. Though there was no apparent development of larvae in M. muelleri, this fish {{can be considered as}} the obligatory second intermediate host of A. simplex in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep.</b> However, {{it is unlikely that the}} larva from P. norvegica can be successfully transmitted into the cetacean or pinniped final hosts, where they reach the adult stage. An additional growth phase and a second intermediate host is the next phase in the life cycle. Larger predators such as P. virens serve as paratenic hosts, accumulating the already infective stage from M. muelleri. The oceanic life cycle of A. simplex in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep</b> is very different in terms of hosts and proposed life cycle patterns of A. simplex from other regions, involving only a few intermediate hosts. In contrast to earlier suggestions, euphausiids have no importance at all for the successful transmission of A. simplex in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep.</b> This demonstrates that this nematode is able to select definite host species depending on the locality, apparently having a very low level of host specificity. This could explain the wide range of different hosts that have been recorded for this species, and can be seen as the reason for the success of this parasite in reaching its marine mammal final hosts in an oceanic environment...|$|E

40|$|Samples from {{commercial}} trawl landings for reductional purposes {{show that the}} Norwegian catches recorded as Norway pout in the fishery statistics consist of 50 — 70 prosent blue whiting during the autumn and 30 — 60 prosent during late spring and summer. The contribution is somewhat lower in the winter. Blue whiting of the 0 -group enters the fishery in the autumn, and this yearclass dominates the catches then and throughout winter and spring. The catches in the summer consist of older, spent fish. Material collected during 9 research vessel surveys support this pattern. The 0 -group fish entering {{the area in the}} autumn seem all the years, apart from the 1969 yearclass, to have left the area as I-group fish the succeding summer. Hydrographic observations made during the cruises indicate that the young fish and the older fish inhabit different water and depth regimes. The 0 -group seems in the autumn to be confined to the incoming Atlantic water along the shelfedge of the North Sea Plateau towards the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep.</b> The older fish are found somewhat deeper in the colder, deep water of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep.</b> The older fish can accordingly be distributed in a wider volume of water. Furthermore, a more pelagic occurrence then the younger fish makes them less available to bottom trawl, and it is suggested that the resources of older fish in the North Sea are greater than the catches indicate. Echo integrator recordings made during the surveys indicate that the 1969 yearclass was stronger represented in the North Sea than the 1970 and 1971 yearclasses. Similarly the 1972 yearclass seems to have been stronger in the North Sea than the 1971 and 1973 yearclasses. No spawning is recorded neither in the Norwegian Sea nor in the North Sea, and it is concluded that the immigration of 0 -group fish in the autumn and of older, spent fish in the late spring and summer originates from the spawning areas west of the British Isles. Apart from yearclass strength, it is suggested that the amount of 0 -group fish entering the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deep</b> each autumn is strongly influenced by the influx of Atlantic water at that time. It is further suggested that the current pattern might also influence the immigration of old fish after the spawning...|$|E

A total of 40 species and generic groupings was determined in this study. Three stratigraphically meaningful assemblages are recognized in Hole 985 A: a basal assemblage with coarsely agglutinated forms (Cores 162 - 985 A- 62 X through 50 X), a Spirosigmoilinella compressa assemblage (Cores 162 - 985 A- 49 X through 40 X), and a sparse assemblage with pyritized radiolarians in the uppermost part of the studied interval (Cores 162 - 985 A- 39 X through 32 X). The whole succession {{from the base of}} Hole 985 A to Core 162 - 985 A- 32 X is here assigned to the Dorothia siegliei-Rotaliatina bulimoides Zone of Oligocene age. The stratigraphic ranges of several species extended into younger strata compared with biostratigraphic records from the Vøring Slope (ODP Hole 643 A) and from an exploration well on the Vøring Plateau. Taxonomic differences between the foraminiferal records of the Norwegian Sea and the deep Labrador Sea provide evidence for faunal isolation of the <b>deep</b> <b>Norwegian</b> basin during the Oligocene.

The euphausiid Meganyctiphanes norvegica and the teleost Maurolicus muelleri were the principal prey organisms. With increasing total length of E. spinax, the frequency of Meganyctiphanes norvegica prey decreased and that of M. muelleri increased. Seven different metazoan parasite species were found: adult Monogenea (2), larval and adult Cestoda (3), and larval Nematoda (2). The predominant parasites were an unidentified monocotylid monogenean and the cestode Aporhynchus norvegicus, with respective prevalences of infestation of 83. 8 % and 81. 1 %. The sites of infestation were the gills (Squalonchocotyle spinacis, Monogenea), nasal cavities (Monocotylidae indet.), body cavity (Lacistorhynchus tenuis, Cestoda), stomach wall and organs of the body cavity (Anisakis simplex, Nematoda), and stomach and spiral valve (A. norvegicus and Pseudophyllidea indet., Cestoda; Hysterothylacium aduncum, Nematoda). No other metazoan parasite taxa were found, and the musculature was free of parasites. Five new host and three new locality records were established. M. muelleri seems to be an important intermediate host for the endoparasitic nematodes which were found, with E. spinax serving as a paratenic host. E. spinax also serves as an intermediate host for the trypanorhynch cestode L. tenuis, and as the definitive host for the two monogeneans and the trypanorhynch A. norvegicus.

40|$|Assessing the {{relative}} contribution of local diversity to regional biodiversity {{may be the}} key to understanding large-scale and even global patterns in species diversity. Here, the contribution of habitat heterogeneity of cold seeps at three spatial scales [micro-scale (ms), macro-scale (10 to 100 s of ms), and mega-scale (10 to 100 s of km) ] to the total nematode biodiversity (genus level) along the Norwegian continental margin is evaluated. Due to the development of higher resolution bathymetry and increased bottom sampling in recent years, continental margins, once regarded as monotonous landscapes, are now acknowledged to have a high degree of habitat complexity and diversity. By calculating the additive partitioning of gamma diversity in alpha and beta fractions, we examined to what extent habitat diversity of seep sites significantly increases the nematode genus composition and diversity at different spatial scales. Siboglinidae patches and control sediments yielded comparably high levels of nematode genus richness. They exhibited low turnover rates within and across the different seep sites. In contrast, the bacterial mats at Hakon Mosby Mud Volcano (HMMV) and the reduced sediments at the Nyegga pockmarks harboured genus-poor nematode communities with an equally high dominance of one or two species, which were different for each seep. Different habitats, in particular at the HMMV, contributed significantly to the seep nematode richness.

Nematodes were the dominant group in virtually all stations, their densities ranging from 61 to 4167 individuals. 10 cm - 2. Only in the Southern Bight, where nematode numbers were low, did harpacticoids sometimes represent the dominant meiobenthic taxon. There was a tendency for nematode (and total meiobenthos) density to increase towards the north. A total of 278 copepod species belonging to 105 genera and 22 families were identified. Over 40 % of the species were new to science; new taxa were found particularly among the interstitial families which were most important in terms of species diversity. Copepod density decreased rapidly to the north and this trend was followed by diversity. Individual ash-free dry weight (AFDW) was determined for 98 species of copepod. Total biomass reached a peak in the south (low mean individual AFDW, high density) and in the north (high mean individual AFDW, low density), but was low in the Central North Sea where the copepod communities were impoverished both qualitatively and quantitatively. Using the classification technique TWINSPAN (two-way indicator species analysis), it was impossible to define meaningful clusters (TWIN groups) {{on the basis of the}} l 8 major meiobenthic taxa. However, seven distinct communities could be recognized on the basis of the copepod composition: (I) TWIN A largely coincided with the Southern Bight and showed high densities of predominantly interstitial species (Cylindropsyllidae, Paramesochridae, Cyclopinidae) and a few characteristic taxa from coarse sediments; (2) TWIN B was found in the coastal zone of the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and in the Dogger Bank, and was dominated by large Ectinosomatidae and Ameiridae, and by interstitial Leptastacidae; (3) TWIN C represented an impoverished community north of the Dogger Bank and consisted of large mud-dwelling species belonging to the Diosaccidae, Laophontidae and Ameiridae; (4) between the Scottish coast and <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deeps</b> and in the Silver Pits Zosimidae, Cletodidae and Idyanthidae were the most important families (TWIN D); (5) TWIN E grouped the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Deeps,</b> Devirs Hole and Farne Deep and showed a typical deepwater fauna represented by Ancorabolidae, Cerviniidae, Stenocopiinae and bathyal cletodid genera. Two minor clusters (a, 13) coincided with the Dutch Wadden Sea (1 station) and the river outlets (Thames, Wash, Meuse/Scheldt) whose meiobenthos is subject to pollutants.

We consider these changes in near-bottom flow vigor and benthic foraminiferal isotope records to mark a significant reorganization of the Holocene deep ocean circulation, and attribute the changes to a weakening of NEADW flow during the mid to late Holocene that allowed the shoaling of Lower Deep Water and deeper eastward advection of Labrador Sea Water into the northeast Atlantic Basin. copyright 2011 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} {{recently}} acquired {{data from the}} Rockall Trough and from areas of eastern Atlantic immediately to the south shows that two southern sources of bottom water have a major present-day influence over the southern Feni Ridge. One source results from detachment and southward recirculation of water from a slope current, flowing north-ward along the west European continental margin. A second is the northward drift which occupies the deep layer of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Transport estimates on the overflow of <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>Deep</b> Water (NSDW) into the Rockall Trough suggest that NSDW probably had a lesser influence on the shaping of the Feni Ridge sediment drift, if its mod-ern pattern and behavior pertained through the late Neogene and Quaternary. Analysis of the variability in current strength and direction over the flanks of Feni Drift show that the fine-grained, cohesive sediments which make up the sediment waves at DSDP Site 610 could locally be eroded and transported {{over much of the}} year...|$|R

40|$|Water mass {{analysis}} {{reveals a}} persistent core of deep overflow water within the Rockall Trough which hugs {{the northern and}} western boundaries of the basin. Mean speeds within this overflow are 10 – 15 cm s− 1 giving a transport time from the Wyville Thomson Ridge to the central basin of < 50 days. Analysis of the 40 -year Extended Ellett Line record shows proportions of <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>Deep</b> Water associated with the deep core exceed 15 % around {{one quarter of the}} time. We present the first transport estimates for overflow water in the Rockall Trough. This flux is for overflow water modified by mixing with a density greater than 27. 65 kg m− 3. Mean values calculated both from a newly deployed mooring array (OSNAP project) and indirectly from the Extended Ellett Line time-series are − 0. 3 ± 0. 04 Sv. Although the flux is highly variable there is no long term trend. As some overflow appears to exit into the Iceland Basin via channels between the northern banks, we suggest that the volume transport will likely increase as the flow pathway is traced back around the boundary of the Rockall Trough towards the Wyville Thomson Ridge...|$|R
40|$|The {{chronology}} of marine sediment cores from high resolution basins on the North Icelandic shelf {{is based on}} combined tephrochronology and AMS 14 C datings. Reliably dated tephra markers provide age control for archives of Holocene palaeoceanographic changes {{in the vicinity of}} the oceanographic Polar Front. The present position of the Polar Front separates Arctic surface water of the East Greenland and the East Icelandic currents (Polar Water) from branches of the North Atlantic Current, the Irminger Current (Atlantic Water) to the west and north of Iceland. The area is also within the realm of the Arctic Front that delineates the maximum extent of the winter sea ice, which periodically extends from Greenland to Iceland. The <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>Deep</b> Water replaces the surface and intermediate water masses at a depth of 300 - 400 m off North Iceland. The modern salinity and temperature data from the area show that the deep water masses may be expected to encroach into topographic lows and basins on the shelf during periods of active deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Another climatic boundary is represented by the North Atlantic Atmospheric low-depression track and the accompanying westerlies across Iceland. The strong gradients both in the ocean and in the atmosphere make this region extremely sensitive to climatic changes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince 1985 various {{investigators}} {{have proposed that}} <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>deep</b> water (NSDW) is formed by mixing of warm and saline deep water from the Arctic Ocean with the much colder and fresher deep water formed by convection in the Greenland Sea (GSDW). We here report on new observations which suggest significant modification and expansion of this conceptual model. We find that saline outflows from the Arctic Ocean result in several distinct intermediate and deep salinity maxima within the Greenland Sea; the southward transport {{of the two most}} saline modes is probably near 2 Sv. Mixing of GSDW and the main outflow core found over the Greenland slope, derived from about 1700 m in the Arctic Ocean, cannot by itself account for the properties of NSDW. Instead, the formation of NSDW must at least in part involve a source which in the Arctic Ocean is found below 2000 m. The mixing of various saline outflows is diapycnal. While significant NSDW production appears to occur in northern Fram Strait, large amounts of saline Arctic Ocean outflow also traverse the western Greenland Sea without mixing and enter the Iceland Sea. During the past decade, deep convection in the Greenland Sea has been greatly reduced, while deep outflow from the Arctic Ocean appears to have continued, resulting in a markedly warmer, slightly more saline, and less dense deep regime in the Greenland sea. © American Geophysical Union 199...|$|R
50|$|The weak deep-water {{exchange}} with the Atlantic Ocean {{is due to}} the small depth of the relatively flat Greenland-Scotland Ridge between Scotland and Greenland, an offshoot of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only four areas of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge are deeper than 500 metres: the Faroe Bank Channel (about 850 metres), some parts of the Iceland-Faroe Ridge (about 600 metres), the Wyville-Thomson Ridge (620 metres), and areas between Greenland and the Denmark Strait (850 meters) - this is much shallower than the <b>Norwegian</b> Sea. Cold <b>deep</b> water flows into the Atlantic through various channels: about 1.9 Sv through the Faroe Bank channel, 1.1 Sv through the Iceland-Faroe channel, and 0.1 Sv via the Wyville-Thomson Ridge. The turbulence that occurs when the deep water falls behind the Greenland-Scotland Ridge into the deep Atlantic basin mixes the adjacent water layers and forms the North Atlantic Deep Water, one of two major deep-sea currents providing the deep ocean with oxygen.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) is an {{important}} conduit for the poleward flow of Atlantic water towards the Nordic Seas and, as such, it plays an integral part in the Atlantic's thermohaline circulation. Mixing processes in the FSC are thought to result in an exchange of properties between the channel's inflow and outflow, with wider implications for this circulation; {{the nature of this}} mixing in the FSC is, however, uncertain. To constrain this uncertainty, we used a novel empirical method known as Parametric Optimum Multi-Parameter (POMP) analysis to objectively quantify the distribution of water masses in the channel in May 2013. This was achieved by using a combination of temperature and salinity measurements, as well as recently available nutrient and δ 18 O measurements. The outcomes of POMP analysis are in good agreement with established literature and demonstrate the benefits of representing all five water masses in the FSC. In particular, our results show the recirculation of Modified North Atlantic Water in the surface layers, and the pathways of Norwegian Sea Arctic Intermediate Water and <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>Deep</b> Water from north to south for the first time. In a final step, we apply the mixing fractions from POMP analysis to decompose the volume transport through the FSC by water mass. Despite a number of caveats, our study suggests that improved estimates of the volume transport of Atlantic inflow towards the Arctic and, thus, the associated poleward fluxes of salt and heat are possible. A new prospect to more accurately monitor the strength of the FSC branch of the thermohaline circulation emerges from this study...|$|R

During Sep 1989 the USNS BARTLETT occupied a dense array of 48 high- quality CTD {{stations in the}} Greenland Basin to characterize the Jan Mayen Current (JMC) system {{as part of the}} Greenland Current (EGC) waters {{in the form of a}} surface Polar Water (PW) tongue, a near-surface (approx 50 m) core of modified PW, and an intermediate (approx 100 m) core of Atlantic Water displaced approx 75 km northward of the PW core. In contrast, the Greenland Sea Gyre is very weakly stratified aside from a thin surface gradient. Historical data demonstrate the JMC axis to move approx 100 km north and south of its 1989 observed position near 74 deg and show that upper water column temperatures and salinities were significantly lower in 1989 and 1982 than in 1958. The dynamic height pattern (0 - 1000 dbar) supplemented with Lagrangian ice drift rates reveal the JMC as partly an anticyclonic meander in the EGC; drifters indicate a significant barotropic component. Baroclinic transport estimates yield a 2 Sv initial eastward transport by the JMC. This transport results in an annual freshwater excess of 1. 4 m over the survey area which equates to roughly 14 of the annually available fresh water in the EGC. Deep water analyses show that isopycnal mixing of Eurasian Basin Deep Water and Greenland Sea Deep Water to yield <b>Norwegian</b> Sea <b>Deep</b> Water occurs within the Greenland Basin.
