2500|$|With ancestral {{roots in}} {{industrial}} microbiology that date back centuries, the <b>new</b> <b>biotechnology</b> industry grew rapidly {{beginning in the}} mid-1970s. Each new scientific advance became a media event designed to capture investment confidence and public support. [...] Although market expectations and social benefits of new products were frequently overstated, many people were prepared to see genetic engineering as the next great advance in technological progress. By the 1980s, biotechnology characterized a nascent real industry, providing titles for emerging trade {{organizations such as the}} Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO).|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} {{biotechnology}} culminated {{with the birth}} of genetic engineering. There were two key events that have come to be seen as scientific breakthroughs beginning the era that would unite genetics with biotechnology. One was the 1953 discovery of the structure of DNA, by Watson and Crick, and the other was the 1973 discovery by Cohen and Boyer of a recombinant DNA technique by which a section of DNA was cut from the plasmid of an E. coli bacterium and transferred into the DNA of another. This approach could, in principle, enable bacteria to adopt the genes and produce proteins of other organisms, including humans. Popularly referred to as [...] "genetic engineering," [...] it came to be defined as the basis of <b>new</b> <b>biotechnology.</b>|$|E

2500|$|One other {{use that}} is being {{discussed}} {{is the use of}} social networks in the science communities. Julia Porter Liebeskind et al. have published a study on how <b>new</b> <b>biotechnology</b> firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledge. They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another, they are able to [...] "increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization". Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas, and without these new means of communicating their theories might become [...] "isolated and irrelevant". Researchers use social networks frequently to maintain and develop professional relationships. They are interested in consolidating social ties and professional contact, keeping in touch with friends and colleagues and seeing what their own contacts are doing. This can be related to their need to keep updated on the activities and events of their friends and colleagues in order to establish collaborations on common fields of interest and knowledge sharing.|$|E
2500|$|Atypical as Lederberg was at Asilomar, his optimistic {{vision of}} genetic {{engineering}} would soon {{lead to the development}} of the biotechnology industry. Over the next two years, as public concern over the dangers of recombinant DNA research grew, so too did interest in its technical and practical applications. Curing genetic diseases remained in the realms of science fiction, but it appeared that producing human simple proteins could be good business. Insulin, one of the smaller, [...] best characterized and understood proteins, had been used in treating type 1 diabetes for a half century. It had been extracted from animals in a chemically slightly different form from the human product. Yet, if one could produce synthetic human insulin, one could meet an existing demand with a product whose approval would be relatively easy to obtain from regulators. In the period 1975 to 1977, synthetic [...] "human" [...] insulin represented the aspirations for new products that could be made with the <b>new</b> <b>biotechnology.</b> Microbial production of synthetic human insulin was finally announced in September 1978 and was produced by a startup company, Genentech. Although that company did not commercialize the product themselves, instead, it licensed the production method to Eli Lilly and Company. [...] 1978 also saw the first application for a patent on a gene, the gene which produces human growth hormone, by the University of California, thus introducing the legal principle that genes could be patented. Since that filing, almost 20% of the more than 20,000 genes in the human DNA have been patented.|$|E
