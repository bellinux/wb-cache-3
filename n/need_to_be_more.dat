5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of head injuries in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce head injuries by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of head injuries. Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives made a {{detailed}} and revised plan on April 25, 2007, after leaks {{of a speech}} {{which was supposed to}} be made by John Baird on April 26 were discovered after some Liberal MPs received a fax of the speech. The new plan seeks to stop the increase of greenhouse gas emissions before 2012 and reduce the amount as much as 20% by 2020. Targets would be imposed to industries before 2015, while home appliances would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> energy efficient. There were also rewards for companies that reduced the amount of emissions since 2006. On the next day, Baird announced additional measures including one that would force industries to reduce greenhouse emissions by 18 percent by 2010 while auto industries would have a mandatory fuel-efficient standard by 2011. Later in 2007, Baird revealed other plans and deadlines that industries must meet. The plan mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 and will have to report data on their emissions on every May 31.|$|E

A local business owner expressed support of non-violent demonstrations and told The Cavalier Daily that [...] "The only way thing change is if you talk about what's happening." [...] The march ended outside of the Phi Kappa Psi house where protesters challenged a perceived [...] "culture of sexual assault at the University". Community members offered suggestions for immediate steps administration could take to implement preventative measures and address safety concerns regarding sexual assault. One student protestor told The Cavalier Daily: [...] "I really hope the University takes this article and the protest movement as a sign that they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> transparent about the way they deal with sexual assault."

[...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs {{to do a better job}} of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study in the context of a zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E

However, the largest bodied race of barn owl, T. a. furcata from Cuba and Jamaica, is also an island race, albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources. The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from typical owls when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating flight pattern and the dangling, feathered legs. The pale face with its heart shape and black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, like a flat mask with oversized, oblique black eye-slits, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat resembling a nose.|$|E
