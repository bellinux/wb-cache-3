5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
25|$|Within {{minutes of}} Duggan's second {{telephone}} call to her, his mother contacted the British emergency services and was advised {{to call her}} local police station in Colindale, Barnet. She told them she believed her son was in danger. They transferred her to the London Metropolitan Police at Scotland Yard, but when she explained he had become involved with Nouvelle Solidarité they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant.|$|E
2500|$|Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes: Maddie Hayes is a chic {{and smart}} former high-fashion model. Left {{bankrupt}} when her accountant embezzles {{all of her}} money, she is forced {{to make a living}} by running the detective agency she had previously owned as a tax write-off. Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Cybill Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do and, during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a “Hawksian” comedy. [...] The two had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about, so she suggested they screen Twentieth Century, Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. [...] A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched Bringing Up Baby and His Girl Friday.|$|E
50|$|The Pose tune {{continues}} to play in her head and she {{continues to}} needle her husband Ridge about their risque rendezvous which he is totally dumbfounded by. After realizing he really has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> talking about she finally confronts Oliver.|$|R
5000|$|Web Extra: Road Signs: As {{is often}} {{done on the}} show, each of the drivers was given a brief test by Tim on their road sign awareness. Siham and Tyler post the joint-highest scores, while Chanie posts the worst score, getting just 3 out of 10; and {{although}} she correctly identifies a [...] "yield" [...] sign, Chanie admits to having <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> actually supposed to do when she sees one when she's driving.|$|R
50|$|Helen begs Martha to {{hand her}} the baby, but Martha ignores her, telling the baby she is his mother. Martha tries to inject {{morphine}} in Helen's arm, but Helen knocks the syringe away. When Martha retrieves it, she hears Jackson's footsteps. In a scramble, she quickly cleans up, meeting Jackson at the door. She {{tells him to}} leave Helen alone, as he has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> been through. The two leave Helen asleep, with Martha giving the baby to Jackson.|$|R
2500|$|Greenlee discovers Ryan's ex-girlfriend, Madison North, is {{pregnant}} with Ryan's child by {{breaking into a}} hospital computer with David's hospital card. She confronts Madison who tells Greenlee she has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants to do yet. Greenlee is haunted by this and soon starts to daydream about Ryan and Madison and their baby. While Greenlee is walking, she discovers Madison passed out in the snow. Greenlee gets Madison {{to the hospital and}} both Madison and Greenlee learn the baby is okay. Greenlee offers to help Madison start over in New York. Madison happily accepts and thanks Greenlee for saving her and the baby. Soon after, Madison tells Greenlee that she is no longer moving to New York and claiming that Pine Valley is her home. Greenlee worries and tries to set up Dr. Griffin Castillo with Madison. Griffin turns Greenlee down. Greenlee continues to worry about Madison and the baby. After learning that Madison had run into Scott Chandler at prison, Greenlee visits Scott. She makes him an offer; she will give him a job as co-owner of Pine Valley Hospital if he befriends Madison.

Scott starts to befriend Madison, [...] promising his [...] "father" [...] that he will not hurt Madison.|$|E

50|$|Joy {{gets the}} {{promotion}} she'd been working for, but tells her boss {{she would rather}} be happy doing nothing than doing something she hates and being miserable. Jack talks to his parents and they tell him {{it looks like he}} and Joy are in love. Realizing his mistake, he goes to find her. Tipper tells Jack that she quit her job and that nobody knows where she is. He has a suspicion that she has gone to a beach (Fire Island, New York) that she told him about, the only place that makes her feel truly happy. Jack asks her to be his wife (again) and she says yes. As the two embrace, Joy says that she quit her job and has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> going to do. Jack reminds her that {{they have a lot of}} money between them. Joy states that they hit the jackpot, to which Jack replies that he certainly did (referring to both the money and to Joy).|$|R
60|$|When {{the boat}} carried Dot and Tot beyond the rocky arch {{that led to}} the Fourth and most {{important}} Valley of Merry-land, the children held their breaths in suspense; for here lived the Queen of all this wonderful country, and they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was like.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Silverman, {{you have}} <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is. She is,' said my lady, laying her touch upon my coat-sleeve, 'I do verily believe, the most {{extraordinary}} girl in this world. Already knows more Greek and Latin than Lady Jane Grey. And taught herself! Has not yet, remember, derived a moment's advantage from Mr. Silverman's classical acquirements. To say nothing of mathematics, which she is bent upon becoming versed in, and in which (as I hear from my son and others) Mr. Silverman's reputation is so deservedly high!' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} her, in case her {{expression}} might {{help him to}} understand her behavior. As usual, she had quickened her pace unconsciously, and was now walking a little in front of him; but he could gain little information from her eyes, which looked steadily at the brown heather, or from the lines drawn seriously upon her forehead. Thus to lose touch with her, for he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was thinking, was so unpleasant {{to him that he}} began to talk about his grievances again, without, however, much conviction in his voice.|$|E
60|$|My lady went on {{with more}} talk of this kind, though, in truth, Esmond had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said further, so entirely did her first words occupy his thought. Were they true? Not all, nor half, nor a tenth {{part of what the}} garrulous old woman said, was true. Could this be so? No ear had Esmond for {{anything}} else, though his patroness chatted on for an hour.|$|R
60|$|She was {{not angry}} with him now, but puzzled; <b>she</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> he meant: <b>she</b> {{accepted}} the situation, she had indeed a vague {{feeling that he was}} behaving in a very noble fashion and that she ought to admire it; but also she felt inclined to laugh at him and perhaps even to despise him a little.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day Irena behaves bizarrely {{and the girls}} begin {{to believe that there}} is something wrong with her. Zohar offers to take her to the infirmary but instead prepares for her date with the visiting soldier. However Irena insists on coming on the date and behaves strangely the entire time. When Zohar and her date finally manage to be alone, he aggressively strips off her clothes and when she asks him to be gentle, he tells her she should have gone with a non-combatant. She asks him to stop; he ignores her but is stopped by Irena who pulls his rifle on him and humiliates him before finally letting him go. Once Irena and Zohar return to the office, Rama chastizes them for not going to the infirmary. When Zohar explains that she was almost raped and that Irena saved her, Irena claims to have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> talking about, and Zohar realizes that Tehila's ghost must have left her. Unimpressed, Rama makes Zohar stay in the office all night cleaning. When she returns in the morning she is impressed that the office is spotless but soon finds that Zohar has shredded every record in the department and stuffed them in Rama's office.|$|R
60|$|The cat, having lured Jims {{to where}} he wanted him, sat down and began to lick his paws. He was quite willing to be caught now; but Jims had no longer any idea of {{catching}} him. He stood very still, looking at the lady. She did not see him then and Jims could only see her profile, which he thought very beautiful. She had wonderful ropes of blue-black hair wound around her head. She looked so sweet that Jims' heart beat. Then {{she lifted her head}} and turned her face and saw him. Jims felt something of a shock. She was not pretty after all. One side of her face was marked by a dreadful red scar. It quite spoilt her good looks, which Jims thought a great pity; but nothing could spoil the sweetness of her face or the loveliness of her peculiar soft, grey-blue eyes. Jims couldn't remember his mother and had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> looked like, but the thought came into his head that he would have liked her to have eyes like that. After the first moment Jims did not mind the scar at all.|$|E
60|$|An intense silence {{came over}} everything. Helena almost {{expected}} to hear the stars moving, everything below was so still. She {{had no idea what}} Siegmund was thinking. He lay with his arms strong around her. Then she heard the beating of his heart, like the muffled sound of salutes, she thought. It gave her the same thrill of dread and excitement, mingled with a sense of triumph. Siegmund had changed again, his mood was gone, so that he was no longer wandering in a night of thoughts, but had become different, incomprehensible to her. She had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought or felt. All she knew was that he was strong, and was knocking urgently with his heart on her breast, like a man who wanted something and who dreaded to be sent away. How he came to be so concentratedly urgent she could not understand. It seemed an unreasonable an incomprehensible obsession to her. Yet she was glad, and she smiled in her heart, feeling triumphant and restored. Yet again, dimly, she wondered where was the Siegmund of ten minutes ago, and her heart lifted slightly with yearning, to sink with a dismay. This Siegmund was so incomprehensible. Then again, when he raised his head and found her mouth, his lips filled her with a hot flush like wine, a sweet, flaming flush of her whole body, most exquisite, as if she were nothing but a soft rosy flame of fire against him for a moment or two. That, she decided, was supreme, transcendental.|$|E
6000|$|By and by Sam'l Todd, {{looking a}} little dazed, was pushed {{into the middle of}} the room to Tibbie's side, and the {{minister}} raised his voice in prayer. All eyes closed reverently, except perhaps the bridegroom's, which seemed glazed and vacant. It was an open question in the community whether Mr. Dishart did not miss his chance at weddings; the men shaking their heads over the comparative brevity of the ceremony, the women worshipping him (though he never hesitated to rebuke them when they showed it too openly) for the urbanity of his manners. At that time, however, only a minister of such experience as Mr. Dishart's predecessor could lead up to a marriage in prayer without inadvertently joining the couple; and the catechizing was mercifully brief. Another prayer followed the union; the minister waived his right to kiss the bride; every one looked at every other one, as if he had for the moment forgotten what he was on the point of saying and found it very annoying; and Janet signed frantically to Willie Todd, who nodded intelligently in reply, but evidently had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant. In time Johnny Allardice, our host, who became more and more doited as the night proceeded, remembered his instructions, and led the way to the kitchen, where the guests, having politely informed their hostess that they were not hungry, partook of a hearty tea. Mr. Dishart presided with the bride and bridegroom near him; but though he tried to give an agreeable turn to the conversation by describing the extensions at the cemetery, his personality oppressed us, and we only breathed freely when he rose to go. Yet we marvelled at his versatility. In shaking hands with the newly-married couple the minister reminded them that it was leap-year, and wished them [...] "three hundred and sixty-six happy and God-fearing days." ...|$|E
60|$|Alison felt {{physically}} dizzy, but she contrived to ask {{another question}} or two, {{and then went}} out, utterly cast down and desperate, into the steadily falling rain. She {{was alone in the}} big western city, with very little money in her purse and <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> should do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} the {{activity}} accounts for that--or my watching for you?" [...] she queried, archly. She was quick, bright, roguish. Neale had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> qualities <b>she</b> might have possessed before that fateful massacre, but she was bewilderingly different from the sick-minded girl he had {{tried so hard to}} interest and draw out of her gloom. He was so amazed, so delighted with her, and so confused with his own peculiar state of mind, that he could not be natural. Then his mood shifted and a little heat at his own stupidity aroused his wits.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course she}} spoke {{without knowing the}} value of words. <b>What</b> could <b>she</b> know of death--she who knew nothing of life? It was merely as the proof of her being beside herself with some odious apprehension, that this {{extraordinary}} speech had moved me, not to pity, but to a fascinated, horrified wonder. I had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> notion <b>she</b> had of her danger. Some sort of abduction. It was quite possible with the talk of that atrocious old woman. Perhaps {{she thought she could}} be carried off, bound hand and foot and even gagged. At that surmise I felt as if the door of a furnace had been opened in front of me.|$|R
5000|$|Alissa Simon {{writing for}} Variety said that [...] "The Slut refrains from {{supplying}} audiences with an emotional hook; lissome cipher Tamar is all id.

5000|$|The song {{is about}} a man who wonders what his former lover is {{currently}} doing and what her whereabouts are ("last I heard she had moved to Boulder"). While the singer has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing now, he proclaims [...] "what she's doing now is tearing him apart".|$|E
5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} the interview, {{she also}} asked whether he had ever smoked [...] "endo," [...] a slang {{reference}} to marijuana. Looking uncomfortable, the host told the singer that he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was talking about; Madonna called him a liar which led Letterman to make light of the embarrassing question by acting like Johnny Carson.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides {{keeping this}} Educational Institution, {{kept in the}} same room--a little general shop. <b>She</b> had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> stock <b>she</b> had, or <b>what</b> the price of {{anything}} in it was; {{but there was a}} little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem, <b>what</b> relation <b>she</b> was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.|$|R
5000|$|Everest [...] "Eve" [...] NingEve is a {{creative}} writing graduate from Brooklyn {{who has already}} become embittered at just about every aspect of her life, and the universe in general. Grumpy, cynical, and introverted, Eve has a menial job at Olly's Organix, an organic grocer, and has <b>no</b> clear <b>idea</b> about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants {{to do with her}} future. Early chapters of the strip focused on Eve's initially rocky relationship with her roommate Hanna, but the two have since become very close friends, despite their contrasting personalities and lifestyles. Eve's inhibitions and emotional distance have led many of her friends to view her as strong-willed and resilient, but Eve does not see herself this way.|$|R

One day, while sitting in the park, Annie sees a young boy about {{to be hit by}} a vehicle. Annie saves him and meets the boy's mother, who we meet as Mrs. X (Laura Linney). When she introduces herself as [...] "Annie", Mrs. X mistakes her words for [...] "Nanny" [...] and hires her to look after Grayer (Nicholas Art), the boy she saved (Mrs. X also continues to call her [...] "Nanny" [...] instead of [...] "Annie" [...] throughout the film). Annie lies to her mother about taking a job at a bank and, in reality, moves in with the X's to be the nanny for Grayer.|$|R
