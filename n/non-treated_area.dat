40|$|Northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) {{have been}} declining {{throughout}} their range since the 1960 s. The {{decline in the}} Gulf Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion (GPM) has primarily {{been the result of}} habitat loss and fragmentation. With the population already reduced, additional causes of quail decline become important issues. In 1957, red imported fire ants (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta) began to invade the GPM. RIFA can potentially affect bobwhites by direct predation of pipping chicks, reduced survival of young chicks, and competition for food. Eastern cottontails are another important species that could be impacted by RIFA. Previous work has documented RIFA predation of altricial young born in pen-raised cottontail nests. The Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado County, Texas received large-scale aerial treatment of RIFA with Extinguish Plus? insecticide as a management action for the endangered Attwater?s prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri). This presented me with an opportunity to evaluate the effects of RIFA treatment on: (1) bobwhite nest success and brood survival, (2) bobwhite abundance and density, (3) bobwhite movements and ranges, and (4) cottontail numbers. An additional objective was to (5) contribute reference data for bobwhite in the GPM to address this region?s lack of data. To investigate these objectives bobwhites were radio-collared and tracked, RIFA were sampled, and cottontails were surveyed in both the treated and non-treated areas. Treatment with Extinguish Plus? successfully reduced the abundance of RIFA in iii the treated area from 2014 ? 2017. However, I found that flooding can negate the effectiveness of the treatment when the treated area is surrounded by adjacent non-treated areas. Bobwhite densities were 76. 6 % higher (P = 0. 042) in the treated area compared to the <b>non-treated</b> <b>area.</b> There was no difference between bobwhite consecutive movements (P = 0. 275) or seasonal ranges (P = 0. 783) in the treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>area.</b> However, there was a difference (P = < 0. 001) by category. Nesting season females without a brood had larger movements (P = < 0. 001) than nesting season females with a brood and larger movements (P = 0. 002) than pre-nesting females.

40|$|Populations of {{northern}} bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) have been declining throughout Texas {{since at least}} the 1970 s. The red imported fire ant (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta) was introduced to the southern United States from South America around the 1920 s and reached Texas by the 1950 s. Previous studies have documented the negative effects of RIFA on northern bobwhite populations through both direct predation and indirect reduction of small invertebrates; a major food source for bobwhites. In 2013 and 2014, large areas of the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR) in Colorado County, Texas were aerially treated with Extinguish PlusTM, a chemical pesticide and reproductive inhibitor which targets ants. My study took place on this refuge and my objectives included evaluation of the impacts of (1) RIFA treatment on RIFA abundance, (2) RIFA treatment on invertebrate abundance, (3) RIFA treatment on northern bobwhite nest success, and (4) invertebrate abundance on northern bobwhite brood survival. I trapped, banded, and radio-collared northern bobwhites in areas treated and not treated with Extinguish PlusTM from May 2014 through May 2015. I also collected RIFA and invertebrate abundance data on areas treated and not treated during the 2014 and 2015 northern bobwhite nesting seasons. These data allowed for the assessment {{of northern}} bobwhite brood survival, RIFA abundance, and invertebrate abundance across treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas</b> of the refuge. Treatment with Extinguish PlusTM reduced the presence of RIFA on the refuge. However, significantly (P = 0. 019) lower mean invertebrate biomass per sample was found in treated areas and no significant (P = 0. 219) difference in mean numbers of individuals per sample were found between treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas.</b> Additionally, data collected suggested that <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas</b> had higher bobwhite brood survival than did treated areas.

Then, the environmental persistence, the diurnal and nocturnal scavenging rates of water vole carcasses were assessed in autumn 2011 and in spring 2012.

The average rates of diurnal and nocturnal scavenging ranged from 67 to 100 % and 5 to 100 %, respectively. They depended on the composition of the scavenger community present near the monitored plots; diurnal scavenging rates being higher with corvids than with raptors. In autumn, the red kite and the common buzzard were the main scavengers in one of the plots, what suggests a high risk of poisoning for these raptors during post-nuptial migration.

On the other hand, cell orientation on coated surfaces was clearly influenced by competitive adsorption of adhesive proteins such as fibronectin or collagen and anti-adhesive molecules as pluronic F 68 or albumin. Attachment factors were adsorbed on PSox stripes while adsorption of anti-adhesive molecules on the most hydrophobic PS areas prevented cell adhesion or growth. Thus, we describe the preparation of a cell culture substrate that succeeded in orientating cell growth and {{that led to a}} line of cells on adhesive PSox stripes ranging from 2 to 100 mu m width.

40|$|Abstract. Erosion in {{the first}} year after a {{wildfire}} can be up to three orders of magnitude greater than the erosion from undisturbed forests. To mitigate potential postfire erosion, various erosion control treatments are applied on highly erodible areas with downstream resources in need of protection. Because postfire erosion rates generally decline by an order of magnitude for each year of recovery, effective erosion mitigation treatments are most needed during the first year or two after a fire. Postfire treatments include broadcast seeding, scarification and trenching, physical erosion barriers such as contour-felled logs and straw wattles, and mulching with wheat straw, wood straw, and hydromulch. This paper summarizes data from more than seven years of studies {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} postfire erosion mitigation treatments at the hillslope and small watershed-scale in the western U. S. Results suggest that some mitigation treatments may help reduce erosion for some, but not all, rainfall events. Generally, mulching is more effective than seeding, scarifying, or erosion barriers. For small rainfall events, reduction in first year erosion rates have been measured for engineered wood straw and straw mulch (60 to 80 %), contour-felled log erosion barriers (50 to 70 %), and hydromulch (19 %). Grass seeding treatments have little effect on first year erosion reduction. For intense rain events (I 10 greater than 40 mm h- 1) there was little difference between treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R

To obtain extravasation in normal tissue PDT conditions were one order of magnitude more intensive than the ones in tissue containing neovessels reported in the literature. Fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC-D, 2000 kDa), a macromolecular agent, was intravenously injected 10 min before (LK 0 group, n= 14) or 2 h (LK 2 group, n= 16) after Visudyne-mediated PDT in nude mice bearing a dorsal skin fold chamber. Control animals had no PDT (CTRL group, n= 8). The extravasation of FITC-D from blood vessels in striated muscle tissue was observed in both groups in real-time for up to 2500 s after injection. We also monitored PDT-induced leukocyte rolling in vivo and assessed, by histology, the corresponding inflammatory reaction score in the dorsal skin fold chambers. In all animals, at the applied PDT conditions, FITC-D extravasation was significantly enhanced in the PDT-treated areas {{as compared to the}} surrounding <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas</b> (p< 0. 0001).

At the selected conditions, Visudyne-mediated PDT promotes vascular leakage and FITC-D extravasation into the interstitial space of normal tissue.

We took photographs along the Delta in treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas,</b> and used an ENVI segmentation tool {{to find the best}} parameters for discriminating Water Hyacinth and Primrose. Once those parameters were found, we created a set of rules that would convey the percent cover of each invasive and dead plant material inside every photograph.

The rules we created where based on the average RGB band ratios, and minimum and maximum RGB values of Water Hyacinth, Primrose, detritus, and water.

The best segmentation parameters we found still did not accurately separate the two plant species within a given photo graph, but performed well on photographs with only one species.

40|$|GESTINF (Berti and Zanin, 1997) is a {{decision}} tool for post-emergence weed control based on the equivalent density approach (Berti and Zanin, 1994). Based on the observation of weed densities just before treatment, the program estimates the economic return from the treatment, thus indicating whether to treat or not and, if a treatment is needed, the most economic weed control solution. Each treatment is also characterized by an environmental pollution index. GESTINF has been tested on wheat and soybean crops. Trials were done {{on a farm in}} north-eastern Italy, considering a total cropping area of about 60 ha of wheat and 40 ha of soybean. For both crops in those areas, weed control followed the suggestions of GESTINF, while the remaining cropping areas were treated according to the standard farm weed control practices. To compare the two weed control systems, the extra time required for scouting and treatments, as well as weed control efficacy and average crop yield were measured. In both crops the treatments suggested by GESTINF showed good efficacy and yields proved to be no different from those obtained in the fields treated following the standard farm weed control practices. In most cases GESTINF selected treatments with a lower environmental impact. The most critical point was the time required to scout the weed population which, in low value crops and/or when very cheap treatments were available, reduced the weed control economic return. In wheat, GESTINF indicated that less fields are needed to be treated than did the conventional system. However, extra costs due to both scouting and more expensive treatments balanced the savings obtained from <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas.</b> For soybean the treatments adopted by the farm were based on a combination of pre- and post-emergence practices.

Studies have typically estimated the effects of this type of interventions comparing outcome indicators -at the aggregate level- of areas with the facilities and areas that lack them, quite often neglecting systematic differences between treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas.</b> Moreover, at aggregate levels, on the one hand, less comprehensive information may imply greater unobserved and uncontrolled heterogeneity; on the other, heterogeneity within areas may jeopardize identification of impacts. To account for these key observations, we used propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at the individual level. Using indirect methods based on census data we constructed a mortality index at the motherhood level, and calculated five different impact estimators based on the propensity scores. We found that the average impact of the program ranged from 7. 2 percent (local linear regression-kernel matching) to 9. 0 percent (5 -nearest neighbors matching). Matching difference-in-differences estimators also evidenced about an 8 percent reduction in child mortality levels. The reflexive or naïve evaluation for the cross-section would have estimated an average impact of 16. 5 percent and the difference- indifferences naïve evaluation would have estimated an average impact of 19 percent, both clearly overstating the intervention's effects. When exploring heterogeneity of impacts, we stratified the sample by quartiles based on expenditure per capita, and surprisingly, no significant improvement among those in the bottom quartile was evidenced in relation to their matched individuals. However, we also observed that even in the poorest quartiles, if a woman had at least primary education, then the household obtained significant gains from W&S interventions. This would suggest the interesting observation that the overall insignificant effect for the bottom quartile was driven by the absence of impact in those who completely lacked education, thus stressing the importance of complimentary private inputs in order to reap the benefits of piped water, as other studies have suggested. water supply, sewerage, child mortality, propensity score matching. ...|$|R

"May 2012 "One weed that is of concern in Missouri pastures that can be detrimental is Northern dewberry (Rubus flagellaris Willd.). This weed can be detrimental due its production of spines which can injure grazing animals and also humans. Results from our study show that herbicide applications made in the fall that contain metsulfuron will provide approximately 50 % control of this weed, but where severe infestations exist a follow-up application will be required. Tall fescue can also be detrimental to the health of grazing animals. It can contain a fungus known as ergovaline which is in its highest concentration in tall fescue seedheads. Applying herbicides at certain growth stages can reduce tall fescue seedhead density. Applications of metsulfuron-containing herbicides at the boot stage of growth reduced tall fescue seedhead density the most compared to vegetative stage applications of these same herbicides. The distribution of cattle grazing in mixed tall fescue and legume pastures is also an important aspect of pasture management. Overgrazing of certain areas in pastures can cause an increase in weed growth and also reduce the growth of desirable forage. However, many producers are skeptical of treating pastures with broadcast herbicide applications as almost all herbicides available for broadleaf weed control in a pasture setting will eliminate other desirable forage species such as clover. Through this research, it was determined that even with the elimination of legumes, cattle grazing distribution can be increased in herbicide-treated pastures compared to <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas</b> within the same pasture...|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis {{dynamically}} adapts {{to changing}} environmental conditions. Extreme environmental {{conditions such as}} high temperature and water limitation directly reflect in the photosynthetic performance as vegetation stress. To monitor photosynthesis dynamics at large vegetation scales, indicators of stresses in vegetation extracted by non-invasive techniques can be used. Spectral reflectance indices such as NDVI and PRI have been tested to provide rapid and non-invasive estimation of photosynthesis at regional scales. Unfortunately, these indices lack sensitivity to short-term vegetation physiological changes. Alternatively, a passive retrieval of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) using high performance imaging spectroscopy has been suggested. SIF emission {{is closely related to}} the status of photosynthesis and therefore has the potential to track adaptation of this process to changes in environmental conditions and plant status. Although SIF emission represents a weak signal in comparison to the reflected radiation, recent research provides evidence that SIF can be measured by exploiting solar and atmospheric absorption lines using high performance spectrometers. In this contribution, we present the design and first results of an experiment that aimed to evaluate the capability of the new remote observable SIF and common reflectance based indices to detect plant stress. In the experiment, carried out in June and July 2014 in Latisana (Italy), we treated homogeneous lawn plots to provoke different level of stress in plants. In particular, we applied the herbicide (Dicuran) in different concentrations to four plots, three other plots were treated with the anti-transpirant Vaporgard; while three remaining plots were not treated and used as control. Diurnal variations in SIF and surface reflectance were evaluated for period of two weeks, using the high performance imaging spectrometer HyPlant. HyPlant is a dedicated fluorescence spectrometer and allows measuring radiance in the wavelength range between 400 nm and 2500 nm with a high spectral resolution of 0. 26 nm between 670 nm and 780 nm. Data was recorded for spatial resolution of 1 meter per pixel. Airborne data was calibrated and validated using high resolution top of canopy measurements of reflectance and SIF. Vegetation indices and SIF were calculated for treated and <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas</b> and compared with corresponding ground measurements. Additional measurements of CO 2 and H 2 O fluxes using chambers and an eddy covariance tower to monitor photosynthetic activity were performed. First results show contrasting responses of emitted SIF and vegetation indices for plant stress: SIF strongly increased after the treatment with Dicuran followed by a slow decrease down to the initial values. The Meris Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) showed a clear decrease after the herbicide treatment. We conclude that SIF is a promising new observable sensitive to plant stress which provides complementary information to commonly used remote observables origin form reflectance spectroscopy. We suggest a combined use of SIF and reflectance spectroscopy to establish reliable approaches for rapid, early, and non-invasive plant stress detection...|$|R
40|$|Avena sterilis weed {{pressure}} categories can be discriminated in wheat through remote {{images taken}} at late stages of wheat senescence. Site-specific image processing was achieved with SARI ®, an add-on software program for ENVI ® developed to implement precision agriculture. Using the SARI software and crop-weed competition and economic models, the precision yield losses for each micro-plot {{can be estimated}} and herbicide prescription maps obtained. Simulation studies on control indicators and herbicide use efficiency were undertaken using real-time ground data and remote images of two wheat plots infested with Avena sterilis at LaFloridaII and Navajas (Southern Spain). The simulation indicated that precision application of herbicides would produce higher overall herbicide savings (OHS) compared to broadcast applications but would {{vary depending on the}} level of weed infestation, the decision making criteria (DMC) of applying herbicide above a weed infestation level {{and the size of the}} spray grid considered. For example, for areas with low levels of infestation (around 15 %), the OHS was 20, 44, 81 and 90 % for a DMC of 0, 10, 20 and 30 %, respectively. SARI ® also estimates the overall herbicide application efficiency (OHAE), a key agro-environmental index to estimate the efficiency of herbicide applications in weedy areas and the lack of herbicide applications in weed-free areas. Ideally, the OHAE is equal to 1 if weed control is complete and herbicide applications in weed-free areas are not necessary. The OHAE index is influenced by the size of the micro-plot and decision-making herbicide application criteria (DMC). The OHAE values increased as the size of the micro-plot decreased, regardless of the intensity of the weed infestation. For example, micro-plots of 20 × 6 m, 5 × 3 m and 1. 2 × 1. 5 m had OHAE values of 0. 27, 0. 57 and 0. 76, for areas of low infestation, when averaged over the DMC. Generally, the OHAE values increased as the size of the micro-plot decreased regardless of the intensity of weed infestation. Based on actual weed abundance data, competition models and production costs, SARI ® estimated wheat yield losses and economic net return for each micro-plot and herbicide application strategy. In both locations, weed infestation varied spatially from virtually weed-free micro-plots to 15 and 24 % winter wheat yield loss in Navajas and LaFloridaII, respectively. Preliminary calculations indicate that net returns were slightly higher for areas with site-specific adjusted-rate applications than for the overall standard label rate application strategy. Both of these strategies provided considerably higher net returns compared to <b>non-treated</b> <b>areas.</b> © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In order to identify the causal effects of the programme, we use panel data at a fine spatial scale covering years {{before and after the}} launch of the program, and exploit several institutional features that determined whether or not an area becomes supported. Using spatial differencing, we find evidence of significant displacement from <b>non-treated</b> to treated <b>areas</b> close to the treatment area boundary.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that vitiligo areas contain inactive or dormant melanocytes. Melanin synthesis is related to tyrosinase presence and indicative of active metabolic state. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare repigmentation, epidermal melanocyte distribution and tyrosinase mRNA detection through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, in tissue samples of vitiligo, before and after curettage, with or without subsequent autologous skin graft using a new method. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, in the Department of Dermatology, Faculdade de Medicina do ABC, Santo André. METHODS: Two vitiligo areas were curetted. One subsequently received grafted normal sacral autologous skin, whereas the other had no further treatment. The curetted areas were examined after 30 days, to evaluate the degree of repigmentation. The melanocyte percentages and tyrosinase mRNA presence in normal skin and vitiligo areas, before and after curettage and grafting, were compared. RESULTS: Complete repigmentation was seen in all grafted areas, whereas non-grafted curetted vitiligo presented partial repigmentation. The melanocyte percentage in grafted areas was greater than in non-treated vitiligo skin (p = 0. 01) and skin with curettage alone (p = 0. 015). Tyrosinase mRNA was negative in 93. 75 % of <b>non-treated</b> vitiligo <b>areas.</b> After treatment (curettage alone or curettage and grafting), all lesions became positive for tyrosinase mRNA. CONCLUSION: Metabolically inactive or dormant melanocytes are probably present within vitiligo areas, and may be activated by exogenous or endogenous stimuli...|$|R
40|$|The lesser prairie chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus; LPC) has {{declined}} in numbers {{since the late}} 1800 s. Reasons for this decline {{have been attributed to}} habitat degradation (decreased forb and grass cover and increased woody cover) and fragmentation caused by overgrazing and conversion of native rangelands to croplands. The herbicide, Tebuthiuron, has been used extensively throughout the LPC?s range to reduce dominance of woody shrubs and allow growth of forbs and grasses. Tebuthiuron treatment of shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) rangelands has been reported as being both beneficial and detrimental to LPC populations. My study evaluated the effects of Tebuthiuran treatment of shinney oak on LPC survival, movement, and reproduction. I trapped (48), radio-tagged (38), and monitored LPC survival, movements, reproduction, and habitat use during spring and summer 2006 and 2007. I also determined potential LPC nest predators using dummy nests (domestic chicken eggs) and motion-sensitive infrared cameras. No differences were found in survival between ages, sexes, or years. Range size did not differ by age, sex, or year. Female LPC moved greater distances from lek of capture than did males. Females nested almost exclusively in non-grazed rangeland and under sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia). Nest-sites had higher obstruction of vision (OV), higher (%) woody cover, and lower (%) bare ground than surrounding areas. All LPC were found to use non-grazed rangeland areas more than all other vegetation types, and to use tebuthiuron-treated, grazed areas slightly more than <b>non-treated,</b> grazed <b>areas.</b> Non-grazed rangeland had higher OV than all other vegetation types. Tebuthiuron treatment lowered woody plant dominance and increased forbs and grasses. Fire reduced vegetation height and OV and increased growth of grasses and forbs, but did not kill woody vegetation as did tebuthiuron-treatment. The most common dummy nest predator found was the Chihuahuan raven (Corvus cryptoleucus) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the inhibitory effect of losartan, a type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT 1) antagonist, and of combined treatment with losartan and GR 144053, a fibrinogen receptor (GPIIb/IIIa) antagonist, on neointima formation subsequent to vascular injury in the hamster carotid artery. Vascular injury was achieved by a roughened-tip 2 F catheter and the neointimal area was measured up to 2 weeeks inducing the injury. Compared to <b>non-treated</b> hamsters (intimal <b>area</b> (IA) /internal elastic laminal area (IELA) ratio = 60. 3 ± 5. 9 %, n= 12), losartan dissolved in drinking water (1, 3 and 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day, n= 8 each) reduced neointimal area dose-dependently, a significant decrease (IA/IELA= 39. 7 ± 5. 6 %) being attained with the highest dose when it was administered from 1 day before injury. However, neointima formation was not prevented even with the highest dose of losartan when the administration was started after injury. When the administration of GR 144053 (1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per hour) via an implanted osmotic pump was started 30 [*]min before the injury and continued for the next 2 weeks, no suppression of neointima formation was observed, although platelet aggregation evoked ex vivo by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) {{at the end of}} treatment period was efficiently inhibited. In separate experiments in which 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxy-Uridine (BrdU) was used to test smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation 1 and 7 days after injury, the ratio of SMC proliferation in the injured area was only slightly decreased by losartan when its administration was started after the injury, despite the marked reduction of SMC proliferation when treatment was started before the injury. Treatment with GR 144053 as indicated above also significantly decreased the SMC proliferating index 1 day after the injury. To examine the potential benefit of the coadministration of the GPIIb/IIIa antagonist with the AT 1 receptor antagonist, GR 144053 (1. 0 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per hour) was combined with post-injury treatment with losartan (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day). This markedly reduced the proliferation of SMCs and significantly decreased the neointimal area (IA/IELA= 31. 2 ± 4. 6 %) measured 2 weeks following the catheterization. According to the results of a time-dependent study in which GR 144053 was given in combination with post injury treatment with losartan for 1, 3, 7 or 14 days, neointima formation could be reduced by treatment with GR 144053 for just 7 days. In conclusion, GR 144053, a fibrinogen receptor antagonist, enhanced the inhibitory effect of losartan, an AT 1 receptor antagonist, on neointima formation in the damaged carotid artery of hamsters...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la 10 ª Reunión anual de la Sociedad Española de Investigación sobre Cannabinoides celebrada en Santander del 26 al 28 de noviembre de 2009. There {{are many}} basic and {{clinical}} studies demonstrating {{the interaction between}} serotonergic brain and endocannabinoid systems. This interaction might be relevant for understanding the neurobiology of depression {{as well as the}} mechanism of action of the antidepressants. The bilateral olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat is an animal model of chronic depression with comorbid anxiety that exhibits similar behavioural, neurochemical and structural alterations to those observed in depressed patients. Moreover, it possesses great predictive validity since the OBX-induced behaviour is reversed by chronic treatment with almost all clinically effective antidepressants. Therefore, in this study, we have analysed the functionality of the CB 1 receptor in the brain of the OBX rat and its modulation following chronic administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day, s. c. 14 days). OBX-induced behaviour was evaluated in the >open-field> test under highly aversive conditions (high luminance, 400 lux). CB 1 -receptor functionality in rat brain sections was assessed measuring the stimulation of [35 S]GTPγS binding induced by the cannabinoid agonist (10 [Mu]M). Two weeks after OBX surgery, animals exhibited hyperactivity (increased peripheral deambulations) and increased exploratory activity (rearings) in the >open-field> paradigm. Chronic fluoxetine fully attenuated this OBX-induced behaviour but it did not produce any behavioural effects in control animals. WIN 55212, 2 -induced stimulation of [35 S]GTPγS binding was significantly increased on several brain areas in the OBX rat (% of stimulation ranging from 90 % to 350 % over basal binding values) in comparison with that observed in control animals (% of stimulation from 10 % to 151 % over basal binding values) : medial prefrontal, frontal, frontoparietal, cingular and enthorrinal cortices; septal nuclei; CA 1 -CA 2 fields and dentate gyrus of hippocampus; dorsomedial hypothalamic area; basolateral nuclei of amygdala; and susbtantia nigra. Interestingly, chronic fluoxetine modulated, in a region-selective manner, CB 1 receptors functionality in OBX rats since a significant desensitization of WIN 55212, 2 -induced G-protein activation was observed in fluoxetine-treated OBX rats in comparison with <b>non-treated</b> OBX-rats in <b>areas</b> such as the medial prefrontal cortex (218 ± 16 % stimulation of stimulation of [35 S]GTPγS binding over basal binding vs 161 ± 8 %; p open field> test is associated with a reversal of those OBX-induced adaptive changes upon CB 1 receptors functionality in some cortical areas and the septal nuclei. This animal model of chronic depression/anxiety may represent a valuable tool to study the implication of the endocannabinoid system in the modulation of emotional processes and its participation in the mechanism of action of antidepressants.
