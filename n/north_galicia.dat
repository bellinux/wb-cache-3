50|$|Marvão's role as {{fortress}} now {{became more}} important {{not as a}} Christian or Moorish outpost-against-the-infidel, but as a territorial marker for the young - and by no means militarily strong - state of Portugal against the competing Christian Kingdom of León. In 1226, Marvão was among the earliest towns on the eastern border to receive from Sancho II of Portugal its foral (i.e. royal charter, allowing the town to regulate its administration, borders and privileges).Another aspect of 13th century statecraft that would bolster the area's 'Portugalidade' (Portuguese identity) would be the settlement of planted Christian colonists from the <b>north</b> (<b>Galicia,</b> the Minho), southern France and Flanders in territories around Marvão. This was done with royal approval, and with the intermediation of the Templars and Hospitallers. The resettlement of barren areas depopulated by centuries of warfare and bloodshed - or simply abandoned by fleeing Berber refugees - was vital to sustain the new Portuguese kingdom. Many of these settlers were Galicians, {{and the name of}} the hamlet of Galegos in Marvão is likely to refer to its 13th-14th century settlers. Other nearby settlements took names from southern France: in the nearby Templar-controlled village of Nisa (Nice), we find hamlets named Tolosa (Toulouse), Montalvão (Montauban) and Arez (Arles) to denote the origins of their settlers.|$|E

40|$|The west Galicia margin (Spain) {{provides}} {{a model for}} passive continental margin evolution. During the Meso-zoic, the continental crust of the margin experienced severa! episodes of extension. The main stage was during the Berriasian-late Aptian interval. The stretching of the lithosphere resulted in a) the thinning of the continental crust, testified by superficial extensional structures (normal faults, tilted fault blocks) and rapid subsidence, and b) the emplacement of mantle rocks (peridotite) at the continental rift axis. The crustal thinning and the final emplacement of peridotite onto the seafloor are explained by uniform, normal, simple shear of the continental lithosphere, following asthenosphere diapirism. The sedimentary response to the rifting process was the rapid de-position of coarse detrital sediments in the half grabens of the rift. The pre-rift sediments are platform carbonates, and the post-rift sediments are distal turbidites followed by pelagic sediments. To {{the south of the}} Bay of Biscay, the <b>north</b> <b>Galicia</b> and Asturias margin evolved as the Galicia passive margin until latest Cretaceous time. During the Paleocene-Eocene interval, it was converted into an active margin {{as a result of the}} Eurasian-lberian plate convergence and related southward subduction of the European plate beneath the lberian plate. A marginal trench and a tectonic accretionary prism developed at the plate boundary and the margin was shortened, deformed and eroded, becoming a subduction-related fold belt. Today it is the westward prolongation of the Pyrenean and Cantabric collisional chain. Therefore models accounting for the emerged part of the Pyrenees must also be constrained by offshore data...|$|E
40|$|Apatite fission-track (AFT) and (U+Th) /He (AHe) data, {{combined}} with time-temperature inverse modelling, reveal the cooling and exhumation {{history of the}} Iberian Massif in eastern Galicia since the Mesozoic. The continuous cooling at various rates correlates with variation of tectonic boundary conditions in the adjacent continental margins. The data provide constraints on the 107 timescale longevity of a relict paleolandscape. AFT ages range from 68 to 174 Ma with mean track lengths of 10. 7 ± 2. 6 to 12. 6 ± 1. 8 μm, and AHe ages range from 73 to 147 Ma. Fastest exhumation (≈ 0. 25 km/Ma) occurred during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous main episode of rifting in the adjacent western and northern margins. Exhumation rates have decreased since then and have been approximately one order of magnitude lower. Across inland Galicia, the AFT data are consistent with Early Cretaceous movement on post-Variscan NE trending faults. This is coeval with an extensional episode offshore. The AHe data in this region indicate less than 1. 7 km of denudation in the last 100 Ma. This low exhumation suggests the attainment of a mature landscape during Late Cretaceous post-rift tectonic stability, whose remains are still preserved. The low and steady rate of denudation prevailed across inland Galicia despite minor N-S shortening in the northern margin since ≈ 45 Ma ago. In <b>north</b> <b>Galicia,</b> rock uplift in response to NW strike-slip faulting since Early Oligocene to Early Miocene has caused insufficient exhumation (< 3 km) to remove the Mesozoic cooling signal recorded by the AFT data. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that simple shear rifting {{of the continental}} crust, {{in the form of}} low-angle detachment faulting, occurred during the final stages of continental breakup between West Iberia and the Grand Banks. The primary evidence for such faulting is the occurrence of low-angle, high amplitude reflectors within the basement adjacent to the ocean– continent transition zone. Here we present a series of intersecting, depth migrated seismic reflection profiles that image one such reflector, the H-reflector, located on the southern edge of Galicia Bank. ‘H’ lies beneath several boreholes drilled during ODP Legs 149 and 173, in a region where the oceanward extent of extended continental crust steps at least 150 km westward from its location in the southern Iberia Abyssal Plain to its location off the relatively shallow Galicia Bank. In our profiles ‘H’ appears to define a surface that extends over a region of at least 200 km 2 and that dips down ? 19 ? to the <b>north,</b> towards <b>Galicia</b> Bank. The profiles show that a close affinity exists between ‘H’ and the most seaward continental crust. Based on geophysical data and ODP drilling results, we infer that the basement above ‘H’ is composed of continental crust deformed by extensional faults into a series of wedge-shaped blocks and thin slivers. These basement wedges have a complex 3 -D geometry. ‘H’ rises to the basement surface on a number of the seismic profiles and appears to define locally the oceanward extent of continental fault blocks...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{planning}} practices {{can be explained}} from the prevailing theoretical juxtaposition of ‘institutional design’ and ‘institutional evolution’; two schools of thought {{that are at the}} extremes of assumptions on modifiability. The two extremes are considered to be inextricably linked to each other and cannot be separated; institutional design at a higher level highly infl uences institutional evolution at a lower level. In this paper we add the opposite direction of their interdependence. We found that small and sometimes even unexpected efforts of institutional design at a low level of scale can, when aggregated, result into an evolution of collective institutions at a higher level. We participated in a cooperative project between research and practice, which was established as an exchange project on innovation in land development. We investigated the genesis of institutional change in land development, which is a specific regional planning instrument. We analyzed 40 planning practices that were presented by land agencies from seven EU regions (Flanders, the Netherlands, <b>North</b> Rhine–Westphalia, <b>Galicia,</b> Portugal, Hungary, and Lithuania) as their most innovative ones. We studied the histories of 14 of them intensively, using grounded data gathered in visits, discussions, and in-depth interviews with key persons. We found great similarity across these 14 cases in terms of the distinctive patterns relating to local processes leading up to systemic innovations: seemingly small, local, often unexpected and unpredictable occurrences appeared to have set the process of innovation in motion.
