40|$|Increased {{demand for}} {{certified}} organic products {{has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of certified organic farms in developing countries. Knowledge of farmer nutrient management practices on certified organic farms in developing countries is limited. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the adoption of certified organic agriculture on farm <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> and <b>nutrient</b> budgets, and evaluate to which degree organic farms comply with organic principles relating to nutrient management. the study is based on five case studies of different types of certified organic farming systems in Brazil, Egypt and China. Farm <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> and <b>nutrient</b> budgets for nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium were created for each farm. Four of the five organic systems studied had nutrient surpluses on the farm budget. the surpluses were of varying magnitude. the main difference between organic and non-organic farm <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> was the replacement of mineral fertilizers with organic inputs. However, the magnitude of <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> were generally similar for organic and non-organic farms. Certified organic farms with positive nutrient budgets had a heavy reliance on external inputs. Continued high dependence on an external supply of nutrients, which typically originate from mineral sources, poses a significant challenge to organic farmers' fulfilment of the principles of organic agriculture.

Additionally, symptoms of bacterial wilt of turf grass include yellow leaf spots, tan or brown spots, water soaked lesions, elongated yellow leaves and shriveling of aforementioned blue or dark green leaves.Since putting greens are not a pure stand of turf, some grass blades may be resistant to the bacterium and thus remain unharmed while the surrounding turf dies, rendering the putting surface inconsistent and unsightly, especially at high-end golf courses.|$|E

Modelling is a promising approach {{to reduce the}} cost and the delay in studying the relationship between farming management and risky emissions. The simulation of decision is essential to better analyze ex ante changes in farm management, but is rarely considered in environmental models. MELODIE simulates the flows of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, zinc and water within the whole pig and dairy farm over the long term. MELODIE upscales dynamic models developed at the field or animal scale by considering the management of the whole farm system coherently with the livestock farming system. The model is structured according to an ontology of agricultural production systems to represent the interactions between the biotechnical system and the decision system. The biotechnical module simulates the <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> at a daily time step for each entity of the sub-models (soil/crop, animal and manure processes). MELODIE represents decisions at two time scales: every year, for drawing annual activity plans and every day for the context-dependent application of this plan. Thanks to the interactions between the biotechnical system and the decision system at different time scales, MELODIE is able to run consistently under different long-term climate series. The goal is to study the emerging properties of the system. Besides, because the <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> within the farm are dynamically simulated, it is possible to study both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environmental risks. This approach enables a better understanding of variability in the farming system according to climate. MELODIE is intended for use in research, not as a decision support system for farm management. It is a framework for virtual experimentation on animal farming systems, and could be extended to deal with other issues than <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

50|$|The most {{abundant}} species of coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi, {{belongs to the}} order Isochrysidales and family Noëlaerhabdaceae.

It is studied for the extensive blooms it forms in nutrient depleted waters after the reformation of the summer thermocline. and for its production of molecules known as alkenones that are commonly used by earth scientists as a means to estimate past sea surface temperatures. Coccolithophores are of particular interest to those studying global climate change because as ocean acidity increases, their coccoliths may become even more important as a carbon sink. Furthermore, management strategies are being employed to prevent eutrophication-related coccolithophore blooms, as these blooms lead to a decrease in <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> to lower levels of the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Myrmecophily is {{considered}} a form of indirect plant defense against herbivory, though ants often provide other services in addition to protection. Some ants provide hygienic services to keep leaf surfaces clean and deter disease, and defense against fungal pathogens has also been demonstrated. It is common for ants to prune epiphytes, vines, and parasitic plants from their host plant, and they sometimes thin the shoots of neighboring plants as well. In doing so, ants reduce plant-plant competition for space, light, nutrients, and water. Finally, current work focusing on ants' role in nutrient supplementation for plants has shown that in many ant-plant relationships <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> is bidirectional. One study has estimated that while 80% of the carbon in the bodies of Azteca spp. workers is supplied by the host tree (Cecropia spp.), 90% of the Cecropia tree's nitrogen was supplied by ant debris carried to the tree {{as a result of}} external foraging. In light of these services, myrmecophily can be very advantageous in ensuring a plant's survival and ecological success.|$|E
50|$|Photosynthetic {{reaction}} centre {{genes from}} PSII (PsbA, PsbD) {{have been discovered}} within marine bacteriophage. Though it is widely accepted dogma that arbitrary pieces of DNA can be borne by phage between hosts (transduction), one would hardly expect to find transduced DNA within {{a large number of}} viruses. Transduction is presumed to be common in general, but for any single piece of DNA to be routinely transduced would be highly unexpected. Instead, conceptually, a gene routinely found in surveys of viral DNA {{would have to be a}} functional element of the virus itself (this does not imply that the gene would not be transferred among hosts - which the photosystem within viruses is - but instead that there is a viral function for the gene, that it is not merely hitchhiking with the virus). However, free viruses lack the machinery needed to support metabolism, let alone photosynthesis. As a result, photosystem genes are not likely to be a functional component of the virus like a capsid protein or tail fibre. Instead, it is expressed within an infected host cell. Most virus genes that are expressed in the host context are useful for hijacking the host machinery to produce viruses or for replication of the viral genome. These can include reverse transcriptases, integrases, nucleases or other enzymes. Photosystem components do not fit this mould either.The production of an active photosystem during viral infection provides active photosynthesis to dying cells. This is not viral altruism towards the host, however. The problem with viral infections tends to be that they disable the host relatively rapidly. As protein expression is shunted from the host genome to the viral genome, the photosystem degrades relatively rapidly (due in part to the interaction with light, which is highly corrosive), cutting off the supply of nutrients to the replicating virus. A solution to this problem is to add rapidly degraded photosystem genes to the virus, such that the <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> is uninhibited and more viruses are produced. One would expect that this discovery will lead to other discoveries of a similar nature; that elements of the host metabolism key to viral production and easily damaged during infection are actively replaced or supported by the virus during infection.|$|E

40|$|In {{the search}} for Integrated Nutrient Management {{practices}} {{in response to the}} widely observed soil fertility decline in Sub-Saharan Africa, the potential of low-external-input and organic farming remains to be systematically examined. The nutrient monitoring concept was used {{to assess the impact of}} technologies on <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> and economic performance at activity and farm household level in Machakos district, Kenya. The <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> and balances and economic performance indicators of farms practising low-external input agriculture (LEIA) technologies for a number of years were compared with a group of farms practising conventional farm management.

No significant differences could be found between the LEIA and conventional farm management group. Only if LEIA farm management reduces nutrient losses through leaching and gaseous losses can a positive impact on nutrient balance be expected.

40|$|Measuring in situ {{nutrient}} {{and energy}} flows in spatially and temporally complex aquatic ecosystems represents a major ecological challenge. Food web structure, energy and nutrient budgets {{are difficult to}} measure, and it is becoming more important to quantify both energy and <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> to determine how food web processes and structure are being modified by multiple stressors. We propose that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners represent an ideal tracer to quantify in situ energy and <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> between trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate how an understanding of PCB congener bioaccumulation dynamics provides multiple direct measurements of energy and <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> in aquatic food webs. To demonstrate this novel approach, we quantified nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and caloric turnover rates for Lake Huron lake trout, and reveal how these processes are regulated by both growth rate and fish life history. Although minimal nutrient recycling was observed in young growing fish, slow growing, older lake trout (3 ̆e 5 yr) recycled an average of 482 Tonnes∙yr- 1 of N, 45 Tonnes∙yr- 1 of P and assimilated 22 TJ yr- 1 of energy.

40|$|Phasic {{changes in}} intramyocardial tension during the cardiac cycle {{interrupt}} coronary blood flow (CBF) so {{that most of}} the <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> to the ventricular myocardium occurs in ventricular diastole. Rapid changes in mean arterial pressure cause transient changes in CBF before autoregulatory factors return flow toward previous levels. Myocardial oxygen consumption (MVo 2) appears to be the major determinant of CBF and the factors determining MVo 2 (mainly developed tension and contractile state) are, therefore, major determinants of CBF. The direct effects of autonomic excitation on CBF appear relatively minor, however; the vagus, sympathetic nerves and adrenal medullary hormones profoundly alter CBF indirectly through changes in MVo 2. In the eschaemic heart with atheromatous occlusion of large vessels there is a reduced capacity for autoregulation, and <b>nutrient</b> <b>flow</b> is more dependent on pressure gradient.

40|$|In {{regions of}} {{intensive}} pig and dairy farming, nutrient losses {{to the environment}} at farm level {{are a source of}} concern for water and air quality. Dynamic models are useful tools to evaluate the effects of production strategies on <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> and losses to the environment. This paper presents {{the development of a new}} whole-farm model upscaling dynamic models developed at the field or animal scale. The model, called MELODIE, is based on an original structure with interacting biotechnical and decisional modules. Indeed, it is supported by an ontology of production systems and the associated programming platform DIESE. The biotechnical module simulates the <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows</b> in the different animal, soil and crops and manure sub-models. The decision module relies on an annual optimization of cropping and spreading allocation plans, and on the flexible execution of activity plans for each simulated year These plans are examined every day by an operational management sub-model and their application is context dependent As a result, MELODIE dynamically simulates the flows of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, zinc and water within the whole farm over the short and long-term considering both the farming system and its adaptation to climatic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to study both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environmental risks, and to test changes of practices and innovative scenarios. This is illustrated with one example of simulation plan on dairy farms to interpret the Nitrogen farm-gate budget indicator It shows that this indicator is able to reflect small differences in Nitrogen losses between different systems, but it can only be interpreted using a mobile average, not on a yearly basis. This example illustrates how MELODIE could be used to study the dynamic behaviour of the system and the dynamic of <b>nutrient</b> <b>flows.</b> Finally, MELODIE can also be used for comprehensive multi-criterion assessments, and it also constitutes a generic and evolving framework for virtual experimentation on animal farming systems...|$|R

Treatments consisted of four diets where different sources of plant protein {{accounted for the}} major protein source named soybean meal, source of higher ruminal degradability, and three other sources of higher resistance of degradation: roasted soybean, corn gluten meal, and cottonseed cake. Amounts of rumen protein were similar among rations; however, flows of dry matter, protein and non-fiber carbohydrate to omasum were higher for diets with protein source with reduced rumen degradation rate.
