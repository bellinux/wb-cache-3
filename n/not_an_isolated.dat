Three Hathibada inscriptions and one Ghosundi inscription, all {{located in}} the state of Rajasthan and dated by modern methodology to the 1stcenturyBCE, mention Samkarsana and Vasudeva, also mention that the structure was built for their worship. These four inscriptions are notable for being some of the oldest-known Sanskrit inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Within {{less than}} a week of the mutiny, a Court of Inquiry was set up to {{investigate}} and collect evidence for the trial for the mutineers. Although the Court of Inquiry was meant to take place behind closed doors, as accordance with standard military procedures, the proceeding was held in public instead. According to Harper and Miller this was to give the public the impression that the mutineers “were being tried for mutiny and shooting with intent to kill and not, as alleged for refusal to go to Turkey’’. Although the Court of Inquiry was clearly trying to downplay the link between Turkey and the mutiny, with the declassification of new documents and evidence, another perception has emerged in explaining the cause of the mutiny and that is the role of pan-Islamism. Contrary to official British colonial authorities, the mutiny was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> case of a purely local affair but was instead part of a wider anti-British and pro-Muslim battle.|$|E

25|$|This was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> victory; {{five more}} German {{airships}} {{were destroyed by}} Home Defence B.E.2c interceptors between October and December 1916. The airship campaign faltered; this rate of attrition could not be sustained, especially in combination with considerable non-combat losses.|$|E
25|$|Approximately one in {{five people}} from Perth profess to have no religion, with 11% of people not {{specific}} as to their beliefs. One hundred years ago this figure was one in 250 (0.4%).

25|$|According to Mohamed Haji Ingiriis, {{the vicious}} atrocities {{during the reign}} of Barre were <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event nor unusual in Somalia's history. Barre also {{targeted}} the Hawiye. But, states Ingiriis, Barre extermination campaigns against other clan groups reflected the deep seated historic cycles of repressions by the clan that gains dominant power then marginalizes other clans.|$|E

25|$|Affecting {{thousands}} of people across several centuries, dancing mania was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event, and was well documented in contemporary reports. It was nevertheless poorly understood, and remedies were based on guesswork. Generally, musicians accompanied dancers, to help ward off the mania, but this tactic sometimes backfired by encouraging more to join in. There is no consensus among modern-day scholars as {{to the cause of}} dancing mania.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, a bug is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> flaw, but {{represents}} an error of thinking or planning {{on the part}} of the programmer. Such logic errors require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of code review, stepping through the code and imagining or transcribing the execution process may often find errors without ever reproducing the bug as such.|$|E
25|$|The {{software}} domain is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> entity. There {{are many}} instances of overlap of software related subject matter with {{the domains of}} other IACs such as reliability, information assurance and modeling and simulation. For example, software reliability is a subtopic of the broader topic of system reliability. Software assurance is intertwined with the subject of Information Assurance. Software technology is {{a significant part of}} modeling and simulation.|$|E

50|$|Historical {{and modern}} {{linguists}} classify Korean {{as a language}} isolate;however, {{it does have a}} few extinct relatives, which together with Korean itself and the Jeju language (spoken in the Jeju Province and considered somewhat distinct) form the Koreanic language family. This implies that Korean is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolate,</b> but <b>a</b> member of a small family. The idea that Korean belongs to the controversial Altaic language family is discredited in academic research. There is still debate about a relation to Dravidian languages and on whether Korean and Japanese are related to each other. The Korean language is agglutinative in its morphology and SOV in its syntax.|$|R
25|$|Operation Lilliput was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> {{operation}} as in {{a single}} landing or convoy series. It grew from very limited and difficult sea transport {{in support of the}} Buna campaign, the very serious lack of supplies for that campaign and had a parallel operation, using some of the same ships over essentially the same route. Convoys of similar nature continued after the formal Operation Lilliput stages had officially ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} cab driver Monier Gindy on January 4, 2007, in Marrero, Louisiana, was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> incident. Ever since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, cab drivers have {{increasingly}} been {{the targets of}} criminals terrorizing the New Orleans metropolitan area. The president of United Cab discourages his drivers from carrying firearms, instead advising them to accelerate the car and crash into a lamppost or even a police car if they are threatened with a gun.|$|E
25|$|The Greek Revolution was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event; {{numerous}} {{failed attempts}} at regaining independence took place {{throughout the history}} of the Ottoman era. Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the Ottomans in the Morea and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by Dionysius the Philosopher. After the Morean War, the Peloponnese came under Venetian rule for 30 years, and remained in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of klephts multiplied.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: HIT {{is a rare}} disease. There was no {{evidence}} of a predisposing factor for the occurrence of the disease in a uniform resuscitation population. The diagnosis of HIT is based on a cluster of arguments and <b>not</b> on <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event. Biological tools are indispensable, in a complementary way to the clinical picture.|$|R
50|$|The {{widespread}} use of computers and application of biotechnology raises similar resistance among the public today. Whether the public receives an invention readily or resists depends on their awareness and willingness to entertain rapid change. Regardless of the response, technological inventions occurs as part of overall social development, <b>not</b> as <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> field of activity.|$|R

25|$|On 20 April 1945, the Soviets, {{without asking}} their Western allies, {{instructed}} Renner {{to form the}} provisional government. Seven days later Renner's cabinet took office, declared the independence of Austria from Nazi Germany and called {{for the creation of}} a democratic state along the lines of the First Austrian Republic. Soviet acceptance of Renner was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> episode; their officers re-established district administrations and appointed local mayors, frequently following the advice of the locals, even before the battle was over.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of theatre in England in the 16th and 17th centuries was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> phenomenon; similar developments occurred simultaneously in other European countries, to {{greater or lesser}} degrees. The same broad factors influenced English actors as those that affected actors in neighboring countries, especially Scotland, France, Denmark, and states in northern Germany like Saxony and the Rhineland Palatinate. Yet conditions in other societies also differed significantly from those in England; the following discussion applies specifically to England in the 16th century and 17th century.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} Nattapara in Hooghly district, a remote village in Balagarh block. There are some 100 dhakis in the village. There {{is not a}} single family without a dhaki. All used to go out to work as dhakis during the festive season, but now the demand has {{declined}} {{to such an extent that}} many are forced to give up the traditional profession and work as wage labourers. Worse still, a dhaki from the village was contacted by a well-known Durga Puja in Kolkata for Rs. 2,000. After he had performed his duties they paid him less and insulted him. It is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> incident and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E
50|$|Some general {{factors that}} will persuade that the conduct was extreme and {{outrageous}} (1) {{there was a}} pattern of conduct, <b>not</b> just <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> incident; (2) the plaintiff was vulnerable and the defendant knew it; (3) the defendant {{was in a position}} of power; (4) racial epithets were used; and (5) the defendant owed the plaintiff a fiduciary duty.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Evergreen Marine Corporation, {{then the}} world's second largest {{shipping}} company after Maersk, also shifted its operations to PTP from Singapore. This event raised alarm bells in the Singaporean port, with widespread speculation in the shipping community that Evergreen's endorsement of PTP demonstrated that Maersk's move may <b>not</b> be <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> one. Other lines have since also started direct services at PTP.|$|R
5000|$|Stochastic {{thinking}} as basis for making decisions starts with observing an effect or problem which needs a decision. The effect is considered <b>not</b> as <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> event {{but as an}} outcome of the whole system, which admitted its occurrence.

25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 of these girls were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services. More information concluded from the research {{is that there are}} more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are teen girls who died by suicide, homicide, and accidents in the state in one year.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} anti-disco {{incidents}} took place {{elsewhere in the}} first half of 1979, showing that [...] "the Disco Demolition was <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> incident or an aberration."

In New York, a rock deejay played Donna Summer's sexualized disco hit, [...] "Hot Stuff"; he received protests from his listeners.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, later-disbarred American {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings; [...] "I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody. We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games. This is <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>isolated</b> incident. These types of games are basically murder simulators. There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis". Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £50 million in a wrongful death claim.|$|E
