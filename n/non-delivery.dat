5|$|Spain {{commissioned}} three {{ships of}} the , {{with the first}} laid down in 1909. The three ships were the smallest dreadnoughts ever built. They were built in Spain, with assistance; construction on the third ship, , took nine years from its laying down date to completion because of <b>non-delivery</b> of critical material, especially armament, from the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Her hull was {{launched}} in September 1896, but <b>non-delivery</b> of the ship's main guns delayed her maiden voyage until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 Rostislav became the first ship of the Imperial Navy {{to be commanded by}} a member of the House of Romanov, Captain Alexander Mikhailovich. From 1903 to 1912 the ship was the flagship of the second-in-command of the Black Sea Fleet. During the 1905 Russian Revolution her crew was on the verge of mutiny, but ultimately remained loyal to the regime, and actively suppressed the mutiny of the cruiser Ochakov.|$|E
5|$|Regina Margherita {{laid down}} at the La Spezia {{shipyard}} on 20 November 1898. She was launched on 30 May 1901 {{in the presence of}} King Victor Emmanuel, and completed three years later; she was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 14 April 1904. Work progressed slowly on the ship in large part due to <b>non-delivery</b> of material, particularly the heavy armor. In July, the ship conducted her speed trials in the Gulf of Genoa. Following her completion, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The ships in the squadron were typically only on active duty for seven months of the year for training; {{the rest of the year}} they were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Regina Margherita, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October as the flagship of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} inaugurated in September 1903 {{as the result}} of a design {{competition}} nine years earlier. The competition was won by Gustaf Hermansson, who also designed the Sofia Church. It was King Oscar II himself, after whom the church is named, who laid the foundation stone in 1897. Criticised from the start for its Gothic Revival style, it was originally meant to be partly clad in brick; this changed to a uniformly white façade, clad in limestone and marble. The construction work was delayed several times because of problems with the foundation, <b>non-deliveries</b> and labour strikes, which is why the church was not consecrated until 1903.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} which allows comparison between models under different modeling paradigms. Consider the following situation: Two {{models have been}} constructed to study {{different aspects of the}} same system. One model simulates a fleet of aircraft moving a given combination of cargo and passengers from an onload point to an offload point. A second model is an optimization (linear programming) model, which for given cargo and passenger requirements, optimizes aircraft and route selection in order to minimize late- and <b>non-deliveries.</b> The optimization model represents a much more aggregated view of the airlift system than does the simulation. The two models do not have immediately comparable input or output structures, which complicates a comparison of the two models' outputs. A methodology is developed to structure this comparison...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{develops}} a two-stage aggregation disaggregation model based on THRUPUT 2 (Morton, Rosenthal and Lim, 1995), a mobility optimization model {{used to analyze}} the ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to conduct airlifts in support of major military operations. For a given fleet of aircraft, a given network of routes, and a given set of unit movement requirements over time, THRUPUT 2 schedules airlift to minimize late deliveries and <b>non-deliveries.</b> The linear programming model presented is based on THRUPUT 2, but aggregates those units which share the same origin-destination pair and have overlapping time periods and therefore creates a smaller linear program. This reduction in size will consequently decrease the time needed to solve, which is desirable because repeated runs of this model are necessary to generate analytic insight and develop recommendations. The thesis further {{develops a}} disaggregation model which will remove the aggregations of the first, and therefore offer resolution similar to that of THRUPUT 2. NAU. S. Navy (U. S.

5|$|The {{ship was}} built by the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. Her keel was laid down on 30 January 1899, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 7 November 1901 {{in the presence of}} the King and Queen of Italy, government officials, and the whole Italian Mediterranean squadron. Fitting out work lasted for the next four years, and she was completed on 1 September 1905. It took so long primarily because of <b>non-delivery</b> of material, particularly the heavy armor. After she entered active service, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The Squadron was usually only activated for seven months of the year in peacetime, which was occupied with training maneuvers, and the rest of the year the ships were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Benedetto Brin, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. Benedetto Brin remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time the fourth Regina Elena-class ship was completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{has often been}} {{described}} as a major women's health issue, but no information exists on the extent of the problem in the United Kingdom. AIM: To investigate the community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and its effect on the lives of consulting and non-consulting women. DESIGN OF STUDY: Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING: Women aged 18 to 49 (n = 3916) randomly selected from the Oxfordshire Health Authority Register. METHOD: The questionnaire response rate (adjusted for <b>non-deliveries)</b> was 74 % (2304 / 3106). Chronic pelvic pain was defined as recurrent or constant pelvic pain of at least six months' duration, unrelated to periods, intercourse, or pregnancy. Case subgroups comprised recent consulters, past consulters, and non-consulters. Women who reported dysmenorrhoea alone formed a comparison group. RESULTS: The three-month prevalence of chronic pelvic pain was 24. 0 % (95 % CI = 22. 1 % to 25. 8 %). One-third of women reported pain that started more than five years ago. Recent consulters (32 % of cases) were most affected by their symptoms in terms of pain severity, use of health care, physical and mental health scores, sleep quality, and pain-related absence from work. Non-consulters (41 % of cases) did not differ from women with dysmenorrhoea in terms of symptom-related impairment. Irrespective of consulting behaviour, a high rate of symptom-related anxiety was found in women with chronic pelvic pain (31 %) compared with women with dysmenorrhoea (7 %). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a high community prevalence of chronic pelvic pain in women of reproductive age. Cases varied substantially in {{the degree to which they}} were affected by their symptoms. The high symptom-related anxiety in these women emphasises the need for more information about chronic pelvic pain and its possible causes...|$|R
500|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Aeroflot had {{experienced}} massive {{growth in the}} aviation market. They carried 116.1 million passengers and millions of pounds of cargo. Still, because of travel restrictions, only 3.4 million passengers were international travelers. The airline remained an almost entirely domestic carrier, getting freight and people to far off remote cities, many {{of which had been}} built by Stalin-era Gulag prisoners. Aeroflot also remained in charge of other <b>non-delivery</b> or transportation services such as: [...] "ice patrol in the Arctic Ocean and escorting of ships through frozen seas, oil exploration, power line surveillance, and transportation and heavy lifting support on construction projects." [...] Further, because nearly every single non-military airplane permitted to fly in the Soviet Union was registered as an Aeroflot airframe, Aeroflot suffered from the worst safety reputation in the worldwide industry, recording between four hundred and five hundred incidents since its creation in 1932. Many blamed Ilyushin and their engineers for the airplanes' poorer reliability when compared to its Western counterparts—namely Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus.|$|E
500|$|<b>Non-delivery</b> {{of the new}} 10-inch Model 1897 guns, made by the Obukhov Factory in Saint Petersburg for Rostislav, s and s, {{delayed the}} {{completion}} of the ship by two years. One of these guns, earmarked for Admiral Ushakov, exploded at the proving ground and the whole batch was subjected to exhaustive tests and, when possible, repairs. Guns Number 16 through Number 19 passed the tests and were delivered to Sevastopol in July and August 1899. Rostislav was able to sail to her first gunnery trial on April 12, 1900. On the second day of shooting practice the recoil mechanisms of her forward turret failed and more defects were discovered back at the base. Rostislav {{spent the rest of the}} spring having her gun mounts repaired, but the problem persisted and the Navy [...] "solved" [...] it by prohibiting them from being used. The gun mounts were rebuilt along the pattern of those used by the armored cruiser [...] in 1901 and 1902, and Rostislav successfully passed the gunnery tests in June 1902. The ship's electrical turret controls, with their 332 contact pairs, required tedious maintenance and proved too complex for most of the enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, the Landlord finds his flat burgled, his life savings gone. He {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from his middleman Uncle Seven, offering him a job to kidnap baby Lee on behalf of a triad boss, who claims the baby is his grandson. Enticed by the HK$7 million reward, Thongs and Octopus accept the job without knowing its objectives, finding out only after the Landlord has fled the Lees' mansion with the baby. Disgusted by the idea of kidnapping a baby, Thongs threatens to return him, but relents after the Landlord tells him of his predicament. En route to their rendezvous point in Sai Kung, the trio encounter a police road block which the Landlord attempts to outrun, only to crash his van down a hill. As the police close in on them, the stuck Landlord instructs Thongs and Octopus to leave with the baby. While in custody for reckless driving, the Landlord learns of the baby's value through the news. He phones Thongs, instructing him not to hand the baby over to anyone prior to his release so he can jack up the price. Over the next few days, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby, developing a strong bond with him. The two begin to regret their vices: Thongs resists the urge to gamble, while Octopus feels sorry for cheating on his wife. Meanwhile, both the triads and the police are after the baby. The triad boss, enraged by the <b>non-delivery</b> of his [...] "grandson", sends his men to retrieve the baby from Thongs' flat. Confronted by both the triads and Police Inspector Mok, Thongs and Octopus go into hiding with the baby.|$|E

We don't send letters to the Returned Letter Branch till we've tried, as you see, to get the correct addresses, and until two {{separate}} letter-carriers have attempted to deliver them. After leaving the letter-carriers' hands, the address of every undelivered letter, and the indorsement it bears, are carefully examined by a superior officer, who is held responsible for discovering any wrong treatment it may have undergone, and for having recourse to any further available means of finding the owner. It is considered better that the sender of a letter should know as soon as possible of its <b>non-delivery,</b> than that it should travel about with little prospect of its owner being found. We therefore send it to the Returned Branch without further delay, where it is carefully examined by a superior officer, to see that it has actually been presented as addressed, and that the reasons assigned for its <b>non-delivery</b> are sufficient. In doubtful cases the Directories and other books of reference in the branch are consulted, and should it be found that there has been any oversight or neglect, the letter is immediately re-issued. After all has been done that can be to deliver such letters, they are opened, and returned the same day to the senders. If valuables are enclosed, the address and contents are recorded in case of inquiry. When senders fail to give their addresses, sometimes these are discovered by bills of exchange, cheques, or money-orders, which happen to be enclosed. When addresses of senders can be discovered by information on the outside of covers, the letters are returned without passing through the Returned Letter Branch, and are not opened. When all efforts have failed, and the letters do not contain property, they are not preserved." ...|$|E
