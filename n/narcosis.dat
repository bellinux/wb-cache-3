5|$|<b>Narcosis</b> {{has been}} {{compared}} with altitude sickness regarding its variability of onset (though not its symptoms); its effects depend on many factors, with variations between individuals. Thermal cold, stress, heavy work, fatigue, and carbon dioxide retention all increase the risk and severity of <b>narcosis.</b> Carbon dioxide has a high narcotic potential and also causes increased {{blood flow to the}} brain, increasing the effects of other gases. Increased risk of <b>narcosis</b> results from increasing the amount of carbon dioxide retained through heavy exercise, shallow or skip breathing, or because of poor gas exchange in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Narcosis</b> {{is known}} to be {{additive}} to even minimal alcohol intoxication, and also to the effects of other drugs such as cannabis (which is more likely than alcohol to have effects that last into a day of abstinence from use). Other sedative and analgesic drugs, such as opiate narcotics and benzodiazepines, add to <b>narcosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} <b>narcosis</b> {{is related to}} the {{increased}} solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause <b>narcosis.</b> More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of <b>narcosis.</b> The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within a minute or two, which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates <b>narcosis</b> owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E
5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} <b>narcosis</b> will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of <b>narcosis</b> for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may have trouble with eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the <b>narcosis,</b> although severe <b>narcosis</b> may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing <b>narcosis,</b> yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that <b>narcosis</b> {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and <b>narcosis.</b> However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) emphasize that such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of <b>narcosis</b> for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of <b>narcosis</b> at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E
5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of <b>narcosis</b> {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, <b>narcosis</b> results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are {{essentially}} identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of <b>narcosis</b> {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply <b>narcosis.</b> Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E
5|$|When inhaled at high partial {{pressures}} (more {{than about}} 4 bar, encountered at depths below about 30m in scuba diving), nitrogen is an anesthetic agent, causing nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication.|$|E
5|$|A divers' {{cognition}} may {{be affected}} on dives as shallow as , but the changes are not usually noticeable. There is no reliable method to predict the depth at which <b>narcosis</b> becomes noticeable, or {{the severity of the}} effect on an individual diver, as it may vary from dive to dive even on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of <b>narcosis</b> {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes. In the event of complications or other conditions being present, ascending is always the correct initial response. Should problems remain, then {{it is necessary to}} abort the dive. The decompression schedule can still be followed unless other conditions require emergency assistance.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of <b>narcosis</b> are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. <b>Narcosis</b> reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause <b>narcosis,</b> it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of similar}} and {{additive}} effects, divers should avoid sedating medications and drugs, such as marijuana and alcohol before any dive. A hangover, {{combined with the}} reduced physical capacity that goes with it, makes nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> more likely. Experts recommend total abstinence from alcohol for at least 12 hours before diving, and longer for other drugs. Abstinence time needed for marijuana is unknown, but owing to the much longer half-life of the active agent of this drug in the body, {{it is likely to}} be longer than for alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Provision of {{breathing}} gas at ambient pressure can greatly prolong {{the duration of}} a dive, {{but there are other}} problems that may result from this technological solution. Absorption of metabolically inert gases is increased as a function of time and pressure, and these may both produce undesirable effects immediately, as a consequence of their presence in the tissues in the dissolved state, such as nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> and high pressure nervous syndrome, or cause problems when coming out of solution within the tissues during decompression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Narcosis</b> {{results from}} {{breathing}} gases under elevated pressure, {{and may be}} classified by the principal gas involved. The noble gases, except helium and probably neon, as well as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen cause a decrement in mental function, but their effect on psychomotor function (processes affecting the coordination of sensory or cognitive processes and motor activity) varies widely. The effects of carbon dioxide consistently result in a diminution of mental and psychomotor function. The noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon are more narcotic than nitrogen at a given pressure, and xenon has so much anesthetic activity {{that it is a}} usable anesthetic at 80% concentration and normal atmospheric pressure. Xenon has historically been too expensive to be used very much in practice, but it has been successfully used for surgical operations, and xenon anesthesia systems are still being proposed and designed.|$|E
5|$|Before diving, {{pinnipeds}} typically exhale {{to empty}} their lungs {{of half the}} air and then close their nostrils and throat cartilages to protect the trachea. Their unique lungs have airways that are highly reinforced with cartilaginous rings and smooth muscle, and alveoli that completely deflate during deeper dives. While terrestrial mammals are generally unable to empty their lungs, pinnipeds can reinflate their lungs even after complete respiratory collapse. The middle ear contains sinuses that probably fill with blood during dives, preventing middle ear squeeze. The heart of a seal is moderately flattened to allow the lungs to deflate. The trachea is flexible enough to collapse under pressure. During deep dives, any remaining air in their bodies is stored in the bronchioles and trachea, which prevents them from experiencing decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity and nitrogen <b>narcosis.</b> In addition, seals can tolerate large amounts of lactic acid, which reduces skeletal muscle fatigue during intense physical activity.|$|E
5|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is {{a commonly}} used {{way of expressing}} the narcotic effect of different breathing gases. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic. Standard tables, based on relative lipid solubilities, list conversion factors for narcotic effect of other gases. For example, hydrogen at a given pressure has a narcotic effect equivalent to nitrogen at 0.55 times that pressure, so in principle it should be usable at {{more than twice the}} depth. Argon, however, has 2.33 times the narcotic effect of nitrogen, and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving (it is used as a drysuit inflation gas, owing to its low thermal conductivity). Some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure; for example, high-pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity. Although helium is the least intoxicating of the breathing gases, at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome, a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon. Inert gas <b>narcosis</b> is only one factor influencing the choice of gas mixture; the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity, cost, and other factors are also important.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen <b>narcosis.</b> Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Narcosis</b> may be {{completely}} reversed {{in a few}} minutes by ascending to a shallower depth, with no long-term effects. Thus <b>narcosis</b> while diving in open water rarely develops into a serious problem as long as the divers are aware of its symptoms, and are able to ascend to manage it. Due to its perception-altering effects, the onset of <b>narcosis</b> may be hard to recognize. At its most benign, <b>narcosis</b> results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or marijuana and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
25|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than others because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing <b>narcosis,</b> yet still be affected by it.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} {{consistently}} greater for gases {{with a higher}} lipid solubility, and there is good evidence that the two properties are mechanistically related. As depth increases, the mental impairment may become hazardous. Divers can learn to cope {{with some of the}} effects of <b>narcosis,</b> but it is impossible to develop a tolerance. <b>Narcosis</b> affects all divers, although susceptibility varies widely from dive to dive, and between individuals.|$|E
25|$|Helium (He) is an {{inert gas}} {{that is less}} {{narcotic}} than nitrogen at equivalent pressure (in fact {{there is no evidence}} for any <b>narcosis</b> from helium at all), so it is more suitable for deeper dives than nitrogen. Helium is equally able to cause decompression sickness. At high pressures, helium also causes high-pressure nervous syndrome, which is a CNS irritation syndrome which is in some ways opposite to <b>narcosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heliox is {{a mixture}} of oxygen and helium and is often used in the deep phase of a {{commercial}} deep dive to eliminate nitrogen <b>narcosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Depth rules: Gas consumption, {{nitrogen}} <b>narcosis</b> and decompression obligation {{increase with}} depth, {{and the effects}} of nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> may be more critical in a cave due to the high task loading and presence of combinations of hazards. Cave divers are advised not to dive to depths exceeding the planned depth and the applicable range of their equipment and the breathing gases in use, and to keep in mind this effective difference between open water depth and cave depth. Excessive depth is frequently cited as a contributory factor in fatal incidents involving fully trained cave divers.|$|E
25|$|Henry's law - as {{pressure}} {{increases the}} quantity of gas absorbed by the tissues {{of the human body}} increases. This mechanism is involved in nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> oxygen toxicity and decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|Trimix is {{a mixture}} of oxygen, {{nitrogen}} and helium and is often used at depth in technical diving and commercial diving instead of air to reduce nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> and to avoid the dangers of oxygen toxicity.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen (N2) is a {{diatomic}} gas and {{the main}} component of air, the cheapest and most common breathing gas used for diving. It causes nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> in the diver, so its use is limited to shallower dives. Nitrogen can cause decompression sickness.|$|E
25|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of <b>narcosis</b> are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. <b>Narcosis</b> reduces both the perception of cold discomfort and shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{blending}} for {{scuba diving}} (or Gas mixing) is the filling of diving cylinders with non-air breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall {{safety of the}} planned dive, by {{reducing the risk of}} decompression sickness and/or nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> and may improve ease of breathing.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of <b>narcosis</b> {{is simply to}} ascend to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes. In the event of complications or other conditions being present, ascending is always the correct initial response. Should problems remain, then {{it is necessary to}} abort the dive. The decompression schedule can still be followed unless other conditions require emergency assistance.|$|E
25|$|Controlled {{tests have}} not shown {{breathing}} nitrox {{to reduce the}} effects of nitrogen <b>narcosis,</b> as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only {{to the use of}} nitrox. Nonetheless, {{there are people in the}} diving community who insist that they feel reduced narcotic effects at depths breathing nitrox.|$|E
25|$|To avoid oxygen {{toxicity}} and <b>narcosis,</b> the diver {{needs to}} plan the required mix to be blended and to check the proportions of oxygen and inert gases in the blended mix before diving. Generally the tolerance of each final component gas fraction should be within +/-1% of the required fraction. Analysis instruments commonly used by recreational/technical diving gas blenders are typically capable of a resolution of 0.1% for both oxygen and helium.|$|E
25|$|The {{opponents and}} {{supporters}} of chloroform were mainly {{at odds with the}} question of whether the complications were solely due to respiratory disturbance or whether chloroform had a specific effect on the heart. Between 1864 and 1910 numerous commissions in Britain studied chloroform, but failed to come to any clear conclusions. It was only in 1911 that Levy proved in experiments with animals that chloroform can cause cardiac fibrillation. The reservations about chloroform could not halt its soaring popularity. Between about 1865 and 1920, chloroform was used in 80 to 95% of all narcoses performed in the UK and the German-speaking countries. In America, however, there was less enthusiasm for chloroform <b>narcosis.</b> In Germany, the first comprehensive surveys of the fatality rate during anesthesia were made by Gurlt between 1890 and 1897. In 1934, Killian gathered all the statistics compiled until then and found that the chances of suffering fatal complications under ether were between 1:14,000 and 1:28,000, whereas under chloroform the chances were between 1:3,000 and 1:6,000. The rise of gas anesthesia using nitrous oxide, improved equipment for administering anesthetics and the discovery of hexobarbital in 1932 led to the gradual decline of chloroform <b>narcosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Stillson's {{team was}} sent to salvage the F-4 submarine. On these deep dives, the divers {{experienced}} the debilitating effects of nitrogen <b>narcosis</b> leading them to try the addition of helium to their breathing mix. The navy salvage operations then came {{under the direction of}} Warrant Gunner C. L. Tibbals who led teams through the salvage of the S-51 in 1925 and S-4 in 1927 further establishing the naval need for equipment, training, and procedures for rescue operations.|$|E
