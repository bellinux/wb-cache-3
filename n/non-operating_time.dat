The algorithms are simple, and they schedule customers from multiple queues in a Call-center. A simulator is implemented i Java to measure the customers waiting time and the <b>non-operating</b> <b>time</b> of the agents. The algorithms are compared to each other so that the best method can be chosen. An example of a good method is one that gives the customers short waiting time. Two different cases was tested. CASE 1 was set up to handle two queues with the same arrival rate. One type of agents served both of the queues, and the average serving rate was estimated to the same value for all of the arriving customers. In this case, the algorithms produced almost the same result when the arrival rate, serving rate or the number of agents in the system was changed. CASE 2 was configured with three different agent types and three queues. Each queue had their own arrival rate, and the agent groups had different serving rate, they also served different sets of queues. In this case the result from the algorithms differ. The customers waiting time and the agents <b>non-operating</b> <b>time</b> was dependent on the choice of algorithm. When the arrival rate was changed, the static algorithm type gave increased waiting time for the customers in the queue where the arrival rate increased. The customers in the other queues did just get a insignificance increase in their waiting time. For dynamic queue scheduling the result was a little different. When the arrival rate increased in one queue, the waiting time increased in all queues in the system. This is because these algorithms analyse each queue load before an customer is picked from a queue. The agents <b>non-operating</b> <b>time</b> decreased more when a dynamic algorithm was used to schedule the next customer. The reduction of the <b>non-operating</b> <b>time</b> and the degree of increase in waiting time shows that dynamic algorithms should be chosen if the system is going to have high performance and scalability...|$|E
40|$|This project aims to {{understand}} and propose improvements about the competitive advantage to export Iron Ore via the Vale’s Maritime Terminal Ponta da Madeiral (PDM) in the northeast of Brazil, through the enhancement of its infrastructures and processes. This {{is one of the}} world’s largest ports operated by Vale SA and accounts for 10 % of the worlds Iron Ore cargo mevements. Vale {{is one of the largest}} mining company and one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world with market capitalization of around US$ 100 billion. It is the world’s largest producer of Iron Ore and pellets, key raw materials for steelmaking 2. Over the last 70 years, it produced more than 5 billion metric tons of Iron Ore 3. In fact, Vale in doing some multibillionaires projects to increase its Iron Ore output export through the PDM port. China is the major Iron Ore market driver, because it consumes more than 60 % of the market share. In 2014, because of China’s slowdown economy, the Iron Ore prices declined around 50 % of its value. The last day of 2014, the Iron Ore price was US$ 68. 80 ton 4. Vale break-even costs in 2015 lies between USD$ 37 /ton and US$ 41 /Ton 5. Therefore, Vale needs to get competitive advantage to overcome its major’s competitors, BHP (Anglo-Australian) and Rio Tinto (British-Australian) which have lower break-even (US$ 31 /Ton or 32 /Ton CFR), so it can offer Iron Ore at a better price 6. We interviewed and collected data from reliable sources such as Vale Management and Operations teams in Brazil and Brazilian Maritime Government authorities. We analyzed the main issues in the PDM Port related to the export of Iron Ore, and proposed recommendations to the enhancement of its infrastructures and processes, so Vale Management can use it for decision-making. In our findings, we realized that the port had ships cracking at least twice in the port, which affected its operations during this <b>non-operating</b> <b>time.</b> Moreover, Vale multibillionaires projects will increase its Iron Ore output that will choke the port capacity to export Iron Ore since it does not have yet appropriate infrastructure for this increase in supply. In addition, in our research we perceived that the port has issues with locals because of the port enhancement projects. We recommended the use of a Cargo Plan to avoid ships cracking, the construction of another Pier and 11 stockyards, the creation of Communities Councils to deal with locals involved in Vale projects. Last, we believe that the port could use its existent infrastructure to diversify its exports, increasing its agriculture commodities exports, since Iron Ore is not a renewable commodity...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} ten years, the {{practice}} of greenhouse farming has been used {{on a large scale}} in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agriculture production of most of these greenhouses was directed to the production of vegetable crops because of their high profit and the relatively short season. Data were collected from greenhouses farms in the central region of the Kingdom. The collected data included a survey of mechanical and manual operations, house dimensions, operations and machines used, and machinery operating patterns inside the houses. The measurements included working width and operating and <b>non-operating</b> <b>times.</b> Actual operating speed was determined as well as field capacity and field efficiency for the various mechanical and manual operations. The average operating speeds was 3. 28, 2. 65, 1. 97, 4. 1 and 0. 83 km/hr for plowing, cultivating, ridging, line opening, and spraying respectively. It was found that the speed of tillage operations was less than that of the speeds in the open fields by 60 ¬ 80 %. This also was reflected on the values of field efficiency which was very low in specific for plowing, cultivating and ridging. The average values was 60. 7, 53. 1, and 57. 1 %, while the actual field capacity for the same operations was as follow: 0. 298. 0. 184 and 0. 166 ha/hr. The field efficiency and field capacity was directly affected by the Lower speeds as well as other factors such as: improper size of tractor and machine, the orientation of the house, the operating pattern and the obstacles inside the house...|$|R
