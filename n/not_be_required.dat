5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks. Their research was accorded a low priority, owing to expectations that a gun-type nuclear weapon design would work for both uranium-235 and plutonium, and implosion technology would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b>|$|E
5|$|Members of the Force were {{exempt from}} {{service as a}} peace officer or parish officer, {{and could not be}} {{compelled}} to serve on a jury; field officers could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to serve as a high sheriff. Officers of the Force who were sheriffs were discharged from performing this duty when embodied, with the responsibility taken by the under sheriff. Accepting a commission as an officer of the Force did not vacate the seat of a Member of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{along with}} the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division, {{remained}} in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of the partisans, who had laid claim to the city. It was not until mid-June that the partisans withdrew from the city. It would be several more weeks before it was determined by the New Zealand government that the division would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for service in the Pacific theatre of operations. However, the longest serving men of the regiment had been steadily returning to New Zealand on furlough since early 1944, and most were not required to come back to active service. By the end of August, the last elements of the regiment had withdrawn from Trieste to wintering positions near Florence. In mid-September, it was decided to send the latest reinforcement drafts, then assembling in New Zealand, to Japan to serve as an occupation force (Jayforce) and that the men of 20th Armoured Regiment would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b> This accelerated the demobilisation process and accordingly the regiment was officially disbanded on 2 December 1945.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{attended}} {{a series of}} crisis meetings in Chicago with Connant, Groves, Arthur Compton, Kenneth Nichols and Enrico Fermi. It was agreed that the isotopes could not be separated, so high-purity plutonium would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b> Thomas therefore decided to disband his plutonium purification team. The Los Alamos laboratory {{then turned to the}} technologically much more difficult task of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|After leaving West Ham, Greaves put {{on weight}} and did not attend a match as either a player or a spectator for two years. Drinking formed {{a large part of}} his life and he became an alcoholic; at times he was {{drinking}} 20 pints of lager during the day and consuming a bottle of vodka in the evening. He later admitted that he was also regularly driving whilst drunk during this period. Seeking an answer to his alcoholism, Greaves decided to return to football at a lower level where he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to be as fit as he had been whilst playing in the Football League. He started playing for his local side, Brentwood, and made his debut on 27 December 1975 in a 2â€“0 defeat to Witham Town.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all be incorporated into the new complex.|$|E

The first {{buildings}} on the site were constructed {{for use as a}} military hospital in preparation for military casualties from the Normandy landings. Subsequently, it became clear they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for that purpose and became barracks for Navy Wrens. Bletchley Park established an outpost at the Eastcote site, known during the Second World War as HMS Pembroke V, to house some of the Bombe codebreaker machines used to decode German Enigma messages. A total of 100 machines were operated at Eastcote, controlled by 800 Wrens and 100 RAF technicians. A detachment of American personnel were stationed in a separate area, operating their own Bombe machines.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.2 was {{released}} on August 8, 2005 and added the option of One Bit Audio, used on Super Audio CDs, at up to 8 channels. To make HDMI more suitable for use on PC devices, version 1.2 also removed the requirement that only explicitly supported formats be used. It added the ability for manufacturers to create vendor-specific formats, allowing any arbitrary resolution and refresh rate rather than being limited to a pre-defined list of supported formats. In addition, it added explicit support for several new formats including 720p at 100 and 120Hz and relaxed the pixel format support requirements so that sources with only native RGB output (PC sources) would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to support YCBCR output.|$|E

Michaels then became the top {{contender for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and Diesel came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he and Diesel resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The {{commander}} of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to establish a base there if he thought it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary because he thought it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E

5|$|Neligan was {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 20 August 1914 at Townsville, Queensland, under the name Maurice Wilder, again giving Auckland as his place of birth. The AIF was {{established}} as Australia's expeditionary force {{to fight in the}} war, as the Citizens' Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). He had first attempted to enlist under his true name and age, and had told the clerk he was married with a child. When told that younger unmarried men were volunteering in great numbers, and that his services would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required,</b> he merely joined a queue in front of a different clerk, gave the name Wilder and claimed he was a bachelor. With the rank of private he was allotted to the Queensland-raised 9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade, which was part of the 1st Division, and was given the regimental number 974. Within three weeks he had been promoted to lance corporal, and by late September was a corporal. The battalion embarked for overseas the following month and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt on the Themistocles, arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, Wilder was promoted to sergeant, and he was posted as the battalion orderly room sergeant.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May, the 25th Battalion {{moved to}} the village of Sgonico, just to the north of Trieste. Along with other {{elements}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division, the battalion remained in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans, who had laid claim to the city. In mid-June the partisans withdrew from the city and several weeks later the New Zealand government decided that the division would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> for service in the Pacific Theatre of Operations. In early August, the battalion began demobilisation with long serving men leaving for New Zealand via Bari while the remaining personnel withdrew to wintering positions near Florence. In October, Barnett took over command of {{what was left of the}} 6th Brigade. This left command of the battalion in its final days to Major D. Muir, who oversaw its disbandment on 2 December 1945.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2007, Scrushy {{was sentenced}} to six years and ten months in a federal prison, ordered to pay $267,000 in {{restitution}} to United Way of Alabama, three years probation, and a fine of $150,000. Scrushy {{is also expected to}} personally pay for his time in prison and perform 500 hours of community service. Siegelman was sentenced on the same day to seven years and four months in prison, restitution of $181,325 to the state, three years probation, a $50,000 fine, and 500 hours of community service upon his release. U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller would later rule, however, that Sieglman would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to pay the $181,325 in restitution. The restitution was based on debts accumulated by the State of Alabama during a fraudulent warehouse deal, but Siegelman was acquitted on charges related to the deal. Upon sentencing, Scrushy and Siegelman were taken into custody and transported to a federal prison in Atlanta, Georgia, where they briefly shared a cell.|$|E

5|$|Still Impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler {{asked her}} to film Triumph des Willens ("Triumph of the Will"), a new {{propaganda}} film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg. More than one million Germans participated in the rally. Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted {{and did not want}} to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on Hitler's favourite opera, Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland ("Lowlands"). Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of Tiefland, but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled. Hitler was able to convince her to film Triumph des Willens on the condition that she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl. The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of propaganda filmmaking. The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to bother with the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E
5|$|The {{route from}} Victoria to Orpington via Herne Hill is {{projected}} to be amongst the most congested and overcrowded in South East London by 2026. Network Rail is considering grade-separating the two lines passing through Herne Hill so that trains would not cross each other's paths at the station's junctions; this restricts the number of services that can pass through the station. A 2008 route utilisation strategy for South London concluded that this improvement will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> before 2020 but recommended safeguarding the required land. Grade-separation is supported by Southeastern and First Capital Connect believed it should be given more consideration, but Network Rail has stated {{that it would be}} difficult to carry out the work because the station is on a viaduct and surrounded by buildings. The 2011 route utilisation strategy, which examined options for congestion relief at Herne Hill before 2031, did not suggest grade-separation as an option in the 2011â€“2031 period.|$|E
