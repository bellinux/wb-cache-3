To accomplish {{the objective of this}} study, two experiments were conducted. The first experiment considers the effect of different concentrations of IBA (Indolbutiric) and NAA (<b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic)</b> <b>acids</b> on the rooting of Cordia trichotoma stem cutting gathered from the sprout of Cordia trichotoma seedlings produced by seeds, in February 2011, using micro sprinkler irrigation, eight times a day. Cordia trichotoma seedlings were produced by seeds constituting a miniclonal garden with subsequent pruning of the aerial part. Sprouts were harvested resulting in semi-woody cuttings with 12. 0 cm long and 5. 5 mm in diameter and a pair of leaves in the apical portion reduced in a half. The treatments consisted of fast immersion of the cuttings base in IBA and NAA acids in concentrations of 0, 2. 000, 4. 000, 6. 000, 8. 000 mg i. a. L- 1 in a randomized block design with factorial arrangement 2 x 5. After 60 days of cutting, rooting percentage, roots number and length, sprouting percentage, the number of shoots and new leaves were evaluated as well as the survival and mortality. When there were differences, the averages were compared by F test at 5 % probability. For concentrations, it was used a polynomial regression analysis to 1 % by F test. The vegetal regulator IBA at a concentration of 8. 000 mg L- 1 showed higher cutting rootings. The cutting originated from seedlings produced by seeds must be better investigated {{as an alternative to the}} vegetative propagation of the species in Summer. The second experiment describes the effect of different concentrations of IBA (Indolbutiric <b>acetic)</b> and NAA (<b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic)</b> <b>acids</b> on the rooting of stem cuttings gathered from the sprout of Cordia trichotoma seedlings in May 2011, produced by seeds using intermittent mist. Cordia trichotoma seedlings were produced by seeds constituting a miniclonal garden with subsequent pruning of the aerial part. Sprouts were harvested, from the pruning of the previous harvest, resulting in semi-woody cuttings with 12. 0 cm long and 5. 5 mm in diameter and a pair of leaves in the apical portion reduced in a half.

Several biotechnological advances have been developed to solve the difficulties resulting from genetic variability in seed propagation presented by the eucalyptus species. This requires the study of diverse strategies of micropropagation which permit the obtainment and multiplication of eucalyptus clones. Thus, the objective of this study was to establish the technology for the in vitro clonal micropropagation of selected genotypes, for the purpose of obtaining high quality plants for plantations or clonal orchards in southeastern Mexico. For the establishment of the explants to in vitro conditions, the disinfestation times of the explants were evaluated, employing a combination of three levels of disinfestations with antibiotic (terramycin 40 mg/ 100 ml) and with fungicide (cuprimycin 150 mg/ 100 ml) at 0, 10 and 30 minutes, thus obtaining up to 90 % of the cultures free of contamination.

Leaf explants were cultured in media containing different concentrations of cytokinins. After determining {{the most effective}} cytokinin and cytokinin concentration, we tested the effects of various auxins at different concentrations on the regeneration efficiency and growth of shoots from excised leaf segments. Among the cytokinins tested, zeatin supplementation resulted in the highest shoot initiation efficiency, largest number of shoots per explant, and longest shoots after 6 weeks of culture. In this study, zeatin in combination with an auxin, <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> was highly effective for inducing shoot regeneration. Among the cytokinin/auxin combinations tested, supplementation of the culture medium with 1 mg/L zeatin and 0. 1 mg/L <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> resulted in {{the greatest number of}} shoots per explant (8. 3), highest regeneration efficiency (93 %), and longest shoot length (27 mm).

However, the micropropagation rate is low in yam. We investigated in vitro, the rate of production of new nodes at some Plant growth regulator regimes applied at specific growth phases of yam. Three concentrations each of uniconazole-p (UP), gibberellic, jasmonic (JA) and <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> (NAA) <b>acids</b> were applied at single node and primary nodal complex (PNC) formation phases in a split-plot design using two genotypes each of white and water yams. Number of nodes per plantlet was recorded after 16 weeks. The number of new nodes varied significantly with genotype by growth phase interaction and the main effect of PGRs. After 16 weeks, the control, 1. 7 µM UP and 0. 03 µM JA had highest means of 7, 9 and 8 nodes per plantlet compared to 2 - 3 nodes in the GA treatments. Thus, 4, 900, 8, 100 and 6, 400 plantlets can be obtained in I year from a 100 -node plant. In D. alata genotypes, addition of PGRs at PNC doubled the number of nodes per plantlet relative to addition at single node stage, while the effect of stage varied with genotype in D. rotundata. There is an important role for GA and its inhibitor-UP on the rate of yam micropropagation. Optimum multiplication rates can be achieved if the right PGR is applied at a standardized growth phase of a particular genotype.

I. Khan during 2004. The data revealed significant effect of different levels of growth regulators and growing media on the rose establishment parameters viz., plant height, plant spread, number of primary shoots, secondary shoots and survival percentage. Maximum plant height (134. 2 cm), plant spread (46. 3 cm), primary shoots (6. 3), secondary shoots (25) and survival percentage (94. 72 %) were recorded when the rose cuttings were applied with NAA {{at the rate of}} 50 mg L - 1. Among the plant growth regulators, <b>Naphthalene</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (NAA) was found to be superior to indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) for its stronger effect regarding all parameters. The optimum level of <b>Naphthalene</b> <b>Acetic</b> <b>Acid</b> (NAA) was found in the range of 50 and 75 mg L - 1, while no such conclusion could be drawn for indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) as all growth parameters were linearly increased up to the highest concentrations of IAA i. e., 100 mg L - 1. Regarding growing media, the leaf mould appeared the best in terms of its positive effect on establishment of rose cuttings by giving the maximum plant height (125. 1 cm), plant spread (37 cm), primary shoots (5. 2), secondary shoots (19. 48) and survival percentage (85. 67 %), followed by soil + leaf mould, while soil media was least effective...|$|E

40|$|An auxin-binding protein can be solubilized from microsomal {{membranes}} of Zea mays {{using either}} Triton X- 100 extraction of the membranes or buffer extraction of the acetone-precipitated membranes. This paper describes {{the properties of}} the binding protein solubilized by these two methods. The binding is assayed by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of naphthalene [2 - 14 C]acetic acid. Binding is rapid and reversible with an optimum at pH 5. Both preparations show similar molecular weights by gel filtration (80, 000 daltons) at pH 7. 6 and 0. 1 molar NaCl, and both aggregate at low ionic strength. They appear to be the same active molecular species. The binding activity is destroyed by trypsin, pronase or para-chloromercuribenzoic acid, but not significantly reduced by phospholipase C, DNase, RNase, or dithioerythritol. Since saturating amounts of <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> protect the molecule from inhibition by para-chloromercuribenzoic acid, it is concluded that the binding protein has a sulfhydryl group at the binding site, or protects such a group in its binding conformation. The dissociation constant of the protein for <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is 4. 6 × 10 − 8 molar with 30 picomoles of sites per gram of tissue fresh weight. Binding constants were estimated for 13 other natural and synthetic auxins by competition with naphthalene[2 - 14 C]acetic acid. Their dissociation constants are in general agreement with published values for their binding to intact membranes and their biological activity, although several exceptions were noted. A supernatant factor from the same tissue changes the apparent affinity of the protein for <b>naphthalene</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid.</b> This factor may be the same one as has been previously reported to alter the affinity of intact microsomes for auxin...|$|E

This study explores two evolutionary engineering strategies for the improvement of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{tolerance of}} the xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae RWB 218, whose anaerobic growth on xylose at pH 4 is inhibited at <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations > 1 g L(- 1) : (1) sequential anaerobic, batch cultivation (pH 4) at increasing <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations and (2) prolonged anaerobic continuous cultivation without pH control, in which acidification by ammonium assimilation generates selective pressure for <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance. After c. 400 generations, the sequential-batch and continuous selection cultures grew on xylose at pH≤ 4 with 6 and 5 g L(- 1) <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> respectively. In the continuous cultures, the specific xylose-consumption rate had increased by 75 % to 1. 7 g xylose g(- 1) biomass h(- 1).

At pH 4. 5 the fastest mass doubling time was 36 h, and the highest <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration reached was 4. 5 g/liter. Generally, as the pH was decreased from 6. 0 and the initial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration increased, the mass doubling time increased, and the final <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration decreased.

Weak <b>acids</b> such as <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and formic acid are troublesome inhibitors restricting efficient microbial conversion of the biomass to desired products. To improve our understanding of weak acid inhibition, and to identify engineering strategies to reduce <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> toxicity, the highly acetic-acid-tolerant yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii was studied. The impact of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> membrane permeability on <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance in Z. bailii was investigated with particular focus on how the previously demonstrated high sphingolipid content in the plasma membrane influences <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> tolerance and membrane permeability. Through molecular dynamics simulations we concluded that membranes with a high content of sphingolipids are thicker and more dense, increasing the free energy barrier for the permeation of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> through the membrane. Z. bailii cultured with the drug myriocin, known to decrease cellular sphingolipid levels, exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> while growth in medium without <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> was unaffected by the myriocin addition.
