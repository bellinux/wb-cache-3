We argue that the results are driven by the fact that compared with SOE issuers, NSOE issuers have more incentives to signal their earnings quality to avoid adverse selection by the investors, and/or reputable underwriters are more influential over their clients in mitigating earnings management.

40|$|The {{existing}} {{literature on the}} role of underwriters has concentrated on underwriter certification, monitoring and marketing. However, these studies have apparently ignored the market timing role often ascribed to underwriters by practitioners. This study examines whether IPO timing {{is a function of the}} reputation of underwriters who have expertise in the financial market. In their advisory role, underwriters advise their client firms on offer timing, in addition to pricing decisions and, ultimately, distributing the shares to investors. Unlike auditors, lawyers and engineers, who are responsible only for specific elements of registration statements, underwriters are responsible for the timing decision, relying on information from all parties to the offering, knowledge of the issuer's industry performance, and expertise gained in continuous market participation. The more reputable underwriters have a comparative advantage in analyzing financial markets, because of scale economies in information acquisition and in search, than their less reputable counterparts. The more reputable underwriters are able to search more efficiently because of superior expertise in the <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> <b>market</b> gained from extensive experience, and because of a more extensive customer base. Because of the benefits from successful timing and the costs of poor timing advice, underwriters ' reputation and, thus, value will depend in part on how well they time IPOs.

40|$|Through four essays, {{this thesis}} investigates {{different}} aspects of new issues of common equity in Canada. The first three essays consider initial public offerings (IPOs) and the fourth essay examines seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). The short-run intraday behaviour of Toronto Stock Exchange (ME) IPOs are examined first. Initial trading volume and number of trades for underpriced (overpriced) issues is unusually high (low) indicating that informed investors are active (inactive). Liquidity is consistently lower for overpriced issues. The typical investor Will probably not earn positive returns from IPO investment since median returns are consistently zero over the short-run. Amortized spreads are large and are driven primarily by unusually large share turnover {{at the start of}} secondary market trading. A four-moment market model indicates that the shape of the distribution of returns is important in explaining IPO returns. The overallotment option (OAO) gives underwriters the right to acquire additional shares from the firm at the offer price (less fees). It has been suggested that one use of the OAO is to stabilize price. Several aspects of stabilization in the <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> <b>market</b> in Canada are examined in order to establish its presence and to determine the role played by the OAO. Although there are indications that prices are being stabilized at the start of secondary market trading, the OAO {{does not seem to have}} a clear impact in terms of supporting prices. On the other hand, the OAO does have a positive effect on underwriter fees which implies that the reluctance of Canadian issuing firms to grant OAOs may be justified. Next a sample of underwriter fees for TSE listed common equity IPOs is examined. Mean fees for Canadian IPOs are less than one percent below fees charged by U. S. underwriters over a similar period of time. There is some apparent clustering of fees at 6 % for medium sized IPOs, but different from U. S. IPOs, this fee concentration is cyclical rather than increasing over time. An analysis of fees charged by Canadian brokerage firms suggests that while fees are high relative to those charged by brokerages in countries other than the U. S., evidence in favour of collusion is weak. Efforts in Canada to reduce the country's dependence on natural resources are not directly observable in the capital markets with resource firms remaining prominent in the issuance of seasoned equity. Amortized spreads are much smaller for SEOs than IPOs since lower share turnover effectively distributes transactions costs over longer holding periods. Consistent with the literature, negative and positive announcement period abnormal returns are identified for non-resource public offerings and private placements. Pre-announcement abnormal returns and offering type are important in explaining announcement period abnormal returns...|$|E

40|$|Underpricing of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> relates {{negatively}} to underwriter reputation in studies covering the US {{during the early}} 1970 s until 1997 but positively in one study of IPOs from 1992 - 4. This paper investigates whether IPO underpricing depends on {{the organization of the}} financial system, whether underwriter reputation is a consistent indicator of firm quality and therefore (negatively) of underpricing, and whether this reputation effect also appears in completely different contexts. The study also looks for truncation in the observed returns distributions that may hint at price support activities on the part of underwriters. To answer these questions, the study presents evidence on <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> of stocks and their one-day returns in the Berlin market of 1882 - 1892 along with parallel data from the New York markets of 1998 - 2000. Despite what appear to be major institutional differences between the US and Germany, underpricing and its correlates are remarkably similar in the two cases: median underpricing is nearly the same in the two samples. Strikingly, the link between underwriter reputation and underpricing is positive both in the U. S. of recent years and in Berlin of the 1880 s. This finding is in stark contrast with those for the US in the 1970 s and 80 s. The trade off between prices and rationing faced by underwriters might result in this instability in the reputation-underpricing link. Finally, the observed distributions of first-day returns for both markets display marked skewness toward positive values ? a pattern that is consistent with left censoring and quite possibly with underwriter price supports. These results support a number of conclusions: first, either underwriter reputation is a poor signal of firm quality or firm quality is positively related to underpricing in certain circumstances; second, the largest and most prestigious underwriters may exert market power or at least provide more or better service in return for their higher indirect costs; third, the relationship between underwriter reputation or market share and underpricing clearly varies dramatically over time and across countries; and finally, financial system design?in particular, universal and relationship banking?may have little impact on the performance of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> <b>markets.</b> Given the German results, one should conclude either that significant information asymmetries exist despite universality and formal relationships in the banking system or that information problems are unnecessary for the emergence of underpricing...|$|R
40|$|The {{puzzle of}} {{hot and cold}} <b>issue</b> <b>markets</b> has {{attracted}} substantial interest in the academic community. The behavior of IPO volume and initial returns over time is well documented respectively (see, Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975), Ritter (1984), Rock (1986), McGuinness (1992), Lee, Taylor, and Walter (1999) and Lowry (2003)). Few studies, however, investigate the dynamic interrelationship between IPO volume and initial returns. This paper uses a simultaneous equations approach to study the endogenous interrelationship between IPO volume and initial return. We find that higher IPO volume causes higher initial returns, but not vice versa. Furthermore, lagged IPO volume is significantly negatively related to initial returns. In other words, the underpricing of a <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> is affected by not only the concurrent number of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> at the mean time {{but also by the}} numbers of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> in prior periods. Another purpose of our study is to test the hypothesis that technological innovation is the main driver behind hot <b>issue</b> <b>markets.</b> Welch (1989) and Hoffmann-Burchardi (2001) suggest that the clustering of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> is caused by IPO volume spikes in industries that have recently experienced technological innovations or favorable productivity shocks.

40|$|Every MBA {{program that}} I have taught in has some Asian {{students}}, {{and in some}} Asian societies, such as Korea, {{it is common for}} a student to give a gift to a teacher {{at the end of the}} year. Some Korean students continue this practice when they are students in the U. S., and over the years I have received a number of gifts from students. Most of these gifts fall into the category of trinkets and knick-knacks, and I would guess that the average value of these gifts has been about twenty dollars. I typically accept these gifts when offered, and sometimes I even remember the student’s name. I don’t think that many people would consider my acceptance of these gifts after the end of a semester as unethical behavior. I haven’t been faced with the decision, but what would I do if I was offered a gift of a work of art, a gift worth $ 200 ? And what if I could sell this gift (I would wait until after the student graduated and left town, of course), and pocket the $ 200 ? Would accepting this gift be unethical? Would it change my behavior? What if the work of art was worth $ 10, 000, but the Korean student let me know in advance of the final exam that he or she only gave gifts to professors in classes where an ‘A’ was received? Would this affect my decisions on what grade to give this student, especially if it turned out the student was right on the borderline between an A and a B when I was making up the grade distribution? What if the student didn’t tell me this in advance, but I had learned from experience that I would receive much more valuable gifts from Korean students if they received high grades? Would it be OK for me to accept significant gifts from students who received high grades if other professors were doing so? In other words, if it was “standard industry practice?” Because this article is about the <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> <b>market,</b> I will not discuss further the ethical problems associated with professors who give high grades to students and receive gifts in return.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} anomaly of {{corporation}} finance that initial public offerings (IPOs) tend to be underpriced. That is, it appears that shares tend to be offered at a price that is below what the market would bear. Scholars have offered several explanations, most of which focus on various sorts of underwriter opportunism (and insider acquiescence therein). But {{it is difficult to}} believe that competition among underwriters does not force offerings to be made at the highest possible price, particularly in view of the numerous alternatives to traditional underwriting methods that have arisen in recent years. The persistence of underpricing suggests that it may be attributable to market forces. In this paper, I consider the reasons why firms go public and how the reason for a public offering might affect the method used. Based on analysis of the reasons why firms go public and the means by which they do so, I surmise that underpricing may be attributable to an inherent discount imposed by the market as the price of access to liquidity. Indeed, the notion of underpricing is somewhat misleading. It would be more accurate {{to think of it as}} akin to a negative takeover premium. The fact that a bidder must pay a premium to acquire control of a target is unremarkable even if one assumes that the market is efficient. Similarly, it is only natural that a firm that wants to sell stock to the public must do so at something of a discount. In addition, this discount may be attributable to some extent to the need to persuade otherwise diversified investors - who largely eschew stock-picking and instead tend to buy and sell stocks with a view to portfolio balancing - to assume firm-specific risk in connection with an IPO. To test this hypothesis, I gathered data relating to the 34 IPOs made during October 1999. I find that the aggregate amount of underpricing for each offering - money on the table - as a percentage of market capitalization after the offering is relatively constant - averaging 6. 04 % with a standard deviation of 4. 75 %. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that underpricing may be related to offering size and total market capitalization. One possible explanation for how the market knows such things is that diversified investors who weight their portfolio holdings by market capitalization are willing to buy more shares of large capitalization issuers. If apparent underpricing is due to such factors, there is little reason for additional regulation of the <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R

The behavior of IPO volume and initial returns over time is well documented. Few studies, however, investigate the dynamic interrelationship between these two variables. This paper aims to fill this gap. In addition, the technological innovations hypothesis of hot <b>issue</b> <b>markets</b> is tested. Welch and Hoffmann-Burchardi suggest that the clustering of <b>new</b> <b>issues</b> is caused by IPO volume spikes in industries that have recently experienced technological innovations or favorable productivity shocks. Design/methodology/approach – This paper employs a sample of 8, 160 initial public offerings filed in the USA between January 1972 and December 2001. A simultaneous equation approach is {{used to examine the}} endogenous relationship between IPO volume and initial returns. In addition, the paper analyzes the industry correlation matrix of <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> activity and estimates a fixed-effects model based on industry-level data to examine the impact of technological innovations on <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> activity. Findings – It is found that higher IPO volume causes higher initial returns, but not vice versa. In addition, evidence is found against the technological innovations hypothesis. The findings suggest that economy-wide rather than industry-specific factors are responsible for the observed variations in IPO volume. Research limitations/implications – As with any empirical study, the results may be sample-specific. Originality/value – The paper extends the prior literature on the relationship between IPO volume and initial returns by applying two-stage and three-stage least squares models that go beyond prior methodological approaches used in the extant literature. In addition, the paper provides some of the first empirical evidence on the effect of technological innovations and productivity shocks on IPO activity.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to explore the role of risk management, {{speculative}} industry competition effect and hot <b>issue</b> <b>markets.</b> We used a sample of 260 initial public offerings (IPOs) in the Australian resource sector for the 1994 – 2004 period to test the underpricing effect. We do not find any evidence that risk management can reduce the uncertainty relating to the <b>new</b> <b>issue</b> and hence alleviate the extent of underpricing. A plausible explanation for this lack of evidence is the poor information content of publicly available disclosures regarding risk management activities of IPO firms. We further provide evidence that the underpricing returns for resources IPOs are not impacted upon by the strength of alternative speculative IPO markets. We also show that the degree of underpricing adjusts to both market return in the preceding three months and the average underpricing of resources IPOs in the 12 month period leading to the float which offers an explanation to the hot issue effect observed in the IPO market. Initial public offerings, underpricing, risk management, industry competition effect, hot <b>issue</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R
40|$|An income {{trust is}} an {{investment}} vehicle that distributes cash generated {{by a set of}} operating assets in a tax-efficient manner. The market capitalization of income trusts has grown rapidly over the past two years, reaching $ 45 billion at year-end 2002. The sharp rise of income trust valuations, the large supply of <b>new</b> <b>issues,</b> and the complexity of their legal structure have increased scrutiny of this asset class. Because retail investors are the principal owners of income trusts, the author explores whether the cash returns from income trusts are in line with the risks. The structure and valuation of a typical income trust are outlined. The benefits of income trusts and the issues related to investment are elaborated, focusing on legal and regulatory issues, corporate governance, operational <b>issues,</b> and <b>market</b> <b>issues.</b> Financial <b>Markets...</b>|$|R
