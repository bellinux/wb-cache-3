5000|$|The {{fact that}} the data can be {{accessed}} using its description, rather than location, {{can be used to}} provide end-user organizational capabilities without limiting to the hierarchical organization as used in file-systems. In a file system, each file or folder is contained in only one folder. But WinFS Items can participate in any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> relationships, that too with any other items. As such, end users are not limited to only file/folder organization. Rather, a contact can become a container for documents; a picture a container for contacts and so on. For legacy compatibility, WinFS includes a pseudo-type called Folder which is present only to participate in holding relationships and emulate file/folder organization. Since any WinFS Item can be related with more than one Folder item, from an end user perspective, an item can reside in multiple folders without duplicating the actual data. Applications can also analyze the relationship graphs to present various filters. For example, an email application can analyze the related contacts and the relationships of the contacts with restaurant bills and dynamically generate filters like [...] "Emails sent to people I had lunch with".|$|E
30|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> and {{overflow}} packets {{incurred by}} policy AT is always zero. However, {{it results in}} {{the highest number of}} transmissions and transmission error rate. The average immediate cost incurred by AT is at least 0.09 higher than DP-MDP-QC, which justifies our expectation; AT minimizes the packet delay and queue overflow costs but incurs higher transmission power consumption and downlink transmission error rate. Therefore, the long-term cost incurred by AT is not as low as that incurred by DP-MDP-QC. For policy DP-MDP-Q, the number of transmissions is almost the same as DP-MDP-QC, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> and overflow packets is even lower than DP-MDP-QC. However, since this policy assumes that the wireless channels are ideal (but they are in fact not), the transmission error rate is about 1.3 times higher than DP-MDP-QC (almost as high as AT). Therefore, the average immediate cost is still higher than DP-MDP-QC. In summary, in a stochastic environment where the long-term loss can be incurred by multiple causes, the policy that considers all such causes simultaneously outperforms those that only consider some and neglects others.|$|E
40|$|Results of {{a survey}} of the level of access {{provided}} to selected free scholarly electronic journals by academic libraries is reported. A list of scholarly journals that are available electronically without any access limitations was compiled, and for each title the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> institutions on OCLC and its coverage by major abstracting and indexing services was determined. The twenty-five most popular titles, determined by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> institutions on OCLC, were searched on a random sample of library websites and catalogs to provide a separate gauge for access levels provided by institutions. Despite approximately half the titles being indexed by major vendors, including 88 % of the top twenty-five, access levels were fairly low and decreased dramatically with the size of the institution. The Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society and Journal of Extension provide examples of free ejournals with print counterparts. Approximately ½ and 1 / 3 of the institutions, respectively, only provide access to the print versions of those journals (and in the latter case, the print version is no longer produced, so no access to the current issues is provided) ...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Sample holder for cryo-conservation {{of biological}} or medical materials (20) comprises a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> frames (21, 22) arranged along the bundle (10) of tubular, flexible sample chambers (11, 12). The spaced, rectangular holding frames form a carrier {{on which the}} process chambers are arranged adjacently. Inter-frame spacing exceeds frame thickness. The frames lie concisely together along the bundle. They form a stack (30) held by a clamp. One, more or all frames integrate data memory, or it lies between them. Sample chambers are fastened to the frame, forming a plane side surface parallel to the planar extent of the frame. Area of the sample chamber cross section varies along its length, optionally periodically. The chambers are subdivided by chamber walls. The chamber wall has pores or is a dialysis membrane. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method of manufacture. USE - A sample holder for cryo-conservation of biological or medical materials, including cells, tissues, fluids and organs. ADVANTAGE - Construction is simplified, overcoming conventional manufacturing difficulties. Handling is facilitated, especially when charging with samples, freezing and during subsequent sample extraction. The design is suitable for large-scale cryo-conservation...|$|E
40|$|One-quarter of U. S. {{households}} use a septic {{system for}} wastewater disposal. In {{this study we}} investigated whether septic system density was associated with endemic diarrheal illness in children. Cases [...] children 1 to < 19 years old seeking medical care for acute diarrhea [...] and controls resided in the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area, a population-based cohort in central Wisconsin. Enrollment was from February 1997 through September 1998. Study participants completed a structured interview, and septic system density was determined from county sanitary permits. Household wells were sampled for bacterial pathogens and indicators of water sanitary quality. Risk factors were assessed for cases grouped by diarrhea etiology. In multivariate analyses, viral diarrhea {{was associated with the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> tank septic systems in the 640 -acre section surrounding the case residence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 02 - 1. 15; p = 0. 008], and bacterial diarrhea was associated with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> tanks per 40 -acre quarter-quarter section (AOR, 1. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 46; p = 0. 026).

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{strength}} of the bank-firm relationship affects the level of cash holding, especially in the tighter period of monetary policy. We measure the {{strength of}} bank-firm relationship by holding bank ownership, bank-firm proximity (holding local bank ownership) and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> local bank ownership. We argue that remote location between firm and bank increases the cost of financial external fund, if the headquarters of firms and holding ownership bank are the same province, {{it is easier for}} companies to obtain external funding. So the {{strength of the}} local bank-firm relationship can ease financial constraint. As expected, stronger evidence supports that firms with stronger bank-firm relationship tend to hold less cash. The firms without stronger bank-firm relationship adjust their level of cash holding more quickly toward target level than holding local bank ownership firms and stronger bank relationship reduces the investment-cash sensitivity. Our findings are in line with our expectations and support both the precautionary motive for holding cash and the pecking order theory...|$|E

40|$|National audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of finding the efficient frontier with the mean-variance portfolio optimisation model. The classical portfolio optimisation problem is a quadratic convex programming model that can be numerically solved with great efficiency. However, in practice, {{it is necessary to}} consider other characteristics of portfolio performances, such as, for instance, transaction costs, restriction of <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> assets and transaction roundlot restrictions which make the problem NP-hard. We consider here the cardinality constrained portfolio problem that limits a portfolio to have a specified number of assets. To solve the problem, first we propose an exact approach consisting in using a commercially available software with a branch-and-bound procedure based on a continuous relaxation of the problem. Second, in order to solve realistic size problems in a reasonable computing time we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm based on fixation of variables which uses the solution of the continuous relaxation. Computational results and comparisons are presented for five data sets involving up to 225 assets.

40|$|Purpose – To {{replicate}} a {{study done}} in 1992 on the bibliographic availability of 55 popular culture periodicals sold by a Kroger supermarket in Royal Oak, Michigan. The earlier study asked the question whether time might be a relevant variable for the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> libraries. Design/methodology/approach – The authors searched WorldCat {{for the number of}} reported library holdings for the same 55 popular culture periodicals and analyzed the results. Findings – 34 periodicals with holdings during both periods had a median increase of 58. 4 %; but, when the 83. 5 % increase in OCLC full membership during the same period was taken into account, holdings had a median decrease of 13. 7 %. For the nineteen cases with no library holdings in 1992, eight (42. 1 %) now had library holdings including several high circulation periodicals such as Star and Soap Opera Weekly. Practical implications – Popular culture materials read by many American are still not widely available in libraries or are not entered into WorldCat, the prime source for bibliographic holdings. Originality/value – Provides additional statistical evidence on the availability of popular culture materials in libraries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the one-dimensional cutting stock problem when demand is a random variable. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic nonlinear program with recourse. The first stage decision variables are {{the number of}} objects to be cut according to a cutting pattern. The second stage decision variables are the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>holding</b> or backordering items due to the decisions made in the first stage. The problem`s objective is to minimize the total expected cost incurred in both stages, due to waste and holding or backordering penalties. A Simplex-based method with column generation is proposed for solving a linear relaxation of the resulting optimization problem. The proposed method is evaluated by using two well-known measures of uncertainty effects in stochastic programming: the value of stochastic solution-VSS-and the expected value of perfect information-EVPI. The optimal two-stage solution is shown {{to be more effective}} than the alternative wait-and-see and expected value approaches, even under small variations in the parameters of the problem.
