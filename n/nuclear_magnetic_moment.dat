40|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> {{resonance}} (NMR) is {{a manifestation}} of an intrinsic property of the nucleus, i. e. nuclear spin angular momentum.

NMR spectroscopy involves {{the study of the}} behaviour of these nuclei under suitable conditions. Analogous to other forms of spectroscopy, <b>nuclear</b> <b>magnetic</b> resonance (NMR) results from absorption of electromagnetic radiation that causes transitions between nuclear spin energy states. Absorption of radiation occurs in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Not all isotopes of the elements in the periodic table possess nuclei that are ‘NMR active’.
