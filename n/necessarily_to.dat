When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E
25|$|Nintendo sound {{designer}} Koji Kondo wrote the six-song musical score for Super Mario Bros., {{as well as}} designing all of the game's sound effects. At {{the time he was}} composing, video game music was mostly meant to attract attention, not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> enhance or conform to the game. Kondo's work on Super Mario Bros. was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games.|$|E
25|$|Sparta's {{interference}} and {{invasion of}} Thebes in 382 BC gave the latter {{a very good}} reason to join the league. However her behaviour within the league became difficult and Athens started to realise that Thebes was not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> be trusted. For example, Thebes destroyed Plataea in 372 BC, which had only recently been refounded. Athens started to think about negotiating peace with Sparta; it was while Athens was discussing this with Sparta that Thebes defeated the Spartan army conclusively at Battle of Leuctra (371 BC).|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Leone di Modena, a 17th-century Venetian {{critic of}} Kabbalah, wrote {{that if we}} were to accept the Kabbalah, then the Christian trinity would indeed be {{compatible}} with Judaism, as the Trinity closely resembles the kabbalistic doctrine of the sephirot. This critique was in response to the knowledge that some European Jews of the period addressed individual sephirot in some of their prayers, although the practice was apparently uncommon.

25|$|A {{new airport}} {{committee}} {{was established in}} March 1983, which had representatives from the large industrial companies and the municipalities of Stord, Bømlo and Fitjar. In May, the area plan for Sørstokken was unanimously approved by the municipal council. The limited company Sunnhordland Lufthavn A/S was established on 6 July 1983, owned one-seventh each by the three municipalities and four industrial companies: Aker Stord, Aker Elektro, Leirvik Sveis and VVS Stord. The company estimated the investment costs to NOK25.5 million and stated that their immediate goal was to build an airport and not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> initially establish scheduled services.|$|E
25|$|Pharmaceuticals {{designed}} to reduce stomach acid, such as the proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), {{are among the most}} widely sold drugs in the world. One PPI, omeprazole (Prilosec), has been found to lower the bioavailability of vitamin C by 12% after 28 days of treatment, independent of dietary intake. The probable mechanism of vitamin C reduction, intragastric pH elevated into alkalinity, would apply to all other PPI drugs, though not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> doses of PPIs low enough to keep the stomach slightly acidic. In another study, 40mg/day of omeprazole lowered the fasting gastric vitamin C levels from 3.8 to 0.7µg/mL.|$|E

The proposal was conditional on a peace treaty that would allow Israel to retain the territory it had captured which had been allocated to the Arab state by the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, and, contrary to Israel's UN acceptance promise, on the Arab states absorbing the remaining 550,000–650,000 refugees. The Arab states rejected the proposal on both legal, moral and political grounds, and Israel quickly withdrew its limited offer.|$|E
25|$|While annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic {{administration}} {{is a critical}} aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of re-infection, and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, {{has focused on the}} development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still {{have a significant impact on}} the high burden of disease throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Core damage {{frequency}} (CDF) is a {{term used}} in probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) that indicates the likelihood of an accident that would cause severe damage to a nuclear fuel in nuclear reactor core. Core (severe) damage accidents are considered extremely serious because severe damage to the fuel in the core prevents adequate heat removal or even safe shutdown, {{which can lead to}} a nuclear meltdown. Some sources on CDF consider core (severe) damage and core meltdown to be the same thing, and different methods of measurement are used between industries and nations, so the primary value of the CDF number is in managing the risk of core accidents within a system and not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> provide large-scale statistics.|$|E

Zakir responded that he considers the punishment for apostasy not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> mean death since Muhammed was reported in the Hadith scriptures to on some occasion to have shown clemency towards apostates, but added that if a Muslim apostate speaks and propagates against Islam under Islamic Shari’a rule then the apostate should be put to death.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> modern ones. Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity. Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's mental development.|$|E
25|$|Ramanuja, reiterates that {{inequality}} and {{diversity in the}} world are due to the fruits of karma of different souls and the omnipresent energy of the soul suffers pain or pleasure due to its karma. Unlike the Semitic religions, e.g., Abrahamic religions, which believe that God created the soul and the world out of ‘nothing,’ Ramanuja believed that creation is an eternally recurring cyclic process and hence God is free from the responsibility of starting it and causing the evils accruing from it. Instead he believed that karma, the result of the actions of Jivas (souls) in previous embodiments, causes the good and evil, enjoyments and sufferings of karma which have to be <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> be enjoyed or suffered by the Jivas themselves who are responsible for the fruits.|$|E

25|$|Tame {{reindeer}} {{are known}} to be curious, but even wild reindeer can be curious in some situations. The wild reindeer is a shy animal and it reacts very quickly to sudden sounds or movements as well as the smell of strangers. In spite of this, inexperienced animals may even approach quite closely to a hunter and curiously observe while the hunter is field dressing a downed animal. They have good hearing and a good sense of smell, but have poor eyesight. They may react to a hunter's movements, but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> his form if he doesn't move. Under the right conditions, a stealthy hunter may be able to approach surprisingly close to a reindeer, even when the hunter is in full sight of the animal. Many animals are shot at relatively close range (10–50 meters).|$|E
25|$|Reserve auction is {{an auction}} where the item for sale {{may not be}} sold if the final bid is not high enough to satisfy the seller; that is, the seller {{reserves}} the right to accept or reject the highest bid. In these cases a set 'reserve' price known to the auctioneer, but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> the bidders, may have been set, below which the item may not be sold. The reserve price may be fixed or discretionary. In the latter case, the decision to accept a bid is deferred to the auctioneer, who may accept a bid that is marginally below it. A reserve auction is safer for the seller than a no-reserve auction as they {{are not required to}} accept a low bid, but this could result in a lower final price if less interest is generated in the sale.|$|E
25|$|Historical ecology {{can also}} {{aid in the}} goals of other fields of study. Conservation biology recognizes {{different}} types of land management processes, each attempting to maintain the landscape and biota in their present form. Restoration ecology restores sites to former function, structure, and components of biological diversity through active modification of the landscapes. Reclamation deals with shifting a degraded ecosystem back toward a higher value or use, but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> its original state. Replacement of an ecosystem would create an entirely new one. Revegetation involves new additions of biota into a landscape, {{not limited to the}} original inhabitants of an area. Each method can be enriched by the application of historical ecology and the past knowledge it supplies. The interdisciplinary nature of historical ecology would permit conservation biologists to create more effective and efficient landscape improvements. Reclamation and revegetation can use a historical perspective to determine what biota will be able to sustain large populations without threatening native biota of the landscape.|$|E

25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not <b>necessarily</b> <b>to</b> the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E
