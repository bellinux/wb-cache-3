5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken {{little interest in the}} property. Okehampton Castle does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{mitochondrial}} DNA analysis, {{the black}} wildebeest {{seem to have}} diverged from the main lineage during the Middle Pleistocene and became a distinct species around a million years ago. A divergence rate of approximately 2% has been calculated. The split does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been driven by competition for resources but instead {{by the fact that}} each species adopted a different ecological niche and occupied a different trophic level.|$|E

5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with their mothers. However, they do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from their mothers and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while {{encircling}} the whole city, they do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> provided real protection against an invasion. No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed {{the city as}} many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls {{seem to have been}} designed to protect the city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been any mechanical tampering or bribery. Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E

50|$|As Aurangzeb's chief consort, Dilras wielded {{considerable}} {{influence over}} him, and ruled his zenana or harem. She was amongst the highest ranked figures at the Mughal court unlike her husband's secondary wives, {{who were very}} unpopular at court. However, Dilras did not take part in court politics and in administrative affairs as her husband did <b>not</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> allowed even her to interfere in such matters.|$|R
5|$|A {{closely related}} problem {{concerns}} sets of integers {{in which each}} integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus {{the product of the}} other integers in the set. This problem does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.|$|E
5|$|A {{large portion}} of the Persian army was trapped in its camp and slaughtered. The {{destruction}} of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, decisively ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a resounding victory, it does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been attributed the same significance (even at the time) as, for example, the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or the Spartan defeat at Thermopylae.|$|E
5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. This method of attack {{seems to have}} caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force {{trying to keep the}} pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E

"No, I can't do it," [...] Cornelia still protested; but {{the reasons}} why she could <b>not,</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped her, or <b>to</b> <b>have</b> turned into mere excuses. In fact, since Charmian had {{proposed}} it, and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> wish it, they were really no longer reasons. Cornelia alleged them again {{with a sense of}} their fatuity. She did not finally assent; she did not finally refuse; but she felt that she was very weak.|$|R
5|$|During John's {{persecution}} of William de Braose in 1209, William Marshal gave de Braose shelter on his Irish lands. De Gray demanded that Marshal surrender de Braose {{to him as}} a traitor, but Marshal refused, claiming that since he held some lands from de Braose, it would be an act of treason to surrender his lord to an outside authority. Marshal's refusal does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> embittered de Gray however, as three years later the bishop was praising him in a letter to John.|$|E
5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls and dishes do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> required extensive repairs.|$|E

5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places {{there is no sign of}} a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{felt that}} his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He {{is said to have}} been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Mellitus fled {{first to}} Canterbury, but Æthelberht's {{successor}} Eadbald {{was also a}} pagan, so Mellitus, accompanied by Justus, took refuge in Gaul. Mellitus was recalled to Britain by Laurence, the second Archbishop of Canterbury, after his conversion of Eadbald. How long Mellitus' exile lasted is unclear. Bede claims it was a year, but {{it may have been}} longer. However, Mellitus did not return to London, because the East Saxons remained pagan. Although Mellitus fled, there does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been any serious persecution of Christians in the East Saxon kingdom. The East Saxon see was not occupied again until Cedd was consecrated as bishop in about 654.|$|E

Eclipse Orion can also be used on-premises but it is mostly based on the existing Eclipse IDE for desktop applications. Cloud 9 and Codeanywhere <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> give access to their developers through mobile devices apart from web browsers. This effort does <b>not</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a wide support from the community, mostly because {{it is very difficult to}} incorporate coding functions in a limited screen of a mobile or tablet.|$|R

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{influence}} {{assisted the}} spread of Christianity throughout Europe, {{but there is little}} evidence of a direct link between the Roman Empire and Christian missions north of Hadrian's Wall. Traditionally, Ninian is credited as the first bishop active in Scotland. He is briefly mentioned by Bede who states that around 397 he set up his base at Whithorn in the south-west of Scotland, building a stone church there, known as Candida Casa. More recently {{it has been suggested that}} Ninian was the 6th-century missionary Finnian of Moville, but either way Roman influence on early Christianity in Scotland does <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been significant.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{confrontation}} between the Libyan-FAP forces and the Chadian regular forces took place at Faya-Largeau, {{the capital of the}} BET. The city, defended by 5,000 Chadian soldiers, fell on 18 February after sharp fighting to a force of 2,500 rebels, supported by possibly as many as 4,000 Libyan troops. The Libyans do <b>not</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> directly participated in the fighting; in a pattern that was to repeat itself in the future, the Libyans provided armor, artillery and air support. The rebels also were much better armed than before, displaying Strela-2 surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
