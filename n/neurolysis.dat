50|$|If {{non-invasive}} treatment measures fail, tarsal tunnel release surgery may be {{recommended to}} decompress the area. The incision is made behind the ankle bone {{and then down}} towards but not {{as far as the}} bottom of foot. The Posterior Tibial nerve is identified above the ankle. It is separated from the accompanying artery and vein and then followed into the tunnel. The nerves are released. Cysts or other space-occupying problems may be corrected at this time. If there is scarring within the nerve or branches, this is relieved by internal <b>neurolysis.</b> <b>Neurolysis</b> is when the outer layer of nerve wrapping is opened and the scar tissue is removed from within nerve. Following surgery, a large bulky cotton wrapping immobilizes the ankle joint without plaster. The dressing may be removed at the one-week point and sutures at about three weeks.|$|E
50|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{non-invasive}} treatments, including manipulation, physical therapy, rest, heat, anti-inflammatory medication, antidepressants, anti-convulsants, opioid and non-opioid analgesics, and migraine prophylaxis medication.

50|$|The {{earliest}} descriptions about hemifacial spasm is by Shultze in 1875 and Gowers in 1899. The {{etiology of}} hemifacial spasm {{and location of}} the abnormality have been debated {{for more than a}} century. Surgical treatment for hemifacial spasm in the early 20th century included <b>neurolysis</b> (destruction of nerve tissue), stretching the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve), and high-pressure irrigation of the nerve with lactate ringer's solution. The medical regimens of that time involved injection of the nerve with ethanol, electrical stimulation, application of toxic compounds (nitrate of silver, zinc, arsenic, bromides) as well as medications such as Dilantin or other anticonvulsants.|$|E

50|$|The {{first line}} of {{treatment}} is often to treat the patients pain with neuropathic drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. The second lines of drugs to treat pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, tramadol, and opioids. Other techniques used to facilitate healing of the nerve and pain are either static or dynamic splinting that can both help protect the injured part as well as improve function. Sometimes surgery is an option, although the prognosis is still very poor of regaining function of the affected nerve. The goal of surgery is to join healthy nerve to unhealthy nerve. The most common surgical techniques include external <b>neurolysis,</b> end-to-end repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfer from somewhere else in the body.|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} a variety of classifications of winged scapula, {{there is a}}lso more than one type of treatment. Massage Therapy is an {{effective}} initial approach to relax the damaged muscles. In more severe cases, Physical Therapy can help by strengthening effected and surrounding muscles. Physical therapy constitutes treatment options if there is weakness of the glenohumeral joint muscles, but if the muscles do not contract clinically and symptoms continue to be severe for more than 3-6 months, surgery may be the next choice. Surgery by fixation of the scapula to the rib cage can be done for those with isolated scapular winging. Some options are <b>neurolysis</b> (chordotomy), intercostal nerve transfer, scapulothoracic fusion, arthrodesis (scapulodesis), or scapulothoracis fixation without arthrodesis (scapulopexy).|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{approaches}} {{have also been}} used successfully in TOS. Microsurgery can be used approaching the area from above the collar bone (supraclavicular) followed by <b>neurolysis</b> of the brachial plexus, removal of the scalene muscle (scalenectomy), {{and the release of}} the underlying (subclavicular) blood vessels. This approach avoids the use of resection, and {{has been found to be}} an effective treatment. In cases where the first rib (or a fibrous band extending from the first rib) is compressing a vein, artery, or the nerve bundle, part of the first rib and any compressive fibrous tissue, can be removed in a first rib resection surgical procedure; scalene muscles may also need to be removed (scalenectomy). This allows increased blood flow and the reduction of nerve compression. In some cases there may be a rudimentary rib or a cervical rib that can be causing the compression, which can be removed using the same technique.|$|E
50|$|Precise {{knowledge}} about the length and exact localization of a damaged nerve segment is essential for surgical intervention. On one hand, certain preoperative information about the overall state of an injured nerve (state of the neural and perineural tissue) is important because exploratory inspection of a nerve itself may lead to additional inadvertent damage. If, on the other hand, the surgeon, during genicular ligament reconstruction, inspects a nerve {{at the site of}} most probable injury only (limited <b>neurolysis),</b> he or she may sometimes by chance expose an unaffected section of a nerve. Because of the mechanism of nerve injury during traction, however, a more proximal or distal segment of the nerve may be severely damaged. A limited nerve inspection without preoperative {{knowledge about}} the site of nerve injury may thus give the false impression of an unimpaired nerve and wrongly lead to conservative treatment of the nerve lesion. If no neurologic improvement is shown after 2-3 months from injuries, then operative decompression is indicated. Surgical operations such as grafting and tendon transfer are necessarily required.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{arthrodesis}} {{destroys the}} cartilage of the joint, producing ankylosis, {{and may also}} reduce pain immediately due to <b>neurolysis.</b> Often intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA) or ethyl alcohol is used. Ethyl alcohol has several advantages over MIA, including decreased pain (MIA produces severe pain for several hours following injection), lower cost, and easy access. Chemical arthrodesis is commonly performed to treat osteoarthritis of the lower hock joints. These joints have little motion and can fuse without affecting {{the movement of the}} horse. Chemical arthrodesis has the potential to greatly improve chronic lameness which is not responding to IA anti-inflammatories, but carries the risk of severe complications, including joint sepsis, cellulitis, and severe lameness. Chemical arthrodesis is cheap, simple, and relatively noninvasive, but is potentially disastrous if the proximal intertarsal joint communicates with the high-motion tarsocrural joint. For this reason, a contrast study is often recommended prior to treatment to ensure no communication occurs between the two joints. Chemical arthrodesis has the potential to damage the joint cartilage without fusing the joint, leading to increased pain and lameness. Chemical arthrodesis is less successful when used in the pastern joint, and often surgical arthrodesis is preferred.|$|E

This standardized study evaluates the value of CMAP analysis in predicting the long-term efficacy of <b>neurolysis.</b> CMAP amplitude is also used to determine the optimal extent of <b>neurolysis.</b> The left peroneal nerves of 30 rats were crushed. CMAPs were recorded for both crushed (left) and control (right) nerves. Fifteen rats underwent <b>neurolysis</b> 3  months post crush injury; the remaining 15 were sham controls and did not undergo <b>neurolysis.</b> CMAP measurements were taken after: (1) release of the nerve from the fascia, (2) opening the epineurium, and (3) opening the perineurium. At 3  months post crush injury, opening the epineurium resulted in a statistically significant increase in CMAP. CMAP increase with perineurial <b>neurolysis</b> was greater than with fascial release of the nerve but was not statistically different from that of epineurial release. At 5  months post crush injury, recovery of crushed nerves that underwent <b>neurolysis</b> was 90 % and significantly less at 70. 5 % in rats not treated with <b>neurolysis,</b> according to CMAP analysis. Two conclusions can be made from this study. First, intraoperative neurophysiologic studies can monitor the immediate results of <b>neurolysis</b> and predict long-term results in the injured nerve.

40|$|Introduction: The {{pain from}} upper {{gastrointestinal}} malignancy leads to considerable morbidity. The celiac plexus and splanchnic nerve <b>neurolysis</b> are good therapeutic options. Although splanchnic nerve <b>neurolysis</b> less frequently performed, {{but it has}} an edge over celiac plexus {{as it can be}} performed in patients with altered celiac plexus anatomy by enlarged lymph nodes. Methods: The fluoroscopy-guided splanchnic nerve <b>neurolysis</b> was done in about 21 patients with intractable upper abdominal pain with pain intensity of ≥ 7 in numerical rating scale (NRS) from upper gastrointestinal cancers with distorted celiac plexus anatomy from enlarged celiac lymph nodes as seen by computed tomography scan after positive diagnostic splanchnic nerve <b>neurolysis.</b> The demographic features, pain intensity, daily opioid dose, functional status and quality of life was measured at baseline and 1 week, 1 and 3 months after the procedure.

40|$|Background : The {{mechanisms}} of neuropathic pain are not clearly understood which {{are characterized by}} various different kinds abnormal sensation; hence the author attempted to elucidate a novel pain model that is produced by radiofrequency <b>neurolysis</b> in rats. Methods : Bilateral sciatic nerves of 30 wister rats (7 - 8 weeks) were exposed and blocked with heat (<b>neurolysis)</b> under pentobarbital anesthesia. Right sciatic nerves were treated at 50 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10), 60 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10), 70 ℃ for 45 sec. (N= 10) respectively; left sciatic nerves were not treated as a sham. Rats were placed in plastic cages for behavioral testing; posture of neurolyzed extremity, responses to spontaneous nociceptive pain and radiant heat impinged on plantar surface of hind paw. To examine neuropathologic change in sciatic nerves that were harvested after <b>neurolysis,</b> light microscopic sections were stained with toluidine blue.

40|$|Background : Unilateral lumbar sympathectomy {{involved}} {{that increased}} skin temperature on the ipsilateral foot and simultaneously decreased temperature on contralateral foot. In the neurolyzed extremity, blood flow increased {{at the expense}} of contralateral blood flow. The compensatory distribution of blood is called “borrowing-lending”　phenomenon (DeBakey. 1947), on which few reported on the account of thoracic sympathetic <b>neurolysis,</b> hence effects of volume preload on the phenomenon were elucidated under radiofrequency <b>neurolysis</b> of thoracic sympathetic ganglion in anesthetized dogs. Method : The 30 dogs were divided into three groups following pre-neurolysis level of right atrial pressure (RA) : 1) hypovolemic group (n= 10) : RA< 3 mmHg, 2) normovolemic group (n= 10) : 3 mmHg≦RA≦ 6 mmHg, 3) hypervolemic group (n= 10) : 6 mmHg<RA. Skin temperature on the bilateral costal arch region and hemodynamic variables were measured before and after <b>neurolysis.</b> Results : No significant changes of hemodynamic variables were observed in all groups. Regional skin temperature of the neurolyzed side increased significantly 5 and 20 minutes after <b>neurolysis.</b> The contralateral skin temperature simultaneously decreased in hypovolemic and normovolemic groups, but we found no change of temperature in hypervolemic group.

Presently, PAP refractory to medical management is frequently treated with minimally invasive procedures guided by ultrasound, such as alcohol <b>neurolysis</b> and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Objective: To record the immediate and long-term efficacy of alcohol <b>neurolysis</b> and RFA. We first used alcohol <b>neurolysis</b> and then, when necessary, we performed RFA on PAP patients. Study design: Prospective case series. Setting: Pain management center. Methods: Thirteen subjects were treated with ultrasound-guided procedures. Results: All patients were treated with <b>neurolysis</b> using alcohol solutions guided by ultrasound. Seven (54 %) of 13 subjects achieved pain relief after 1 – 3 alcohol injection treatments. The remaining 6 subjects obtained pain relief after receiving 2 administrations of ultrasound-guided RFA. After a 6 -month follow-up evaluation period, pain quantities were also assessed. Both stump pain (including intermittent sharp pain and continuous burning pain) and phantom pain were relieved. The frequency of intermittent sharp pain was decreased, and no complications were noted during the observation.
