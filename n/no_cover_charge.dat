5000|$|... ==Legal restrictions== According to Massachusetts law, {{subject to}} a penalty of up to $50, no cafe, restaurant, or bar can require payment of a minimum or <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> unless a sign is conspicuously posted with at least one-inch-high letters, stating that a minimum <b>charge</b> or <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> shall be charged and {{indicating}} the amount. Children under thirteen may not be charged. This law {{was put in place}} to resolve the problem of “secret” <b>cover</b> <b>charges,</b> which are indicated only in tiny text on the menu. Clubgoers would then find this <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> added to their first drink order. In Illinois, bars cannot impose a <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> unless the fee goes towards the cost of off-setting entertainment costs such as a live band. In 1995, the Italian regional government in Lazio (which includes Rome) began requiring restaurants in the region to remove the <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> for [...] "Pane e coperto" [...] (bread and cover) from their bills. In 1998, the European Union ruled that the regional law was invalid, but the region is continuing to try to abolish the practice ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cover</b> <b>charges</b> {{are usually}} much lower for local, semi-professional bands or entertainers than for better-known touring bands from other regions. In North America, the <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> for a {{performance}} by a local teenage band may be as low as a few dollars; a show by a nationally-known band with a recording contract may have a $10 to $15 cover. Some expensive jazz clubs and comedy clubs have both a <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> and a minimum drink requirement. Many sports bars have <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> when they are showing a boxing or a UFC pay per view event, to help defray to costs of ordering the pay-per-view material.|$|R
50|$|The couvert or <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> {{has been}} levied for many years, {{certainly}} in English-speaking countries by 1899. The concept, and term, was later {{used in the}} US in the 1920s by illegal bars called speakeasies, during the Prohibition-era ban on alcohol. Manhattan saloonkeeper Tex Guinan, was an early example of a bar requiring a <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> from patrons. In the US the <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> later became an entry charge where both entertainment and food and drink are provided, and carries the expectation of entertainment.|$|R

5000|$|There are booked shows, regular open mics and [...] "bringer" [...] shows. A booked show {{is usually}} booked week in advance with some lottery spots {{selected}} by pulling candidates' names from a hat. With a regular open mic, a person puts their {{name on the}} list and they go on when their name is called by the host. With a [...] "bringer" [...] show, each performer has to bring {{a certain number of}} people (friends, family members, etc.) to get on stage. Open mic shows may have <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> <b>charge,</b> a reduced cover charge, or a minimum drink requirement. Open mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English-speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene, especially London and New York. In these cities, with a plethora of aspiring comedians, the greatest challenge may be in attracting an audience.|$|E
5000|$|Open mic nights {{may have}} <b>no</b> <b>cover</b> <b>charge,</b> {{or a very}} low cover charge, {{although}} the venue may have a gratuity jar or [...] "pass the hat" [...] for donations. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling alcoholic beverages and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for her/his services. The host or MC may perform {{at some point during}} the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for her/his slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to jam sessions, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a house band or rhythm section and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end jazz club.|$|E
50|$|The bar usually {{allows the}} band or {{performers}} {{to provide a}} list of guests who will be admitted without paying the <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> ("the guest list").

As well, bouncers sometimes waive the <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> for their friends, in what could be described as nepotism or even as an illegal action akin to theft or embezzlement that deprives the bouncer's employer of revenue to which it is entitled.|$|R

50|$|Bars {{and clubs}} have {{different}} policies {{for how the}} <b>cover</b> <b>charge</b> is shared, if at all, with the performers.

Some bars may also agree to a guarantee, in which the bar promises to pay the band a certain amount even if this is less than the amount collected at the door.|$|R
50|$|Bars {{and clubs}} that use <b>cover</b> <b>charges</b> {{use them for}} several reasons.

5000|$|Many bars have a {{discount}} period, designated a [...] "happy hour" [...] to encourage off-peak-time patronage.
