40|$|Data {{compression}} {{is concerned}} with how information is organized in data. Efficient storage means removal of redundancy from the data being stored in the DNA molecule. Data compression algorithms remove redundancy and are used to understand biologically important molecules. We present a compression algorithm, “DNABIT Compress” for DNA sequences based on a novel algorithm of assigning binary bits for smaller segments of DNA bases to compress both repetitive and <b>non</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence. Our proposed algorithm achieves the best compression ratio for DNA sequences for larger genome. Significantly better compression results show that “DNABIT Compress” algorithm is the best among the remaining compression algorithms. While achieving the best compression ratios for DNA sequences (Genomes),our new DNABIT Compress algorithm significantly improves the running time of all previous DNA compression programs. Assigning binary bits (Unique BIT CODE) for (Exact Repeats, Reverse Repeats) fragments of DNA sequence is also a unique concept introduced in this algorithm {{for the first time}} in DNA compression. This proposed new algorithm could achieve the best compression ratio as much as 1. 58 bits/bases where the existing best methods could not achieve a ratio less than 1. 72 bits/bases...|$|E
40|$|Compressing DNA {{sequences}} is {{an important}} task as every day thousands of gigabytes of sequences of nucleotides and amino acids gets stored in Genbank. Storing large Genomes in a personal computer in the compressed form is an efficient means of using DNA sequences for biological functions. We present a compression algorithm, “HuffBit Compress ” for DNA sequences based on a novel algorithm of assigning binary bit codes(0 and 1) for each base(A,C,G,T) to compress both repetitive and <b>non</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequence. Our proposed algorithm achieves the compression ratio using the concept of Extended Binary Tree. In this algorithm Extended binary tree concept is applied to derieve a special class of variable-length codes that satisfy prefix property. This class of codes is called Huffman Codes. Huffman codes are based on relative frequency with which DNA symbols (A,C,G,T) appear in the sequence. The specific bit sequence assigned to an individual base is determined by tracing out the path from {{the root of the}} tree to the leaf that represents that Base. By convention, bit ' 0 ' represents following the left child when tracing out the path and bit ' 1 ' represents following the right child when tracing out the path. The extended binary tree is constructed such that the paths from the root to the most frequently used bases are short while the paths to less frequently used bases are long. This results in short codes for frequently used bases and lon...|$|E
40|$|Different {{strategies}} to search public {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) databases for intragenic SNPs were evaluated. First, we assembled a strategy to annotate SNPs onto candidate genes based on a BLAST search of public SNP databases (Intragenic SNP Annotation by BLAST, ISAB). Only BLAST hits that complied with stringent criteria according to 1) percentage identity (minimum 98 %), 2) BLAST hit length (the hit covers at least 98 % {{of the length of}} the SNP entry in the database, or the hit is longer than 250 base pairs), and 3) location in <b>non</b> <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA,</b> were considered as valid SNPs. We assessed the intragenic context and redundancy of these SNPs, and demonstrated that the SNP content of the dbSNP and HGBASE/HGVbase databases are highly complementary but also overlap significantly. Second, we assessed the validity of intragenic SNP annotation available on the dbSNP and HGVbase websites by comparison with the results of the ISAB strategy. Only a minority of all annotated SNPs was found in common between the respective public SNP database websites and the ISAB annotation strategy. A detailed analysis was performed aiming to explain this discrepancy. As a conclusion, we recommend the application of an independent strategy (such as ISAB) to annotate intragenic SNPs, complementary to the annotation provided at the dbSNP and HGVbase websites. Such an approach might be useful in the selection process of intragenic SNPs for genotyping in genetic studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{evidence}} is accumulating that dinucleotide steps other than AA/TT affect DNA flexure of AnTm (m + n greater than = 4) containing fragments. However, {{it is not}} clear whether macroscopic DNA flexure without AA/TT steps might occur. In this paper we demonstrate the anomaly in electrophoretic mobility of <b>non</b> AA/TT <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences which is a function of sequence phasing.

40|$|In vogue {{tremendous}} amount of data generated day by day by the living organism of genetic sequences and its accumulation in database, their size is growing in an exponential manner. Due to excessive storage of DNA sequences in public databases like NCBI, EMBL and DDBJ archival maintenance is tedious task. Transmission of information {{from one place to}} another place in network management systems is also a critical task. So To improve the efficiency and to reduce the overhead of the database need of compression arises in database optimization. In this connection different techniques were bloomed, but achieved results are not bountiful. Many classical algorithms are fails to compress genetic sequences due to the specificity of text encoded in dna and few of the existing techniques achieved positive results. <b>DNA</b> is <b>repetitive</b> and <b>non</b> <b>repetitive</b> in nature.

40|$|The basic {{principles}} of chromosomal organization in eukaryotic cells remain elusive. Current mainstream research efforts largely concentrate on searching for critical packaging proteins involved in organizing chromosomes. I have taken a different perspective, by considering the role of genomic information in chromatins. In particular, I put forward the concept that <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> elements are key chromosomal packaging modules, and their intrinsic property of homology-based interaction can drive chromatin folding. Many <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> families have high copy numbers and clustered distribution patterns in the linear genomes. These features may facilitate the interactions among members in the same repeat families. In this paper, the potential liquid–liquid phase transition of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> that is induced by their extensive interaction in chromosomes will be considered. I propose that the interaction among <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> may lead to phase separation of interacting <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> from bulk chromatins.

Mapping specific <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences derived from Introns of the Al vitellogenin gene reveals that these sequences are scattered within {{and around the}} four vitellogenin genes (Al, A 2, Bl and B 2) and the two albumin genes (74 kd and 68 kd). Three <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> elements present 1 n the Al vitellogenin transcriptional unit are also located in introns of the 74 kd albumin gene. This apparently random distribution of middle <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> in the two gene families suggests that the analyzed sequences are not Involved in gene regulation, but rather that they might represent unstable genetic elements.

40|$|Long {{and short}} {{repetitive}} sequences of rat DNA can be isolated and characterized. Long [> 1. 5 kilobases (kb) ] sequences can {{be separated from}} short (0. 2 - 0. 4 kb) sequences by exclusion chromatography after renaturation of 4 -kb DNA fragments to a repetitive C 0 t and digestion with the single-strand-specific S 1 nuclease. (C 0 t is the initial concentration of DNA in mol of nucleotides/liter multiplied by time in sec.) Long <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> can be driven by an excess of whole rat DNA to measure its repetitive frequency. Excess long <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> {{can also be used}} to drive tracer quantities of either long (self-renaturation) or short <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA.</b> Both the extent and the rate of the renaturations are found to be similar, suggesting that long and short DNA fragments share sequences. When long <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> is used to drive whole DNA tracers of various lengths, a 3. 2 -kb interspersion period is found.

The extent of shared sequences was studied by reassociating a labeled preparation of short <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> with an excess of unlabeled long <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA.</b> Less than 10 % of the long <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> preparation was able to reassociate with the short <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA.</b> Thus the long and short repetitive elements appear to be principally independent sequence classes in sea urchin <b>DNA.</b> Precisely reassociating <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> was prepared by four successive steps of reassociation and thermal chromatography on hydroxyapatite.

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of eukaryotic genomes consist of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> that {{plays an important role}} in the organization, size and evolution. In the case of crickets, chromosomal variability has been found using classical cytogenetics, but almost no information concerning the organization of their <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> is available. To better understand the chromosomal organization and diversification of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in crickets, we studied the chromosomes of two Gryllidae species with highly divergent karyotypes, i. e., 2 n(♂) = 29,X 0 (Gryllus assimilis) and 2 n = 9, neo-X 1 X 2 Y (Eneoptera surinamensis). The analyses were performed using classical cytogenetic techniques, <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> mapping and genome-size estimation. Conserved characteristics were observed, such as the occurrence of a small number of clusters of rDNAs and U snDNAs, in contrast to the multiple clusters/dispersal of the H 3 histone genes. The positions of U 2 snDNA and 18 S rDNA are also conserved, being intermingled within the largest autosome. The distribution and base-pair composition of the heterochromatin and <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> pools of these organisms differed, suggesting reorganization. Although the microsatellite arrays had a similar distribution pattern, being dispersed along entire chromosomes, as has been observed in some grasshopper species, a band-like pattern was also observed in the E. surinamensis chromosomes, putatively due to their amplification and clustering. In addition to these differences, the genome of E. surinamensis is approximately 2. 5 times larger than that of G. assimilis, which we hypothesize is due to the amplification of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Finally, we discuss the possible involvement of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the differentiation of the neo-sex chromosomes of E. surinamensis, as has been reported in other eukaryotic groups.

40|$|Background: The {{accumulation}} of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> during sex chromosome differentiation {{is a common}} feature of many eukaryotes and becomes more evident after recombination has been restricted or abolished. The accumulated repetitive sequences include multigene families, microsatellites, satellite DNAs and mobile elements, {{all of which are}} important for the structural remodeling of heterochromatin. In grasshoppers, derived sex chromosome systems, such as neo-XY♂/XX♀ and neo-X 1 X 2 Y♂/X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 ♀, are frequently observed in the Melanoplinae subfamily. However, no studies concerning the evolution of sex chromosomes in Melanoplinae have addressed the role of the <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences. To further investigate the evolution of sex chromosomes in grasshoppers, we used classical cytogenetic and FISH analyses to examine the <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences in six phylogenetically related Melanoplinae species with X 0 ♂/XX♀, neo-XY♂/XX♀ and neo-X 1 X 2 Y♂/X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 ♀ sex chromosome systems. Results: Our data indicate a non-spreading of heterochromatic blocks and pool of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> (C 0 t- 1 DNA) in the sex chromosomes; however, the spreading of multigene families among the neo-sex chromosomes of Eurotettix and Dichromatos was remarkable, particularly for 5 S rDNA. In autosomes, FISH mapping of multigene families revealed distinct patterns of chromosomal organization at the intra- and intergenomic levels. Conclusions: These results suggest a common origin and subsequent differential {{accumulation of}} <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the sex chromosomes of Dichromatos and an independent origin of the sex chromosomes of the neo-XY and neo-X 1 X 2 Y systems.
