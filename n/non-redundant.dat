5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly <b>non-redundant.</b> Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic data will be error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E

25|$|Human {{cancer is}} {{heterogeneous}} and recurrent cancer mutations are present {{only a minority}} of patient. Therefore, a careful and <b>non-redundant</b> design of selector is the vital part in CAPP-Seq and also the size of the selector is related to its downstream costs.|$|E
25|$|UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a {{manually}} annotated, <b>non-redundant</b> protein sequence database. It combines information {{extracted from}} scientific literature and biocurator-evaluated computational analysis. The aim of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot {{is to provide}} all known relevant information about a particular protein. Annotation is regularly reviewed {{to keep up with}} current scientific findings. The manual annotation of an entry involves detailed analysis of the protein sequence and of the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|This work {{showed that}} the black hole {{information}} paradox is resolved when quantum gravity is described in an unusual string-theoretic way assuming the string-theoretical description is complete, unambiguous and <b>non-redundant.</b> The space-time in quantum gravity would emerge as an effective description {{of the theory of}} oscillations of a lower-dimensional black-hole horizon, and suggest that any black hole with appropriate properties, not just strings, would serve as a basis for a description of string theory.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{air source}} may be fully redundant (completely independent of {{any part of}} the main air supply system) or <b>non-redundant,</b> if it can be compromised by any failure of the main air supply. From the diver's point of view, air supplied by a buddy or rescue diver is fully redundant, as it is unaffected by the diver's own air supply in any way, but a second regulator on a double cylinder valve or a secondary demand valve (octopus) is not redundant to the diver carrying it, as it is attached to his or her main air supply. Decompression gas can be considered an alternative gas supply only when the risk of breathing it at the current depth is acceptable.|$|E
25|$|UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a {{comprehensive}} and <b>non-redundant</b> database, which contains all the protein sequences from the main, publicly available protein sequence databases. Proteins may exist in several different source databases, and in multiple copies in the same database. In order to avoid redundancy, UniParc stores each unique sequence only once. Identical sequences are merged, {{regardless of whether they}} are from the same or different species. Each sequence is given a stable and unique identifier (UPI), making it possible to identify the same protein from different source databases. UniParc contains only protein sequences, with no annotation. Database cross-references in UniParc entries allow further information about the protein to be retrieved from the source databases. When sequences in the source databases change, these changes are tracked by UniParc and history of all changes is archived.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Lunney {{decided to}} leave NASA, feeling that the shuttle program had worn him out {{physically}} and mentally {{and that he was}} ready for a new type of challenge. Although he had retired from NASA the year before, he was called to testify before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology {{in the aftermath of the}} Challenger accident. While still manager of the shuttle program, he had signed the [...] "Criticality 1" [...] waiver that allowed Challenger to launch even though the joints of its solid rocket boosters had recently been redefined as <b>non-redundant</b> systems.
