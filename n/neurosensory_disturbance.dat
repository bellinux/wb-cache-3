40|$|Abstract <b>Neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> is {{a common}} {{complication}} of bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). This study focuses on the evaluation of factors affecting <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> after BSSO. Furthermore, the study focuses on the measurement of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> with easily available bedside tests, not only on evaluating the state of sensory disturbance at each follow-up, but also on predicting the potential for recovery. Moreover, panoramic radiography, computerized tomography (CT) and conventional spiral tomography are assessed on locating the mandibular canal. The study was carried out involving a total of 50 patients undergoing BSSO for the correction of mandibular deficiency. In addition, 20 voluntary healthy students participated in this study. Questionnaires, a battery of neurosensory tests and preoperative imaging of the mandibular canal were used. A high incidence of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the lower lip and chin was found after BSSO. However, recovery of sensation occurred with increasing frequency during the follow-up, and after one year sensation of the lower lip and chin returned to the presurgical situation in most patients. A prolonged <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> was more frequent in older patients, in large surgical movements of the mandible and {{in cases where the}} inferior alveolar nerve was manipulated during surgery. The bedside tests used in this study correlated well with the patients' subjective evaluation of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance,</b> and the repeatability of these tests was good. Furthermore, the sensibility testing of the mandibular teeth correlated well with the other tests and patient's subjective evaluation. Four days after surgery, sensibility testing of the mandibular teeth was an efficient test alone to predict the recovery from <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance.</b> On radiographic imaging, the risk for <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> after BSSO could not be predicted from the panoramic radiograph. Before BSSO, CT was the best method to visualize the buccolingual location of the mandibular canal. After BSSO, a clinical follow-up using a battery of mechano- and nociceptive tests in the examination of sensation of the lower lip and chin, sensibility testing of the teeth, and subjective evaluation is needed. CT should be a part of treatment planning of the patients with thin rami or severe asymmetries of the mandible...|$|E
40|$|Osteotomies of the {{mandible}} {{are designed}} to adjust improper jaw positions. While vertical ramus osteotomy {{can be used for}} mandibular setback but not for mandibular advancement, sagittal split osteotomy can be used to move the lower jaw in both directions and this surgical technique also permits mobility of the lower jaw immediately after surgery. The versatility of sagittal split osteotomy has made it widely used although it is relatively frequently followed by various degrees of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> ("numbness") in the patient's lower lip and chin. Reports of the incidence of such <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> vary widely in the literature, and the aetiology of the condition has been debated. The possible impact of <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> on a patient's impression of the treatment result has only been vaguely described. This thesis is based upon observations from a patient material consisting of 1, 034 orthognathic surgery patients, with a follow-up period of 2 years. The sensitivity of the lower lip and chin was analysed among the 818 who had undergone mandibular surgery. While vertical ramus osteotomy and genioplasty were relatively infrequently followed by <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance,</b> sagittal split osteotomy was followed by such <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the lower lip and chin in 40 % of the operated sides. Half of these disturbances were mild, the other half more pronounced. Additional genioplasty tended to worsen the neurosensory function after sagittal split osteotomy, but to a lesser degree than expected. Various other parameters were studied with respect to their possible correlation to <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> after sagittal split. It was found that increasing patient age was followed by impaired recovery of the neurosensory function. The surgeons' routine influenced the sensitivity outcome, while <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> was only weakly correlated to other parameters studied, such as type of split technique, degree of intraoperative nerve encounter, degree of mandibular movement, and type of osteosynthesis. The soft tissue dissection prior to the bone cut was suggested to be partly responsible for some of the neurosensory disturbances observed. The bed-side-type of sensitivity evaluation in the large patient material was compared with more sophisticated, objective sensitivity assessments and was found to be quite reliable. While increasing age of the patients resulted in increasing incidence of neurosensory disturbances, it was also found that the impact of such neurosensory disturbances was greater in older patients than in young ones. The youngest three quarters of the patients rated the outcome of their treatment equal regardless of existing or nonexisting <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance.</b> In the oldest quarter (aged over 35) patients who demonstrated a reduced sensitivity of their lower lip and chin rated their final treatment result significantly lower than did those with normal sensitivity. The possible effect of a dissection trauma on the nerve function was studied in an animal experimental model, The signal substances galanin and substance P were examined in the rat trigeminal ganglion after compression injury to the mandibular nerve and after transection of the nerve. It was found that the ganglion responses to both types of nerve injury were identical, indicating that a dissection compression of the nerve might result in severe damage. Conclusions: Sagittal split osteotomy was followed by <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the lower lip and chin in 40 % of the operated sides. Half of these were mild, the other half more pronounced. Older patients suffered from neurosensory disturbances more often than young ones, and were also more disturbed by the condition than younger patients were. The presently utilised dissection technique may negatively influence the neurosensory function and is proposed to be changed...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess past and present <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> using a {{questionnaire}} and a psychophysical approach in patients treated with immediate loaded implants in the edentulous anterior mandible. A group of 65 patients (age range 30 – 84  years, mean 58  years, 30 women) was enrolled. All were treated by means of three immediately loaded implants (Branemark Novum System®). A self-designed questionnaire was used for data collection. The response rate was 89 %. Of the 58 responders, 33 % (n= 19) reported <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> after implant surgery. Nine of these patients (mean age 56  years, seven women) participated in an objective evaluation and were subjected to a psychological and several psychophysical tests. At the moment of the evaluation none of the nine patients still had clinical complaints. Psychological testing revealed no statistical differences between the patients, who had previously experienced subjective complaints, and the control group. Two-point discrimination and thermal sensation tests revealed no sensory lesions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{treatment}} modality of distraction osteogenesis (DO) with {{the gold standard for}} mandibular advancement surgery. In fact we compare distraction osteogenesis with the standard of care, which is a conventional bilateral sagittal split osteotomy as described by Trauner and Obwegeser in 1957 and later modified by Dalpont/Hunsuck. The hypothesis is that DO does not provide significant advantages over BSSO in advancements of the mandible. The primary outcome will focus on <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of the inferior alveolar nerve and skeletal stability. Other patient factors such as infections, pain scores, will also be evaluated. Finally the costs of both treatment modalities will also be taken into account. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the results are described of a retrospective of a retrospective cohort study. Patients in these studies were operated between 2001 and 2004 in the Isala Clinics, in Zwolle, The Netherlands. In chapter 2 and 3 objective and subjective <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of the inferior alveolar nerve will be presented. In chapters 4 and 5 short- and long-term skeletal stability will be discussed. Because in these first studies patients were not randomly assigned to either treatment some confounders of outcome were found. To avoid selection bias and to balance known and unknown prognostic factors we decided to perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT).

40|$|Mandibular canal is {{the most}} {{important}} anatomical landmark in the body of mandible which always must be considered for implant surgery in posterior mandibular region. Damage to vessels and inferior alveolar nerve that passes through the mandibular canal can cause problems such as hemorrhage and <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Damage to the mandibular canal can occur during implant surgery. Depending on the severity of injuries, it would result in temporary or permanent <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> We have reported a case that mandibular canal narrowing occurred following implant surgery and resulted in anesthetic and hypoesthetic areas in the lower lip. Patient had a history of implant surgery in the region of teeth numbered 30 and numbered 31. The inserted implant failed after 6 years, and reimplantation was done in this area, but due to lower lip numbness in the right side, the second implant was removed, and another implant was inserted in the region of the tooth numbered 32. After 2 years, right lower lip numbness was reported again by the patient. Cone beam computed tomography images showed canal narrowing in the region of the tooth numbered 31 where the second implant was inserted.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} persistent <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> of the lingual nerve (LN) or inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) on life satisfaction and depression symptoms. Methods: This study recruited patients with persistent LN or IAN deficit {{as a consequence of}} lower third molar surgery for 12 months or more to form the study group. A control group was formed by matching age and gender of recruited subjects in the study group with patients without the neurosensory complications. Life satisfaction was assessed with Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) and depression symptoms were assessed with 20 -item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CESD- 20). Results: Fourty-eight participants (24 cases and 24 controls) were recruited. Patients with LN or IAN deficits after lower third molar surgery were less satisfied with their lives when compared to the control group (p, 0. 001).

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} {{was performed to}} evaluate differences in postoperative <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> (NSD) between two methods of mandibular advancement surgery. A total of 66 non-syndromal class II patients with mandibular hypoplasia were randomized for either distraction osteogenesis (DO) or bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). Twenty-nine patients in the BSSO group and 34 patients in the DO group were available for evaluation. Objective assessment was performed by Semmes-Weinstein (SW) monofilament testing preoperatively and at least 1 year after surgery. Six of the 34 patients (17. 6 %) in the DO group experienced objective NSD, compared to 5 / 29 patients (17. 2 %) in the BSSO group. In the evaluation of nerve function by individual nerves, 8 / 68 nerves (11. 8 %) revealed objective NSD in the DO group, compared to 7 / 58 nerves (12. 1 %) in the BSSO group.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review on complications in {{all forms of}} mandibular distraction osteogenesis (MDO) for acquired deformities was performed. Search terms expressing distraction osteogenesis were used in ‘AND’ combination with search terms comprising ‘mandible’ and terms for complication, failure, and morbidity. A search using PubMed (National Library of Medicine, NCBI), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register yielded 644 articles published between 1966 and mid October 2013. Three hundred and twenty-one eligible articles were screened in detail. Complications related to MDO in acquired deformities were reported in 105 clinical articles, involving 1332 patients. Treatments included alveolar distraction osteogenesis (ADO), mandibular lengthening, DO in bone grafts, and bi-/trifocal transport disc DO (TDDO) for segmental mandibular defects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{anterior}} mandible {{is generally}} considered a rather safe surgical area, involving few risks of damage to vital anatomic structures. Nevertheless, both <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and hemorrhages have been reported after implant surgery in that particular area. PURPOSE: With the increasing demand for oral implant placement, the anatomy of the anterior mandible should receive more attention. This review {{will focus on the}} anatomic peculiarities of the anterior mandible and the related clinical implications. METHODS: The scientific evidence on the anatomic, histologic, physiologic, and clinical aspects of the neurovascularization of the anterior mandible will be reviewed. RESULTS: Surgical complications may be attributed to the existence of a mandibular incisive canal with a true neurovascular supply. Potential risks may also be related to the presence of the lingual foramen and anatomic variations, such as an anterior looping of the mental nerve. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative radiographic planning for oral implant placement in the anterior mandible should therefore not only consider all esthetic and functional demands but should also pay particular attention to the anatomic peculiarities of this region to avoid any neurovascular complications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background. Orthognathic surgery means {{surgical}} {{correction of}} dentofacial and congenital deformities, which includes unsatisfactory facial aesthetics, malpositioned teeth, jaw malformations and masticatory dysfunction. Correction {{of these conditions}} requires a multidisciplinary approach {{with a combination of}} orthodontics and surgery. Successful outcome of orthognathic treatment requires pre-, intra- and postoperative considerations with a multimodal approach in order to minimize morbidity and enhance recovery after surgery. Developments within the orthognathic field should focus on multimodal approaches with combined effects of modern anaesthetic protocols, minimal invasive surgery and pharmacological modification of inflammatory responses. However, surgical morbidity after orthognathic surgery is still associated with undesirable sequelae such as damage to teeth, facial oedema, pain, <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances,</b> prolonged recovery time and removal of titanium plates. Intraoperative anchorage of the occlusion is a major keystone in the implementation of the orthognathic planning during surgery. Bone anchor screws are therefore occasionally required in transalveolar positions as reinforced rigid emergency anchor for proper intermaxillary fixation in cases when orthodontic appliances loosen or when preoperative orthodontic treatment isn´t indicated. Furthermore, steroids are recommended to reduce swelling, pain, nausea and vomiting (PONV) and may promote nerve healing after surgery. The multimodal effects of steroids needs further investigation, thus the optimal dosages and the timing of administration is of great interest. Moreover, removal of inserted titanium fixation plates after surgery occur due to plate related complications. The reason for plate removal needs further investigation. Finally, different general anaesthetic protocols influence haemodynamics and subsequently postoperative pain, recovery and hospitalization. It is needed to understand the recovery process and to promote mobilization of the patient after surgery. Objectives. The aim of the first study was to evaluate two types of surgical techniques for insertion of bone anchor screws for intermaxillary fixation, regarding frequency of iatrogenic dental root injuries. The second trial investigated the efficacy of single versus repeated betamethasone doses on facial oedema, pain and <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO). The main objective of the third study was to investigate the incidence and reasons for removal of titanium fixation plates following orthognathic surgery, identify risk factors predisposing removal and to explore if the patients discomfort was reduced after removal. The primary objective of the fourth study was to evaluate haemodynamics and recovery parameters in relation to two general anaesthetic protocols; remifentanil-propofol based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) versus fentanyl-sevoflurane based balanced inhalation anaesthesia (BA) in orthognathic surgery. The second objective was to evaluate long duration local anaesthesia on recovery parameters and hospitalization. Material & Methods. Study I: Two surgical techniques were compared retrospectively (n= 123). Study II: Two study groups and a control group were compared with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Repeated dose (4 + 8 + 4 mg betamethasone, n= 14), single dose (16 mg betamethasone, n= 11) and controls (n= 12). Study III: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 404) and additionally a questionnaire was used. Totally 323 (80 %) patients responded the questionnaire and were subsequently included in the study. Study IV: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed (n= 269). Ninety-four patients were audited due to strict inclusion criteria. Results. The first study revealed that the twist drill was hazardous in transalveolar positions since it could cause iatrogenic dental root injuries (p< 0. 001). The second study showed that steroids inhibited progression of facial oedema the first day after surgery (p= 0. 017). However, steroids did not reduce <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> over time. Reduced bleeding was associated with improved pain recovery over time (p= 0. 043). Patients requiring higher dosages of analgesics due to pain had significantly delayed recovery regarding <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> (p< 0. 001). The third study revealed that smoking, osteotomies performed in the mandible and additional number of inserted fixation plates resulted in more plate removal. A majority of the patients were relieved from plate related complications after plate removal. In the fourth study {{no significant differences between the}} two anaesthetic protocols were found regarding: blood loss, operating time, recovery time, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and hospitalization. Remifentanil-propofol based TIVA facilitated haemodynamic stability. Long duration local anaesthetics (ropivacaine 7. 5 mg/ml) administered at the end of surgery appeared to improve mobilization of the patient and reduce hospitalization. Conclusions. Morbidity was reduced when the twist drill was avoided prior the insertion of bone anchor screws in transalveolar positions. Steroids reduced facial oedema. The need for fixation plate removal was reduced when the numbers of inserted plates were minimized and smoking arrest was emphasized. Recovery from pain was enhanced when blood loss was minimized.

Complications including minor infection (6. 0 %), device-related problems (7. 3 %), skeletal open bite (2. 4 %), hypertrophic scar formation (2. 1 %), facial nerve palsy (1. 8 %), <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of the inferior alveolar nerve (1. 9 %), and (fibrous) non-union (0. 7 %) were seen. A new index for more detailed classification of complications in MDO is proposed based on six categories that indicate the impact of the complication and its further treatment or final results. The proposed complication index may be a useful tool to classify complications related to MDO...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the surgical complications and <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> of coronectomy and total excision of lower wisdom teeth with roots in close proximity to the inferior dental nerve (IDN). Study design: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the surgical complications and IDN deficit of coronectomy and total removal of wisdom teeth. Patients with specific radiographic signs of close proximity of wisdom teeth roots to the IDN were randomized. Results: A total of 231 patients underwent surgery for 349 lower wisdom teeth (171 coronectomies, 178 controls); 16 coronectomies failed and were removed in total. Nine patients in the control group presented with IDN deficit, compared with 1 in coronectomy group (P =. 023). Pain and dry socket incidence was significantly lower in the coronectomy group, and there were no statistical differences in infection rate between the 2 groups. Reoperation of one coronectomy case was performed owing to persistent root exposure. Conclusion: There are fewer complications in terms of IDN deficit, pain, and dry socket after coronectomy, but the infection rate is similar to that of total excision. © 2009 Mosby, Inc.

40|$|Introduction: The {{increased}} <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> and hemorrhage after surgical {{intervention in}} the mandibular canal region increased the demand for presurgical planning and proper assessment to avoid those complications. Aims: Determine the path and course of the mandibular canal of dentate Malaysian patients, mandibular canal diameter, mandibular foramen diameter and the incidence of bifid canal using the Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). Materials and Methods: The subjects for this study included imaging of 60 patients (30 males and 30 females) from the Division of Oral radiology, with ages ranging from 20 to 60 years (mean age, 47 years). The samples were selected according to gender, race and age groups. The position of the mandibular canal and mandibular canal diameter were measured at five different locations. Linear measurements were done in the coronal view just posterior to the mental foramen at 10 mm interval (D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 5). Mandibular foramen diameter and incidence of bifid mandibular canal were also recorded. The samples were imaged using CBCT and SimPlant software and data analyzed through SPSS (v. 12). Results: In this study the mandibular canal was identified in all samples with 100...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different splitting techniques, namely, "mallet and chisel" versus "spreading and prying", used during bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) on postoperative hypoesthesia outcomes. We systematically searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases (from January 1957 to November 2012) for studies that examined postoperative <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> (NSD) of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) after BSSO. Our initial PubMed search identified 673 studies, of which, 14 met our inclusion criteria. From these 14 studies, 3 groups were defined: (1) no chisel use (4. 1 % NSD/site), (2) undefined chisel use (18. 4 % NSD/site), and (3) explicit chisel use along the buccal cortex (37. 3 % NSD/site). Study heterogeneity and a frequent lack of surgical detail impeded our ability to make precise comparisons between studies. However, the group of studies explicitly describing chisel use along the buccal cortex showed the highest incidence of NSD. Moreover, comparison of the study that did not use chisels with the 2 studies that explicitly described chisel use revealed a possible disadvantage of the "mallet and chisel" group (4. 1 % versus 37. 3 % NSD/site). These results suggest that chisel use increases NSD risk after BSS...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for prognathism is sagittal split ramus osteotomy (SSRO) if the proximal and distal {{segments of the}} ramus require fixing with screws or metal plates. In this procedure, however, it is frequently difficult to avoid <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbance</b> (NSD) of the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) when the posterior margin of the ramus curves inward or when the ramus is thin (Fig 1 A, B). This report describes a new alternative procedure, intraoral vertico-sagittal ramus osteotomy (IVSRO), 1 a modification of SSRO and intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO). One of the main advantages of IVSRO is that it avoids IAN damage, because the ramus can be split parallel to the original sagittal plane posterior to the point between the mandibular canal and the lateral cortical bone plate immediately {{in front of the}} antilingular prominence. Another advantage of IVSRO is that the area in which screws can be inserted is relatively large, if the subcoronoid area on the distal segment and subcondylar area on the proximal segment are used. The 2 segments can be fixed in these areas with bicortical bone screws, with or without a cheek incision (Fig 1 C). This report introduces rigid fixation of IVSRO for mandibular prognathism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractExtreme {{variation}} in the reported incidence of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) <b>disturbances</b> suggests that <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances</b> after orthognathic surgery have not been evaluated adequately. Here we review the reported incidence of IAN injury after orthognathic surgery and assess recently reported methods for evaluating sensory disturbances. A search was conducted of the English-language scientific literature published between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2013 using the Limo KU Leuven search platform. Information on various aspects of assessing IAN injury was extracted from 61 reports. In 16 reports (26 %), the incidence of injury was not indicated. Preoperative IAN status was not assessed in 22 reports (36 %). The IAN assessor was described in detail in 21 reports (34 %), while information on the training of the assessors was mentioned in only two reports (3 %). Subjective evaluation {{was the most common}} method for assessing neurosensory deficit. We conclude that the observed wide {{variation in}} the reported incidence of IAN injury is {{due to a lack of}} standardized assessment procedures and reporting. Thus, an international consensus meeting on this subject is needed in order to establish a standard-of-care method...|$|R
40|$|The choung {{osteotomy}} (Intraoral Vertico- Sagittal Ramus Osteotomy) has developed"nsince 1992 in {{the treatment}} of mandibular prognathism. In IVSRO, osteotomy plane is theoretically parallel to"nthe original sagittal plane and thereby attempting to decrease the incidence of condylar dispacement. This"nosteotomy designed additionally to decrease <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> "nPurpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the incidence of neurosensory deficit and condylar"ndisplacement with IVSRO and Sagittal Split Ramus Osteotomy (SSRO). "nMaterials and Methods: In this study, mandibular set back surgery was accomplished upon 7 patients by"nchoung osteotomy. In addition to choung osteotomy, in 2 patients Lefort 1 osteomy was performed for"nmaxillary protrusion and for 2 other patients, chain surgery was performed. Variables such as the"nneurosensory disturbances of inferior alveolar nerve and condylar displacement following choung osteotomy"nwere investigated. All the patients were followed up one year after osteotomy. OPG, Lateral Cephalogram and"nSubmentovertex radiographies were take pre and postoperatively for all patients. "nResults: No statistically significant differences were found in condylar displacement (P&gt; 0. 5). However, Mc"nNemar analysis showed significant difference of neurosensory deficit between IVSRO and SSRO (P= 0. 001).

40|$|The {{prospects}} for extending {{the length of}} time that humans can safely remain in space depend partly on resolution of a number of medical issues. Physiologic effects of weightlessness that may affect health during flight include loss of body fluid, functional alterations in the cardiovascular system, loss of red blood cells and bone mineral, compromised immune system function, and <b>neurosensory</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Some of the physiologic adaptations to weightlessness contribute to difficulties with readaptation to Earth's gravity. These include cardiovascular deconditioning and loss of body fluids and electrolytes; red blood cell mass; muscle mass, strength, and endurance; and bone mineral. Potentially harmful factors in space flight that are not related to weightlessness include radiation, altered circadian rhythms and rest/work cycles, and the closed, isolated environment of the spacecraft. There is no evidence that space flight has long-term effects on humans, except that bone mass lost during flight may not be replaced, and radiation damage is cumulative. However, {{the number of people who}} have spent several months or longer in space is still small. Only carefully-planned experiments in space preceded by thorough ground-based studies can provide the information needed to increase the amount of time humans can safely spend in space...|$|R
