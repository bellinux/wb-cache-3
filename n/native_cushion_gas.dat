30|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} factors contributing to successful underground gas storage operations in gas condensate reservoirs is how to manage the depletion phase of the field under consideration. Excessive gas production rate during the depletion phase may lead to an increase in the saturation of condensates over an area around the wellbore, so that the reservoir could not provide the sufficient pre-planned production rate during the withdrawal season. Furthermore, the production rate may continue as long as the reservoir <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> volume does not fall below a minimum required limit. Failure to meet this requirement may lead to failure to achieve the expected reservoir deliverability {{by the end of the}} injection season. In the reservoir depletion phase, one should try to realize the maximum gas and gas condensate recovery at the expense of the minimum pressure drop while maintaining reservoir potentials to be transformed into a gas storage facility.|$|R

40|$|Natural gas {{reservoirs}} {{are obvious}} targets for carbon sequestration by direct carbon dioxide (CO 2) injection {{by virtue of}} their proven record of gas production and integrity against gas escape. Carbon sequestration in depleted natural gas reservoirs can be coupled with enhanced gas production by injecting CO 2 into the reservoir as it is being produced, a process called Carbon Sequestration with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR). In this process, supercritical CO 2 is injected deep in the reservoir while methane (CH 4) is produced at wells some distance away. The active injection of CO 2 causes repressurization and CH 4 displacement to allow the control and enhancement of gas recovery relative to water-drive or depletion-drive reservoir operations. Carbon dioxide undergoes a large change in density as CO 2 gas passes through the critical pressure at temperatures near the critical temperature. This feature makes CO 2 a potentially effective <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> for gas storage reservoirs. Thus {{at the end of the}} CSEGR process when the reservoir is filled with CO 2, additional benefit of the reservoir may be obtained through its operation as a natural gas storage reservoir.

40|$|The {{techniques}} of pressurized mining and hydraulic fracturing {{are often used}} to improve gas well productivity at the later development stage of low-permeability carbonate gas reservoirs, but reservoirs are watered out and {{a great number of}} micro fractures are produced. Therefore, one of the key factors for underground gas storages (UGS) rebuilt from low-permeability fractured gas reservoirs with CO 2 as the <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> is how to expand storage capacity effectively by injecting CO 2 to displace water and to develop control strategies for the stable migration of gas–water interface. In this paper, a mathematical model was established to simulate the gas–water flow when CO 2 was injected into dual porosity reservoirs to displace water. Then, the gas–water interface migration rules while CO 2 was injected in the peripheral gas wells for water displacement were analyzed with one domestic UGS rebuilt from fractured gas reservoirs as the research object. And finally, discussion was made on how CO 2 dissolution, bottom hole flowing pressure (BHFP), CO 2 injection rate and micro fracture parameters affect the stability of gas–water interface in the process of storage capacity expansion. It is shown that the speed of capacity expansion reaches the maximum value at the fifth cycle and then decreases gradually when UGS capacity is expanded in the pattern of more injection and less withdrawal. Gas–water interface during UGS capacity expansion is made stable due to that the solubility of CO 2 in water varies with the reservoir pressure. When the UGS capacity is expanded at constant BHFP and the flow rate, the expansion speed can be increased effectively by increasing the BHFP and the injection flow rate of gas wells in the central areas appropriately. In the reservoir areas with high permeability and fracture-matrix permeability ratio, the injection flow rate should be reduced properly to prevent gas–water interface fingering caused by a high-speed flow. Furthermore, it is necessary to monitor strictly the migration of gas–water interface by using observation wells to prevent gas escape through the edge water or water breakthrough at high-permeability zones. These research results provide a technical and theoretical support for water displacement and capacity expansion of UGS rebuilt from low-permeability fractured gas reservoirs with CO 2 as the <b>cushion</b> <b>gas...</b>|$|R

40|$|A geomechanical {{modeling}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate stability of major faults during past gas production and future underground gas storage operations in a depleted gas field in the Netherlands. The field experienced induced seismicity during gas production, which was most likely caused by the reactivation of an internal Central fault separating the two major reservoir blocks. A 3 D field scale geomechanical finite element model of the gas field was developed with realistic representation of the structural geology and juxtaposition of various lithologies across the Central fault. The model was calibrated to match the subsidence data and the approximate location of the critically stressed, reactivated part of the fault in agreement with the seismological localization of the hypocenters of the past major seismic events. The model predicted a maximum shear slip of up to 2 cm associated with gas production. Additional, but a smaller, fault slip of up to 0. 5 cm could be expected during the subsequent phase of <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> injection.

40|$|The {{underground}} storage {{of natural gas}} is a procedure compatible with the optimal management of the transportation system. The amount of gas that exceeds consumption is stored underground {{in order to be}} extracted during high demand periods. Due to the structure of the gas market, greatly affected by heating gas consumption, this translates into a yearly storage cycle whereby gas is injected underground during the warmest periods of the year and retrieved in the coldest months. The fundamental parameters for storage are: •	working gas, or maximum gas quantity that can be received during the ream cycle; •	<b>cushion</b> <b>gas,</b> or the difference between total gas volume in place in a situation of maximum flood and working gas (although it represents a fixed quantity, <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> is necessary to keep reservoir pressure and to allow adequate flows during the ream cycle); •	maximum gas flows allowed by the characteristics of the reservoir and the production units. In Italy, where storage is presently carried out only in semi-depleted gas reservoirs, it is not permitted, during the injection cycle, to exceed in reservoir the original static pressure recorded at the time of discovery. This practice, however, is beginning to be successfully adopted abroad. The storage pressure of the gas in reservoir is limited, from a technical point of view, by the ability of the cover rock to oppose the passage of the hydrocarbons and by its resistance to fracture. Particular attention is then paid to the aptitude of the storage cover rock in preventing the passage of gas. Such property depends, on the sample scale, on the rock's chemico-physical characteristics, particularly the capillarity properties. From an experimental point of view, this study was carried out on the basis of tests run on samples of formations of the Santerno Clay type, a cover rock common to many Italian storage fields. The samples belong to four fields located at depths between 1000 and 1650 metres sub sea level. The threshold displacement pressure of these samples was measured; that is the difference in pressure that must exist at the extremities of the sample initially saturated with water in order for it to let the gas through. This test is very burdensome, given the length of time necessary (up to several months) to perform it. The cost of the test and the need to extend the values obtained on the field scale make the possibility of correlating this parameter with the values of porous media, otherwise measurable, particularly attractive. Thus, the change of the threshold displacement pressure vis-à-vis the petrophysical (permeability and porosity), mineralogical, granulometrical and sedimentation characteristics of different samples was studied. Given the number and the varied nature of the values under consideration, the task, complex in itself, could not generate the possibility of correlating these values in reliable manner. The values of the threshold displacement pressure seem to be influenced by the content in clay minerals of the samples (Figure 1) ...|$|R

30|$|Knee chondropathy {{represents}} {{a challenge for}} the orthopaedic surgeon because of the limited regenerative properties of the cartilage tissue. In the last decades, a variety of treatments, limited only to focal cartilage lesions, has been proposed (Behery et al. 2014; Seo et al. 2011; Tetteh et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016). For diffuse degenerative chondral lesions, no adequate biological treatments are currently available. New therapeutic approaches, {{such as the use}} of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results when applied in the context of joint degeneration (Caplan 2005; Kristjánsson and Honsawek 2014; Pak et al. 2014, 2016; Ruetze and Richter 2014). MSCs have been reported to have a perivascular origin (pericytes), and to be able to activate and influence the microenvironment by serving as “a site-regulated drug store” (Caplan and Correa 2011). Through trophic, mitogenic, anti-scarring, anti-apoptotic, immunomodulatory, and anti-microbial actions, produced by a plethora of bioactive elements, growth factors and cytokines, these cells “sense” and “signal” changes in the microenvironment where they reside (Caplan and Correa 2011). Adipose tissue is rich in vascular niches that, besides providing a readily available source of <b>native</b> <b>cushioning,</b> could serve as a smart source of MSCs (Zuk et al. 2002). The use of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) has recently created a huge interest in the context of cartilage regeneration (Pak et al. 2016; Ruetze and Richter 2014), and both in vitro and in vivo studies clearly demonstrated their anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties (Chamberlain et al. 2007). Nevertheless, enzymatic treatment and/or cell expansion have complex regulatory issues (Ährlund-Richter et al. 2009; Arcidiacono et al. 2012; Sensebé et al. 2010). Hence, the availability of a minimally manipulated autologous adipose tissue as a therapeutic option would have remarkable clinical relevance. Based on these considerations, we approached a commercially available system that intra-operatively provides micro-fragmented adipose tissue in a short time, without expansion or enzymatic treatment (Bianchi et al. 2013). With the aid of this technology, the adipose tissue is micro-fragmented and washed until free of pro-inflammatory oil and blood residues. The resulting product has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of different pathologies (Tremolada et al. 2016). The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the 1 -year safety and outcome of a single intra-articular injection of autologous and micro-fragmented adipose tissue in patients affected by diffuse degenerative chondral lesions.|$|R

To study the background seismicity a microseismic network composed by 7 seismic stations has been realized. On February 2010, a first test phase has been conducted for 3 sites. The network was completed with 4 more stations on May 2010. All stations are composed by a 24 -bit digital recorder (Lennartz M 24 /NET) with GPS time signal. The study area is characterized by a very high anthropic and industrial noise. In order to improve the quality of the seismic signals, 4 stations have been installed in a 100 m deep borehole. The seismic sensors (Lennartz LE- 3 D/BH for the borehole and LE- 3 Dlite MKI for the installation at the surface) have similar technical characteristics with 1 Hz free period, cutoff frequency at 80 Hz and dynamic range of 136 dB.

The paper includes the description of two test facilities used for separate effect experiments for the discharge flow of accumulators. Results derived from experiments at a glass facility show the dependency of the nitrogen release processes in the water on the depressurization rate during negative pressure transients and a delay of release. This release delay caused oversaturated solutions and this effect {{has to be taken}} into account for the modelling of accumulators. It was not observed coalescence of nitrogen bubbles during rising but the appearance of humid nitrogen above the liquid level. At the test facility TRACEI separate effect experiments were carried out for the investigation of the heat and mass transfer to the nitrogen cushion, the release of nitrogen out of saturated pressurized water and the multidimensional distribution of the gas temperature. The measured data in the nitrogen cushion show different conditions of humid nitrogen such as unsaturated and saturated humid nitrogen, the occurrence of water droplets in terms of fog and frozen fog. Intensive distributions of temperature and humidity above the liquid level were detected during fast pressure gradients, hence high depressurization rates. Post test calculations were accomplished with the ATHLET-Code Mod. 1. 2 Cycle B for selected TRACEI separate effect experiments. The comparison of calculated results and experimental data shows well calculated liquid level decreasing and a good agreement of the pressure transient even if the friction pressure loss coefficients of the connection pipe between the accumulator simulator and the venting vessel were adapted. Deviations between simulations and experiments arised in calculating the <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> temperature. In order to improve the simulation quality it was suggested to calculate the enthalpy, the density, and accordingly the specific volume and the volumetric gas fraction, respectively the volumetric water fraction, by a model of humid nitrogen bearing analogy to the model of humid air in consideration of the basic equations used in the ATHLET-code. The modelling for releasing of solved nitrogen in the water nodes contains a source term of volumetric gas release rate subjected to pressure and depressurization rate and approaches for the determination of bubble rising velocities of the nitrogen bubbles in water.

30|$|Natural gas is of {{non-renewable energy}} {{resources}} which are continuously produced and supplied {{to the market}} (Farahani et al. 2015). This significant energy resource {{is referred to as}} a good strategy for many industries and factories so that consumers try to provide storage facilities and equipment to protect themselves against possible fluctuations and crisis arisen from natural gas shortages (Alim and Tohidi 2012). The first successful natural gas storage project was implemented in Canada in 1915; however, by 1995, the number of underground gas storage reservoirs increased to 554 reservoirs worldwide, of which 400 reservoirs were located within Canada and US borders (Flanigan 1995). Underground natural gas storage can be defined as storing a mass volume of natural gas within porous media of rocks at different depths (Wang and Economides 2012). Before planning for a storage project, it is of vital importance to investigate reservoir capacity and deliverability, knowledge of market demand and also consider impacts of weather conditions on the gas market (Confort and Jorge 2014). Gas storage is the operation of gas transmission from a reservoir to another reservoir which is close to the target market, to avoid burning and other losses incurred from a drop-in consumption demand (Azin et al. 2008). One of the common methods of natural gas storage, due to consumption supplement in cold season, referred to gas storage in one depleted gas condensate reservoir (Arfaee and Iman 2014). Among other features of depleted gas reservoirs is that they can accommodate an easy and low-cost gas storage operation, because they enjoy appropriate porosity and permeability characteristics (Kuncir et al. 2003). Also, geological structure and petrophysical properties of many gas reservoirs are thoroughly investigated and well specified, so that one can employ computer models developed in the oil and gas industries to predict thermodynamic behaviors, movements and trapping of hydrocarbons (Katz et al. 1959). Furthermore, some of existing facilities and wells can be utilized for storage operations (Knepper 1997). Besides the mentioned reasons, the gas injection can act to recover several percents of the remaining hydrocarbon in the reservoir, so that a gas storage project can also be seen as an enhanced gas and condensate recovery project (Aminian et al. 2007). As such, these reservoirs may provide the best and the most economical accommodations for gas storage (Bennion et al. 2000; Rabbani et al. 2018). The annual number of injections and withdrawals is normally low with the daily transmission rate depending on the porosity and permeability values (Ahmed et al. 1998). Gas injection into depleted gas condensate reservoirs not only stabilizes the reservoir pressure but also leads within-reservoir condensates to be evaporated. As a result, the produced gas via recovery cycles will contain heavy hydrocarbons which are necessary to be separated from the produced gas in the processing units so as not to witness gas condensation thus forming a liquid phase in the pipeline (Katz et al. 1983). The composition of the produced gas from a depleted gas condensate reservoir is {{different from that of the}} injected gas, because of the existence of gas condensates within the reservoir in the course of depletion process (Adib et al. 2014; Davarpanah et al. 2017, 2018). In the case where there are some gas condensates in the reservoir due to retrograde condensation phenomenon, the secondary purpose to be followed alongside gas storage process is to produce condensates above via evaporating and then depleting or displacing them (Carriere et al. 1985). Gas storage operation design depends on the reservoir location and performance (Barker and Germer 2010). Those decisions made for the sake of enhanced volume of working gas and deliverability, determining new wells to be drilled and, possibly, specifying some of wells to be abandoned, must be based on an analysis of the circumstances coupled with an accurate simulation of reservoir behavior, so that one can determine the manner in which the operation and corresponding investment should be realized (Masanori et al. 2000). Failure to consider these parameters, there would be a high risk of gas leakage and operation failure. Such a leakage can stem from various reasons such as gas migration, gas trapping in non-accessible regions of the reservoir, and fingering phenomenon of the displacing phase (gas phase) (Mogbo 2011). Furthermore, availability of full history of the field with its initial development details (provided the reservoir under consideration have been originally a gas reservoir) strongly contributes to the successful management of a gas storage operation. Total gas to be addressed in a gas storage reservoir can be divided into two categories. <b>Cushion</b> <b>gas</b> or base gas, which, remaining unchanged within the reservoir, participate in neither injection nor production operations. It only provides the required pressure for the gas to be produced. <b>Cushion</b> <b>gas</b> is either originally in the reservoir or introduced into the reservoir via the first injection phase and will remain in the reservoir until the very end of the reservoir lifetime. Working gas, which is, one or more than one times a year, injected into and withdrawn from the reservoir (Kanaga et al. 2004; Davarpanah and Nassabeh 2017 a, b).|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolubility of {{nitrogen}} in propylene glycol/water mixtures (25 %, 41. 84 % and 100 % glycol by weight) have been determined in a temperature range from 10 °C to 110 °C using a static isochoric measuring method and are {{compared to the}} solubility of a typical solar liquid. To evaluate the amount of gas in a solar system {{it is necessary to}} measure the part of gases dissolved in the solar liquid, but also to consider the fraction of free gases (gas bubbles or <b>gas</b> <b>cushions)</b> in the system. Measuring this part was either not possible or only possible with a big technical effort until now. Therefore a new method was developed, which easily and fast identifies the volume of undissolved gases (“Gas Bubble Test”). The method was validated in extensive investigations in real solar systems...|$|R

Solubility coefficients for relevant gases in solar liquids, in particular, are essential for in-depth theoretical analysis and can be presented for the first time. The measurements of the solubility coefficients of nitrogen in a typical solar fluid show a significant different behavior compared to water. The concentration of atmospheric gases was investigated in seven current large scale {{solar thermal systems}} by sampling. An indoor test rig was built and investigated in terms of solubility, corrosion and gas transport. Thus, this project presents both current data for existing solar thermal installations and also detailed results of the analysis of a system with well-controlled conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{developed}} a roadmap of CO 2 utilization technologies for the California Energy Commission, a state government energy research, policy and permitting agency. The objective of the roadmap is to identify technologies that can make significant contributions to the state's 2020 and 2050 greenhouse gas (CHG) reduction goals. The state of California, under Assembly Bill 32, is committed to achieving reductions to 1990 GHG inventory levels by 2020 and, under Governor's Executive Order S- 3 - 05, to 80 percent below those levels by 2050. The roadmap will guide future R&D investment and policy development for enabling carbon utilization technologies in California. For {{the purposes of the}} roadmap, we defined utilization as including technologies that produce a useful product from anthropogenic CO 2, or through the processes of capture or sequestration of CO 2. Technologies may contribute to reductions directly by permanently sequestering CO 2, or indirectly by displacing the use of fossil fuels or more potent GHGs, such as CFCs. Technologies considered include: CO 2 as a working fluid (including enhanced oil recovery (EOR), enhanced gas recovery (EGR), and enhanced geothermal systems (EGS)), chemical feedstocks, biofuels, building materials, compressed <b>gas</b> energy storage, <b>cushion</b> <b>gas</b> for natural gas storage, and water and marketable minerals produced from displaced sequestration reservoir fluids. Evaluation criteria include technological maturity, potential market size, purity of CO 2 required, commercialization time frame, environmental impacts, water use, data on energy-carbon life cycle analysis, and potential local economic benefits such as job creation. In addition, we evaluated the potential impact of non-technical barriers to commercial- scale adoption, such as the need for clear accounting protocols to provide incentives for CO 2 producers to adopt these technologies to meet carbon standards. It may be possible to integrate different utilization approaches. For example, CO 2 can be reduced to produce methanol or formic acid, which can be converted into fuels. Other processes to functionalize the carbon atom produce saleable chemicals, such as urea. By combining these two approaches, synthesis of even more chemicals directly from CO 2 could be achieved. Widespread deployment of CO 2 utilization technologies also depends on integration into planning of a future carbon- energy infrastructure. While single projects for some technologies, such as EOR, may create a demand comparable to the CO 2 volumes generated by large sources, other technologies may have to be aggregated and/or combined with geologic sequestration to provide the volume of sequestration required. Deployment networks provide opportunities for cost optimization of pipeline infrastructure and for focusing public or private investment to facilitate commercialization. Currently in California, utilization projects are in the research, pilot, or permitting stages, including projects to combine urea production and EOR, produce high carbon-content building materials, and develop chemical and biological CO 2 recycling technologies. None of these projects have yet reached the development stage necessary to demonstrate whether the technologies can contribute effectively to reducing California's CHG emissions...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether foreigners <b>cushion</b> <b>native</b> labour {{during the}} {{phases of the}} {{economic}} cycle. The theoretical model, {{based on the work}} of Blanchard and Katz (Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 0 (1) : 1 – 75, 1992), assumes that foreigners supply labour with a higher wage elasticity than natives. The empirical analysis, based on an unbalanced panel of 161 European regions during 1988 – 97, shows that following a labour demand shock the variability of native employment growth is lower the higher the proportion of foreign citizens in the local labour force. These results suggest that foreigners absorb some of the effects of the shock, shielding natives from its full impact. The analysis also reveals that the main channel mediating this ‘cushioning’ effect is the inter-regional migration of foreign workers, followed (as a far distant second) by their higher/lower unemployment rates. 29 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|A typical experiment, {{consists}} of a glass tube of volume V, and of cross-section A, which is open on one of its end. A ball (or sometimes a piston) of mass m with the same cross-section, creating an air-tight seal, is allowed to fall under gravity g. The entrapped gas is first compressed {{by the weight of}} the piston, which leads to an increase in temperature. In the course of the piston falling, a <b>gas</b> <b>cushion</b> is created, and the piston bounces. Harmonic oscillation occurs, which slowly damps. The result is a rapid sequence of expansion and compression of the gas. The picture shows a revised version of the original Rüchardt setup: the sphere oscillating inside the tube is here replaced by a [...] "breast-pump" [...] which acts as an oscillating glass-piston; in this new setup three sensors allow to measure in real-time the piston oscillations as well as the pressure and temperature oscillations of the air inside the bottle (more details may be found in [...] ) ...|$|R

We use numerical simulations where both the liquid and the gas phases are considered incompressible in order to focus on the gas inertial and viscous contributions. We first confirm that the dominant gas effect on the dynamics is due to its viscosity through the <b>cushioning</b> of the <b>gas</b> layer beneath the droplet. We then exhibit an additional inertial effect that is directly related to the gas density. The two different splashing mechanisms initially suggested theoretically are observed numerically, depending on whether a jet is created before or after the impacting droplet wets the substrate. Finally, we provide a phase diagram of the drop impact outputs as the gas viscosity and density vary, emphasizing the dominant effect of the gas viscosity with a small correction due to the gas density. Our results also suggest that gas inertia influences the splashing formation through a Kelvin–Helmoltz like instability of the surface of the impacting droplet, in agreement with former theoretical works...|$|R
