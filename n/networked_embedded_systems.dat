40|$|Abstract — Modern <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>system</b> {{design has}} {{to cope with}} {{multiple}} design objectives. One major challenge is the determination of optimal routings with respect to these objectives. Existing automatic optimization approaches carry out a two step optimization: First, they perform a multi-objective topology optimization of the <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>system.</b> Then, a multi-objective routing optimization for a subset of Paretooptimal solutions obtained from {{the first step is}} performed. In general, this may exclude several globally optimal solutions from the optimization process. To overcome this drawback, a unified approach based on Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms is presented that ensures a combined optimization of the topology and routing. Since the system topology is varied within the optimization, the main contribution of this paper contribution is a novel routing technique that always samples feasible paths using a topology independent genetic encoding. This encoding preserves optimized routing information when changing the underlying topology. An experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of the presented approach. I...|$|R

30|$|The secure {{establishment}} of cryptographic keys for symmetric encryption via key agreement protocols enables nodes in a <b>network</b> of <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> and remote agents to communicate securely in an insecure environment. In this paper, we propose a pure hardware {{implementation of a}} key agreement protocol, which uses the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellmann and digital signature algorithms and enables two parties, a remote agent and a <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>system,</b> to establish a 128 -bit symmetric key for encryption of all transmitted data via the advanced encryption scheme (AES). The resulting implementation is a protocol-on-chip that supports full 128 -bit equivalent security (PoC- 128). The PoC- 128 has been implemented in an FPGA, {{but it can also}} be used as an IP within different embedded applications. As 128 -bit security is conjectured valid for the foreseeable future, the PoC- 128 goes well beyond the state of art in securing <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> devices.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and evaluates {{a new approach}} of modeling energy consumption of communication within adaptive <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems.</b> The objective is to enable energy estimation within early phases of system development, which allows system designers to compare different allocations of software components. As <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> consist of multiple specialized networks (with different protocols and topologies) and are characterized by {{a high degree of}} interaction, existing network-centric approaches have significant disadvantages describing entire systems. To overcome this problem a model was created which is based on individual communication connections between software components. This enables technology-transparent mapping to network topologies (across borders of networks) which significantly simplifies the evaluation of different software placements...|$|E

40|$|In safety-critical, <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems,</b> it is {{important}} that the way in which a fault(s) in one component of the system can propagate throughout the system to other components is analyzed correctly. Many real-world systems, such as modern aircrafts and automobiles, use large-scale <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> with complex behavior. In this work, we have developed techniques and a software tool, FauPA, that uses those techniques to automate fault-propagation analysis of large-scale, <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> such as those used in modern aircraft. This work makes three main contributions. 1. Fault propagation analyses. We developed algorithms for two types of analyses: forward analysis and backward analysis. For backward analysis, we developed two techniques: a naive algorithm and an algorithm that uses Datalog. 2. A system description language. We developed a language that we call Communication System Markup Language (CSML) based on XML. A system can be specified concisely and at a high-level in CSML. 3. A GUI-based display of the system and analysis results. We developed a GUI to visualize the system that is specified in CSML. The GUI also lets the user visualize the results of fault-propagation analyses.

40|$|Since the {{requirements}} and {{the set of}} provided functionalities of <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> are growing, the complexity of these systems is continuously increasing as well. Early verification of embedded systems is necessary to prevent failures and to save costs during the design. Considering solely functional properties of the software for <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> is insufficient to satisfy the quality requirements in most of their application domains. To produce robust software-based embedded systems in a cost-efficient way, an early verification of non-functional properties is inevitable. ERNEST is an open tool-chain framework to enable the early verification of component-based software {{in the area of}} <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>systems.</b> Based on a specific simulation framework, written in SystemC, ERNEST provides flexible mechanisms to verify non-functional properties in early design stages. ERNEST can be integrated easily into a model-based design flow and is based on the open-source development platform Eclipse. Thus, it states an extensible tool platform for verifying non-functional properties, which can easily be enhanced by various analysis techniques. To analyze and verify a networked embedded system, the modeled hardware, software and communication behavior is simulated as accurate as needed. The results of these simulations can be used in third-party tools or re-integrated into the initial model. Thus, an iterative model-driven development exploiting early prototyping is possible...|$|E
40|$|We {{envision}} {{that during}} the next decade the advances in technology will make sensor networks more powerful. Therefore, they will become part of a larger class of <b>networks</b> of <b>embedded</b> <b>systems</b> that have sufficient computing, communication, and energy resources to support distributed applications. The current software architectures and programming models are not suitable for these new computing environments. We present a distributed computing model, Cooperative Computing, and the Smart Messages software architecture for programming large <b>networks</b> of <b>embedded</b> <b>systems.</b> In Cooperative Computing, distributed applications are dynamic collections of migratory execution units, called Smart Messages, working to achieve a common goal. Virtually, any userdefined distributed application can be implemented using our model. To illustrate this flexibility, we describe the implementation, using Smart Messages, of two previously proposed applications for sensor networks, SPIN and Directed Di#usion. The simulation results for these applications together with micro-benchmark results for our prototype implementation demonstrate that Cooperative Computing is a viable solution for programming <b>networks</b> of <b>embedded</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Such networks need to enable reliable communication without requiring significant resources, and provide an easy programming interface. This paper considers a file-system interface across all resources in a <b>networked</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>system,</b> ie. an application can access local, remote and mobile resources using a file interface. The approach is based on Styx [1, 2], part of the network protocol of the Inferno/Plan 9 OS [1]. The Styx protocol provides file system level abstractions for ease of developing and management at an application layer. To this, we have added limited fault-tolerance and potential mobility for resources. To ensure applicability in a low-resource context, we have defined and implemented a (hardware) Styx IP-core Module 1, removing {{the need for a}} CPU and software overhead. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
