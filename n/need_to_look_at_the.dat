We need {{to ensure the safety of}} these people, and need to help stop police action against the people of Marikana. The work is enormous. Some people still need medical attention, and we also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> living {{conditions}} of workers and the community at large. Then there is the problem of the unemployment of women and the high rate of illiteracy here. We need to help realise programmes to ensure people can get an income, that they can enjoy a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
500|$|A typical {{subway station}} has waiting {{platforms}} ranging from [...] long, though some IND platforms {{may be as}} long as [...] long. Platforms of former commuter rail stations, such as those on the IND Rockaway Line, are even longer. Due to {{the large number of}} transit lines, one platform or set of platforms often serve more than one service. Passengers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> overhead signs at the platform entrance steps and over each track to see which trains stop there and when, and at the arriving train to see which one it is.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the images}} connect back to his earlier works. The images of life as boat adrift with a leak {{is similar to the}} [...] "Death by Water" [...] section of The Waste Land. Like images about old age and {{experience}} found in East Coker, this image reinforces the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> whole of life and try to see things beyond the limitations of time. Men are supposed to progress, but they aren't supposed to focus on what they can gain in the future. The prayer to the Virgin Mary is intended to help guide the journey which would end with understanding eternity and the Annunciation. It is Mary who will guide the metaphorical sailors to their proper harbour. While connecting back to his earlier works, Eliot also connects back to his family's past; the [...] "Dry Salvages" [...] was part of the landscape his ancestor Andrew Eliott travelled to in 1669.|$|E
500|$|NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at a 2007 {{press conference}} {{broadcast}} on CBC Sports, said, [...] "Fighting {{has always had}} a role in the game... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> just as we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> hits <b>to</b> the head. But we're not <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or {{should be part of the}} game." ...|$|R

50|$|Managers also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> how {{resources}} are allocated within an organization. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know what each activity costs and why. These questions require managerial accounting {{techniques such as}} activity based costing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sequence}} field {{lists the}} numbers themselves, {{or at least}} about four lines' worth. The sequence field makes no distinction between sequences that are finite but still too long to display and sequences that are infinite. To help make that determination, you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> keywords field for [...] "fini", [...] "full", or [...] "more". To determine to which n the values given correspond, see the offset field, which gives the n for the first term given.|$|E
2500|$|Now for the ritorno. [...] The landmark, as noted, is WSW of {{the ship}}'s morning {{position}} (C). [...] So to [...] "return" [...] to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing {{from its current}} NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW. [...] However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of [...] "intended" [...] direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, so we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar. [...] Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 [...] 2.84 = 73.84. [...] And there we have it. [...] The landmark is 73.84 {{miles away from the}} ship's morning position.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} writers and {{political}} commentators consider Berlusconi's political success a precedent for the 2016 election of real estate tycoon Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, with most noting Berlusconi's panned Prime Ministerial tenure and therefore making the comparison in dismay. Roger Cohen of The New York Times argued, [...] "Widely ridiculed, endlessly written about, long unscathed by his evident misogyny and diverse legal travails, Berlusconi proved a Teflon politician [...] Nobody who knows Berlusconi and has watched the rise and rise of Donald Trump can fail to be struck by the parallels." [...] In The Daily Beast, Barbie Latza Nadeau wrote, [...] "If Americans are wondering just what a Trump presidency would look like, they only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> traumatized remains of Italy after Berlusconi had his way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [239] A more methodical, though, {{under general}} circumstances, uselessly prolix way, {{is to cut}} a square hole, some half an inch wide, in the sheet of cardboard, {{and a series of}} small {{circular}} holes in a slip of cardboard an inch wide. Pass the slip over the square opening, and match each colour beside one of the circular openings. You will thus have no occasion to wash any of the colours away. But the first rough method is generally all you want, as after a little practice, you only <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hue through the opening {{in order to be able}} to transfer it to your drawing at once.|$|E
60|$|Miss Gage said nothing, and I cannot {{say that}} she looked anything. She simply CLOUDED UP, if I may so express the effect that came and {{remained}} upon her countenance, which was now the countenance she had shown me the first evening I saw her, when I saw the Deerings cowering in its shadow. I had no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> adamantine little man before her {{to know that he}} was softening into wax, and, in fact, I felt a sort of indecency in beholding his inteneration, for I knew that it came from his heart, and had its consecration through his love for her.|$|E

50|$|To be successful, a {{business}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for competitive advantages beyond its own operations. The business <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the competitiveness value chain of suppliers, distributors and customers. Many companies today have partnered with specific suppliers and distributors {{to create a}} superior value delivery network.|$|R
50|$|By {{treating}} {{failure and}} value demand alike in statistical analysis, failure demand {{can give the}} quite false impression of greater productivity.

50|$|The {{pattern of}} air {{maneuvers}} described above {{may be a}} general pattern, {{or it may be}} purely General X's personal command style.

30|$|Proposition 2 {{strongly}} {{displays the}} network effect. One {{can argue that}} unless a minimum critical proportion of consumers (sellers) invest in cashless instruments, sellers (consumers) will not invest as well. To calculate these critical levels, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the steady state equilibrium.|$|R
50|$|Factors are sub-sets of a category.

40|$|This paper aims {{at taking}} a fresh <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Freudian psychoanalytical theory from a modern perspective. Freudian {{psychology}} {{is a science}} based on the unconscious (id) and the conscious (ego). Various aspects of Freudian thinking are examined from a modern perspective and {{the relevance of the}} psychoanalytical theory of consciousness is projected. Do psychoanalysis and the unconsciousness have something to teach us about consciousness? Approaching Freud from a historical, psychoanalytical, anthropological and sociological perspective, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> how Freudian theory may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} consciousness. We also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> psychoanalytical psychotherapy and its contribution to a better understanding of body-mind dualism and consciousness as a whole. Ego psychology is considered in the present day context and it is synthesized with various psychological studies to give us a better understanding of consciousness...|$|R
