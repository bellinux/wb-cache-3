500|$|Gosling {{came to the}} {{attention}} of a mainstream audience in 2004 after starring opposite fellow Canadian Rachel McAdams in the romantic drama film The Notebook, a film adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name, directed by Nick Cassavetes. Gosling portrayed Noah Calhoun and commented on the role: [...] "It gave me an opportunity to play a character over a period of time – from 1940 to 1946 – that was quite profound and formative." [...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set.

[...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together". The film grossed over $115 million worldwide. Gosling won four Teen Choice Awards and an MTV Movie Award.

50|$|During the fifties, Kazakevich reached high {{positions}} in the Soviet Association of Writers and was aligned with the efforts of de-Stalinization. he kept picking up potentially sensitive subjects, and during his last years may {{have been working on}} a major novel about Lenin during the revolutionary years. The short novel Sinyaya tetrad (The Blue <b>notebook)</b> <b>appeared</b> in 1961; it is set during Lenin's stay on the Karelian isthmus in the summer of 1917 and brings Lenin face to face both with ordinary people and with Grigory Zinovyev, who was still considered a traitor or at best a dubious figure at the time of writing. While Kazakevich, in the end, makes Lenin refute Zinovyev's fears and allegations, there is no attempt to show the latter as an evil or insincere person, which would have been a given for most Soviet writers at the time.|$|R
