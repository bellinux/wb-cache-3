40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{relations}} between Israel and the Islamic Republic of Iran {{in the context of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Israel and Iran are situated in the Middle East and both of countries have their own <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Although states are not contiguous, Israel and Iran be feel threatened by a <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Especially the Iranian <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> {{is one of the most}} urgent issues of global security. At first, the thesis describes Iranian and Israeli motives to gain nuclear weapons, as well as individual development acquiring <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> In conclusion, the work outlines the relationship between Israel and Iran since the revolution to the present, and whether the relationships were affected <b>nuclear</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R
25|$|Since 2011, the IAEA has voiced {{growing concern}} over {{possible}} military dimensions to Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> and has released {{a number of}} reports chastising Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> to that effect.|$|R
40|$|North Korea is {{unlikely}} to relinquish its <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> because of its importance to the perpetuation of the Kim regime. This conclusion arises from the observation that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> has been a long-term project spanning several decades, culminating in denuclearisation negotiations, which have followed a cyclical pattern in which the North has provoked crises to extract concessions and gain leverage vis-a-vis regional states. It {{is clear that the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> has great intrinsic value to Pyongyang. First, this paper argues that the sunk costs of previous investment in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> as evidenced by the infrastructure for the country's nuclear fuel cycle, create forward momentum favouring continuation of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Second, it argues that the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> solidifies Kim regime rule as an institutional buttress, as a prop for the domestic economy, and as a vehicle for ideological legitimation. The paper is a unique contribution, which explicitly links the Kim regime's proliferation calculus to the economic and bureaucratic imperatives of regime perpetuation, as well as the sunk cost of previous investment in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> It provides a coherent explanation for North Korea's consistent unreliability in negotiations, and offers insights into future prospects of the denuclearisation process.

25|$|Iraq was {{alternately}} praised and admonished by the IAEA for its {{cooperation and}} lack thereof. It {{was only after}} the first Gulf War that {{the full extent of}} Iraq's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs,</b> which had switched from a plutonium based weapon design to a highly enriched uranium design after the destruction of Osiraq, became known.|$|E
25|$|Brazil and Argentina’s {{position}} on the global non-proliferation regime was quite similar. From {{the second half of}} the 1960s onward, both countries understood they should jointly resist external pressure applied to their respective <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs.</b> This common understanding was a major source for bilateral nuclear cooperation and helped dilute any security dilemma dynamics between the two countries.|$|E

40|$|Iran’s {{accountability}} in developing <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> is {{questioned by the}} West and international agencies, such as the United Nations and IAEA. The Islamic government of Iran is considered violating the NPT and Safeguards Agreement which it ratified in 1968 and 1974 respectively. On the contrary, the Iranian government asserts that it develop <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> for peaceful purposes and domestic energy -consumption. Additionally, the government deplores the West and international agencies which intervene its national <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> while they allow other countries, such as Israel, India, Pakistan, in developing similar project.

25|$|Opposition in Ireland and Poland {{prevented}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> there, while Austria (1978), Sweden (1980) and Italy (1987) (influenced by Chernobyl) {{voted in}} referendums to oppose or phase out nuclear power. In July 2009, the Italian Parliament {{passed a law}} that cancelled {{the results of an}} earlier referendum and allowed the immediate start of the Italian nuclear program. After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster a one-year moratorium was placed on nuclear power development, followed by a referendum in which over 94% of voters (turnout 57%) rejected plans for new nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{facilities}} {{should not}} jeopardise their safety {{in case of}} earthquakes or other hostile external events. Therefore, their seismic design is based on criteria far more stringent than those applying to non-nuclear facilities. The Fukushima I nuclear accidents and damage to other nuclear facilities that followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami have, however, drawn attention to ongoing concerns over Japanese nuclear seismic design standards and caused other many governments to re-evaluate their <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs.</b> Doubt has also been expressed over the seismic evaluation and design of certain other plants, including the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant in France.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 2007, North Korea told delegates at {{international}} nuclear talks {{that it was}} preparing to shut down its main nuclear facility. The agreement was reached following a series of six-party talks, involving North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, and the United States begun in 2003. According to the agreement, a list of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> would be submitted and the nuclear facility would be disabled in exchange for fuel aid and normalization talks with the United States and Japan. This was delayed from April due to a dispute with the United States over Banco Delta Asia, but on July 14, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors confirmed the shutdown of North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear reactor and consequently North Korea began to receive aid. This agreement fell apart in 2009, following a North Korean satellite launch.|$|E

25|$|Views on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> of Iran vary greatly, as the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> of Iran {{is a very}} {{contentious}} geopolitical issue. Uriel Abulof identifies five possible rationales behind Iran’s nuclear policy: (i) Economy, mainly energy needs; (ii) Identity politics, {{pride and}} prestige; (iii) Deterrence of foreign intervention; (iv) Compellence to boost regional influence; and (v) Domestic politics, mitigating, through ‘nuclear diversion’ the regime’s domestic crisis of legitimacy.

500|$|Many {{leaders of}} the G20 {{disagreed}} about which issues should be discussed at the summit. The prime focus of the summit discussions was the recovery from the ongoing global recession and the European debt crisis. Summit leaders were divided over which strategies {{would be best for}} tackling these problems. The European Union emphasized the need to cut their deficits by focusing on austerity measures. [...] In contrast, the United States emphasized the importance of maintaining economic stimulus spending in order to encourage growth. In summit discussions, the countries of the European Union explained projected reductions in spending and balanced budgets. [...] Alternatively, China, India, and the United States argued in favor of increased stimulus funding to mitigate the effects of recession. Among the specifics proposed by the European Union were a global bank tax and a Robin Hood tax, but the United States and Canada opposed these plans. Other topics of concern were international development and continuing international aid to Africa and other developing nations. [...] Some invitees expressed criticism of Israel's Gaza strip blockade and of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> of North Korea and the United States raised issues of corruption and security in Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|The DOE began {{studying}} Yucca Mountain in 1978 {{to determine whether}} it would be suitable for the nation's first long-term geologic repository for over [...] (150 million pounds) of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste as of 2015 stored at 121 sites around the nation. An estimated [...] of the waste would be from America's military <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs.</b> On December 19, 1984, the DOE selected ten locations in six states for consideration as potential repository sites, based on data collected for nearly ten years. The ten sites were studied and results of these preliminary studies were reported in 1985. Based on these reports, President Ronald Reagan approved three sites for intensive scientific study called site characterization. The three sites were Hanford, Washington; Deaf Smith County, Texas; and Yucca Mountain. In 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and directed DOE to study only Yucca Mountain, which is located within a former nuclear test site. The Act provided that if during site characterization the Yucca Mountain location was found unsuitable, studies would be stopped immediately. This option expired when the site was actually recommended by the President.|$|E

[...] Within months, [...] "both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the U.S.–DPRK Agreed Framework of October 1994." [...] North Korea's October 9, 2006, detonation of a nuclear device further complicated Bush's foreign policy, which centered for both terms of his presidency on [...] " [...] the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world". Bush condemned North Korea's position, reaffirmed his commitment to [...] "a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula", and stated that [...] "transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities {{would be considered a}} grave threat to the United States", for which North Korea would be held accountable. On May 7, 2007, North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account. This was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the United States and including China. On September 2, 2007, North Korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> by the end of 2007.
