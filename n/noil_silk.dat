50|$|<b>Noil</b> <b>Silk,</b> however short its fibres may be, though, has the {{advantage}} of being made from protein. Thus, it has a better texture and depth that cotton - and gives a nice fall and drape.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>noil</b> {{may also}} be made from the short fibres, {{directly}} sourced from the silkworm cocoons. Rather than the continuous length of silk, shorter fibers, which are generally not used to create high quality silk are used for <b>Silk</b> <b>Noil,</b> which has a slightly rough texture. It is relatively weaker and has low resilience. It tends to have very low lustre, which makes it appear more like cotton - than silk.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>Noil</b> has an {{intriguing}} ancient past and hails from China, {{from where it}} was exported to Europe in the middle ages, especially to Italy. It was used to create silk blends, through {{the first half of}} the 14th century. However, over the time the use decreased.|$|R
50|$|Station Mill {{was built}} in 1834 by Thomas and Edward Platt, members of a family who had farmed Longdendale for generations. The family owned this cotton mill for 68 years, before selling it in 1923 to E. Wilman & Sons, which {{converted}} it to <b>silk</b> <b>noil</b> spinning. The mill closed in 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Noil is {{the short}} fiber {{left over from}} combing wool or {{spinning}} silk and used as a decorative additive for many spinning projects, like rovings and yarns. <b>Silk</b> <b>noil</b> is also called [...] "raw silk", although that is a misnomer. As noil is a relatively short fiber, fabric made from noil is weaker and considered less valuable.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>Noil</b> is also blended or {{appended}} with heavier fabrics like velvets and satins {{to create}} varied textures. Made {{out of the}} strongest natural fibres (with a protein base) around, the Noil Sarees are not slippery like synthetic fibres and absorb moisture well. Noils are easily dyed, and can also be made waterproof, by using a polyurethane coating. This also increases their usage in furnishingsâ€™ industry.|$|R
