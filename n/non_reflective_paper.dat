40|$|<b>Reflective</b> <b>papers</b> are {{increasingly}} recognized as potentially important contributors to clinical education and practice; however, few quality guidelines {{are available for}} potential authors or reviewers. We sought to identify key characteristics of effective <b>reflective</b> <b>papers</b> and to clarify factors that increased or reduced the probability of acceptance for publication. A 10 -item survey addressing the definition, purpose, and quality characteristics of <b>reflective</b> <b>papers</b> was developed based on a literature review {{and analysis of the}} author instructions of 14 journals that regularly publish <b>reflective</b> <b>papers</b> and are likely to be read by primary care physicians. The survey was sent electronically to the editor or associate editor responsible for <b>reflective</b> <b>papers</b> at each journal. Seven completed surveys were returned. The essential element defining a <b>reflective</b> <b>paper</b> was identified as narration of a specific professional experience that resonated with readers and conveyed deeper meaning. All respondents rated emotional engagement as very important, followed by stimulating reflection in the reader, providing a lesson applicable to patient care, and stimulating discussion with colleagues and/or learners. Reasons for acceptance or rejection of reflective submissions to journals were identified in issues related to writing style, topic selection, and reader reaction. Writing and reviewing <b>reflective</b> <b>papers</b> is strongly dependent on context, personal values, experience, and emotional reaction; nevertheless, core quality features can be identified to guide both writers and editors/reviewers without destroying the unique nature of these papers...|$|R

40|$|Background. Students need a {{sense of}} {{direction}} and identity for solving ill-defined problems in a professional context. Reflection can help students to develop this direction. However, students {{do not seem to}} reflect, possibly through general and vague instructions. It seems that students need more guidance. Aim. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of task structure (independent variable) on the level of reflection (dependent variable). Methods. Thirty first year students (n = 30) of the course engineering with ISCED level 3 a participated. Students discussed a core problem in groups of four students. Afterwards students made a reflection task. Students in the unstructured condition received a reflection task with six questions and students in the structured condition received a task with fifteen questions. Students filled in a questionnaire about their opinion on reflection and the made task. Analysis. The elaborations of the reflection tasks were analyzed with a quantitative coding scheme with three <b>non</b> <b>reflective</b> and three reflective levels based on the work of Mezirow. Results. No significant differences were found between the two conditions. <b>Non</b> <b>reflective</b> levels were more present than the reflective levels and not all students reached one reflective level. A significant difference was found between the used classes. Conclusions. Task structure does not lead to a higher level of reflection. Students within the conditions experienced the amount of questions differently. The results and possible explanations are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one colour, making it easier to see. Such self-shading can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a <b>non</b> <b>reflective,</b> matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three papers; literature review, empirical <b>paper,</b> and <b>reflective</b> <b>paper.</b> The literature review evaluates the effectiveness of psychological interventions for perfectionism in adults. The systemic review analysed 12 papers comprising of; randomised control trials, group intervention studies, and single case designs. Interventions were varied in delivery, such as face-to-face or web-based with the majority using a CBT intervention. A number of studies showed effectiveness {{for the treatment of}} perfectionism in adults, but some were narrow in use of population e. g. a high proportion of female participants. Clinical implications are discussed. The empirical paper investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism, self-criticism, self-esteem, and mood in primary school children. A non-clinical population (9 - 11 years of age) of 90 children were recruited with quantitative measures utilised. Mediation models were used to establish if any relationships existed. Results showed a significant relationship between self-esteem and mood, and perfectionism dimensions, such as sensitivity to mistakes and mood were significantly mediated by self-esteem and self-criticism. Results are discussed in comparison with previous research and clinical and education implications are discussed.

This thesis documents the development of reflective practice amongst a group of Christian volunteers undertaking an internship in a faith-based organisation. As {{the director of the}} programme, this provided me with the opportunity to examine my own effectiveness in promoting critical reflection and assess my own success in promoting transformative pedagogy using hermeneutic phenomenology. The analysis of the intern volunteers’ reflections was modelled on the research of Kember (1999) which distinguishes between content, process, and premise reflections. Research conducted by Kember is underpinned by the theory of transformative learning (Mezirow, 1998). Running parallel to the reflective journeys of the volunteers is an account of my own journey from a <b>non</b> <b>reflective</b> to a reflective educator validated by audits conducted by two academic colleagues and two intern graduates. In the process I was forced to address a crisis of faith and confront aspects of my own changing identity as the personal and the private intruded upon and affected the public and the professional...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} thesis {{consists of}} three papers; a literature review, an empirical <b>paper</b> and a <b>reflective</b> <b>paper.</b> The literature review summarises current knowledge regarding the efficacy of systemic family therapy in neurorehabilitation. Studies investigating the impact of brain injury on the family suggest that all family members {{should be included in}} their injured relatives’ rehabilitation programme due to the risk of developing relational difficulties. In view of this, family therapy has become increasingly popular amongst Clinical Psychologists and other professionals working in neurorehabilitation. This review aims to critically evaluate the efficacy of systemic family therapy within neurorehabilitation. Methodological considerations and implications for future research are discussed, as well as clinical and service implications. The empirical paper explores changes in children’s relationships when a parent acquires a brain injury. The findings of the study highlight the positive and negative changes children experience in their relationships {{as a result of their}} parents’ acquired brain injury (ABI). Results are discussed in relation to the current literature, consideration of the strengths and limitations of the research, clinical implications and recommendations for future research.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers, a literature review, an empirical <b>paper</b> and a <b>reflective</b> <b>paper.</b> The literature review explores the neuropsychological and neurocognitive correlates of psychopathy {{with a view to}} identify and appraise review papers together. Nine articles were identified and comprised studies of child/adolescent and adult, clinical and nonclinical samples. The review identifies evidence of different patterns of performance on inhibition, working memory, intelligence, emotion recognition and affective theory of mind (ToM). Results are considered in terms of neural correlates, clinical presentations and intervention options. Methodological limitations are discussed, both in terms of the included studies and of the literature review itself. Implications for policy and practice are outlines and directions for further research are highlighted. The empirical paper investigates the construct of psychopathy and its measurement and relationship with the measures of empathy. Data from a nonclinical sample was collected using an online platform. Using a correlational design, relationships between psychopathy and empathy were investigated. Further analyses examined the different psychopathy subscales, differences in performance according to the emotional valence of the task stimuli and tentative explorations into gender differences. The results are discussed in relation to existing evidence and limitations of the research are highlighted. Finally, the <b>reflective</b> <b>paper</b> comprised a discussion of conducting clinical research as part of clinical training. This includes critique of the term psychopathy and challenges in professional identity. ...|$|R

Specifically the role of Psychoticism, Extroversion and Neuroticism are examined in addition to Sociotropy and Autonomy. A lot of research has examined the role of personality in the outcome of treatment where medication has been used (see Mulder, 2002) but less looks at the use of psychological treatments. A number of methodological limitations and recommendations for future research and clinical implication are discussed. Chapter II: Empirical Paper Existing research that considers mood congruent and mood dependent memory does not fully explain the relationship between mood and memory. This investigation explores a different perfective by examining the relationship between ratings given to past memories and thoughts of future events. It examines the skew in the distribution of ratings in relation to self-rated mood and mood measured by the BDIII. It also includes a measure ofpersonality.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three papers, a literature review, an empirical <b>paper</b> and a <b>reflective</b> <b>paper.</b> The literature review covers two distinct but interlinked areas of research: the impact of dementia {{on the quality of}} relationships, and the impact of relationship quality on the experience of living with dementia. The literature review clarifies the interactions between these factors by using a model to demonstrate the influence of relationship factors on the experience of living with dementia. Methodological issues and suggestions for future research are discussed, and the findings are summarized with particular reference to clinical implications. The empirical paper reports on a study of the awareness of carer distress in people with dementia. Ratings of carer psychological health were elicited from people with dementia and from the carers themselves as a pair. Comparison of the ratings showed that people with dementia are aware of their carers' psychological health. A control group of people with arthritis also participated in the study. The level of awareness shown by the participants with dementia was comparable to the level of awareness of carer psychological health shown by the control group. The level of awareness of carer psychological health in the participants with dementia was not related to their level of awareness of their own memory difficulties. The thesis concludes with a <b>reflective</b> <b>paper</b> which focuses on observations made whilst conducting research interviews and recruiting participants through support groups.
