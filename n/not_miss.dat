5|$|At age seventy-seven, Barbree {{is one of}} the longest-serving network correspondents to work {{continuously}} on {{a single}} subject. He started working for NBC on July 21, 1958 covering the space program, and continues in that capacity to the present. He has never missed a mission launch, despite suffering a heart attack while jogging along Cocoa Beach in 1987, and being declared clinically dead for several minutes. Following his heart attack, he had bypass surgery, and still did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any launches.|$|E
5|$|In August 1931, Amazing was {{acquired}} by Teck Publications, a subsidiary of Bernarr Macfadden's Macfadden Publications. Macfadden's deep pockets helped insulate Amazing from the financial strain caused by the Great Depression. The schedule of Amazing Stories Quarterly began to slip, but Amazing did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> {{an issue in the}} early 1930s. However, it became unprofitable to publish over the next few years. Circulation dropped to little more than 25,000 in 1934, and in October 1935 it switched to a bimonthly schedule.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 2009–10 season, Burrows left {{during a}} game against the Los Angeles Kings after being hit in the throat by a Jarret Stoll slapshot. He was not injured, however, and did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any games thereafter. Playing a full season on the Canucks' top line with the Sedins, he {{recorded}} a career-high 35 goals, 32 assists, 67 points and a +34 rating. His goals total ranked first on the Canucks. Fans voted him as recipient of the team's Most Exciting Player Award for the third consecutive season.|$|E

5|$|Ray Mathias {{spent his}} entire playing career from 1964 to 1984 at Tranmere, making a record 637 {{appearances}} in all competitions. Mathias went on to manage the team in 2002. Harold Bell made a record 595 league appearances for Tranmere. Bell also holds {{the record for the}} most consecutive league appearances for a British team; he was picked for the first game after the Second World War in the 1946–47 season and did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> a match until 30 August 1955, a total of 401 consecutive matches in the Third Division North.|$|E
5|$|Alberts did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> a game {{during his}} college career until {{suffering}} two knee injuries during {{his senior year}} in 2004–05. Limited to 30 games, he again recorded 16 points and {{was named to the}} Hockey East First All-Star Team. In the playoffs, he ended what was the longest semifinal game in Hockey East history with a double-overtime goal against the Maine Black Bears. Alberts earned Hockey East All-Tournament honors, as the Eagles defeated the New Hampshire Wildcats 3–1 in the final to win the Lamoriello Trophy as conference champions. He also earned his second consecutive NCAA East All-American recognition.|$|E
5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster. After being used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two {{became one of the most}} dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history. Berry, who did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> a single game until his eighth year in the league, led the NFL in receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.|$|E

5|$|During the 2007 season, Harris was {{diagnosed}} with a torn labrum in her right hip which occurred during a goal kick. Harris did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any games following the injury and instead switched to mainly using her left leg and dealt with the pain. Dorrance again employed the two-goalkeeper method, as Harris split time with junior goalkeeper, Anna Rodenbough. The two goalkeepers alternated starts and played for half of each game. Harris played in 19 games and made 9 starts, playing a total of 1120 minutes. She allowed nine goals and recorded 29 saves, giving a 0.763 save percentage. UNC lost their match against Notre Dame in the third round of the 2007 NCAA Women's Soccer Tournament on November 24, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer in 1999 and underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During the process, she did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> {{a day on the}} bench. Physically weakened after the cancer treatment, Ginsburg began working with a personal trainer. Since 1999, Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to the Special Forces, has trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court. In spite of her small stature, Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve since her first bout with cancer, being able to complete twenty full push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he was {{involved}} in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong's Steven King. As King attempted to kick the ball out of mid-air, he missed and collected White's face {{at the height of his}} leg's swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14screws into White's jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne's final match of the season—Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> a match, despite the severity of the injury. White's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.|$|E

Nash injured his knee and ankle in Victoria's win over Western Australia in Perth in early July and was unable to train for a week. While Nash did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any matches due to the injuries, they bothered him {{throughout}} the season and he was forced to miss South Melbourne Footballers' weekly dance at the Lake Oval Social Hall. Although carrying injuries, Nash continued to show his versatility, playing around the ground and led South Melbourne to the Grand Final, their third in a row, only to be defeated by Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{struggled}} after Graham {{retired in}} 1956 and ended {{the regular season}} at 5–7, their first-ever losing record. After the season, Brown traded the 35-year-old Gatski to the Detroit Lions for a draft pick after Gatski asked for a raise. He only played in the 1957 season with the Lions. Detroit beat the Browns for the NFL championship that year. By the time he retired after the 1957 season, Gatski had played on eight championship teams, a professional football record. Gatski did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> a practice or a game during his 12 seasons in football.|$|E

The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund said he and Forsberg would play without salary.|$|E

5|$|On November 9, 2007, Yao {{played against}} fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian {{for the first}} time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was {{broadcast}} on 19networks in China, and was watched by over 200million people in China alone, {{making it one of}} the most-watched NBA games in history. In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference. Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. He missed the 2008 NBA Playoffs, but he did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> the 2008 Summer Olympics at Beijing, China in August. After Yao's injury, the Rockets stretched their winning streak to 22 games, at the time the second-longest such streak in NBA history. Yao underwent a successful operation on March 3, which placed screws in his foot to strengthen the bone, and recovery time was estimated at four months. Yao's final averages in 55games were 22.0points, 10.8rebounds, and 2.0blocks a game.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell {{began the}} season on a {{defensive}} pairing with Drew Doughty. Nearly a month into the campaign, he notched his first goal as a King, scoring short handed against the Dallas Stars in a 5–2 victory on October 28, 2010. In November 2010, he sustained a wrist injury {{during a game}} against the Nashville Predators, sidelining him for 12 games. After recovering, he suffered a knee injury, keeping him from another 11 games. Later in the season, during {{a game against the}} Phoenix Coyotes, on March 3, 2011, Mitchell was hit in the face by a shot from opposing forward Kyle Turris, requiring 53 stitches. He did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any additional games, however. Mitchell finished the season with five goals and five assists over 57 games, ranking third in average ice time per contest with the Kings. He added a goal and an assist in six playoff games as the Kings were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in the first round. On February 24, 2012, Mitchell signed a two-year contract extension with the Kings. In the 2012 playoffs, Mitchell helped the Kings defeat the Vancouver Canucks in the first round, the St. Louis Blues in the semi-finals (winning four games straight) and the Phoenix Coyotes in the Conference Finals. The Kings made the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time since}} 1993 and defeated the New Jersey Devils; this also marked Mitchell's first appearance in the Stanley Cup Final. Mitchell was the second player, after team captain Dustin Brown, to hoist the Cup after the win.|$|E
5|$|On the January 12, 2009 {{episode of}} Raw, DiBiase {{returned}} to aid Manu and Sim Snuka in attacking Cody Rhodes and Randy Orton. Instead, however, DiBiase turned {{on them and}} helped Rhodes and Orton assault Manu and Snuka, thus joining The Legacy faction. As part of The Legacy, DiBiase entered the Royal Rumble match {{in order to help}} Orton win, and lasted until the final four, before being eliminated by Triple H. Rhodes and DiBiase became involved in Orton's scripted rivalry with the McMahon family, helping him to attack Shane and Stephanie McMahon, and Stephanie's real-life husband, Triple H. DiBiase was also elevated to main event status as a result of joining The Legacy, competing in handicap and six-man tag team matches, as well as the occasional singles match against Orton's opponents and rivals. On April 26, at the Backlash pay-per-view, DiBiase, Rhodes, and Orton defeated Triple H, Batista, and Shane McMahon in a six-man tag team match, which, per the pre-match stipulation, resulted in Orton winning the WWE Championship. During WWE's tour of Australia in early July, DiBiase suffered an arm injury, but did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any time because of it. Throughout mid-2009, DiBiase and Rhodes continued to compete against and attack Orton's rivals, particularly Triple H, preventing him from earning a match for Orton's championship. As a result, Triple H reformed D-Generation X (DX) with Shawn Michaels and they defeated DiBiase and Rhodes at SummerSlam. DiBiase and Rhodes later defeated DX in a submissions count anywhere match at the Breaking Point pay-per-view, before losing to DX in a Hell in a Cell match at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view in October.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 2009–10 season Bogosian was {{bothered by}} an injury. During {{a game against}} the Ottawa Senators on October 31, 2009, Bogosian fell behind his team's net; with his left hand lying on the net's iron frame along the ice, another player fell on top of him. The impact broke his left thumb and injured his wrist. Though he did <b>not</b> <b>miss</b> any time from the injury, it had an effect on his {{offensive}} play; Bogosian was perceived to be more hesitant with the puck, choosing to pass it more often than shooting. In the first 17 games of the season, he had scored 8 goals, then went 29 contests without scoring. In the final 64 games, he only scored 2 goals. After he recovered, Bogosian admitted he did not play at his full capacity, but had decided not to disclose the injury to the team until the season finished in April 2010. Regardless of his injury, Bogosian only missed one game throughout the season, a game on March 14 against the Phoenix Coyotes. Even with these setbacks, Bogosian set career highs for games played (81), goals (10), assists (13) and points (23). The 10 goals he scored tied a team record for most by a defenseman in a season, first set by Yannick Tremblay in 1999–2000, the Thrashers' inaugural year. He also set a team record with 196 hits. Again the Thrashers missed the playoffs.|$|E
