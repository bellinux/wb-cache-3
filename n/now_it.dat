When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they brought cheese, French Jews brought sardines and Greek Jews brought halva and olives. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> was Hungarian salami.

The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; <b>now</b> <b>it</b> was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E

Rabbi Krustofski, {{who was in the}} audience, recognized him, was furious and disowned his son, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> has been 25 years since they have seen or spoken to each other.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. <b>Now</b> <b>it</b> concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line.

5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, and <b>now</b> <b>it</b> is known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone bed that is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest {{it is in the}} same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E
