40|$|In natural, undeveloped areas, a large {{percentage}} of relatively uncontaminated precipitation infiltrates the ground, thus recharging the ground water; the remaining runoff flows to nearby water bodies or evaporates. Development alters natural systems as vegetation and open spaces are replaced with new areas of impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, roofs, and turf, which greatly reduce infiltration and thus ground water recharge. Uncontrolled stormwater runoff develops into Floods, even in normal intensity of rainfall causing loss of water recharge levels.

50|$|The Chenab Colony was {{the largest}} {{colonisation}} project in the Punjab, beginning in 1892.

The area was well suited for large-scale colonisation, being a level, alluvial plain, virtually unbroken by ridges or <b>natural</b> <b>drainages.</b> The area was mostly barren land, save for settlement in the riverain tracts, and the presence of semi-nomadic pastoral people known as Janglis, whose rights to graze the land had not been recognised as amounting to proprietary rights by the government. These groups would however form part of an indigenous grouping, classed together with individuals from Montgomery, Jhang and Gujranwala who would be allotted 35 per cent of the total land in the new colony.|$|R

Typical head-of-hollow fills are graded and terraced to create permanently stable slopes.|$|E

The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water so that it does not do further damage to state agriculture and environment.|$|E
25|$|Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, {{nowadays}} fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, {{and only}} {{at the end of their}} life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built the locks and dam, they changed the <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> route of Lake Washington. The locks and dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a fish ladder as the locks were constructed to allow salmon to pass around the locks and dam.|$|E

25|$|In areas {{prone to}} urban flooding, one {{solution}} is the repair {{and expansion of}} man-made sewer systems and stormwater infrastructure. Another strategy is to reduce impervious surfaces in streets, parking lots and buildings through <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> channels, porous paving, and wetlands (collectively known as green infrastructure or sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS)). Areas identified as flood-prone can be converted into parks and playgrounds that can tolerate occasional flooding. Ordinances can be adopted to require developers to retain stormwater on site and require buildings to be elevated, protected by floodwalls and levees, or designed to withstand temporary inundation. Property owners can also invest in solutions themselves, such as re-landscaping their property to take {{the flow of water}} away from their building and installing rain barrels, sump pumps, and check valves.|$|E
25|$|The aquatic {{ecological}} {{community in the}} <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> system of the lower Murray River catchment includes all native fish and aquatic invertebrates within all natural creeks, rivers and associated lagoons, billabongs and lakes of the regulated portions of the Murray River below the Hume Weir, the Murrumbidgee River below Burrinjuck Dam, and the Tumut River below Blowering Dam, {{as well as all}} their tributaries and branches. In Yanga National Park, permanent and intermittent river channels, intermittent swamps, and billabongs make up components of this {{ecological community}}. The modification of natural river flows as a result of river regulation (dams, weirs) has been identified as the main threat to this ecological community. The changed river flow regimes lead to reduced habitat quality, loss of spawning cues, and reduced opportunities for dispersal and migration. Grazing also contributes to the degradation; however, the exclusion of livestock after gazettal as a national park should ease this pressure.|$|E
25|$|There were {{problems}} with water levels in 1792. A lack of maintenance {{had resulted in}} silting, and horses were used to tow the barges, rather than them sailing along the navigation. To prevent grounding of the boats, the water levels had been raised, preventing <b>natural</b> <b>drainage</b> from the surrounding land and causing flooding. Chaplin was ordered to carry out repairs but failed to do so, and died soon afterwards. His son Thomas took over, and tried to negotiate {{an end to the}} lease. On paper, this appears to have been accepted, {{but it is not clear}} that it was carried out, since George Chaplin, the son of Thomas, paid for the navigation to be made wider and deeper in 1811, and spent another £400 on repairs in 1814. There are no records of actual tolls, but estimates suggest that they rose from around £2,000 in the 1770s to £5,000 in the 1820s. Interest payments were £1,375 per year, and Chaplin argued that it had only become a profitable enterprise for him in the 1820s.|$|E
40|$|Northern pike {{is a large}} esocid native in many North American drainages {{that has}} been widely stocked outside of its <b>natural</b> <b>drainages</b> for sportfishing purposes. Stocking of {{northern}} pike outside of its natural range can have many negative effects on native and endangered fishes, existing sport fisheries or commercial fisheries such as salmon in the Pacific Northwest (Conover 1986).

Northern pike have become well established in the Yampa River, Colorado, probably from escapement from Elkhead Reservoir (a reservoir on Elkhead Creek, a tributary to the Yampa River) where it was originally stocked to provide public fishing opportunities.
