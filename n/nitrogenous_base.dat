5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of nucleotides. Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>base.</b> Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{biological}} sciences, <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> are increasingly termed nucleobases {{because of their}} role in nucleic acids - their flat shape is particularly important when considering their roles as {{the building blocks of}} DNA and RNA. A set of five <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> is used in the construction of nucleotides, which in turn build up the nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. These <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). These <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> hydrogen bond between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the [...] "twisted ladder" [...] or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides. Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs. Uracil is only present in RNA, replacing thymine.

They are reactive with N-Hydroxysuccinimide ester group which helps attach a fluorescent dye to the primary amino group on the nucleotide. These nucleotides are known as 5-(3-aminoallyl)-nucleotides since the aminoallyl group is usually attached to carbon 5 of the pyrimidine ring of uracil or cytosine. The primary amine group in the aminoallyl moiety is aliphatic and thus more reactive compared to the amine groups that are directly attached to the rings (aromatic) of the bases. Common names of aminoallyl nucleosides are initially abbreviated with aa- or AA- to indicate aminoallyl. The 5-carbon sugar is indicated {{with or without the}} lowercase [...] "d" [...] indicating deoxyribose if included or ribose if not.

Nucleotide and DNA aqueous solutions were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and iron containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to produce Fenton's reaction and induce oxidative damage. UV Raman spectroscopy is shown to be maximally efficient to reveal changes in the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> during the oxidative mechanisms occurring on these molecules. The analysis of Raman spectra, supported by numerical computations, revealed that the Fenton's reaction causes an oxidation of the <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> in dATP, dGTP and dCTP solutions leading to the production of 2 -hydroxyadenine, 8 -hydroxyguanine and 5 -hydroxycytosine. No thymine change was revealed in the dTTP solution under the same conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{key event}} in {{the origin of life}} on this planet has been {{formation}} of self-replicating RNA-type molecules, which were complex enough to undergo a Darwinian-type evolution (origin of the "RNA world"). However, so far there has been no explanation of how the first RNA-like biopolymers could originate and survive on the primordial Earth. Results As condensation of sugar phosphates and <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> is thermodynamically unfavorable, these compounds, if ever formed, should have undergone rapid hydrolysis. Thus, formation of oligonucleotide-like structures could have happened only if and when these structures had some selective advantage over simpler compounds. It is well known that <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> are powerful quenchers of UV quanta and effectively protect the pentose-phosphate backbones of RNA and DNA from UV cleavage. To check if such a protection could play a role in abiogenic evolution on the primordial Earth (in the absence of the UV-protecting ozone layer), we simulated, by using Monte Carlo approach, the formation of the first oligonucleotides under continuous UV illumination. The simulations confirmed that UV irradiation could have worked as a selective factor leading to a relative enrichment of the system in longer sugar-phosphate polymers carrying <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>bases</b> as UV-protectors. Partial funneling of the UV energy into the condensation reactions could provide a further boost for the oligomerization. Conclusion These results suggest that accumulation of the first polynucleotides could be explained by their abiogenic selection as the most UV-resistant biopolymers. </p...|$|R
