40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the CT features of intra abdominal illicit drug packs used for trafficking,by using scout CT scan image and describe its cost re-imbursement Methods: An observational {{study was conducted}} from January to December 2005, at the CT scan department, Civil Hospital, Karachi. The study subjects included alleged drug traffickers smuggling by body packing, intercepted at Karachi International Airport and referred for CT scan of abdomen by the Anti Narcotic department. Those with suspected body pack rupture were excluded. Scout CT image of the abdomen was taken.

40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to estimate the}} incidence and burden of cerebral microhemorrhage (<b>CM)</b> <b>in</b> patients with heart disease who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as detected on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), a magnetic resonance (MR) sequence that is highly sensitive to hemorrhagic products. Materials and Methods: With Institutional Review Board waiver of consent, MR imaging (MRI) of a cohort of 86 consecutive pediatric patients with heart failure who underwent heart transplantation evaluation were retrospectively reviewed for CM. A nested case–control study was performed. The CPB group consisted of 23 pediatric patients with heart failure from various cardiac conditions who underwent CPB. The control group was comprised of 13 pediatric patients with similar cardiac conditions, but without CPB history. Ten patients in the CPB group were female (age: 5 days to 16 years {{at the time of}} the CPB and 6 days to 17 years {{at the time of the}} MRI). The time interval between the CPB and MRI ranged from 11 days to 4 years and 5 months. Six patients in the control group were female, age range of 2 days to 6 years old. The number of CM on SWI was counted by three radiologists (PK, EK and DK). The differences <b>in</b> <b>number</b> of <b>CM</b> between groups were tested for significance using Mann–Whitney U-test, α = 0. 05. Using the univariate analysis of variance model, the differences <b>in</b> <b>number</b> of <b>CM</b> between groups were also tested with adjustment for age at MRI. Results: There are statistically significant differences <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> on SWI between the CPB group and control group with more <b>CM</b> were observed <b>in</b> the CPB group without and with adjustment for age at MRI (P < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{realization}} that GRBs are narrowly beamed {{implied that the}} actual rate of GRBs is {{much larger than the}} observed one. There are 500 unobserved GRBs for each observed one. The lack of a clear trigger makes it hard to detect these unobserved GRBs as orphan afterglows. At late time, hundreds or thousands of years after a GRB, we expect to observe a GRB remnant (GRBR). These remnants could be distinguished from the more frequent SNRs using their different morphology. While SNRs are spherical, GRBRs that arise from a highly collimated flow, are expected to be initially nonspehrical. Using SPH simulations we follow the evolution of a GRBR and calculate the image of the remnant produced by bremsstrahlung and by synchrotron emission. We find that the GRBR becomes spherical after ∼ 3000 yr(E 51 /n) 1 / 3 at R ∼ 12 pc(E 51 /n) 1 / 3, where E 51 is the initial energy in units of 10 51 erg and n is the surrounding ISM <b>number</b> density <b>in</b> <b>cm</b> − 3.

These results are modified if there is an underlying spherical supernova. In this case the GRBR will remain spherical only for ∼ 150 yr(E 51 /n) 1 / 3 and the number of non-spherical GRBRs is smaller by a factor of 10 and their size is smaller by a factor of 3...|$|R

METHODS: Myoblasts were incubated with control or pancreatic cancer CM for 24 and 48 hours. RESULTS: Lactate significantly increased <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> compared with non-conditioned myoblasts. No variations in expression levels of the main genes involved in glycolysis were found <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> myoblasts. Propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase and isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 beta genes, which encode enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, were overexpressed, while IGFIIR and VAMP 5 genes were underexpressed <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> myoblasts. PAFAH 1 B 1 and BCL- 2 genes (intracellular signal transduction) and the serine protease cathepsin G (proteolysis), were overexpressed <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> myoblasts. Tyrosine accumulation <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> myoblasts suggested that proteolysis overcomes protein synthesis.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that dairy cows require a dry period of at least 40 d for maximal milk yield in the subsequent lactation. Reducing the dry period requirement could prove beneficial to animal health and dairy profitability if subsequent milk yield was not reduced. Studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of continuous milking (CM) and hormonal treatments on milk yield, mammary epithelial cell (MEC) turnover during late gestation and early lactation, and mammary gene expression in dairy cows. A commercial trial using primiparous and multiparous cows demonstrated equal milk yields <b>in</b> bST-supplemented, <b>CM</b> and 60 -d dry (CTL) multiparous cows, but lower milk yields <b>in</b> bST-supplemented <b>CM,</b> primiparous cows treated with bST. Subsequent experiments evaluated mammary development requirements during the dry period in primiparous cows and methods of rescuing milk yield. MEC growth was lower <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> glands during most of late gestation. Maintenance of lactation <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> glands resulted <b>in</b> a marked reduction in the MEC turnover process that occurs in the early dry period. In the last 20 d of gestation, MEC growth remained reduced <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> glands. By the last week of gestation, MEC growth was 50 % less <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> tissue vs. CTL tissue. MEC apoptosis was unaffected by CM during the last 20 d of gestation, but a premature decrease in early lactation apoptosis occurred <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> glands at 7 d postpartum. Mammary gene expression demonstrated bax and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 are involved in apoptosis and cyclin D 1, CCAT/enhancer binding protein-&# 946;, and bcl 2 are involved in mammary development. Ultrastructure of CM tissue revealed large populations of resting or involuting alveoli by d 20 postpartum, whereas CTL glands had a homogenous population of secretory alveoli. Collectively, these data suggest that a 40 - 53 % reduction in milk yield <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> glands is caused by reductions in MEC renewal and reduced secretory capacity. Treatments (bST, prostaglandin E 2) to stimulate milk synthesis or MEC growth <b>in</b> <b>CM</b> primiparous glands were unsuccessful.
