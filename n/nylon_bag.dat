40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study into the {{deployment}} of a metal adsorbent in situ to estimate bioavailable Cd(II) in marine waters. Eight adsorbents were screened in the laboratory to test their ability to accumulate Cd(II) from deionised water and artificial seawater, and an oxidised activated carbon was selected for further investigation. The adsorption isotherm at Cd(II) concentrations 0. 16 – 38 μg l− 1 and at salinity 15 followed the Freundlich equation. The adsorbent was contained in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> (pore size 35 μm) and dialysis tubes (membrane pore size 2 nm) to produce deployable devices and to investigate the effect of housing material on Cd(II) accumulation. The devices were tested in the laboratory and deployed at four field sites for up to 3 weeks. The adsorbent in the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> reached equilibrium {{towards the end of}} this period and the measured contents were in good agreement with expected contents predicted from known seawater Cd(II) concentrations and the adsorption isotherm. The dialysis tubes accumulated significantly lower amounts of Cd(II) than the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags,</b> probably due to an initial lag as Cd(II) diffused into the dialysis bag and due to biofouling which reduced diffusion. The relationship between concentrations of Cd(II) accumulated by the mussels (indicating the bioavailable Cd(II) fraction) and the devices at different field sites could be described by the Freundlich model. The goodness of fit of this relationship was better for the dialysis tubes than the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags.</b> The adsorbent in the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> may have collected small particles from seawater which affected the Cd(II) analysis. Both devices demonstrate potential as indicators of the relative bioavailable fraction of Cd(II) to Mytilus edulis in marine waters...|$|R

The conditions at Fier were worse than the military prisons under the junta in Greece, and for fifteen days he was cold, over-worked and on punishment, in which he was permitted fifteen grammes of meat in the morning, his sole ration for each day in that period. However, he was fortunate at that time as Andreas Papandreou was mobilizing his contacts in the international Maoist and Sinophile movements — Albania at that time was a major satellite of Maoist China — to save him.

40|$|Sodium {{chlorite}} {{increased the}} degradability of fibre {{from a range}} of mature grass forages including barley straw by 40 – 50 digestibility units when comparisons were made using ground (1 mm sieve) material incubated either in vitro with cellulase or in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> in the rumen. However, when fed to sheep, chlorite-treated barley straw was digested to a similar degree to untreated straw (49 and 57 % respectively), but intake was significantly reduced (385 and 790 g/day respectively). The poor in vivo utilization of chlorite-treated straw coincided with high proportions of propionic to acetic acid in the rumen (0 – 85, cf. 0. 28 with untreated feed) and absence of rumen fungi. Rumen pH and ammonia concentrations were not significantly different between diets. When incubated in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> in the rumen of animals fed the corresponding diet, both untreated and treated straw (< 1 mm) were well colonized with microorganisms, as measured by cystine accumulation which showed peaks on the fibres after 24 and 72 h. While large numbers of fungal sporangia were observed after 24 h incubation on digests from untreated forage, no fungi could be detected on the chlorite-treated material. Cystine accumulation on the untreated straw after 72 h was not associated with a secondary growth of fungi. Although barley straw chaff, ground (< 1 mm) after treatment with chlorite, was highly degraded in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> in the rumen and with cellulase in vitro, larger particles (1 cm) suspended in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> in an animal fed chlorite-treated straw actually gained weight, probably {{due in part to the}} degree of microbial colonization...|$|R

Cattle with a permanent rumen cannula and a simple "T"-piece duodenal cannula were given 4 diets in a 4 X 4 Latin Square experiment. The basal diet (diet C) consisted of grass silage, barley and rapeseed meal (700, 240 and 60 g/kg total DM) given daily or supplemented with sucrose 1. 0 kg given twice daily (Diet S), twice daily with sodium bicarbonate 0. 25 kg/day (diet B) or as a continuous intrarumen infusion (diet I). Giving sucrose supplements decreased CMCase and xylanase activities extracted from microbes associated with rumen particulate material or feed particles incubated in <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> compared with diet c. Supplementation of the sucrose diet with sodium bicarbonate resulted in higher CMCase activities than other sucrose diets (S and I). Particle-associated CMCase {{activities were}} very sensitive in detecting differences in the rumen environment and were related to changes in cell wall digestion.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the problems presented by aluminum construction, the Sheridan had a defect that no other common armored vehicle possessed: it fired caseless 152mm main gun rounds. These rounds were [...] "fixed", meaning that, unlike the artillery, the warhead was factory attached to the propellant, and if the warhead separated from the propellant during loading, which was not uncommon, the crewmen were instructed not to load the round. Sometimes, these unspent propellant charges remained on the turret floor due to the emergencies at the time, and in either case, all of the remaining serviceable 152mm shells still remained caseless, albeit attached to their warheads, and sleeved into a re-usable white nine-ply <b>nylon</b> <b>bag,</b> which was form-fitted to hold the propellant portion of the shell. The white/silver-colored bag had a strap attached to the bottom, which the loader would grab and pull off prior to gently inserting the shell into the breech.Once a mine or RPG type weapon created the spark, smoke and fire became imminent, {{and it became a}} matter of Standing Operating Procedure to abandon the tank immediately. On 15 February 1969, just one month after the Sheridan's arrival in South Vietnam, an M551 from the 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry detonated a 25-pound pressure-triggered land mine, which ruptured its hull and ignited the 152mm shells, resulting in a secondary explosion that destroyed the tank. In late 1969, nine Sheridans from the 4th Squadron, 12th Cavalry were fording a river near the DMZ, when three of the M551s detonated mines, completely destroying them. On March 1971, five Sheridans from the 11th ACR were lost in one day to RPG fire; all five vehicles burst into flames and were totally destroyed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the total collection (in vivo), <b>nylon</b> <b>bag,</b> and in vitro digestibility techniques under standardized conditions. Twin steers were used simultaneously to measure the digestibility of five rations consisting of the following ratios of alfalfa hay to steamed roller barley: 4 : 0 (I), 3 : 1 (II), 2 : 2 (III), 1 : 3 (IV), and 0 : 4 (V). One trial was completed in the in vivo study using a six day collection period, whereas two trials were run for each of the other two techniques. Fermentation periods of 24, 48, and 72 hours or 12 and 24 hours were used for the <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro studies, respectively. In vivo energy, crude protein, ether extract, and dry matter digestibility and TDN increased as the roughage: concentrate decreased from 4 : 0 to 0 : 4. The inverse relationship was noted for cellulose and crude fiber digestibility. The variability in dry matter digestibility, as measured by standard deviations and coefficients of variation, was highest in the <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and lowest in the in vivo procedure. The difference between trials, using dry matter digestibility as the criterion, was generally non-significant for both the <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro techniques. It was concluded that repeatability between trials is not a factor when using these techniques if sufficient replications are used. Differences between animals within rations were greater than expected; however, when the data were pooled across all rations, the steers were not significantly different. The rate and variability of <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro dry matter and cellulose digestion was greatest in the first digestion period in each of the five rations. However, as the rations included concentrates, the rate of <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> dry matter and cellulose digestion decreased in the same period. A comparison of the three techniques,using the mean dry matter and cellulose digestion coefficients,showed the in vivo dry matter digestion to compare closely with the 48 hour <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and 24 hour in vitro digestion. The <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro cellulose digestibility underestimated the in vivo digestion of cellulose. The <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> dry matter digestibility at 48 and 72 hour fermentation periods and in vitro dry matter digestibility at 12 and 24 hours was significantly correlated with the in vivo digestibility of ether extract, energy, dry matter, cellulose, and crude fiber. Similar correlations were obtained when <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro cellulose digestion was correlated with in vivo digestibility of the chemical components. Correlation coefficients between the <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro techniques, using dry matter and cellulose digestion as criteria, showed a close relationship at the longer digestion periods. Regression equations developed from these correlations showed no significant (P <. 01) difference between the predicted and actual in vivo dry matter digestibility of eight substrates when using equations developed from the <b>nylon</b> <b>bag</b> and in vitro dry matter digestibility in this study. The effect of inoculum source on substrate digestion was studied using the in vitro technique. The data showed that all-roughage and all-concentrate substrates are digested more completely with inoculum from animals maintained on the same diet. However, when measuring the digestibility of a mixed substrate (roughage and concentrate), the most accurate results, as measured by a standard, were obtained when using an inoculum from donor animals maintained on a mixed diet, regardless of the proportion of roughage and concentrates...|$|E

Nitrogen retention as a percent of nitrogen intake was 35 % higher (P<. 05) for steers fed reconstituted than flaked sorghum grain diets. In two finishing trials with steers, feed intake and feed conversion were higher (P<. 05) for dry rolled than for flaked or reconstituted sorghum grain...|$|R
40|$|Quatro bubalinos e quatro bovinos, fistulados no rúmen, foram distribuídos aleatoriamente a dois quadrados latinos (4 x 4) para avaliar os efeitos de rações com quatro níveis de FDN (54, 60, 66 e 72 %) e de dois tamanhos de poros em sacos de náilon (53 e 100 mm) sobre a população de protozoários ciliados no conteúdo ruminal e dentro dos sacos incubados em diversos tempos. Não houve diferença nos diversos gêneros estudados e no total de protozoários nas amostras dos sacos de náilon entre 53 e 100 mm. As concentrações de Entodinium e de total de protozoários do conteúdo ruminal elevaram-se até o nível de 66 % de FDN, com queda acentuada em 72 % nos bubalinos, enquanto nos bovinos houve redução com o aumento de FDN na ração. Houve diferenças nas concentrações dos protozoários da subfamília Diplodiniinae, Epidinium e Dasytricha entre bubalinos e bovinos, dentro das amostras incubadas em sacos com poros de 53 mm. A concentração de Diplodiniinae aumentou com 72 % de FDN na dieta em ambas as espécies animais. Os bubalinos apresentaram valores médios de pH e taxa de passagem do líquido ruminal mais elevados e volumes ruminais menores que os bovinos. Four buffaloes {{and four}} cattle, rumen fistulated, were {{utilized}} in two Latin Square (4 x 4) {{to evaluate the}} effects of rations with increasing levels of NDF (54, 60, 66 and 72 % in DM) and two porous size of the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> (53 and 100 mm) on the population of ciliate protozoa in rumen content and inside the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> suspended in the rumen for several times. There {{was no difference in}} the several genus and in the total of protozoa in the samples of the <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> between 53 and 100 mm. The concentration of Entodinium and total of protozoa in the rumen content increased in the level of 66 % of NDF with drop accentuated in 72 % in the buffaloes, while in the cattle there was significant decrease with the increase of NDF in the ration. Rumen protozoa concentration of Diplodiniinae subfamily, Epidinium and Dasytricha were different for buffaloes and cattle inside the rumen incubated <b>nylon</b> <b>bags</b> with 53 mm pore size. Diplodiniinae concentration in the rumen content increased with 72 % of NDF in diet in both animal species. The buffaloes presented higher pH average values and rate of passage and lower ruminal volumes than cattle...|$|R
