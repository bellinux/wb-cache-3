It was first introduced in 1346 by the soldiers of George the Brilliant returning from a military expedition in south-western Georgia against invading Osmanli tribesmen. It is said that the plague wiped out a large part, if <b>not</b> <b>half</b> of the Georgian populace. This further weakened {{the integrity of the}} kingdom, as well as its military and logistic capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Leguizamo {{was born}} in Bogotá, the son of Alberto and Luz Leguizamo. His father was once an {{aspiring}} film director and studied at Cinecittà, but eventually dropped out {{due to lack of}} finances. According to Leguizamo, his paternal grandfather was of Italian and Puerto Rican descent, and his maternal grandmother was Lebanese. He has also described himself as being of Amerindian and Mestizo heritage. On June 10, 2011, Leguizamo's father declared in an interview with New York Hispanic newspaper El Diario that he is Colombian and not Puerto Rican, and that Leguizamo is therefore <b>not</b> <b>half</b> Puerto Rican as he has always stated. Leguizamo had always declared that he was Puerto Rican on his father's side, {{which was one of the}} reasons he was selected as the Puerto Rican Day Parade Global Ambassador of the Arts. In response to his father's allegations, Leguizamo reiterated that his grandfather was of Puerto Rican descent. A National Puerto Rican Day Parade spokesman stated that Leguizamo would keep his ambassadorship. He marched in the parade on June 12, 2011.|$|E

500|$|In 1819, when Peel {{introduced}} a Bill to introduce an eleven-hour day {{for all children}} under 16 working in cotton mills, a Lords Committee heard evidence from a Bolton magistrate who had investigated 29 local cotton mills; 20 had no apprentices but employed a total of 550 children under 14; the other nine mills employed a total of 98 apprentices, {{and a total of}} 350 children under 14. [...] Apprentices were mostly found in the larger mills, which had somewhat better conditions; some even worked a 12-hour day or less (the Grant brothers' mill at Tottington worked an 11.5 hour day: [...] "This establishment has perfect ventilation; all the apprentices, and in fact all the children, are healthy, happy, clean, and well clothed proper and daily attention is paid to their instruction and they regularly attend divine worship on Sundays."): in other mills children worked up to 15 hours a day in bad conditions (e.g. Gortons and Roberts' Elton mill: [...] "Most filthy; no ventilation; the apprentices and other children ragged, puny, <b>not</b> <b>half</b> clothed, and seemingly <b>not</b> <b>half</b> fed; no instruction of any sort; no human beings can be more wretched").|$|E
500|$|The studio {{version of}} the song was {{compiled}} from several different takes. It {{was one of several}} songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, [...] "It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's <b>not</b> <b>half</b> the song it is live." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} morning, {{they moved}} their camp {{to the river}} bank to facilitate easier watering of their stock. They were visited around noon by twenty-five warriors and a Mohave sub-chief, who heard their complaints about the killing of their livestock and assured them that no further depredations would occur, {{and that they could}} cross the Colorado as they pleased. About one hour later, another chief and several warriors approached the camp; after receiving gifts, they also left without incident. According to Rose, upon hearing of the emigrants plans the chief gave them, [...] "a very searching look, as if <b>not</b> <b>half</b> believing it". By noon, the party had moved their camp still closer to where they planned to cross, about a mile downriver near a patch of cottonwood trees that were suitable for building rafts.|$|E

500|$|The game's level {{design and}} low {{difficulty}} were also subject to negative criticism. GamePro found the levels {{to be fairly}} large, but not populated with enough enemies and secrets. IGN called the level design simplistic, calling it bland and seemingly unfinished, sharing the same sentiments about the low enemy population as GamePro. The game's large number of acts in each level (five, compared to previous entries having two or three) and simple boss fights was also noted. Mean Machines Sega felt that enemies were almost missing entirely, opining that [...] "without them, this is just <b>not</b> <b>half</b> the game it could have been". However, IGN, GameFan, and Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the number of playable characters, and IGN felt the game's fully 3D special stages were [...] "marvelous," [...] calling them {{the best of the}} Sonic series.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the {{majority}} of the music. [...] "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," [...] says Shakira. [...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was <b>not</b> <b>half</b> as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers is {{generally}} considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are <b>not</b> <b>half</b> so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of anything else to do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid.

Take 2 had two lines transposed from the first take: [...] "There's a shadow hanging over me"/"I'm <b>not</b> <b>half</b> the man I used to be", though it seems clear that their order in take 2 was the correct one, because McCartney can be heard, in take 1, suppressing a laugh at his mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Rutherford {{and others}} had noted the {{disparity}} between the mass of an atom, computed in atomic mass units, and the approximate charge required on the nucleus for the Rutherford model to work.
