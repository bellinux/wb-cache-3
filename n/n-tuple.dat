40|$|An {{ideal of}} <b>N-tuples</b> of {{operators}} is a class invariant {{with respect to}} unitary equivalence which contains direct sums of arbitrary collections of its members {{as well as their}} (reduced) parts. New decomposition theorems (with respect to ideals) for <b>N-tuples</b> of closed densely defined linear operators acting in a common (arbitrary) Hilbert space are presented. Algebraic and order (with respect to containment) properties of the class CDD_N of all unitary equivalence classes of such <b>N-tuples</b> are established and certain ideals in CDD_N are distinguished. It is proved that infinite operations in CDD_N may be reconstructed from the direct sum operation of a pair. Prime decomposition in CDD_N is proposed and its (in a sense) uniqueness is established. The issue of classification of ideals in CDD_N (up to isomorphism) is discussed. A model for CDD_N is described and its concrete realization is presented. A new partial order of <b>N-tuples</b> of operators is introduced and its fundamental properties are established. Extremal importance of unitary disjointness of <b>N-tuples</b> and the way how it `tidies up' the structure of CDD_N are emphasized. Comment: 115 page...|$|R

2500|$|The modern game-theoretic {{concept of}} Nash {{equilibrium}} is instead {{defined in terms}} of mixed strategies, where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was introduced by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their 1944 book The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of zero-sum games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions. The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article Non-Cooperative Games was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, [...] "an equilibrium point is an <b>n-tuple</b> such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others." [...] Just putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the Kakutani fixed-point theorem in his 1950 paper, and a variant upon it in his 1951 paper used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to prove that there had to exist at least one mixed strategy profile that mapped back into itself for finite-player (not necessarily zero-sum) games, namely, a strategy profile that did not call for a shift in strategies that could improve payoffs.|$|E
