2500|$|Opponents of {{this view}} argue that Shakespeare's erudition was greatly exaggerated by Victorian enthusiasts, and that the works display the typical {{knowledge}} {{of a man with}} a grammar school education of the time. His Latin is derived from school books of the era. There is no record that any contemporary of Shakespeare referred to him as a learned writer or scholar. Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont both refer to his lack of classical learning. If a university-trained playwright wrote the plays, it is hard to explain the many classical blunders in Shakespeare. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> mistake the scansion of many classical names, in Troilus and Cressida he has Greeks and Trojans citing Plato and Aristotle a thousand years before their births. Willinsky suggests that most of Shakespeare's classical allusions were drawn from Thomas Cooper’s Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae (1565), since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare’s plays, and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John Bretchgirdle for [...] "the common use of scholars".|$|E
2500|$|After debuting at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, the Broadway {{production}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. [...] During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. [...] Patinkin was replaced by future Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello. New York Times critic Frank Rich stated: [...] "Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role {{better than any of}} the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> have a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear.

2500|$|Janus {{owes the}} epithet Iunonius to his {{function}} as patron of all kalends, {{which are also}} associated with Juno. In Macrobius's explanation: [...] "Iunonium, as it were, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> hold the entry to January, but to all the months: indeed all the kalends are {{under the jurisdiction of}} Juno". At the time when the rising of the new moon was observed by the pontifex minor the rex sacrorum assisted by him offered a sacrifice to Janus in the Curia Calabra while the regina sacrorum sacrificed to Juno in the regia. Some scholars have maintained that Juno was the primitive paredra of the god. This point bears on the nature of Janus and Juno and {{is at the core of}} an important dispute: was Janus a debased ancient uranic supreme god, or were Janus and Jupiter co-existent, their distinct identities structurally inherent to their original theology? Among Francophone scholars Grimal and (implicitly and partially) Renard and Basanoff have supported the view of a uranic supreme god against Dumézil and Schilling. Among Anglophone scholars Frazer and Cook have suggested an interpretation of Janus as uranic supreme god. Whatever the case, it is certain that Janus and Juno show a peculiar reciprocal affinity: while Janus is Iunonius, Juno is Ianualis, as she presides over childbirth and the menstrual cycle, and opens doors. Moreover, besides the kalends Janus and Juno are also associated at the rite of the Tigillum Sororium of 1 October, in which they bear the epithets Ianus Curiatius and Iuno Sororia. These epithets, which swap the functional qualities of the gods, are the most remarkable apparent proof of their proximity. The rite is discussed in detail in the section below.|$|E
2500|$|Njegoš left Cetinje {{in early}} 1833 {{and set out}} on the long journey to Saint Petersburg. He hoped to be granted a meeting with Russian Emperor (czar) Nicholas I and consecrated as Metropolitan of Cetinje by the Holy Synod. Such a move was {{considered}} highly unusual at the time, as a vladika was traditionally consecrated by the Patriarch of Peć either in Patriarchal Monastery of Peć or in Sremski Karlovci, not Saint Petersburg. According to church canon, a vladika could not be any younger than thirty, a prerequisite that the twenty-year-old Njegoš clearly failed to meet. As such, he chose to have his consecration occur in Saint Petersburg out of political necessity, as he desperately needed the czar to bend church canons in his favour in order to acquire total legitimacy at home and brush aside any theological objections. On his way to Saint Petersburg, Njegoš made stops in several Austrian cities. In Vienna, he met famed Serbian language reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. Karadžić was greatly impressed with Njegoš, and in a letter to poet Lukijan Mušicki, he wrote: [...] "Petar Petrović is not yet twenty years old, but is taller and more handsome than any grenadier in Vienna. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> know Serbian very well to read and write, but he also composes fine verse. He thinks that there is no finer language in the world than our popular tongue (and he's right to think so, even if it were not true)." [...] Njegoš arrived in Saint Petersburg in March 1833 and was consecrated. After the ceremony, the czar granted Njegoš a total of 36,000 rubles, 15,000 of which were to make up for his travel expenses. Standing next to Njegoš as he gave his speech, the czar is said to have commented: [...] "My word, you're bigger than I am." [...] Grateful, the young vladika replied: [...] "Only God is bigger than the Russian czar!" [...] The czar promised Njegoš that Russia would intervene on Montenegro's behalf as if it were one of its own gubernias, while the Holy Synod vowed to provide all the necessary equipment and funds needed to maintain regular religious services in the country.|$|E

Yet <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> grant the terms submitted to him, but in addition he actually lends an ear to the Council's prayer that out of consideration for the great suffering of the city in the siege he should refrain from exacting any indemnity.

In answer to the Council's expressed fears of further harm at the hands of his troopers once these should be in Faenza, he actually consented to effect no entrance into the town.|$|E
60|$|The French people--says M. de Tocqueville--made, in 1789, the {{greatest}} effort which was ever made by any nation to cut, so to speak, their destiny in halves, and to separate by an abyss that {{which they had}} heretofore been, from that which they sought to become hereafter. But he had long thought that they had succeeded in this singular attempt much less than was supposed abroad; and less than they had at first supposed themselves. He was convinced that they had unconsciously retained, from the former state of society, most of the sentiments, the habits, and even the opinions, by means of which they had effected the destruction of that state of things; and that, without intending it, they had used its remains to rebuild the edifice of modern society. This is his thesis, and this he proves, it seems to me, incontestably by documentary evidence. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> find habits which we suppose--or supposed till lately--to have died with the eighteenth century, still living and working, at least in France, in the nineteenth, but the new opinions which we look on usually as the special children of the nineteenth century, he shows {{to have been born}} in the eighteenth.

6000|$|Mr. H. G. Wells {{exists at}} {{present in a}} gay and exhilarating {{progress}} of conservativism. He is finding out more and more that conventions, though silent, are alive. As good an example as any of this humility and sanity of his {{may be found in}} his change of view on the subject of science and marriage. He once held, I believe, the opinion which some singular sociologists still hold, that human creatures could successfully be paired and bred after the manner of dogs or horses. He no longer holds that view. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> no longer hold that view, but he has written about it in [...] "Mankind in the Making" [...] with such smashing sense and humour, that I find it difficult to believe that anybody else can hold it either. It is true that his chief objection to the proposal is that it is physically impossible, which seems to me a very slight objection, and almost negligible compared with the others. The one objection to scientific marriage which is worthy of final attention is simply that such a thing could only be imposed on unthinkable slaves and cowards. I do not know whether the scientific marriage-mongers are right (as they say) or wrong (as Mr. Wells says) in saying that medical supervision would produce strong and healthy men. I am only certain that if it did, the first act of the strong and healthy men would be to smash the medical supervision.|$|E

[...] "They do not seek to produce effect by novelty and invention in plot [...] . they seek it in character. For this end they begin by deliberately falsifying human feelings, giving them a paradoxical appearance completely inadmissible [...] . Love that disguises itself as hate, incomparable energy under the cloak of weakness, virginal innocence under the aspect of malice and impudence, wit masquerading as folly, etc., etc. By this means they hope to make an effect of which they are incapable through the direct, frank, and conscientious study of character." [...] He mentions Octave Feuillet as the greatest offender in this sort among the French, and Bulwer among the English; but Dickens is full of it (Boffin in 'Our Mutual Friend' will suffice for all example), and most drama is witness of the result of this effectism when allowed full play.|$|E
6000|$|It {{will not}} have escaped the {{attentive}} eye, that I have, on the title-page, omitted those honorary appendages to the editorial name which not only add greatly {{to the value of}} every book, but whet and exacerbate the appetite of the reader. For <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> surmise that an honorary membership of literary and scientific societies implies a certain amount of necessary distinction {{on the part of the}} recipient of such decorations, but he is willing to trust himself more entirely to an author who writes under the fearful responsibility of involving the reputation of such bodies as the S. Archæol. Dahom., or the Acad. Lit. et Scient. Kamtschat. I cannot but think that the early editions of Shakspeare and Milton would have met with more rapid and general acceptance, but for the barrenness of their respective title-pages; and I believe that, even now, a publisher of the works of either of those justly distinguished men would find his account in procuring their admission to the membership of learned bodies on the Continent,--a proceeding no whit more incongruous than the reversal of the judgment against Socrates, when he was already more than twenty centuries beyond the reach of antidotes, and when his memory had acquired a deserved respectability. I conceive that it was a feeling of the importance of this precaution which induced Mr. Locke to style himself [...] "Gent."

6000|$|The {{fragment}} from Homer {{included the}} speech of Sarpedon to Glaucus. [...] "It has," [...] said the poet, [...] "been rendered in English by Sir John Denham, after whom the translator had not the vanity to attempt it for any other reason, than that the episode {{must have been very}} imperfect without so noble a part of it." [...] Denham at that period had a much more brilliant reputation than he afterwards retained, and though Pope adopted the language of humility, he must have felt an inward pride in the consciousness that he had distanced so famous a name. His great superiority did not admit of a question, and he must have been well aware that it was his interest to invite a comparison. The specimen was shown in manuscript to Trumbull, who, in his admiration, urged Pope to give a complete translation of the Iliad. The exhortations of Trumbull did not bear fruit till 1713. [...] "I cannot," [...] Pope wrote to him in the November of that year, [...] "deny myself the pleasure of acquainting you how great a proof I have given of my deference to your opinion and judgment, which has at last moved me to undertake the translation of Homer. I can honestly say Sir William Trumbull was not only the first that put this into my thoughts, but the principal encourager I had in it, and though now almost all the distinguished names of quality or learning in the nation have subscribed to it, there is not one of which I am so proud as of yours." [...] When the first volume of the translation appeared in 1715, Pope paid his acknowledgments in the Preface to the eminent men who had specially patronised the work. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> make no mention of Trumbull, but he professes to have yielded to the counsel of a greater authority, and says, [...] "Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake the task."

60|$|During {{the summer}} he spent at York Harbor I was only forty minutes away at Kittery Point, {{and we saw}} each other often; but this was before the last time at Riverdale. He had a wide, low cottage in a pine grove {{overlooking}} York River, and we used to sit at a corner of the veranda farthest away from Mrs. Clemens's window, where we could read our manuscripts to each other, and tell our stories, and laugh our hearts out without disturbing her. At first she had been about the house, and there was one gentle afternoon when she made tea for us in the parlor, but {{that was the last time}} I spoke with her. After that it was really a question of how soonest and easiest she could be got back to Riverdale; but, of course, there were specious delays in which she seemed no worse and seemed a little better, and Clemens could work at a novel he had begun. He had taken a room in the house of a friend and neighbor, a fisherman and boatman; there was a table where he could write, and a bed where he could lie down and read; and there, unless my memory has played me one of those constructive tricks that people's memories indulge in, he read me the first chapters of an admirable story. The scene was laid in a Missouri town, and the characters such as he had known in boyhood; but as often as I tried to make him own it, he denied having written any such story; it is possible that I dreamed it, but I hope the MS. will yet be found. Upon reflection I cannot believe that I dreamed it, and I cannot believe that it was an effect of that sort of pseudomnemonics which I have mentioned.

6000|$|The {{subject of}} the hot dispute was simply this. Were Gentile {{converts}} bound to obey the Law or not? Paul answered in the negative; and, acting upon his opinion, had created at Antioch (and elsewhere) a specifically [...] "Christian" [...] community, the sole qualifications for admission into which were the confession of the belief that Jesus was the Messiah, and baptism upon that confession. In the epistle in question, Paul puts this--his [...] "gospel," [...] as he calls {434} it--in its most extreme form. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> deny the necessity of conformity with the Law, but he declares such conformity to have a negative value. [...] "Behold, I, Paul, say unto you, that if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing" [...] (Galatians v. 2). He calls the legal observances [...] "beggarly rudiments," [...] and anathematises every one who preaches to the Galatians any other gospel than his own. That is to say, by direct consequence, he anathematises the Nazarenes of Jerusalem, whose zeal for the Law is testified by James in a passage of the Acts cited further on. In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, dealing {{with the question of}} eating meat offered to idols, it is clear that Paul himself thinks it a matter of indifference; but he advises that it should not be done, {{for the sake of the}} weaker brethren. On the other hand, the Nazarenes of Jerusalem most strenuously opposed Paul's [...] "gospel," [...] insisting on every convert becoming a regular Jewish proselyte, and consequently on his observance of the whole Law; and this party was led by James and Peter and John (Galatians ii. 9). Paul does not suggest that the question of principle was settled by the discussion referred to in Galatians. All he says is that it ended in the practical agreement that he and Barnabas should do as they had been doing, in respect to the Gentiles; while James and Peter and John should deal in their own fashion with Jewish converts. Afterwards, he complains bitterly of Peter, because, when on a visit to Antioch, he at first inclined to Paul's view, and ate with the Gentile converts; but when [...] "certain came from James," [...] {435} [...] "drew back, and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation" [...] (Galatians ii. 12-13).|$|E

Not only is he devoid of all apprehension of scientific conceptions, <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> fail to attach any meaning to the words [...] "matter," [...] "force," [...] or [...] "law" [...] in their scientific senses, but, worse still, he has no notion of what it is to come into contact with Nature, or to lay his mind alongside of a physical fact, and try to conquer it, in the way our great naval hero told his captains to master their enemies. His whole mind has been given to books, and I am hardly exaggerating if I say that they are more real to him than Nature. He imagines that all knowledge can be got out of books, and rests upon the authority of some master or other; nor does he entertain any misgiving that the method of learning which led to proficiency in the rules of grammar will suffice to lead him to a mastery of the laws of Nature. The youngster, thus unprepared for serious study, is turned loose among his medical studies, with the result, in nine cases out of ten, that the first year of his curriculum is spent in learning how to learn.
