5|$|In 1936 the U.S. {{court ruled}} in U.S. v. One Package that {{medically}} prescribing contraception {{to save a}} persons life or well being was not illegal under the Comstock Law; following this decision, the American Medical Association Committee on Contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control. A <b>national</b> <b>survey</b> in 1937 showed 71 percent {{of the adult population}} supported the use of contraception. By 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the United States despite their advertisement still being illegal. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning. In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services, and the Federal Government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families. The Affordable Care Act, passed into law on March 23, 2010 under President Barack Obama, requires all plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover contraceptive methods. These include barrier methods, hormonal methods, implanted devices, emergency contraceptives, and sterilization procedures.|$|E
5|$|Several {{popularity}} polls {{conducted over}} the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may, in fact, have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine who the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked 58 in the list of the 100 Greatest Britons, broadcast by the BBC. He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese <b>national</b> <b>survey</b> of the 100 most influential heroes. Despite {{the fact that he had}} been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present. In 2008 Rolling Stone ranked Mercury 18 on its list of the Top 100 Singers Of All Time. Mercury was voted the greatest male singer in MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music. In 2011 a Rolling Stone readers' pick placed Mercury in second place of the magazine's Best Lead Singers of All Time.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{review the}} {{international}} {{guidelines and recommendations}} on survey instruments for measurement of alcohol consumption in population surveys and to examine how <b>national</b> <b>surveys</b> in England meet the core recommendations. Methods: A systematic search for international guidelines for measuring alcohol consumption in population surveys was undertaken. The common core recommendations for alcohol consumption measures and survey instruments were identified. Alcohol consumption questions in <b>national</b> <b>surveys</b> in England were compared with these recommendations for specific years and over time since 2000. Results: Four sets of international guidelines and three core alcohol consumptionmeasures (alcohol consumption status, average volume of consumption, frequency and volume of heavy episodic drinking) with another optional measure (drinking context) were identified. English <b>national</b> <b>surveys</b> have been inconsistent over time in including questions that provide information on average volume of consumption but have not included questions on another essential alcohol consumptionmeasure, frequencyof heavy episodic drinking. Instead, they have used questions that focus only onmaximum volume of alcohol consumed on any day in the previous week. Conclusions: International guidelines provide consistent recommendations for measuring alcohol consumption in population surveys. These recommendations have not been consistently applied in English <b>national</b> <b>surveys,</b> and this {{has contributed to the}} inadequacy of survey measurements for monitoring vital aspects of alcohol consumption in England over recent years...|$|R
