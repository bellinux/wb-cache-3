40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} stress coping and some extents of wellbeing in adolescents using drugs, however, not many have assessed changes in these constructs in adolescents undergoing drug rehabilitation. The present study aims to (1) examine changes in coping and domains of subjective wellbeing, and (2) explore potential causal relationship between changes in coping and subjective wellbeing in 111 students currently studying at Christian Zheng Sheng College (ZS). The present study was of cross-sequential design, where students completed {{the same set of}} relevant questionnaires at baseline, 4 months, 8 months and 12 months later. Latent Growth Modelling (LGM) and cross-lagged regression analyses were conducted to examine changes in these constructs across time and potential causality between the observed changes. Results from the LGMs suggest that students who <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>longer</b> at ZS <b>had</b> higher baseline in self-perceived success in important domains in life and overall satisfaction with life than those who <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> for shorter duration of time. Students who <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>longer</b> at ZS also had more active coping and positive reframing than those who <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> for shorter duration of time. Results from the cross-lagged regression models suggest that one’s self-perceived success in important areas of life and overall satisfaction with life possibly predicts one’s use of adaptive strategies, for instance, accommodation (i. e., positive reframing and acceptance) and problem solving (i. e., active coping and planning) in coping with stress. Overall, the results from the present study highlighted the potential of enhancing adolescents’ subjective wellbeing in promoting adaptive stress coping in the drug rehabilitation programme. published_or_final_versionClinical PsychologyMasterMaster of Social Science...|$|R
5000|$|Both the Nazarene Brotherhood and the Barbus {{were able}} to attempt {{communal}} living in abandoned monasteries outside Rome and Paris respectively, but these convenient possibilities on the continent in the Napoleonic period were not available in the London of the 1820s, so Palmer encouraged long-term stays at his house in Shoreham or elsewhere in the village.

30|$|Finally, it can {{be argued}} that length of stay in the country may have an effect. Russian {{migrants}} in the Western European countries <b>have</b> <b>stayed,</b> on average, in the countries for 11  years, while the majority of the Russian diaspora in Eastern Europe have been there for more than 20  years. Length of stay could not be included in the models as it creates multicollinearity with the age variable, as the older also <b>have</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>longer.</b> To account for this we ran two additional models with only migrants and diaspora who have been in the country for at least 10  years and at least 20  years (not shown). The additional models show the same non-effects, which again leads to the conclusion that we cannot demonstrate the ‘migration effect’.|$|R
50|$|Vitali {{never reached}} a higher {{position}} in Bologna {{than that of}} maestro di cappella at the Santissimo Rosario. There may be several reasons for this. By {{the time he left}} Bologna and moved to Modena he had not published any vocal music and is known to have composed only two vocal works, the oratorios Agare and Il Gefte. He was also, significantly, not an organist - unlike the vast majority of maestri di cappella in Bologna during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It is unlikely, therefore, that even if Vitali <b>had</b> <b>stayed</b> <b>longer</b> in Bologna he would have been offered the job of maestro di cappella at San Petronio, the most important musical position in the city.|$|R

My impression of it was quite vivid enough without that, and the vision of the Colosseum remained, and still remains, the immense skeleton of the stupendous form stripped of all integumental charm and broken down half one side of its vast oval, so that wellnigh a quarter of the structural bones are gone.|$|R
