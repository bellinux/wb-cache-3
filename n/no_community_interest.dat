50|$|The Local Government Reform {{process in}} July 2007 {{concluded}} that amalgamation of the Shire would {{not result in}} any benefits to service delivery and management for the area, noting that it was (and is) the largest local government by area and had <b>no</b> <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> with any neighbouring areas. The council was, however, reduced from seven to six councillors with an additional elected mayor.|$|R
50|$|Hinchinbrook {{was one of}} the few shires {{outside of}} remote areas in Queensland not to be {{affected}} by amalgamations in 2007-2008. It was considered for amalgamation into the Cassowary Coast Region with Cardwell and Johnstone, but the Local Government Commissioners accepted arguments by the council that there was <b>no</b> significant <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> between the three, that amalgamation would not improve financial sustainability and that the resulting council would have a large north-south distance which would impact upon economies of scale.|$|R
5000|$|Regulating {{conflict}} of interest in government {{is one of the}} aims of political ethics. Public officials are expected to put service to the public and their constituents ahead of their personal interests. Conflict of interest rules are intended to prevent officials from making decisions in circumstances that could reasonably be perceived as violating this duty of office. Rules in the executive branch tend to be stricter and easier to enforce than in the legislative branch. Two problems make legislative ethics of conflicts difficult and distinctive. First, as James Madison wrote, legislators should share a [...] "communion of interests" [...] with their constituents. Legislators cannot adequately represent the interests of constituents without also representing some of their own. As Senator Robert S. Kerr once said, [...] "I represent the farmers of Oklahoma, although I have large farm interests. I represent the oil business in Oklahoma...and I am in the oil business...They don't want to send a man here who has <b>no</b> <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> with them, because he wouldn't be worth a nickel to them." [...] The problem is to distinguish special interests from the general interests of all constituents. Second, the [...] "political interests" [...] of legislatures include campaign contributions which they need to get elected, and which are generally not illegal and not the same as a bribe. But under many circumstances they can have the same effect. The problem here is how to keep the secondary interest in raising campaign funds from overwhelming what should be their primary interest—fulfilling the duties of office.|$|R

50|$|When a not-for-profit {{community}} group {{applies to the}} regulating body (the Australian Communications and Media Authority) for a community broadcasting licence, it specifies the <b>community</b> <b>interest</b> it intends to serve. Licensees are selected by the regulator {{on the basis of}} suitability and on the merits of the licence application and the capacity to serve identified <b>community</b> <b>interests.</b> Upon grant of a five-year renewable licence each station is required to continue to serve the <b>community</b> <b>interest</b> for which the licence was granted. The Broadcast Services Act establishes the requirement to continue to represent the licensed <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> and the requirement to encourage participation from the licensed <b>community</b> of <b>interest</b> in the provision and selection of programs as key conditions of the licence. Provisions for Temporary Community Radio Liceneces in the Act allow, where spectrum is available, for aspirant {{community group}}s to develop their facilities and financial and programming models before the regulator considers making a permanent licence available.|$|R
