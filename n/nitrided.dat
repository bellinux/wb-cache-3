25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas <b>nitrided,</b> hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E
2500|$|The Praga B2 was a dual ignition, {{air-cooled}} horizontal twin producing 40 horsepower (30kW) {{aimed at}} lightweight aircraft. [...] It was a higher compression version (6.7:1 {{from the earlier}} 5.72:1) of the original and otherwise very similar Praga B, which provided 36hp (27kW). [...] Its cylinders were machined from alloy steel forgings and had aluminium alloy heads. The pistons were of aluminium alloy, with three compression rings and one scraper ring. The connecting rods were of <b>nitrided</b> steel, with divided big ends and bronze bushes at the little ends. The one piece crankshaft was also formed from <b>nitrided</b> steel and had two main roller bearings and a single ball thrust bearing. The single piece crankcase was cast from an aluminium alloy.|$|E
2500|$|During manufacture, {{propeller}} pistons, which {{control the}} pitch of the propellers, are coated through a process called nitriding, which hardens them and makes them more resistant to surface wear. [...] They {{are supposed to be}} inspected to make sure the process is completed. [...] While it is not known why the propeller on N73130 was not <b>nitrided</b> or failed inspections, the fact remains that it was, and was installed on N73130. [...] During the life of the engine, the piston had been slowly wearing away. During the flight, the piston finally failed, causing the propeller to over-speed. [...] The propeller subsequently failed due to overstress, 1 to 2 seconds later. [...] When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself. [...] The investigators determined that the crash was solely caused by the propeller defect and subsequent failure.|$|E

5000|$|Like carbides, <b>nitrides</b> {{are often}} {{refractory}} materials owing to their high lattice energy which reflects the strong attraction of [...] "N3−" [...] for the metal cation. Thus, titanium <b>nitride</b> and silicon <b>nitride</b> {{are used as}} cutting materials and hard coatings. Hexagonal boron <b>nitride,</b> which adopts a layered structure, is a useful high-temperature lubricant akin to molybdenum disulfide. <b>Nitride</b> compounds often have large band gaps, thus <b>nitrides</b> are usually insulators or wide bandgap semiconductors, examples include boron <b>nitride</b> and silicon <b>nitride.</b> The wide band gap material gallium <b>nitride</b> is prized for emitting blue light in LEDs.

50|$|It is {{possible}} that the interfacial layer composed of <b>nitrided</b> silicon dioxide is responsible for those instabilities. This interfacial layer results from the spontaneous oxidation of the silicon substrate when the high-K dielectric is deposited. To limit this oxidation, the silicon interface is saturated with N resulting in a very thin and <b>nitrided</b> oxide layer.|$|E

50|$|A plasma <b>nitrided</b> part {{is usually}} ready for use. It calls for no machining, or {{polishing}} {{or any other}} post-nitriding operations. Thus the process is user-friendly, saves energy since it works fastest, and causes little or no distortion.|$|E

50|$|The Nitronic name {{is due to}} the {{addition}} of nitrogen to the alloy, which enhances the strength internally rather than being <b>nitrided</b> on the surface as some steel are treated.

40|$|Mesoporous {{graphitic carbon}} <b>nitride</b> {{was used as}} both a nanoreactor and a {{reactant}} for the synthesis of ternary metal <b>nitride</b> nanoparticles. By infiltration of a mixture of two metal precursors into mesoporous carbon <b>nitride,</b> the pores act first as a nanoconfinement, generating amorphous mixed oxide nanoparticles. During heating and decomposition, the carbon <b>nitride</b> second acts as reactant or, more precisely, as a nitrogen source, which converts the preformed mixed oxide nanoparticles into the corresponding <b>nitride</b> (reactive templating). Using this approach, ternary metal <b>nitride</b> particles with diameters smaller 10 nm composed of aluminum gallium <b>nitride</b> (Al−Ga−N) and titanium vanadium <b>nitride</b> (Ti−V−N) were synthesized.

40|$|Metal oxide {{semiconductor}} capacitors with oxidized {{thick and thin}} <b>nitride</b> films of two different <b>nitride</b> thicknesses were used to study the conduction and charge-trapping behavior under positive stress bias to the upper electrode. Although the top oxide thickness {{of the two groups}} of oxidized <b>nitride</b> films is the same, the charge-trapping character-istics are different. It was found that due to the positive stress to the upper electrode of oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> the gate voltage is shifted to the negative direction, whereas in oxidized thin <b>nitride,</b> it is shifted to the positive direction, just like the <b>nitride</b> films. It was also observed that in <b>nitride</b> films, irrespective of <b>nitride</b> thickness, due to the positive stress bias, the gate voltage is shifted to the positive direction. From the experimental results of oxidized thick and thin <b>nitride,</b> it can be inferred that in oxidized thick <b>nitride,</b> due to electron injection from the lower electrode, holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film and are trapped near the interface. As a result of trapped holes near the interface of the top oxide and <b>nitride,</b> as well as a shallow electron trap centered below the conduction band of the <b>nitride,</b> a large increase in current is observed in oxidized thick <b>nitride.</b> On the other hand, in oxidized thin <b>nitride</b> films for the same positive stress bias, only a few holes are generated in the <b>nitride</b> film because most of the injected electrons from the lower electrode tunnel through the <b>nitride</b> and are trapped in the top oxide. Also shallow trap centers are generated below the conduction band of the thin <b>nitride</b> films.

50|$|Since {{nitrogen}} ions {{are made}} available by ionization, differently from gas or salt bath, plasma nitriding efficiency {{does not depend}} on the temperature. Plasma nitriding can thus be performed in a broad temperature range, from 260 °C to more than 600 °C.
