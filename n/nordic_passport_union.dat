25|$|The Øresund Bridge {{crosses the}} border between Denmark and Sweden, but in {{accordance}} with the Schengen Agreement and the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union,</b> there are usually no passport inspections. There are random customs checks at the entrance toll booths entering Sweden, but not when entering Denmark. Since January 2016, checks have become significantly more stringent due to the European migrant crisis.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{documents are}} generally considered valid (varying a little, since no law lists them): <b>Nordic</b> driving licence, <b>passport</b> (often only from EU and EFTA), national ID card from EU, Norwegian ID card from banks and some more. There is no ID card for anyone except bank ID card (normally {{printed on the}} reverse of a credit card). To get a bank ID card either a <b>Nordic</b> <b>passport</b> or another passport together with Norwegian residence and work permit is needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} {{cooperation between the}} Nordic Countries has not led to a common policy or an agreement on the countries' memberships in the European Union, Eurozone, and NATO. Norway and Iceland are the only Nordic countries not members of the European Union, while Finland and Sweden are the only Nordic countries not members of NATO. Denmark alone participates in both organizations. Only Finland {{is a member of}} the Eurozone. The tasks and policies of the European Union overlap with the Nordic council significantly, e.g. the Schengen Agreement partially supersedes the <b>Nordic</b> <b>passport</b> free zone and a common labor market.|$|R
25|$|Despite the <b>passport</b> <b>union</b> with Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, Finland {{could not}} join the Nordic Council until 1955 because of Soviet fears that Finland might become {{too close to}} the West. At that time the Soviet Union saw the Nordic Council as part of NATO of which Denmark, Norway and Iceland were members.|$|R
25|$|The Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the Schengen Area, and Schengen visas are not valid. However, the islands are part of the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> and the Schengen Agreement {{provides}} that travellers passing between the islands and the Schengen Area are not to be treated as passing the external frontier of the Area. This means that there is an identity check at air or boat travel to the islands where Nordic citizens on intra-Nordic travel need no passport, only showing the ticket plus identity card.|$|E
25|$|The Schengen Area {{consists}} of 26 states, including four {{which are not}} members of the European Union (EU). Two of the non-EU members, Iceland and Norway, {{are part of the}} <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> and are officially classified as 'states associated with the Schengen activities of the EU'. Switzerland was subsequently allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008. Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011. De facto, the Schengen Area also includes three European micro-statesMonaco, San Marino and the Vatican Citythat maintain open or semi-open borders with other Schengen member countries. Two EU membersIreland and the United Kingdomnegotiated opt-outs from Schengen and continue to operate the Common Travel Area systematic border controls with other EU member states.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November 2015, {{the cabinet}} {{introduced}} temporary border controls with immediate effect. The cabinet also proposed identity checks for every individual passing the Danish-Swedish border and {{closing of the}} Öresund Bridge, giving up the latter on 8 December 2015 after severe criticism. On 17 December 2015, the Riksdag passed legislation to introduce identity checks with the votes 175 in favor, 39 against and 135 abstained. On 4 January 2016, the identity checks was introduced, which means that {{people who can not}} show a valid identity card, license or passport are not allowed to cross the border into Sweden, breaking with the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> {{for the first time since}} 1954. Only twelve hours later the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced that Denmark will implement temporary border controls along the German-Danish border with immediate effect as a consequence of Sweden's identity checks.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Finland and the {{countries}} of the Nordic Council entered into a <b>passport</b> <b>union,</b> allowing their citizens to cross borders without passports and soon also to apply for jobs and claim social security benefits in the other countries. Many from Finland used this opportunity to secure better-paying jobs in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s, dominating Sweden's first wave of post-war labour immigrants. Although Finnish wages and standard of living could not compete with wealthy Sweden until the 1970s, the Finnish economy rose remarkably from the ashes of World War II, resulting in the buildup of another Nordic-style welfare state.|$|R

25|$|As {{explicitly}} asserted by both treaties of the European Union, the Faroe Islands are {{not part}} of the European Union. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the War in Donbass in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh salmon to Russia. Moreover, a protocol to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not citizens of the European Union (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the Schengen Agreement, but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the Schengen Area as part of the Schengen agreement).|$|E

50|$|On the {{economic}} and social policy front, Tindemans advocated for reigniting discussions about a common economic and monetary policy, which had stalled in Europe during the early 1970s recession. As part of this revival of talks, he also advocated for the consolidation and modification of the snake. He proposed expanding the scope of monetary policy by establishing an internal monetary policy, budgetary policy, and plans for the control of inflation. Tindemans supported abolishing the remaining obstacles to free trade of capital that existed within the European Economic Community. Finally, Tindemans hoped for a citizen’s Europe; he advocated for European civil rights, consumer rights, and protection of the environment. He also pushed for a European <b>passport</b> <b>union,</b> and creation of integrated educational systems. Finally, Tindemans encouraged broad institutional reform, pushing for increased powers to the European Parliament, and overall reform for the European Council, the Council of Ministers, and the European Commission.|$|R

In 1972 Max Jakobson was a candidate for Secretary-General of the UN. In another remarkable event of 1955, the Soviet Union decided to return the Porkkala peninsula to Finland, which had been rented to the Soviet Union in 1948 for 50 years as a military base, a situation which somewhat endangered Finnish sovereignty and neutrality.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The University of Oslo is {{currently}} developing an automatic morphosyntactic tagger for Norwegian. 2 A very important module is one which can analyse compounds. Compounding is extremely productive in Norwegian, {{and it is}} futile to ever hope for a lexicon (dictionary) that will contain all or even most of the compounds that occr in actual texts. Since the tagger we are developing {{is based on the}} possibility of recognising words by the help of a lexicon, it is of great importance to have a module that recognises new compounds. According to Munthe (1972), 10. 4 per cent of all words in running text are compounds. Any text sample will contain a greatnumber of compounds. This statistics is true even for small samples. I took an arbitrary 440 -word article from the newspaper Aftenposten from September this year, Full penhet om passunion (Full openness on <b>passport</b> <b>union),</b> and I quickly counted 47 compounds.

Reconstruction after the war gave Norway the highest economic growth in Europe until 1950, partially created through rationing private consumption allowing for higher industrial investments. The Labor Party retained power throughout the period and enforced a policy of public planning. The University of Bergen was created in 1946. The 1950s saw a boom in construction of hydroelectricity and the state built the steel mill Norsk Jernverk and two aluminum works. State banks such as the State Housing Bank, the State Educational Loan Fund and Postbanken allowed for governmental control over private debt. Oslo hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics.|$|E

Border checkpoints have been removed within the Schengen Area, in addition to those that had been abolished previously within the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union.</b> In the case of the Faroe Islands, which are not part of the Schengen Area but remain part of the Nordic Area, the strict Schengen rules apply to travellers from the Faroe Islands into the Schengen Area, including the Nordic countries, but the Nordic rules allowing for an open border apply to those going the other way from the Nordic countries, but not necessarily from the other Schengen countries. However, citizens of the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Passport</b> <b>Union</b> countries enjoy extra rights within the Nordic area, not available under Schengen, such as less paperwork if moving to a different Nordic country, and fewer requirements for naturalization or citizenship.
