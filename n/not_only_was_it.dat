5|$|Going {{into the}} 2003 World Cup, England {{were one of}} the tournament favourites. They reached the final on 22 November 2003 against host Australia and became world champions after a match-winning drop goal by star flyhalf Jonny Wilkinson deep into extra time that made the final score 20–17. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> their first Rugby World Cup victory, but it was the country's first World Cup since winning the 1966 FIFA (football) World Cup as hosts. On 8 December, the English team greeted 750,000 {{supporters}} on their victory parade through London before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> hard work, {{but the quality}} of the printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E

5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; {{all the more so}} when early observations showed that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E

25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E
25|$|Nicolae Ceaușescu {{had a major}} {{influence}} on modern-day Romanian populist rhetoric. In his final years, he had begun to rehabilitate the image of pro-Nazi dictator Ion Antonescu. Although Antonescu's image was never a fully official myth in Ceaușescu's time, today's politicians such as Corneliu Vadim Tudor have coupled the images of the two leaders into their versions of a national Pantheon. The conflict with Hungary over the treatment of the Magyar minority in Romania had several unusual aspects: <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> a vitriolic argument between two officially Socialist states, it also marked the moment when Hungary, a state behind the Iron Curtain, appealed to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe for sanctions to be taken against Romania. This meant that the later 1980s were marked by a pronounced anti-Hungarian discourse, which owed more to nationalist tradition than to Marxism, and the ultimate isolation of Romania on the world stage.|$|E

25|$|Campbell {{was born}} Colin Macliver, {{the eldest of}} the four {{children}} of John Macliver, a cabinetmaker in Glasgow, and Agnes Macliver (née Campbell). His mother {{and one of his}} twin sisters died while he was still a boy. His only brother was killed fighting in the Peninsular War. Having been educated at the High School of Glasgow his uncle, Major John Campbell, took over his care and sent him to the Royal Military and Naval Academy at Gosport. The most oft-quoted story explaining Campbell's name change is that upon Colin's entry into the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot as an ensign in 1808, his uncle presented him to the Duke of York, who assumed the boy's surname was Campbell and had him enlisted in the Army under that name. This story was first promulgated during the Crimean War. The press were fascinated to find why he had changed his name, and rumours abounded that he was in fact the illegitimate son of Major Campbell, so Peter Macliver, a journalist and Colin's cousin, invented the story about the Duke of York. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> highly unusual for an ensign to meet the commander-in-chief, the Duke of York, but Campbell was on the Isle of Wight, not in London when commissioned. Furthermore, General Robert Brownrigg, colonel of the regiment of the 9th Foot, wrote to the Duke of York prior to Campbell's commission, referring to the fifteen-year-old boy as 'Mr Colin Campbell'. Evidently, Campbell changed his name before being gazetted.|$|E
