50|$|A <b>no-contest</b> <b>clause,</b> {{also called}} an in terrorem clause, is a clause {{in a legal}} document, such as a {{contract}} or a will, {{that is designed to}} threaten someone, usually with litigation or criminal prosecution, into acting, refraining from action, or ceasing to act. The phrase is typically used to refer to a clause in a will that threatens to disinherit a beneficiary of the will if that beneficiary challenges the terms of the will in court. Many states in the United States hold a <b>no-contest</b> <b>clause</b> in a will to be unenforceable, so long as the person challenging the will has probable cause to do so.|$|E
5000|$|In California, <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses</b> are {{of limited}} effect, and will divest {{a party that}} unsuccessfully {{contests}} a will containing such a clause only if the Court determines that the party brought the action without probable cause. [...] Probate Code §§ 21310-21315. These statutes, which comprise California's statutory scheme governing the enforceability of <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses,</b> became effective January 1, 2010. As of that date, the predecessor statutes are repealed.|$|R

40|$|José Espejo (3 L) {{delivered}} the second Student Scholars Series lecture {{of the semester}} on February 22. Espejo’s scholarship, “The Enforceability of In Terrorem Clauses,” argued that <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses,</b> also known as “in terrorem” clauses, which forbids a beneficiary from challenging a will or trust, should be enforced. A summary of the event is available here...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{contractual}} clauses which limit {{the ability of}} licensees to challenge patents at {{the basis of their}} licensing agreements. In particular, we study <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses,</b> which prohibit licensees from contesting the validity of the patent, and challenge-penalty clauses, which penalize licensees for doing so. We develop a model that we use to compare three legal regimes: 2 ̆ 2 No Restriction, 2 ̆ 2 in which the patent holder is given complete contractual freedom, 2 ̆ 2 Partial Restriction, 2 ̆ 2 in which <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses</b> are forbidden but challenge penalties are allowed, and 2 ̆ 2 Total Restriction, 2 ̆ 2 in which neither no-contest nor challenge penalty clauses are enforced. We show that No Restriction is unlikely to be optimal, and further, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which Total Restriction is optimal. The rule we suggest differs significantly from the one currently applied by most courts...|$|R
50|$|Harman is on most {{issues a}} liberal, earning a 95% rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action. On {{intelligence}} and defense issues, she {{tends to be}} a moderate. For example, she was one of many Democrats who supported the Iraq War. Harman has combined a moderate stance on economic, trade, and foreign policy issues with a more liberal stance on social issues. For instance, while voting with Republicans to restrict rules on personal bankruptcy, for lawsuit reform, and to abolish the estate tax—as well as on protecting those defense contractors with business interests in her congressional district—Harman voted against the ban on partial-birth abortions, lawsuits against gun manufacturers, the Defense of Marriage Act, and banning indecent broadcasting. Harmon's California Senate Bill 1264, signed into law by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, effective January 1, 2010, rendered most <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses</b> unenforceable. The many loopholes in prior <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses</b> caused more court confusion and expense.|$|R
50|$|In terrorem clauses (referred to in English as <b>No-contest</b> <b>clauses)</b> {{are also}} used in wills to keep {{beneficiaries}} from contesting the will by either completely disinheriting them from any share, or reducing their share to a nominal amount. These clauses are not uniformly recognized. In some states, in terrorem clauses are disfavored, but can still be enforceable. In New York, for example, the Estates Powers & Trust Law codifies the use of, and the limits of, in terrorem clauses in EPTL 3-3.5(b).|$|R
5000|$|Nevada law {{specifically}} {{directs the}} court to enforce <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses.</b> [...] These statutes recognize that a beneficiary may, without penalty, seek enforcement of the will or trust, seek a judicial ruling as {{to the meaning of}} the will or trust. The statutes also recognize an exception where legal action challenging the validity of the document is [...] "instituted in good faith and based on probable cause that would have led a reasonable person, properly informed and advised, to conclude that there was a substantial likelihood that the trust or other trust-related instrument was invalid." ...|$|R
5000|$|A will {{may include}} an in terrorem clause, with {{language}} {{along the lines}} of [...] "any person who contests this will shall forfeit his legacy", which operates to disinherit any person who challenges the validity of the will. Such <b>no-contest</b> <b>clauses</b> are permitted under the Uniform Probate Code, which most American states follow at least in part. However, since the clause is within the will itself, a successful challenge to the will renders the clause meaningless. Many states consider such clauses void as a matter of public policy or valid only if a will is contested without probable cause.|$|R
