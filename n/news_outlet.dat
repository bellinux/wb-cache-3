5|$|In 1986 News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused {{controversy}} when {{he moved}} publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed {{it was impossible to}} produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street {{and the power of the}} print unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major <b>news</b> <b>outlet</b> to leave Fleet Street in 2005. The same year, The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} is the practice of quality news on internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets.</b> It aimed at answering the following questions: 1) What is high quality news in internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets?</b> What is the criterion? 2) What are the process of development and experience of internet as <b>news</b> <b>outlets?</b> Why do professional journalists of traditional media seek internet as <b>news</b> <b>outlets?</b> 3) How do journalists use ICTs {{to make the best of}} alternative <b>news</b> <b>outlets?</b> What are the operation models and their characteristics? This dissertation derived from the assumption that internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets</b> are effective journalistic practices to improve the quality of the news. To understand this proposition, various perspectives of definition and the way of measuring the quality of the news were adopted in this research. Practically, three internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets</b> were chosen as case studies in this research: The French website Rue 89, Belgium website Apache and Spanish website Eldiario. The empirical part of this study includes twenty in-depth interviews and observation in their newsrooms, and basic statistics of top news stories in the home page of six websites from the three countries. Therefore, both quantitative and qualitative methods have been used in this research. The contribution {{of this research}} is rethinking quality journalism in the digital age and introducing the journalistic experiences of professional journalists. First, this research provides an academic definition for the newly generated websites, and theorizes it as Internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets.</b> Next, this research analysed internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets</b> systematically, especially importing the European journalism website to the domain of online journalism studies. Moreover, the introduction of journalist’s statues in different countries is a valuable complement for journalism studies. Furthermore, the method of interview, observation and case study were applied in this research, which is a new examination of online journalism research. Finally, internet-native <b>news</b> <b>outlets</b> create a positive interaction between journalists and readers, which also enrich the news issues and news resource. It is quite important to rethink and discover the social problems. These academic explorations certainly confront many challenges because of majority of social and culture factors, but the results would be valuable for the reflection on knowledge construction in the international academy.
