Silverstein Properties, which has paid the Port Authority over $2.75 billion in financing, noted the organization’s inability to meet construction obligations in its official complaint. The development firm has proposed further government intervention in the project as a way of settling the dispute. On December 2, 2009, US$2.6 billion tax-free bond for the building's construction was approved by the state of New York to continue construction on the World Trade Center site.

The agency cited the recession and disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein as reasons for the proposed reduction.

50|$|After {{receiving}} <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> a <b>dispute,</b> {{the credit}} issuer must acknowledge the dispute within thirty days, investigate the claim and, within ninety days, either make appropriate corrections to the account or {{send a letter}} to the consumer explaining why the creditor believes there was no error.

To trigger duties under the Act, a person must send a written dispute via mail to the [...] "billing inquiries" [...] address on their credit card statement, not the address for sending payments. [...] This dispute must be received by the creditor within sixty days of the statement date on the account statement that first contained the billing error. [...] Notice given by telephone {{is not sufficient to}} trigger the protections of the FCBA; a consumer can only protect their rights under the Act by sending a written notice, or online if the creditor indicates to consumers that it will accept notices electronically. Banks may accept disputes by phone while warning their customers that phone complaints do not preserve the customer's rights under the Act. This often leads to a chargeback to the vendor.|$|R
40|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ) refused {{jurisdiction}} in Georgia’s suit against Russia under the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, {{finding that the}} treaty’s jurisdictional clause, which limits jurisdiction to unsettled disputes, did not apply {{in the absence of}} good-faith negotiation. The court reversed its provisional measures order, which entertained jurisdiction, and continued a line of cases holding that clauses like the treaty’s jurisdictional clause serve mainly to give the parties <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dispute.</b> The ICJ’s ruling noted that these clauses also reflect limits on parties’ consent to jurisdiction and a general preference for negotiated solutions. This suggests that the court will scrutinize attempted diplomacy more in the future to ensure good-faith conduct. Yet the court refused to overturn precedents permitting use of open forums such as the UN and finding negotiations where the specific treaty obligations are not identified, making good faith harder to ensure. The ICJ’s adherence to a more flexible standard thus still provides a way for complainants to satisfy jurisdictional thresholds without fully engaging respondents beforehand...|$|R
40|$|Public private {{partnership}} (PPP) is {{a strategy}} where governments encourage private institutions to financially support public construction projects, by providing proper incentives based on collaboration with private institutions. However, disputes may occur during a contract management. This paper investigates various public-private partnership (PPP) disputes and their critical influential factors for associating fundamental project information and dispute resolutions. In this study, knowledge is extracted from the association rules so that dispute handling patterns can be identified from historical database. Analytical {{results show that the}} rule sets achieve 83. 92 % confidence level.

40|$|The Australian federal {{government}} recently introduced into Parliament legislation mandating the plain packaging of all tobacco products.

Copyright registration and renewal requirements meant that records of copyright owners were centrally located and made available; this facilitated licensing arrangements, and contacting the holders.

40|$|While much {{attention}} has been given to reputation mechanisms to deter fraudulent behavior in online auctions, we know little about the nature <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> or the types of problems that users face. This is an exploratory analysis <b>of</b> 129 <b>disputes</b> for six different types of products that were sold on eBay. In the descriptive and multinomial analysis, we find eight different types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> including poor quality, slow shipping, seller withdrawal, failure to ship the product, fraud, poor communications, misunderstanding, and non-paying bidders. Of these the most common types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> were poor communications, non-paying bidders and item quality. In the most serious <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> fraud and no shipment where the seller is at fault the reputation ratings are much lower than the ratings for other disputes related to sellers. Similarly for buyers, the reputation ratings for the most serious <b>disputes</b> <b>of</b> non-paying bidders are considerably lower than those of other types <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> related to buyers. This implies that analysis of reputation ratings is of some value in reducing the probability <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b> <b>Of</b> the types of payments methods in eBay auctions personal checks show the greatest number <b>of</b> <b>disputes.</b> Auction sites may wish to discourage sellers from accepting this type of payment. ...|$|R

The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements.
