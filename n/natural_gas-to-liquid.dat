5000|$|Coal {{liquefaction}} or gas to liquids product are {{liquid hydrocarbons}} that are synthesised from {{the conversion of}} coal or natural gas by the Fischer-Tropsch process, Bergius process, or Karrick process. Currently, two companies SASOL and Shell, have synthetic oil technology proven {{to work on a}} commercial scale. Sasol's primary business is based on CTL (coal-to-liquid) and GTL (<b>natural</b> <b>gas-to-liquid)</b> technology, producing US$4.40 billion in revenues (FY2009). Shell has used these processes to recycle waste flare gas (usually burnt off at oil wells and refineries) into usable synthetic oil. However, for CTL there may be insufficient coal reserves to supply global needs for both liquid fuels and electric power generation.|$|E
40|$|The optimal {{design of}} a <b>natural</b> <b>gas-to-liquid</b> {{hydrocarbons}} (GTL) process with a multistage cobalt-based Fischer-Tropsch reactor and interstage product separation is considered. The objective function is to maximize the wax (C 21 +) production rate {{at the end of}} the reactor path. Sectioning of the Fischer-Tropsch reactor increases the chain growth probability inside the reactor which results in a higher production of wax. The carbon efficiency of the two-stage reactor is distinctly higher than that of the single-stage reactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to assess the}} effect of {{applying}} new technology to the economics of a proposed <b>natural</b> <b>gas-to-liquids</b> (GTL) plant, to evaluate the potential of a slower-paced, staged deployment of GTL technology, and to evaluate the effect of GTL placement of economics. Five scenarios were economically evaluated and compared: a no-major-gas-sales scenario, a gas-pipeline/LNG scenario, a fast-paced GTL development scenario, a slow-paced GTL development scenario, and a scenario which places the GTL plant in lower Alaska, instead of on the North Slope. Evaluations were completed using an after-tax discounted cash flow analysis. Results indicate that the slow-paced GTL scenario is the only one with a rate of return greater than 10 %. The slow-paced GTL development would allow cost saving on subsequent expansions. These assumed savings, along with the lowering of the transportation tariff, combine to distinguish this option for marketing the North Slope gas from the other scenarios. Critical variables that need further consideration include the GTL plant cost, the GTL product premium, and operating and maintenance costs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates Shell’s {{exploration}} of alternative fuels. Purposes are a theoretically instructed analysis of Shell’s activities {{as well as}} the empirically based introduction of an understanding of path management. Starting point is the hypothesis that actors are able to partly manage technological paths. Path management is developed on the basis of Giddens’ (1997) recursive duality in between structure and agency and on the concept of ‘social mechanisms’ (i. a. Mayntz 2005) as well as by using the classical path dependence and its adaptations in institutional theory as well as strategic management and innovation studies. Consequently, path management is considered as a recursive, mechanism driven duality in which positive feedback loops repeatedly result from the interplay in between the incentives build into the structures and the benefit-orientation of the actors. Thereby the social mechanism ‘positive feedback’ comprises four parts: The path structure, the structural incentives, benefit-oriented actions and the caused positive feedback. Actors manage the path by their decision to follow the structural incentives or to rededicate or create them. Further deliberating aspects are other mechanisms such as mechanisms of change and exploration. On this basis Shell’s activities {{for the development of the}} synthetic diesel fuel from <b>natural</b> gas (<b>Gas-to-Liquids,</b> GtL) and biomass (Biomass-to-Liquids, BtL) as well as cellulosic ethanol and hydrogen are analysed. A first result of the analysis is that Shell is following a strategy of integration which aims at using the positive feedback of the fossil fuel path in favour of the alternatives. Secondly, in the areas where the alternatives can not be integrated technologically, Shell uses compensating strategies. For example in the case of hydrogen Shell pursues an island-strategy which has to solve the ‘hen-or-egg’-problem in between the lacking supply-infrastructure and hydrogen powered car fleet. Thirdly, Shell simultaneously uses the alternatives in order to lessen the pressure for change on the fossil fuel path. This holds especially true for BtL which corresponds to the dieselization of the German car fleet and which as a renewable blend into the fossil fuel meets the critique of the fossil fuel path. Additionally, Shells activities in favour of BtL are closely connected with a de-legitimation of current market-alternatives such as bio-diesel and bio-ethanol. Fourthly and finally, Shell avoids potential conflicts in between the fossil fuel path and the alternatives by a chronological as well as an organisational separation: For example Shell regards hydrogen from renewable sources only as a long-term aspiration. And aspects of the alternatives alien to the core business are de-coupled internally by autonomous development sections and through an outsourcing of the innovation. Taken together, Shell’s exploration activities follow the maxim ‚Integration of the alternatives and stabilisation of the fossil fuel path as far as possible and re-shaping of the exploration structures and de-coupling of the development when necessary‘. Thus, Shell uses the alternative fuels for the extension of the fossil fuel path. All in all Shell‘s {{exploration of}} alternative fuels proves to be a rich empirical case of path management by actively using and shaping the mechanisms of positive feedback, change, and exploration...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{jet fuels}} {{obtained}} from sources other than crude oil {{is a modern}} area of research that is developing continuously to replace available petroleum-based fuels with ?drop-in? alternative fuels. Therefore, reliable composition-property relations are developed to correlate the hydrocarbon compositions of formulated synthetic fuels with their properties to be certified for aviation commercial use. Intensive studies have been initiated at Texas A&M University Qatar in collaboration with industry and academia to study synthetic jet fuels derived from natural gas. These studies are being implemented at its Fuel Characterization Lab where the most advanced testing equipment is used and strict Quality Management and safety systems are followed. This study {{is divided into two}} tracks. The first track is focused on conducting experimental investigations using in-house formulated synthetic jet fuels derived from <b>natural</b> gas via <b>Gas-to-Liquid</b> technology and Fischer-Tropsch chemistry. Throughout this research work, these fuels will be referred to as Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK). These experimental investigations activities are composed of three phases: the first phase focuses on the influence of SPK building blocks (paraffinic hydrocarbons) on fuels? properties, the second phase concerns evaluating the role of aromatics and cyclo-paraffins on properties, and the third phase studies the influence of mixing SPK with conventional Jet A- 1 derived from crude oil. All of the aforementioned experimental investigations are aimed at building an experimental data bank to assist the efforts of the formulation of new generations of SPKs that meet aviation industry standards. On the other hand, the second track is directed towards the development of mathematical correlations for four properties of high importance to SPK certification. These correlations aim at optimizing fuel composition whereby major physical/chemical properties of ASTM D 1655 are met at the lowest cost of composed fuel. The primary findings of this study showed that GTL derived SPK paraffinic constituents can improve certain properties while affecting others negatively, and emphasizing the necessity of aromatics in improving specific properties. Further studies compensating the absence of aromatics and sulfur through blended Jet A- 1 revealed a practical solution through jet fuels optimization based on cost and technical effective manners...|$|R
