40|$|Firms which {{generate}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> as {{a by-product}} of their manufacturing process (2 ̆ 2 generators 2 ̆ 2) need {{to decide how to}} dispose of their scrap; their options include selling to steel mills, foundries or <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> processing companies (2 ̆ 2 processors 2 ̆ 2). The primary focus of this thesis is an examination of the alternative strategies available to generators.;An analytical framework was tested at twelve sites, with data collection and analysis guided by three research questions and eleven propositions. A range of variables was identified as influencing <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal strategies which were classified as either drivers, moderators or outcomes; trade-offs among these variables defined the disposal strategies for each of the sites.;The volume driver highlighted the trade-offs in <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposition; three volume groups were observed, each having a distinctly different set of <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal options. Specifically, volume was found to influence the duration of generator-processor contracts, logistics, the frequency with which generators switched processors, the recovery value received and the level of resources employed in the disposition process.;Although striking differences exist between the three volume groups, the boundaries are indistinct. Characteristics of plants located on the margins demonstrate certain elements of the adjacent group. Contrasts between the volume groups are, therefore, most conspicuous when comparing plants at the midpoints of the three categories.;Cost recovery was found to be the dominant outcome variable. Most of the plants in this study, typically, did not effectively manage the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal process, although opportunities exist within each of the volume groups to provide competitive advantages to the firm through effective disposal strategies. Opportunities to develop capabilities in order to pursue additional outcomes, such as cost reduction, were noticeably absent in the medium and low volume groups.;The <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal network represents an efficient residual management system, applications from which can be applied to other by-products.

The {{analysis of the}} current state of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> market in the Russian Federation, trends of its development, led the authors to an opportunity to reduce the cost for purchasing scrap trough the optimal distribution of the regions between Russian iron-and-steel companies where they purchase <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap.</b> The optimization of the regional structure of the scrap procurement taking into account the regional volumes of its generation and consumption results from using the linear programming methods applying three variants of the problem statement: minimizing the total cost of the scrap delivery to the factory, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the “export parity” price with delivery, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the actual prices with delivery. The authors have developed software for performing the calculations. The source are the database of the JSC Russian Railways, which provides information about the transportation of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> between stations of the Russian Federation by railroad; railway rates guide between railway stations of the Russian Federation; statistical data on the prices for scrap metal of the type 3 A in “export windows”; actual purchasing prices for the scrap of the 3 A type for the range of separate companies of the Russian Federation for several years. As a result, the authors have obtained the optimal regional structure of scrap purchasing for customers in the Russian Federation. We have formulated the recommendations for individual companies regarding the optimal routes of the procurement with scrap. The study has confirmed the possibility to decrease expanses for purchasing the scrap metal for all iron-and-steel factories of the Russian Federation through the optimization of the regional structure of procurement.

The used metallic powders generally showed a satisfactory behavior in the fabrication steps leading to the successful development of particle reinforced MMCs containing no phases other than the constituent and exhibiting a sintering degree varying with the ceramic content.
