5|$|Stojadinović sought {{authority}} from Prince Paul {{to form a}} new cabinet, however Korošec as head of the Senate advised the prince {{to form a new}} government around Cvetković. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinović and appointed Cvetković in his place, with a direction that he reach an agreement with Maček. While these negotiations were ongoing, Italy invaded Albania. In August 1939, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was concluded to create the Banovina of Croatia, which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough,</b> and many Serbs believed it went too far in giving power to Croats. The Cvetković-led cabinet formed {{in the wake of the}} Agreement was resolutely anti-Axis, and included five members of the HSS, with Maček as deputy Prime Minister. General Milan Nedić was Minister of the Army and Navy. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid-1940 of the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Stanoje Mihaldžić, who had been organising covert anti-Axis activities. In October 1940, Simović was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non-committal. From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador Ronald Campbell apparently still believed possible.|$|E

25|$|In June, a {{referendum}} {{was held on}} changes to the constitution, which became law on 13 September. Some protesters felt that the reforms did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> On 18 September, 3,000 people demonstrated in Casablanca and 2,000 in Tangier, demanding {{an end to the}} king's roles as head of the army and of religious affairs. In October, around 50 imams protested in Rabat against state control of their activities.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the main}} legal {{opposition}} parties, including the leftist Tagammu Party and the Nasserist Party, boycotted the election, saying it was unlikely to be free or fair.

25|$|The horrified {{reaction}} of the Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to this speech and the electoral success of Sinn Féin following the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike shocked the Thatcher Government and they were receptive to FitzGerald's lobbying {{on behalf of the}} SDLP which eventually led in 1985 to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which was opposed by both unionists and republicans. Republicans were concerned that the agreement did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> Unionists staged a demonstration of some 200,000 people in Belfast city centre.|$|E
25|$|Konstantin {{sympathized with}} the Poles and, {{ignoring}} {{the advice of}} his brother's generals, he ended martial law and embarked on a program of liberalization. Polish was reinstated as the official language, universities were opened and Konstantin appointed Poles to administrative positions, gathering a distinguished court of Poles and Russians around him. Konstantin did all he could to appease the Poles, but his well-meant reforms did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> for the Polish nationalists who wanted nothing short of independence, by force if necessary.|$|E
25|$|While the {{response}} to these moves was generally positive possibly because ecological protection and energy and infrastructure transformation are more politically neutral than pressures to change social policy. Some experts voiced concern that the IMF was not representative, and that the IMF proposals to generate only US$200billion a year by 2020 with the SDRs as seed funds, did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> to undo the general incentive to pursue destructive projects inherent in the world commodity trading and banking systems—criticisms often levelled at the World Trade Organization and large global banking institutions.|$|E

50|$|However, {{there is}} some {{uncertainty}} as to what exactly 'more than merely preparatory' means. It is upon {{the discretion of the}} judges and the jury to decide.

50|$|Accusations of {{corruption}} and abuse of his office were levelled against Hovyne in 1664.

25|$|Gibson {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} Errol Flynn, Clark Gable, and Marlon Brando by starring as Fletcher Christian in a cinematic retelling of the Mutiny on the Bounty. The resulting 1984 film The Bounty {{is considered to be}} the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's antagonist. He has further praised Anthony Hopkins's performance as Lieutenant William Bligh as the best aspect of the film.|$|E
25|$|Although the resource-based view of {{the firm}} recognizes the {{important}} role of knowledge in firms that achieve a competitive advantage, proponents of the knowledge-based view argue that the resource-based perspective does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> Specifically, the RBV treats knowledge as a generic resource, rather than having special characteristics. It therefore does not distinguish between different types of knowledge-based capabilities. Information technologies can {{play an important role in}} the knowledge-based {{view of the}} firm in that information systems can be used to synthesize, enhance, and expedite large-scale intra- and inter-firm knowledge management (Alavi and Leidner 2001).|$|E
25|$|The new law {{returned}} {{legal ownership}} {{to the state}} of all hydrocarbons and natural resources, maintained royalties at 18 percent, but increased taxes from 16 to 32 percent. It gave the government control of the commercialization of the resources and allowed for continuous government control with annual audits. It also ordered companies to consult with indigenous groups who live on land containing gas deposits. The law stated that the 76 contracts signed by foreign firms must be renegotiated before 180 days. This has not yet been done. Protesters argued that the new law did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> to protect the natural resources from exploitation by foreign corporations, demanding a complete nationalization of the gas and process in Bolivia.|$|E

But the author traces the history of corporate governance to show that such models change over time. And they are different in other nations, such as Japan.

25|$|The federal {{government}} counteracted {{with its own}} advertising campaign which claimed that New South Wales had breached its contractual obligations under the 1999 GST Agreement by continuing to charge unfair stamp duties and land taxes, which {{were supposed to have}} been abolished. After weeks of intense media and public pressure, the New South Wales State Government announced in its budget that it would reduce stamp duty and land tax, but critics argued that the State Government did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> with much broader tax reform in New South Wales required to help encourage investment and business that had been forced elsewhere due to an unfavourable New South Wales business environment. This was in response to the Commonwealth allowing another A$72 million in grants to New South Wales, in addition to existing annual increases.|$|E
25|$|Bennett's conversion, however, {{was seen}} as too little too late, and he faced {{criticism}} that his reforms either went too far, or did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough,</b> including {{from one of his}} cabinet ministers H. H. Stevens, who bolted the government to form the Reconstruction Party of Canada. Some of the measures were alleged to have encroached on provincial jurisdictions laid out in section 92 of the British North America Act. The courts, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, agreed and eventually struck down virtually all of Bennett's reforms. However, some of Bennett's initiatives, such as the Bank of Canada, which he founded in 1934, remain in place to this day, and the Canadian Wheat Board remained in place until 2011 when the government of Stephen Harper abolished it.|$|E
25|$|Far from slavishly championing Velikovsky's chronology, these {{scholars}} believe that Velikovsky did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> Under {{the influence of}} Gunnar Heinsohn they have shortened Velikovsky's timeline of ancient history even more. The 12th Dynasty of ancient Egypt has been moved almost 1500 years closer to the present, ending with Alexander the Great's invasion in -331. The Exodus has been redated to the 8th century, and the 18th Dynasty has been moved to the 8th-7th centuries. 274 years {{have been removed from}} the history of the Israelites. The Hittite Empire, which Velikovsky identified with the Neo-Babylonian Empire, has been identified with the Lydian Kingdom, while the Neo-Babylonians are now regarded as vassal kings of Babylon under the Macedonian Seleucids. The Neo-Assyrian Empire is now equated with the Persian Empire in northern Assyria and has been redated accordingly. In truth, very little of Velikovsky's chronology has been left untouched.|$|E
40|$|MairiAnne McKenzie (this issue) {{worries that}} {{multiculturalism}} {{may be going}} too far but Alastair Davidson believes that it has <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> He argues that multiculturalism has been confined to questions of lifestyle and welfare {{and that it has}} left Australian political and constitutional arrangements untouched.

40|$|In {{this article}} I give a mixed review Allen and Leiter’s {{naturalized}} epistemology theory of evidence.

On the whole, I conclude that the antipathy toward algrithms expressed by Allen and Leiter is misplaced...|$|R
50|$|McDougall {{produced}} another work attacking materialism titled Materialism and Emergent Evolution (1929). In {{the book}} he had also criticised the theory of emergent evolution as he claimed it had ignored the evidence of Lamarckism and had ignored the evidence of mind guiding evolution. McDougall's last work on the subject titled The Riddle of Life (1938) criticised organicism as according to McDougall even though the theory of organicism had rejected materialism it had <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> in advocating an active role for a nonphysical principle.|$|R
25|$|Irish {{universities}} {{have a long}} tradition of electing independent candidates. Some, like the pressure group Graduate Equality, argue that the franchise for electing university senators should be extended to the graduates of all third level institutions. Others believe that this does <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> and that at least some portion of the Seanad should be directly elected by all adult citizens. Calls have also been made for the Seanad to be used to represent Irish emigrants or the people of Northern Ireland. In 1999 the Reform Movement called for some of the Taoiseach's nominations to be reserved for members of the Irish-British minority, and other minorities such as members of the Travelling Community and recently arrived immigrants. The Seventh Amendment in 1979 altered the provisions of Article 18.4 to allow for a redistribution of the university seats to any other institutes of higher education in the state, although no change has in fact taken place since then.|$|E
500|$|Different {{theories}} {{have been offered}} {{as to why the}} magazine failed. [...] Editor and science fiction historian Malcolm Edwards suggests that Merritt's death six years earlier, in 1943, made the magazine a risky proposition, despite Merritt's continuing popularity in the late 1940s. [...] Science fiction historian and critic Sam Moskowitz suggests that, conversely, the magazine did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> in depending on Merritt's popularity, as it only printed three works of his during its run. [...] This may have been because Merritt was sufficiently popular that it was not easy for the magazine to obtain reprint rights to his stories.|$|E

William attracted criticism from reformers, who felt that reform did <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough,</b> and from reactionaries, who felt that reform went too far. A modern interpretation sees him as failing to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find compromise between two bitterly opposed factions, {{but in the process}} proving himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed.|$|E
5000|$|Many more {{conservative}} and centrist National supporters preferred Muldoon's more authoritarian and interventionist policies over the free-market liberalism promoted by Douglas. However, the new National Party Finance Minister, Ruth Richardson, strongly supported Rogernomics, believing that Douglas had <b>not</b> <b>gone</b> <b>far</b> <b>enough.</b> Her policies—dubbed [...] "Ruthanasia"— encouraged two MPs {{to leave the}} National Party and form the New Zealand Liberal Party (1992).
