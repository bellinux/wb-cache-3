The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon than had been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, in {{the realm}} of group theory, a power {{automorphism}} of a group is an automorphism that takes each subgroup of the group to within itself. It is worth noting that the power automorphism of an infinite group may <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> an automorphism on each subgroup. For instance, the automorphism on rational numbers that sends each number to its double is a power automorphism even though it does <b>not</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>to</b> an automorphism on each subgroup.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the above theoretical applications, many practical applications of groups exist. Cryptography relies on {{the combination of the}} abstract group theory approach together with algorithmical knowledge obtained in computational group theory, in particular when implemented for finite groups. Applications of group theory are <b>not</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> mathematics; sciences such as physics, chemistry and computer science benefit from the concept.|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are <b>not</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, which occurs in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E

5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was <b>not</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the WaitematƒÅ Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} {{one of their}} most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were <b>not</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E

It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.|$|E
