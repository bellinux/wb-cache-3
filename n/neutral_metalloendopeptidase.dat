40|$|Hormonal, renal {{and blood}} {{pressure}} effects of SCH 39370, a selective inhibitor of <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase</b> (endopepti-dase 24. 1 1, NEP), were studied in a chronic, congestive heart failure (CHF) model produced by coronary artery ligation in the rat. Sham-operated control rats and rats with CHF were treated either with vehicle or SCH 39370, 30 mg/kg s. c. bid. for 2. 5 days. Plasma levels of atrial natnuretic peptide (ANP) and unnary excretion of cyclic GMP (cGMP) were clearly raised in rats with CHF as compared with controls during vehicle treatment. SCH 39370 caused a further increase in plasma ANP in CHF rats but not in control rats. Urinary excretion of immunoreactive ANP and cGMP increased during SCH 39370 treatment both in CHF rats and in controls. SCH 39370 treatment resulted in an initial increase in urine volume in rats with CHF whereas urine sodiu...|$|E

During the purification of endopeptidase 24. 16 the neurotensin(1 - 10) and neurotensin(11 - 13) formation due to this enzyme was coeluted with Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp-hydrolysing activity. By both fluorimetric and h. p. l. c. analyses, we observed that the latter activity was dose-dependently and completely abolished by neurotensin with an IC 50 value (2. 6 microM) that closely corresponds to the affinity of purified endopeptidase 24. 16 for neurotensin (Km = 2. 5 microM). Furthermore, Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp hydrolysis was inhibited {{by a series of}} dipeptides with a rank of order of potencies that parallels that observed in competition experiments of tritiated neurotensin hydrolysis by brain and intestinal endopeptidase 24. 16. Altogether, these data clearly demonstrate that, in addition to Pz-peptidase, Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp also behaves as a substrate of endopeptidase 24. 16, with a Km of about 26 microM. In addition, we show that, even in crude membrane preparations, Mcc-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro-D-Lys-Dnp behaves as a useful tool to monitor and accurately quantify endopeptidase 24. 16...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{metabolism}} {{is regulated}} {{by a wide}} variety of both circulating and locally produced peptides. The activity of such agents must be regulated, and one potential regulating mechanism is the inactivation of these peptides by locally produced proteolytic enzymes. One candidate for such a class of enzymes is enkephalinase (EC 2. 3. 24. 11), a membrane-bound <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase</b> that inhibits the activity of a range of biologically active peptides, including interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), a potent bone-resorbing agent. In this study, we examined the effects of human enkephalinase on bone resorption in cultures of fetal rat long bones. We found that partially purified and highly purified enkephalinase inhibited bone resorption stimulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and IL 1 α. The effects on PTH-stimulated resorption were reversible, but enkephalinase did not inhibit prestimulated resorption. Enkephalinase also inhibited resorption induced by the nonpeptide stimulators 1, 25 -(OH) 2 D 3, retinoic acid, and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). In addition, preliminary studies confirmed a previous report of the presence of an enkephalinase-like activity in osteoblast-like osteosarcoma cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that proteolytic enzymes, such as enkephalinase, {{may play a role in}} the local regulation of bone resorption.

40|$|ANP-R 1 receptors for {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) {{showed the}} {{following}} rank order of affinity in intact human neuroblastoma cells NB-OK- 1 : human ANP-(99 - 126) ≈ human ANP-(102 - 126) ≈ rat ANP-(99 - 126) (K 1 17 - 32 pM) > human ANP-(103 - 126) > porcine brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Analogues truncated at the C-terminal extremity or devoid of a disulphide bridge, such as rat ANP-(103 - 123), rat C-ANP-(102 - 121), rat ANP-(111 - 126), rat ANP-(99 - 109) and rat [desCys 105,Cys 121]ANP-(104 - 126) and chicken C-type natriuretic peptide, were not recognized. The occupancy of these high affinity ANP-R 1 receptors led to marked cyclic GMP accumulation {{in the presence of}} 3 -isobutyl 1 - methylxanthine. An ectoenzymic activity, partiy shed in the incubation medium, provoked the stepwise release of Phe-Arg-[125 I]Tyr, Arg-[125 I]Tyr and [125 I]Tyr from rat [125 I]ANPW-(99 - 126), at an optimal pH of 7. 0. Its inhibition by 1, 10 -phenanthroline, EDTA and bacitracin but not by thiorphan suggests the contribution of at least one <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase,</b> distinct from EC 3. 4. 24. 11, for which ANP showed high affinity. © 1992.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{is designed to}} evaluate a number of biological markers to estimate harmful exposure on coal miners from different mining regions in France and to relate the outcome to differences in prevalence of coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP) between these regions. Eight epidemiological groups of active and ex-miners (smokers and non-smokers) have been selected in the French collieries (North, Lorraine and Provence) according to their occupational and pneumoconiotic status. The following biomarkers have been evaluated: cellularity of sputum, elementary analysis of particles in TEM/EDAX, plasma <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase</b> elastase type (NMEP), leucocyte elastase (HLE), fibronectin (FN) and elastin peptides. Pulmonary alveolitis, expressed by sputum cellularity, is different between active workers groups but {{not related to the}} general background of pneumoconiosis prevalence in the French collieries. In the plasma parameters, fibronectin, HLE and NMEP significantly increased in all groups of coal mine workers as compared to the control group, except for fibronectin parameter in Lorraine collierie. The degree of increase of these parameters allow us to discriminate the different groups and suggest that plasma FN, HLE and NMEP may be considered as biological markers of chronic inhalation of coal mine dust particles. The decrease of elastin peptides level in the Lorraine group alone suggests a specific alteration of elastin metabolism. These parameters were not related to the development of pneumoconiosis and its degree of severity...|$|E

This derivative, called thermolysin S, was isolated by gel filtration in approximately 80 % yield and then separated from some residual intact thermolysin by an affinity chromatographic step on Sepharose-Gly-D-Phe. It was found that thermolysin S results from a tight association of two polypeptide fragments of apparent Mr of 24000 and 10000. Dissociation of the complex was achieved under strong denaturing conditions, such as gel filtration on a column equilibrated and eluted with 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. The positions of the clip sites were defined by amino acid analysis, end-group determination, and amino acid sequencing of the isolated fragments and shown to lie between Thr- 4 and Ser- 5, between Thr- 224 and Gln- 225, and also between Gln- 225 and Asp- 226. Thermolysin S, which is therefore a stable complex of fragments 5 - 224 (225) and 225 (226) - 316, shows a shift in optimum pH of about 1 unit toward the acid range with respect to intact thermolysin and a Km essentially unchanged, with furylacryloyl-Gly-Leu-NH 2 as substrate. Inhibitors of thermolysin such as ethoxyformic anhydride and Zn 2 + ions inactivate also the nicked enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of the <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase</b> thermolysin at pH 7. 2 in the {{presence}} of EDTA and/or low concentrations of calcium ions produces fast enzyme inactivation as a result of autolysis. The 'nicked' protein is a folded species composed of three tightly associated protein fragments. Dissociation of this complex can be achieved under denaturing conditions, such as gel filtration on a column equilibrated with 5 M guanidine hydrochloride or reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at acidic pH. The positions of the peptide bond cleavages were defined by isolation of the individual fragments by HPLC and their characterization by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis, end-group determination and partial amino acid sequencing. The results of these analyses indicated that the nicked protein is composed of fragments 1 - 196, 197 - 204 and 205 - 316 and thus that the corresponding sites of limited proteolysis occur at the polypeptide chain loop involved in the binding of Ca(4) in native thermolysin [Matthews, B. W., Weaver, L. H. and Kester, W. R. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 8030 - 8044]. The overall conformational properties of nicked thermolysin are quite {{similar to those of the}} intact protein, as judged by spectroscopic measurements and by the fact that rabbit antibodies against native thermolysin recognize and precipitate the nicked protein in immunodiffusion assays. The nicked protein was much less stable to heat and unfolding agents than intact thermolysin. These results contribute to a better knowledge of the molecular mechanism of stabilization of native thermolysin by the four bound calcium ions and demonstrate that the function of Ca(4) is to stabilize the loop 190 - 205 on the surface of the molecule against autolysis...|$|E
30|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} {{is characterized by}} clear cells containing glycogen arranged in tubular, papillary, and solid patterns, which commonly occurs in the ovary and kidney [1, 2]. On the other hand, clear cell cholangiocarcinoma was rarely reported [5]. Differential diagnosis which {{the origin of the}} tumor is intrahepatic or extrahepatic was difficult in this case. Microscopic findings revealed membrane of cyst was separated from the liver and the diaphragm. In this case, there was no malignant tumor in the ovary or kidney and {{there was no evidence of}} endometriosis at the peritoneum. Fujiki et al. reported a case of diaphragmatic clear {{cell carcinoma}} in a patient with a medical history of ovarian endometriosis [8]. The clear cells and hobnail cells were observed in the diaphragmatic tumor. The hobnail cells were not in this case, but the immunohistochemical stain such as PAX 8 and HNF 1 β. Pax 8 is a crucial transcription factor for organogenesis of the thyroid gland, kidney, and müllerian system and is highly found in highly ovarian and renal clear cell carcinomas [9]. HNF 1 β is also a transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis and anti-apoptosis, and recent immunohistochemical studies have shown that it is frequently and highly expressed by ovarian clear cell carcinoma [10]. The great majority of ovarian clear cell carcinomas reported as a HNF- 1 β-positive and ER-negative immunoprofile [11]. CK 7 was the subtype of cytokeratin, and CD 10 was a cell surface enzyme with <b>neutral</b> <b>metalloendopeptidase</b> activity. These were used for the differential diagnosis of renal clear cell carcinoma [12]. In renal clear cell carcinoma, CK 7 is negative and CD 10 is positive. In ovarian clear cell carcinoma, CK is positive and CD 10 is negative, which is similar to this case.|$|E
