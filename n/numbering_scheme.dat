5|$|Galileo steadfastly {{refused to}} use Marius' names and invented {{as a result}} the <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme</b> that is still used nowadays, in {{parallel}} with proper moon names. The numbers run from Jupiter outward, thus I, II, III and IV for Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto respectively. Galileo used this system in his notebooks but never actually published it. The numbered names (Jupiter x) were used until the mid-20th century when other inner moons were discovered, and Marius' names became widely used.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{labeling}} XML nodes {{are the key}} {{design element}} to support generic XML storage and high-efficiency access in relational databases or other reliable stores. In this paper we present a class of hierarchical <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> that combine two prior published schemes [2, 13] by authors of this paper. No schema {{is required for the}} data, and streaming access is supported. Our schemes support fast query processing and fast retrieval of document fragments while supporting insertion of new nodes, or sub-trees, at arbitrary positions within a document, without the need to relabel any old nodes. These insertion capabilities are not supported in other <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes</b> that have appeared in the literature. We also present a detailed quantitative analysis to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the new <b>numbering</b> <b>schemes.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|An eastâ€“west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal {{for what would}} become the Interstate Highway System. As originally proposed by the Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme</b> the next year, before the first Interstates were signed in the state in 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme.</b> The highway originally carried the National Route 23 route marker. Although after {{the construction of the}} Eastern Parkway extension, the highway north of Canberra Avenue was signed with the Alternate National Route 23 route marker. The section of the Monaro Highway between Steeple Flat and Cooma was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length; this arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the Snowy Mountains Highway from end to end, as the Monaro Highway forms a link between that highway's two sections.|$|E

The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building. The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme.</b> Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, {{the section of the}} Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway from end to end. The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} moons to be {{discovered}} were Titania and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel thought he had discovered up to six moons (see below) and perhaps even a ring. For nearly 50years, Herschel's instrument {{was the only one}} with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favorable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman <b>numbering</b> <b>scheme</b> of Uranus's moons {{was in a state of}} flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel's son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.|$|E

40|$|At NNLO it is {{particularly}} {{important to have a}} Variable-Flavour <b>Number</b> <b>Scheme</b> (VFNS) to deal with heavy quarks because there are major problems with both the zero mass variable-flavour <b>number</b> <b>scheme</b> and the fixed-flavour <b>number</b> <b>scheme.</b> I illustrate these problems and present a general formulation of a Variable-Flavour <b>Number</b> <b>Scheme</b> (VFNS) for heavy quarks that is explicitly implemented up to NNLO in the strong coupling constant alpha_S, and may be used in NNLO global fits for parton distributions. The procedure combines elements of the ACOT(chi) scheme and the Thorne-Roberts scheme. Despite the fact that at NNLO the parton distributions are discontinuous as one changes the number of active quark flavours, all physical quantities are continuous at flavour transitions and the comparison with data is successful.

40|$|A {{comparison}} is made between two variable flavor <b>number</b> <b>schemes</b> which describe charm quark production in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering. In these schemes the coefficient functions {{are derived from}} mass factorization of the heavy quark coefficient functions presented in a fixed flavor <b>number</b> <b>scheme.</b> Since the coefficient functions in the variable flavor <b>number</b> <b>schemes</b> have to be finite in the limit m -> 0 we have defined a prescription for those processes where the virtual photon {{is attached to a}} light quark. Furthermore one has to construct a parton density set with four active flavors (u,d,s,c) out of a set which only contains three light flavors (u,d,s). In order factorization of the heavy quark coefficient functions. The charm component of the structure function F_{ 2,c} is insensitive to the different variable flavor <b>number</b> <b>schemes.</b> In particular in the threshold region they both agree with the description in fixed order perturbation theory presented in a three flavor scheme. However one version does not lead to a correct description of the threshold behavior of the longitudinal structure function F_{L,c}.
