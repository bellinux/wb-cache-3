40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the connection between <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation rates and their theoretically substantiated regional determinants, using regression modelling. The dynamics of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation is evaluated comparing the influence of regional determinants in two time periods - 2001 - 2002 and 2011 - 2012. The Czech Republic is the area of interest. Empirical results indicate the coexistence of persistent and changing influences of regional determinants on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The quality of the entrepreneurial environment, industrial diversity and population change have a persistent and positive impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. There is also a positive connection between agglomeration economies and <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation. The increasing influence of agglomeration economies is indicated. The presence of foreigners is not a statistically significant determinant of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation in the 2001 - 2002 models. Nevertheless, the importance of this determinant is increasing. It is suggested that unemployment vulnerability has a negative impact on <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation but has increasing importance on entrepreneurship in disadvantaged regions. Finally, spatial interactions are an inevitable part when considering the determinants of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation...|$|R

5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can be legally served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> and increase property tax revenue.|$|E

5|$|Dayton's {{economy is}} {{relatively}} diversified and {{vital to the}} overall economy {{of the state of}} Ohio. In 2008 and 2009, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development. Dayton is also among the top 100 metropolitan areas in both exports and export-related jobs, ranked 16 and 14 respectively by the Brookings Institution. The 2010 report placed the value of exports at $4.7billion and the number of export-related jobs at 44,133. The Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks 4th in Ohio's Gross Domestic Product with a 2008 industry total of $33.78billion.

5|$|During the war, the city's {{population}} {{increased with}} the arrival of <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> and industries that offered additional employment opportunities, spurred real estate development, and ushered {{in the beginning of the}} city's urban, industrial development. In addition, street crime was prevalent, causing the city government to increase its police force and local merchants to hire private security. The era was also a time of bitter political disputes between Indiana's Democrats and Republicans. In May 1863, in an incident sarcastically called the Battle of Pogue's Run, Union soldiers stopped and searched two departing trainloads of delegates to a statewide Democratic convention, many of whom tossed their personal weapons into a nearby creek. In July 1863 Indianapolis residents feared an attack from Confederate forces during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but the Confederates turned east toward Ohio and never came to the city.|$|E
5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was {{the driving force behind}} the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} tensions {{arise in}} the 19th century, with {{the outbreak of the}} First Serbian Uprising in present-day central Serbia. The Turks construct a blockhouse on the bridge, decorating it with stakes on which they pin the heads of suspected rebels. One evening, the blockhouse burns down. In the ensuing decades, as the Ottoman Empire continues to decline, Bosnia is ravaged by plague. After the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia and Montenegro become fully independent countries. Austria-Hungary receives a right to occupy Bosnia-Herzegovina and turns it into a protectorate. The occupation comes as a shock to the residents of the town, which has remained largely unchanged since the time of the bridge's completion, and the local people experience difficulties accepting the numerous changes and reforms that accompany Austro-Hungarian rule. A barrack is built {{at the site of the}} caravanserai and the town experiences a substantial influx of foreigners. People from all parts of Austria-Hungary arrive, opening <b>new</b> <b>businesses</b> and bringing the customs of their native regions with them. A narrow gauge railway line is built to Sarajevo and the bridge loses much of its strategic importance. Local children begin to be educated in Sarajevo, and some go on to continue their studies in Vienna. They bring home new social and cultural ideas from abroad, among them the concepts of trade unions and socialism, while newly established newspapers acquaint the town's inhabitants with nationalism. Tensions flare following the assassination of Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1898. In 1908, Austria-Hungary formally annexes Bosnia-Herzegovina, sparking tensions with Serbia, which the Austro-Hungarians come to regard as a serious obstacle to their further conquest of the eastern Balkans. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13 see the Ottomans almost completely forced from the region, and relations between Austria-Hungary and Serbia deteriorate further. The significance of the middle portion of the bridge also becomes undermined, as residents of different ethnicities become suspicious and wary of one another.|$|E

The results indicate that indirect effects of <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation are quantitatively much more important than the direct effects. Furthermore, we find that regional differences of the employment change generated by <b>new</b> <b>business</b> formation can to a large part be explained by respective differences of the indirect effects.

40|$|Complexity science perspective, {{covering}} {{many different}} disciplines, mainly describes the dynamic properties of a non-linear system. Due to the fast-changing environment and increasing emphasis on process research orientation, social sciences {{are trying to}} apply complexity science perspective in related studies. Based on this direction, <b>new</b> <b>business</b> development can be explored from complexity science perspective, because it is basically a social process with considerable complexity and dynamics. Therefore, this paper, from complexity science perspective, adopts process-oriented and longitudinal research method to analyze a successful business development case – VISA. Under the leadership of Dee Hock from 1968 to 1980, VISA had been developed as the leading brand of a worldwide value exchange system, connecting a number of banks, stores and consumers.
