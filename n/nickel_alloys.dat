40|$|A nickel-based {{superalloy}} that resists embrittlement by hydrogen {{more strongly than}} does <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718 has been developed. <b>Nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718 is {{the most widely used}} superalloy. It has excellent strength and resistance to corrosion as well as acceptably high ductility, and is recognized as the best alloy for many high-temperature applications. However, <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718 is susceptible to embrittlement by hydrogen and to delayed failure and reduced tensile properties in gaseous hydrogen. The greater resistance of the present {{nickel-based superalloy}} to adverse effects of hydrogen makes this alloy a superior alternative to <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718 for applications that involve production, transfer, and storage of hydrogen, thereby potentially contributing to the commercial viability of hydrogen as a clean-burning fuel. The table shows the composition of the present improved nickel-based superalloy in comparison with that of <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718. This composition was chosen to obtain high resistance to embrittlement by hydrogen while maintaining high strength and exceptional resistance to oxidation and corrosion. The most novel property of this alloy is that it resists embrittlement by hydrogen while retaining tensile strength greater than 175 kpsi (greater than 1. 2 GPa). This alloy exhibits a tensile elongation of more than 20 percent in hydrogen at a pressure of 5 kpsi (approximately equal to 34 MPa) without loss of ductility. This amount of elongation corresponds to 50 percent more ductility than that exhibited by <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> 718 under the same test conditions...|$|R

30|$|The {{oxide film}} that forms on <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> C 22 is {{affected}} by film formation potential and pH. ICR and EIS show the interfacial film resistance Rp is sensitive to the film formation potential. The current {{for the formation of}} oxide peaks at the potential of − 0.1 V. More concentrated KOH electrolyte solution contributes to the formation of less resistant and hence larger peak current for this passive film formation at 0.1 V on <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> C 22. The M–S analysis of the oxide layer on <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> C 22 shows that the oxide film on the <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> is semiconducting when formed in both 0.1 - and 1 -M KOH solutions. Over lower potential range, the oxide film on <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> C 22 displays n-type character, while p-type character is found at higher potentials. Defect concentration obtained from the M–S plots is higher when the film is formed in 1.0 -M KOH solution at all the investigated film formation potentials, which is consistent with a lower film resistance for oxides formed in 1 -M compared to 0.1 -M KOH solution. The AES depth profile shows a dual-layered structure in the oxide film formed at − 0.1 V, where a Cr-rich outer layer is responsible for the higher contact resistance. The amount of Cr showed in the depth profile was higher in 0.1 -M KOH than that in 1.0 -M KOH solution, which further confirmed that a more resistive oxide film grows on the <b>nickel</b> <b>alloy</b> when it is covered by a less concentrated aqueous KOH (less basic) solution.|$|R

25|$|The Olympus 593 was a 2-shaft {{turbojet}} with reheat. The LP and HP compressors {{both had}} 7 stages and were each {{driven by a}} single-stage turbine. Due to the high inlet air temperatures at Mach 2 cruise - in excess of 120 degrees C - the compressor drums and blades were made from titanium except for the last 4 HP stages which were Nimonic 90 nickel alloy. <b>Nickel</b> <b>alloys</b> were normally only required in the hotter turbine areas but the high temperatures {{that occur in the}} last stages of the compressor at supersonic flight speeds dictated its use in the compressor also.

25|$|Radiation {{damage to}} <b>nickel</b> <b>alloys</b> - The {{standard}} Hastelloy N alloy {{was found to}} be embrittled by neutron radiation. Neutrons reacted with nickel to form helium. This helium gas concentrated at specific points inside the alloy, where it increased stresses. ORNL addressed this problem by adding 1–2% titanium or niobium to the Hastelloy N. This changed the alloy's internal structure so that the helium would be finely distributed. This relieved the stress and allowed the alloy to withstand considerable neutron flux. However the maximum temperature is limited to about 650°C. Development of other alloys may be required. The outer vessel wall that contains the salt can have neutronic shielding, such as boron carbide, to effectively protect it from neutron damage.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{types of}} metal or {{synthetic}} substances {{are used for}} bit mouthpieces, which may determine how much a horse salivates or otherwise tolerates a bit; a horse having a moist mouth is considered more relaxed and responsive. Commonly used metals include stainless steel and <b>nickel</b> <b>alloys,</b> which generally do not rust and have a neutral effect on salivation; sweet iron, aurigan and copper, which generally tend to encourage salivation, and aluminum, which is considered drying and is discouraged as a mouthpiece metal. [...] Synthetic mouthpieces may be made with or without internal metal cable or bar reinforcement. [...] Rubber bits are generally thicker than metal bits, but other types of synthetics such as plastics are also used. Plastic-coated bits are often {{the same size as}} metal bits, and some are flavored.|$|E
