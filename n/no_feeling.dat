25|$|Among {{the reasons}} of {{unification}} of accents in, for example, mixed diphthongs, there possibly {{is the absence}} of necessity to distinguish between them. For example, in the case of várna 'crow' - var̃nas 'raven', the r would probably usually be emphasized in var̃nas, but in a case of var̃das 'name', where there is no relative acute word, there can be <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for a speaker, that he / she should emphasize a sound r. But in these cases the distinction can be understood through quantity of a sound – the acute variant has lengthened a, and the circumflex – not lengthened. So, in diphthongs, the problematic leave i, u starting diphthongs, where a standard language speaker have no means to hear, directly know what type of the accent they should have (if they are stressed).|$|E
25|$|One man, Wang Xiaohua, {{was imprisoned}} in a labor camp in Yunnan in 2001 {{when he and}} twenty other Falun Gong detainees were taken to a hospital. They had large {{quantities}} of blood drawn, in addition to urine samples, abdominal x-rays, and electrocardiogram. Hospital staff did not tend to physical injuries they had suffered in custody. This pattern was repeated in several other interviews. Qu Yangyao, a 30-something Chinese refugee, was taken from a labor camp {{to a hospital in}} 2000 along with two other Falun Gong practitioners. She says that hospital staff drew large volumes of blood, conducted chest x-rays and probed the prisoners’ organs. There was “no hammer on the knee, <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for lymph nodes, no examination of ears or mouth or genitals—the doctor checked her retail organs and nothing else,” writes Gutmann.|$|E

25|$|Briseis wasn't {{the only}} {{sensation}} surrounding the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Two {{months before the}} event, on Saturday 9 September, the City of Melbourne sailed for Melbourne from Sydney with a cargo including 13 racehorses, {{many of whom were}} considered serious contenders for the Melbourne Cup. The following day the ship ran into a savage storm and was hit by several rogue waves, with Nemesis (the winner of the 1876 AJC Metropolitan Handicap in Randwick, Sydney and favourite for the Cup, owned by John Moffat) and Robin Hood (another favourite, owned by Etienne de Mestre) being among the 11 horses that were killed. Betting on the big race was paralysed. To the dismay and anger of the public, bookmakers, showing <b>no</b> <b>feeling,</b> presented a purse (loaded with coins) to the captain as token of their appreciation for his part in saving them many thousands of pounds in bets already laid on the favourites who had perished. Perhaps they should have kept their money, however. The outsider Briseis comfortably won by 1 length in the biggest field of all time, and in an extremely good time, so {{it is unlikely that the}} horses who perished could have beaten her.|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{commissioned}} a second series {{based on the}} studio audience reactions during recordings. As development on series two had reached a relatively late stage when the first had received negative reviews upon transmission, {{it was too late}} to cancel the production. The cast and crew, then, had to work on a show which they knew was widely disliked. Moffat reflects on the experience: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> on earth like working on a show that you know is doomed and already tanking." ...|$|E
500|$|Sharon Mawer of Allmusic praised Over the Rainbow {{by saying}} [...] "She can sing, for a seven-year old, {{and most of}} the notes (if not all of them) are in the right order and sung to the right pitch; the timing is fine too". However, she criticised the album, saying [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>feeling,</b> no emotion, no {{realisation}} of what each song is about; they're just pretty little songs", giving the album 2/5. Nick Levine, of Digital Spy, said in a review of the album that Talbot had a [...] "sweet, pure voice", but that there is [...] "no nuance or depth to her performance". However, he said that [...] "There's something inherently wrong about awarding a star rating to a seven-year-old", and that [...] "the decidedly adult concept of musical merit should {{have nothing to do with}} [...] ", awarding the album 2/5.|$|E

500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what was}} in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Oklahoma! {{had been}} a {{struggle}} to finance and produce. [...] Hammerstein and Rodgers met weekly in 1943 with Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theatre Guild, producers of the blockbuster musical, who together formed what they termed [...] "the Gloat Club". [...] At one such luncheon, Helburn and Langner proposed to Rodgers and Hammerstein that they turn Molnár's Liliom into a musical. [...] Both men refused—they had <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for the Budapest setting and thought that the unhappy ending was unsuitable for musical theatre. [...] In addition, given the unstable wartime political situation, they might {{need to change the}} setting from Hungary while in rehearsal. [...] At the next luncheon, Helburn and Langner again proposed Liliom, suggesting that they move the setting to Louisiana and make Liliom a Creole. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein played with the idea over the next few weeks, but decided that Creole dialect, filled with [...] "zis" [...] and [...] "zose" [...] would sound corny and would make it difficult to write effective lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Feminist {{literary}} {{critics argue that}} {{the blame for the}} family feud lies in Verona's patriarchal society. For Coppélia Kahn, for example, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end. When Tybalt kills Mercutio, Romeo shifts into this violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so [...] "effeminate". In this view, the younger males [...] "become men" [...] by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, {{or in the case of}} the servants, their masters. The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate. Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play's feminism from a historicist angle, stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and the advent of capitalism. At the same time, emerging Puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with the [...] "evils of female sexuality" [...] than those of earlier eras and more sympathetic towards love-matches: when Juliet dodges her father's attempt to force her to marry a man she has <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for, she is challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.|$|E

500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what}} was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|The toll of {{international}} celebrity on Wong's personal life {{manifested itself in}} bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking. Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: [...] "Down with Huang Liu Tsong– the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore." [...] Wong began crying and a stampede ensued. After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited {{his family and his}} first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan. Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10days in the family's village and some time in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China. After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: [...] "I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have <b>no</b> <b>feeling</b> for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts." [...] Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.|$|E
500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe {{started working on}} it. Madonna {{wanted it to be}} [...] "loud and brazen, and a {{reflection}} of my street-style and DGAF attitude." [...] She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said [...] "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and jumping on the crowd. That just plain sucks! That's why I wanted something different, something that would be memorable." [...] For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend Maripol for the clothes and the fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in Greenwich Village, where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna. Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the [...] "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me." [...] To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced [...] the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the Like a Virgin album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words [...] "Boy" [...] and [...] "Toy" [...] emblazed on it in gold color. For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager Freddy DeMann contacted record producer Patrick Leonard, who had just returned from the Victory Tour by The Jackson 5. At first Leonard said <b>no,</b> <b>feeling</b> exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.|$|E
