5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is {{planning}} to rescue Katrina. He decides that the only solution is to join the Varden in Surda, and so he convinces almost the entire village to travel there. The villagers reach Narda, where they pay for barges to sail to Teirm. In Teirm, Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who tells him about Eragon and that he <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Dragon Rider. Roran is stunned that his cousin is a Dragon Rider, and he asks Jeod for help to reach the Varden. Jeod decides {{to go with them}} and he gathers a group of his friends to steal a ship called the Dragon Wing. The villagers are chased by a group of Galbatorix's boats, but they force themselves into the gigantic whirpool, the Boar's eye, so that they can trap the enemy ships.|$|E

Although he grows old, he remains a witness rather than actor and more often reacts to, as opposed to causes, events throughout the novel. He is in admiration of Macandal's qualities prior {{to the loss of}} Macandal's arm; he accompanies Macandal into the mountains and is saddened by his departure.|$|E

5|$|By the 13th century, {{a need to}} formalize {{the border}} between the Novgorod Republic and the Scandinavian {{countries}} became evident. The Novgorodians, along with the Karelians who came from the south, reached the coast of what now is Pechengsky District and the portion of the coast of Varangerfjord near the Voryema River, which <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> part of Norway. The Sami population was forced to pay tribute. The Norwegians, however, were also attempting to take control of these lands, resulting in armed conflicts. In 1251, a conflict between the Karelians, Novgorodians and the servants of the king of Norway led to the establishment of a Novgorodian mission in Norway. Also in 1251, the first treaty with Norway was signed in Novgorod regarding the Sami lands and the system of tribute collections, making the Sami people pay tribute to both Novgorod and Norway. By the terms of the treaty, Novgorodians could collect tribute from the Sami as far as Lyngen fjord in the west, while Norwegians could collect tribute on the territory of the whole Kola Peninsula except {{in the eastern part of}} Tersky Coast. No state borders were established by the 1251 treaty.|$|E

25|$|Built between 1835 and 1855, the Malakoff Tower, a {{monument}} constructed in Tunisian / Arabic style, {{used to be}} an observatory and <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> cultural centre and a place for popular gatherings.

Formerly under British rule, Tabuaeran <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> part of the Republic of Kiribati.

25|$|The {{correction}} of capsular contracture might require an open capsulotomy (surgical release) of the collagen-fiber capsule, or the removal, and possible replacement, {{of the breast}} implant. Furthermore, in treating capsular contracture, the closed capsulotomy (disruption via external manipulation) once was a common maneuver for treating hard capsules, but <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> discouraged technique, because it can rupture the breast implant. Non-surgical treatments for collagen-fiber capsules include massage, external ultrasonic therapy, leukotriene pathway inhibitors such as zafirlukast (Accolate) or montelukast (Singulair), and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT).|$|E

25|$|The Munroe Falls Dam was {{modified}} in 2005. Work {{on this project}} uncovered a natural waterfall. Given this new knowledge about the riverbed, some interested parties, including Summit County, campaigned for complete removal of the dam.

The 11.5 foot sandstone dam has since been removed, and in its place <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> natural ledge with a 4.5 foot drop at its greatest point.|$|E

25|$|Tlaltenango {{used to be}} a {{separate}} town, but <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> neighborhood of Cuernavaca city. The main attraction there is the church compound containing the Church of San José and the Church of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros de Tlaltenango. San José {{is one of the oldest}} churches in Mexico, built between 1521 and 1523. Two centuries later an image of the Virgin appeared to members of this village, prompting the building of the second church. This is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros, which was built in 1730, with its bell towers built at the end of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his father, Aurangzeb was {{not much}} {{interested}} in architecture. Aurangzeb constructed a small marble mosque known as the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) in the Red Fort complex in Delhi. He ordered {{the construction of the}} Badshahi Mosque in Lahore. He also constructed a mosque on Benares. The mosque he constructed in Srinagar is still the largest in Kashmir. The structure of Bibi Ka Maqbara in Aurangabad, which <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> historical monument was constructed by the sons of Aurangzeb in remembrance of their mother. The inspiration came from Taj mahal as is quite visible from its architecture.|$|E

25|$|The cathedral {{was built}} by Cortés to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the buttresses. Over time, this church {{underwent}} a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-20th century, when restoration work removed all the Neoclassical altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral's pinacotheca and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered al fresco murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of Philip of Jesus, the first Mexican canonized as a saint. The only other decoration inside this church <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> modern-style crucifix and {{an image of the}} Assumption of Mary. This restoration work was carried out by Bishop Sergio Méndz Arceo.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} building collapses was that of the Conjunto Pino Suárez, which was a complex of five steel-frame buildings. A 20-story tower, Tower Four, doubled over at the third floor and fell south onto a fourteen-story building. The fall left a huge piece of concrete blocking the road that leads to the Zócalo. People at the scene stated that there was simply no time to run and escape the building's fall. The other three 20-story buildings were closed because of damage, as well as the Metro entrance next door. The building was occupied by family courts and offices of the public defender. The area <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> commercial center.|$|E
