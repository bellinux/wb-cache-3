40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the effects of applied bed mixing and vapor phase residence time on the thermal cracking of agglomerating and <b>non-agglomerating</b> feedstock. Bitumen thermal cracking was investigated using a novel Mechanically Fluidized Reactor system and a pilot-scale Fluid Coking Reactor. Bed mixing and vapor residence time were studied to determine their impacts on agglomerate distributions, yields, {{and the quality of}} liquid product. Birchwood pyrolysis was investigated using a fluidized bed reactor to determine the impacts of particle-bed mixing on the pyrolysis of a <b>non-agglomerating</b> feedstock, to provide contrast to the agglomerating bitumen-coke system. It was observed that applied bed mixing destroyed agglomerates and dispersed the trapped reacting feedstock among smaller fragments, leading to reductions in coke yield and increased liquid production. Applied bed mixing resulted in lower viscosity, lower-molecular weight liquid product at short vapor phase residence times. Prolonged vapor phase residence times facilitated the cracking of vapors into non-condensable gas, while increasing the concentration of more refractory, higher-viscosity, higher-molecular weight components in the liquid product. In addition, it was determined that the use of a feeding system which disperses <b>non-agglomerating</b> biomass upon injection, in conjunction with a fluidized bed pyrolyzer, is an effective system and enhancing particle-feedstock mixing further provides no additional benefits for pyrolysis...|$|R

The physicochemical characterization comprised of elemental, proximate, calorific value, and classification (rank) analyses. Thermal analysis was examined using combined Thermogravimetric (TG) and Derivative Thermogravimetric analyses (DTG). Hence, the coal was heated from 30 °C to 1000 °C at 20 °C/min under inert conditions to examine its thermal degradation behaviour and temperature profile characteristics (TPC). The {{results indicated that the}} GMG coal fuel properties consist of low Ash, Nitrogen, and Sulphur content. Moisture content was > 5 %, Volatile Matter > 50 %, Fixed Carbon > 22 %, and Heating Value (HHV) 23. 74 MJ/kg.

The DTG profile revealed four (4) endothermic peaks corresponding to loss of moisture (drying), volatile matter (devolatization), and coke formation. The residual mass Rm was 50. 16 %, which indicates that higher temperatures above 1000 °C are required for the complete pyrolytic decomposition of the GMG coal.

30|$|Activity 5 : Identification {{of design}} problems. In this activity, the {{participant}} had 45 min to identify design {{problems in the}} project. We emphasized to the participant the importance of achieving the key goal of finding design problems. For each identified design problem, the participant was asked to provide the following information: (i) short description of the problem, (ii) possible consequences caused by the problem, (iii) classes, methods, or packages realizing the design problem in the source code, and (iv) the category(s) of agglomerations—described in “Basic concepts” section—that helped him to identify the design problems. If the participant was identifying design problems {{as part of the}} control group, she needed to provide almost the same information; the difference was that instead of providing the agglomeration (and its category), she needed to provide the code smells that she used to identify the design problem. For conducting this task, participants were instructed to use only the information provided by Organic in the current phase. This means that, neither the control group had access to the list of agglomerations, nor the agglomeration group had access to the list of <b>non-agglomerated</b> smells. This was guaranteed by providing different versions of Organic for each group—that is, one version for agglomerations and another version for <b>non-agglomerated</b> code smells. Nevertheless, both the project source code and the information provided by Organic (agglomerated or <b>non-agglomerated</b> smells) could be freely explored and analyzed during the design problem identification.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{hydrophilic}} (ZnO-hydro) and a lipophilic coated (ZnO-lipo) ZnO powder were studied. A main {{aspect of this}} work was the preparation of stable, i.e. <b>non-agglomerating</b> stock suspensions for use in in vitro testing. A two-stage procedure (1, suspension preparation in non-physiological media; and 2, transferring and testing in physiological media), as used by many researchers, e.g., Bihari et al. [23] and Taurozzi et al. [24], was used. The proven approach from previous studies [25, 26, 27, 28] was adapted {{to the requirements of}} the ZnO powders. The approach includes the destruction of existing agglomerates down to the smallest dispersible units of the given powder. Different dispersing agents were tested to yield an optimized stock suspension exhibiting stability over time. The behavior of ZnO particles under physiological conditions was studied through addition of the stock suspensions to phosphate buffer (PBS and PBS with BSA) and cell culture media (DMEM and DMEM/FBS). Extensive investigations were performed on both the stock suspensions and the particles in DMEM and in DMEM/FBS. For this purpose, pH, conductivity, particle size, zeta potential, and dissolved zinc ion concentrations were measured over several days to record changes in the samples. Finally, the goal was to record the changes in the kinetics of ZnO as agglomeration and dissolution under different test conditions in order to improve toxicological studies on ZnO. For example, it is necessary to know about the actual zinc ion and zinc oxide concentration in test media, as the basis for dose–response curves. Last but not least, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined and particle morphology, aggregation degree, and other properties were characterized using scanning electron microscopy.|$|R
30|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) nanoparticles in sunscreens and other cosmetic products demands a risk assessment {{that has to be}} done in toxicological studies. Such investigations require profound knowledge of the behavior of ZnO in cell culture media. The current study was performed to get well-dispersed suspensions of a hydrophilic (ZnO-hydro) and a lipophilic coated (ZnO-lipo) ZnO nanomaterial for use in in vitro tests. Therefore, systematic tests were carried out with common dispersants (phosphate, lecithin, proteins) to elucidate chemical and physical changes of ZnO nanoparticles in water and physiological solutions (PBS, DMEM). Non-physiological stock suspensions were prepared using ultrasonication. Time-dependent changes of pH, conductivity, zeta potential, particle size and dissolution were recorded. Secondly, the stock suspensions were added to physiological media with or without albumin (BSA) or serum (FBS), to examine characteristics such as agglomeration and dissolution. Stable stock suspensions were obtained using phosphate as natural and physiological electrostatic stabilizing agent. Lecithin proved to be an effective wetting agent for ZnO-lipo. Although the particle size remained constant, the suspension changed over time. The pH increased as a result of ZnO dissolution and formation of zinc phosphate complexes. The behavior of ZnO in physiological media was found to depend strongly on the additives used. Applying only phosphate as additive, ZnO-hydro agglomerated within minutes. In the presence of lecithin or BSA/serum, agglomeration was inhibited. ZnO dissolution was higher under physiological conditions than in the stock suspension. Serum especially promoted this process. Using body-related dispersants (phosphate, lecithin) <b>non-agglomerating</b> stock suspensions of hydrophilic and lipophilic ZnO were prepared as a prerequisite to perform meaningful toxicological investigation. Both nanomaterials showed a non-negligible dissolution behavior that strongly depended on the surrounding conditions. Agglomeration of ZnO particles in physiological media is a complex function of particle coating, used dispersants and serum proteins if supplemented. The present study gives a clear guideline how to prepare and handle suspensions with ZnO for in vitro testing and allows the correlation between the chemical-physical particles behavior with findings from toxicological tests.|$|R

To be cost competitive and relevant for widespread use, {{it is crucial to}} explore the synthesis of thin film via soft-chemistry less expensive than physical ones (PLD, ALD [...] .). Combining dip-coating and sol-gel processes, nanometer scale 10 %gadolinium doped ceria (GDC, electrolyte), LSCF (cathode) and 10 %GDC-nickel based composite nanoarchitectures films were deposited on a Si wafer and on porous Al 2 O 3 substrates in one-step thermal processing. For the electrodes, the 3 -D network is constituted of <b>non-agglomerates</b> nanoparticles of Gd-doped ceria and NiO or LSCF. In this arrangement, particles in the nanoscale are kept {{because of the presence of}} secondary phases (NiO, LSCF) and pores. The different interfaces in these hierarchical-porous composites tune the particles size as well as the surface energy. The study of the microstrain through XRD analyses shows that the domain of stability of the studied microstructure is large (200 °C) for NiO/GDC cermet. Accordingly, the effect of the microstructure on the mixed ionic conductivities in this range of temperature is low, because their microstructure is stable. These composites can be used as model for understanding the impact of the size of the particle on the transport of ions and electrons. Furthermore, the reduction of the NiO/GDC electrodes were studied through various techniques: XRD, ac-impedance. The microstructures were stable up to temperatures of 600 °C. The electrochemical performances I-V curves of these different thin layers were measured in a single gas atmosphere setup. The electrochemical results will be discussed as function of the cathode and anode composition and the microstructure (the temperature and the reducing treatments). Finally, these different hierarchical-porous thin films are favorable for efficient composite electrode and electrolyte for micro-SOFC application. 1. A.

By further increasing the refractive {{index of the}} polymer, without lowering the transmittance of visible light, the overall lens properties will be improved. Dispersion of TiO 2 nanoparticles into the polymer was chosen for this because of TiO 2 high refractive index. In this work, a polymer-nanoparticle composite with high refractive index is developed by dispersing TiO 2 nanoparticles into the polymer. The polymer-nanoparticle composite was characterized with respect to refractive index and transmittance of visible light. A {{major part of the}} work evolved around achieving a homogenous dispersion of <b>non-agglomerated</b> TiO 2 nanoparticles. Different approaches was used, including in situ functionalization and post synthesis methods like ultrasonification and electrostatic stabilization of the TiO 2 nanoparticles. Non of the approaches were successful in achieving <b>non-agglomerated</b> particles, making the polymer-nanoparticle composite milky white, and the transmittance of visible light very low. A small increase in refractive index was observed.

A drastic change in morphology was observed between acidic and basic reaction conditions.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to literature on entrepreneurship, by providing insights {{on the impact of}} Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) on the performance of Small and-Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). Particularly, the study explores to what extent agglomerations of firms (i. e., firm clusters) can influence SMEs performance, as well as being part of a territorial network, in which firms can exchange resources and knowledge. EO can be conceived as a general attitude of entrepreneurs in managing their firms (e. g., strong orientation to innovate and take risks, Morris and Paul, 1987). Analyzing EO can be helpful in understanding the agglomerating, and networking patterns of firms, as well as their performance (e. g., Acs and Armington, 2004; Acs and Varga, 2005; Aghion et al., 2009; Fritsch and Mueller, 2008; Acs et al., 2010; Bosma et al., 2011). Albeit literature has recognized agglomerations as surely having an impact on firm performance, {{it is not clear whether}} this impact is positive (e. g., Harrison, 1992; Krugman, 1991; Marshall, 1920), or negative (e. g., Buenstorf and Guenther, 2011). Although in recent years there was an increasing academic attention in understanding differences in performances between agglomerating and <b>non-agglomerating</b> firms, results of research still appear fragmented and inconsistent (e. g., Klumbies and Bausch, 2011). Research has long recognized the importance of networks in fostering innovation. However, interest in understanding their complex evolutionary dynamics is relatively recent (Martin and Sunley, 2006; Glückler, 2007; Giuliani and Bell, 2008; Boschma and Frenken, 2010; Martin, 2010; Menzel and Fornhal, 2010; Boschma and Fornahl, 2011; Martin and Sunley, 2011; Staber, 2011; Ter Wal and Boschma, 2011; Balland, 2012; Balland et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). Contributions on this topic suggest that, changes in the evolutionary patterns of networks can be considered as predictors -at least partially- of the likely future success or failure of an agglomeration (i. e., cluster). Hence, networks and their evolutionary patterns appear to have an impact on the performance of single participating firms. According to the above considerations, this paper provides an exploration of the impact of EO on firm performance, considering agglomeration and network (i. e., the firm being part of a network) as moderating variables in the relationship EO-performance. The paper focuses on the Italian wine industry, one of the most important sectors in agri-food production in Italy, and one of the most recognizable Italian excellences. The wine industry is considered as an emblematic case study for agglomerating effects, given that a similar firm clustering is present among wine industries all over the world (hence, with comparable characteristics, e. g., Cusmano et al, 2010; Bell and Giuliani, 2007). After providing some measurement of agglomeration (using Moran’s LMi statistic), the paper presents the moderate regression that has been performed on data from a sample of 234 Italian wine firms (collected through the administration of a structured questionnaire). Results confirm the importance of agglomeration and entrepreneurial risk taking attitude on performance, but providing no significant evidence on the role of network...|$|R

40|$|A {{software}} product line (SPL) {{is a set}} of systems that share common and varying features. To provide large-scale reuse, the components of a SPL should be easy to maintain. Therefore, developers have to identify anomalous code structures – i. e., code anomalies – that are detrimental to the SPL maintain-ability. Otherwise, SPL changes can eventually propagate to seemly-unrelated features and affect various SPL products. Previous work often assume that each code anomaly alone suffices to characterize SPL maintenance problems, though each single anomaly may represent only a partial, insignificant, or even inexistent view of the problem. As a result, previous studies have difficulties in characterizing anomalous structures that indicate SPL maintenance problems. In this pa-per, we study the surrounding context of each anomaly and observe that certain anomalies may be interconnected, thereby forming so-called anomaly agglomerations. We characterize three types of agglomerations in SPL: feature, feature hierarchy, and component agglomeration. Two or more anomalies form an agglomeration when they affect the same SPL structural element, i. e. a feature, a feature hierarchy, or a component. We then investigate to what extent <b>non-agglomerated</b> and agglomerated anomalies represent sources of a specific SPL maintenance problem: instability.

Besides ensuring good dispersion of all powder components in the system, the <b>non-agglomerated</b> form of CNTs and the expansion upon foaming foster their structural integrity under stretched conditions in the final foams for an efficient load transfer. © 2016 Portuguese Society of Materials (SPM...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} between (NH 4) 2 TiF 6 and H 3 BO 3 in {{the presence}} of varying quantities of PEG- 6000 was used to form NH 4 TiOF 3 mesocrystals (MCs). The amount of PEG- 6000, employed as a template, is crucial to the formation of defect free, <b>non-agglomerated</b> NH 4 TiOF 3 MCs; high concentrations lead to MC agglomeration, lower ones result in centralized defects. This polymer-mediated formation process may be understood using an analogy with known polymerization reactions. The oxofluorotitanate MCs readily undergo a thermal topotactic transformation to give anatase MCs with photocatalytic activity. The TiO 2 MCs are porous, with highly orientated lamellar crystallites that form part of the larger mesocrystal structure...|$|E
