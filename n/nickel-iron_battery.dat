25|$|Jungner {{had invented}} a <b>nickelâ€“iron</b> <b>battery</b> {{the same year}} as his Ni-Cad battery, but found it to be {{inferior}} to its cadmium counterpart and, as a consequence, never bothered patenting it. It produced a lot more hydrogen gas when being charged, meaning it could not be sealed, and the charging process was less efficient (it was, however, cheaper). However, Thomas Edison picked up Jungner's <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> design, patented it himself and sold it in 1903. Edison wanted to commercialise a more lightweight and durable substitute for the lead-acid battery that powered some early automobiles, and hoped that by doing so electric cars would become the standard, with his firm as its main battery vendor. However, customers found his first model to be prone to leakage and short battery life, and it did not outperform the lead-acid cell by much either. Although Edison was able to produce a more reliable and powerful model seven years later, by this time the inexpensive and reliable Model T Ford had made gasoline engine cars the standard. Nevertheless, Edison's battery achieved great success in other applications such as electric and diesel-electric rail vehicles, providing backup power for railroad crossing signals, or to provide power for the lamps used in mines.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series {{electric}} locomotives with on-board batteries. These locomotives weighed 85 tons and operated on 750-volt overhead trolley wire with considerable further range whilst running on batteries. [...] The locomotives provided several decades of service using <b>Nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with lead-acid batteries, and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The {{others can be}} seen at the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad, Iowa, and at the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have long}} life {{expectancy}} and are tolerant of abuse or poor charge regimes. However their larger internal impedance {{often results in}} premature voltage cut-out with remote area power supplies (RAPS) inverters. A new method for sizing nickel iron batteries is proposed, which incorporates a technique that helps address this problem at the design stage. An economic analysis is presented which reveals that <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> can represent a cost effective solution in some RAPS applications...|$|R

50|$|In 1972, Exide {{acquired}} the Edison Storage Battery Company, which {{had developed a}} practical <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> in 1901. The production {{of this type of}} battery was subsequently discontinued in 1975.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was a manufacturing facility {{for a kind}} of <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> developed by Thomas Edison in 1901. Manufacturing began around 1903 and was discontinued in 1975 when Edison Storage was sold to Exide.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> (NiFe battery) is a {{rechargeable}} battery having nickel(III) oxide-hydroxide positive plates and iron negative plates, with an electrolyte of potassium hydroxide. The active materials {{are held in}} nickel-plated steel tubes or perforated pockets. It is a very robust battery which is tolerant of abuse, (overcharge, overdischarge, and short-circuiting) and can have very long life even if so treated.It is often used in backup situations {{where it can be}} continuously charged and can last for more than 20 years. Due to its low specific energy, poor charge retention, and high cost of manufacture, other types of rechargeable batteries have displaced the <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> in most applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> {{have long}} been used in European mining {{operations}} because {{of their ability to}} withstand vibration, high temperatures and other physical stress. They are being examined again for use in wind and solar power systems where battery weight is not important.|$|R
50|$|The first Baker {{vehicle was}} a two seater with a selling price of US$850. One {{was sold to}} Thomas Edison as his first car.

50|$|Electrified trains {{were used}} for coal transport, as the motors did not use {{precious}} oxygen in the mines. Switzerland's lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network. One of the earliest rechargeable batteries - the <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> - was favored by Edison for use in electric cars.|$|E
5000|$|Jungner's {{work was}} largely {{unknown in the}} US until the 1940s, when {{nickel-cadmium}} batteries went into production there. A 50 volt <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> was the main D.C. power supply in the World War II German V-2 rocket, together with two 16 volt batteries which powered the four gyroscopes (turbine powered generators supplied A.C. for its magnetic amplifier driven servomechanisms). A smaller version {{was used in the}} V-1 flying bomb. (viz. 1946 Operation Backfire blueprints.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Aqueous {{potassium}} hydroxide is employed as the electrolyte in alkaline batteries based on nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, and manganese dioxide-zinc. Potassium hydroxide is preferred over sodium hydroxide because its solutions are more conductive. [...] The Nickel Metal Hydride batteries in the Toyota Prius use {{a mixture of}} {{potassium hydroxide}} and sodium hydroxide. <b>Nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> also use potassium hydroxide electrolyte.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{researchers}} {{announced an}} electrolysis system made of inexpensive, abundant nickel and iron rather than precious metal catalysts, such as platinum or iridium. The nickel-metal/nickel-oxide structure is more active than pure nickel metal or pure nickel oxide alone. The catalyst significantly lowers the required voltage. Also <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> are being investigated {{for use as}} combined batteries and electrolysis for hydrogen production. Those [...] "battolysers" [...] could be charged and discharged like conventional batteries, and would produce hydrogen when fully charged.|$|R
5000|$|The springs of Grapevine Canyon {{provided}} {{the water supply}} for the ranch and were used to generate electricity. The springs, located about 300 ft higher than the villa, generated enough water flow and pressure to turn a Pelton wheel, which ran the generator that furnished the villa's electricity. The power was regulated and backed up by the large bank of <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> in the house's tunnels. The springs provided enough water to meet all {{the needs of the}} ranch, with enough left for other uses.|$|R
50|$|An {{underground}} mystery tour is {{also available}} for those wishing to see {{the inner workings of}} the building. One-quarter mile of tunnels run under the building, where visitors can visit the powerhouse and see thousands of tiles that were to be used for the never-finished swimming pool. The tunnels also contain hundreds of <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> cells, used to regulate power and provide backup power. The main house tour is ADA accessible, but the underground tour is not.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, most {{electric}} vehicles have used lead-acid batteries {{due to their}} mature technology, high availability, and low cost (exception: some early EVs, such as the Detroit Electric, used a <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery.)</b> Like all batteries, these have an environmental impact through their construction, use, disposal or recycling. On the upside, vehicle battery recycling rates top 95% in the United States. Deep-cycle lead batteries are expensive and have a shorter life than the vehicle itself, typically needing replacement every 3 years.|$|E
5000|$|... {{was also}} a {{component}} in the <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery,</b> {{also known as the}} Edison Battery, and is a component in fuel cells.

50|$|Experiments with battery-electric railcars were {{conducted}} from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the Edison-Beach type, with <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm nickel-zinc battery was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the Harcourt Street Line in Ireland and British Railways used lead-acid batteries in a railcar in 1958. Between 1955 and 1995 DB railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 railcars utilising lead-acid batteries.|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler TEVan was {{a battery}} {{electric}} vehicle produced from 1993 to 1995 by Chrysler and sold primarily to electric utilities throughout the United States. The first generation used either <b>nickel-iron</b> or nickel-cadmium <b>batteries.</b> Only 56 were produced and were sold for approximately $120,000 each. Half were produced using <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> and half were equipped with the nickel-cadmium packs. The TEVan {{was built on the}} same production line as the gasoline-powered minivans at Chrysler's Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, Canada. It had a top speed of 70 mi/h km/h, seating for five adults, and a curb weight of 5060 lb. The second generation, named the EPIC (Electric Powered Interurban Commuter Vehicle), was launched in 1997 with advanced lead acid batteries and later in 1998 with nickel metal-hydride batteries. It was offered for lease in New York and California in 1999.|$|R

50|$|Anderson had {{previously}} been known as the Anderson Carriage Company (until 1911), producing carriages and buggies since 1884. Production of the electric automobile, powered by a rechargeable lead acid battery, began in 1907. For an additional , an Edison <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>battery</b> was available from 1911 to 1916. The cars were advertised as reliably getting 80 mi between battery recharging, although in one test a Detroit Electric ran 211.3 mi on a single charge. Top speed was only about 20 mph, but this was considered adequate for driving within city or town limits at the time.|$|E

40|$|Ceria-supported {{platinum}} synthesized by a novel solution-combustion method {{results in}} ionically substituted platinum sites on nanosized ceria crystallites, and {{is found to}} be an excellent hydrogen and oxygen recombinant catalyst at room temperature for recovery of water in sealed lead-acid batteries. The use of this catalyst prevents any change in the quantity or concentration of thesulfuric acid electrolyte in the battery during its operation, which is pivotal to enhancing both its performance and life span. The catalyst could be equally advantageous to alkaline storage batteries, and, in particular, in realizing sealed <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> giving them a revived commercial interest...|$|R
50|$|Net {{metering}} {{systems can}} have energy storage integrated, to store {{some of the}} power locally (i.e. from the renewable energy source connected to the system) rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid. Often, the batteries used are industrial deep cycle batteries as these last for 10 to 20 years. Lead-acid batteries are often also still used, but last much less long (5 years or so). Lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used, but too have a relatively short lifespan. Finally, <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years. A 2017 study of solar panels with battery storage indicated an 8 to 14 percent extra consumption of electricity from charging and discharging batteries.|$|R
50|$|Powering the {{transponder}} was a {{more serious}} problem. The system had to operate in any weather, which made conventional lead-acid batteries unsuitable due to their poor cold-weather performance. The system also had to be stored {{for long periods of}} time before being activated, which again argued against lead-acid. The solution was found to be small <b>nickel-iron</b> <b>batteries</b> that could be repeatedly and rapidly recharged in the field, and operated across a wide range of temperatures. To protect the system from capture, it was fitted with small explosives that would destroy enough of the circuitry to make it impossible to determine the exact frequencies being used. The transponders were mounted in suitcases, selected on a case-by-case basis to match common types in use in that area.|$|R
