5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of <b>non-viable</b> tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{is not completely}} understood, as the event is neither predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While {{it is possible that}} more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a <b>non-viable</b> fetus.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, <b>non-viable</b> states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes <b>non-viable</b> before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that anthesis occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 <b>non-viable</b> egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|The white-eyed river {{martin was}} seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not {{definitely}} since. There are unconfirmed sightings from Thailand in 1986 and Cambodia in 2004. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, or will decrease, by 80% within three generations. This species may be extinct, but the IUCN will not categorise it as such until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted. Despite legal protection under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, it was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists. Following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers {{were reported to have}} caught as many as 120 and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity. The small population may therefore have become <b>non-viable.</b>|$|E

25|$|In April 2015, Chinese {{scientists}} reported {{results of}} an attempt to alter the DNA of <b>non-viable</b> human embryos using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder. The study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns. The experiments resulted in changing only some genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. In April 2016 Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of <b>non-viable</b> human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the CCR5 gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.|$|E
25|$|Design {{limitations}} forced Mil {{to adopt}} a twin rotor system but design studies of a tandem layout, similar to the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, revealed major problems. The single rotor layouts also studied proved to be <b>non-viable,</b> leading to the transverse layout chosen for the finished article.|$|E
25|$|Legal {{methods to}} {{restrict}} breeding include not feeding these ducks, deterring them with noise or by chasing, and finding nests and vigorously shaking the eggs to render them <b>non-viable.</b> Returning the eggs to the nest will avoid re-laying as the female would if the clutch were removed.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenetic {{offspring}} {{in species}} that use either the XY or the X0 sex-determination system have two X chromosomes and are female. In species {{that use the}} ZW sex-determination system, they have either two Z chromosomes (male) or two W chromosomes (mostly <b>non-viable</b> but rarely a female), or they could have one Z and one W chromosome (female).|$|E
25|$|The caucuses {{followed}} the regular {{procedures of the}} Democratic Party process. Any voter who was a registered Democrat and a resident of Iowa was eligible {{to participate in the}} event. Individuals could have chosen to register or change their party affiliation at the door. It was estimated that 60 percent of the caucusgoers would have attended the caucuses for the first time. All of the caucusgoers met in public buildings or schools in their respective precincts and divided themselves into groups; each group represented a candidate. The voting was done publicly (viva voce). To be viable, each preference group/candidate must have had at least 15 percent of the caucusgoers' votes. If a candidate received less than 15 percent of the caucusgoers' votes, then the supporters of that <b>non-viable</b> candidate had 30 minutes to join a viable candidate's group, join another <b>non-viable</b> candidate's group to make the candidate viable, join an uncommitted group, or choose not to be counted as a voter.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1755, the Lisbon {{earthquake}} partially {{destroyed the}} Church, {{resulting in the}} destruction of part of the vaulted-ceiling and a belfry over the lateral doorway. A fire, which was triggered after the event, consumed the orphanage, except the chapel of the Holy Sacrament (the former Chapel of D. Simôa), and altarpiece of the Chapel of the Holy Christ of Padecentes. The church of Conceição dos Freiras was also ruined, making its reconstruction <b>non-viable</b> owing to the new city plan.|$|E
25|$|When meiosis is involved, {{the sex of}} the {{offspring}} will depend on the type of sex determination system and the type of apomixis. In species that use the XY sex-determination system, parthenogenetic offspring will have two X chromosomes and are female. In species that use the ZW sex-determination system {{the offspring}} genotype may be one of ZW (female), ZZ (male), or WW (<b>non-viable</b> in most species but a fertile, viable female in a few (e.g., boas)). ZW offspring are produced by endoreplication before meiosis or by central fusion. ZZ and WW offspring occur either by terminal fusion or by endomitosis in the egg cell.|$|E
25|$|The final option, {{if other}} {{measures}} have failed, is heart transplantation or (temporary or prolonged) implantation of an artificial heart. These remain the recommended surgical treatment options. However, {{the limited number}} of hearts available for transplantation in a growing group of candidates, has {{led to the development of}} alternative surgical approaches to heart failure. These commonly involve surgical left ventricular remodeling. The aim of the procedures is to reduce the ventricle diameter (targeting Laplace's law and the disease mechanism of heart failure), improve its shape and/or remove <b>non-viable</b> tissue. These procedures can be performed together with coronary artery bypass surgery or mitral valve repair.|$|E
25|$|By January 2011 {{there were}} {{indications}} that Turkey was reconsidering its {{participation in the}} F-35 program and its procurement of the aircraft. Political friction between Turkey and the US resulted in the US refusing to ship or delaying shipments of F-16 parts to Turkey over relations with Israel and Turkish officials are concerned that similar problems will make F-35 production {{and support of the}} 100 F-35s it has planned to buy <b>non-viable.</b> Rising costs in the F-35 program are also a factor and Turkey is considering developing its own fighter instead in cooperation with other nations.

25|$|The {{natural process}} of healing a {{fracture}} starts when the injured bone and surrounding tissues bleed, forming a fracture hematoma. The blood coagulates {{to form a}} blood clot situated between the broken fragments. Within a few days, blood vessels grow into the jelly-like matrix of the blood clot. The new blood vessels bring phagocytes to the area, which gradually remove the <b>non-viable</b> material. The blood vessels also bring fibroblasts in {{the walls of the}} vessels and these multiply and produce collagen fibres. In this way the blood clot is replaced by a matrix of collagen. Collagen's rubbery consistency allows bone fragments to move only a small amount unless severe or persistent force is applied.|$|E
25|$|Leaders of both fraternities {{made great}} {{attempts}} {{to be sensitive}} to the pain of change and emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, unable or unwilling to commit to another national, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released, and its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be <b>non-viable</b> or had simply vanished in the time since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded, and these were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988.|$|E
25|$|The second Turkish {{offensive}} {{began on}} August 14, 1974, as Greek and Turkish Cypriot representatives met in Geneva {{to discuss the}} situation on the island. Turkish pleas for international intervention having failed and very slow diplomatic progress, in addition to being confined to an undefensible and <b>non-viable</b> region in Cyprus, Turkish Armed forces took action again. Despite a UN ceasefire in place (several had already been disregarded), the Turkish Army, massively reinforced from weeks of build-up, launched an all-out surprise attack on ill-prepared Greek Cypriot and Greek units. With little answer to the masses of armour, mechanised units, artillery and air support that the Turks could bring to bear, virtually all Greek Cypriot defences collapsed in a matter of days, and by August 16, 1974, Turkish forces, spearheaded by the 28th and 39th Infantry Divisions, had extended to capture some 37% of the island, including the towns of Famagusta, Varosha and Morphou.|$|E
500|$|Some {{mutations}} {{occur in}} [...] "toolkit" [...] or regulatory genes. Changes in these often have large {{effects on the}} phenotype of the individual because they regulate the function of many other genes. Most, but not all, mutations in regulatory genes result in <b>non-viable</b> embryos. Some nonlethal regulatory mutations occur in HOX genes in humans, which {{can result in a}} cervical rib or polydactyly, {{an increase in the number}} of fingers or toes. When such mutations result in a higher fitness, natural selection favours these phenotypes and the novel trait spreads in the population.|$|E
500|$|Early {{embryonal}} lethality, {{also known}} as early embryonic death or a <b>non-viable</b> embryo, may occur when the embryo possesses two dominant white alleles, or have the homozygous genotype. The {{reason for this is}} that many mutations for W are caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations or DNA deletions, which, if homozygous, would make it impossible to produce a functional KIT protein. [...] However, it is possible that homozygous embryos from alleles of missense and splice site mutations might be viable because they have less effect on gene function. A 2013 study also unearthed horses that were compound W5/W20 heterozygotes, almost completely white, essentially with greater depigmentation than could be accounted for by either allele alone.|$|E
500|$|The {{porbeagle}} is an opportunistic hunter that preys {{mainly on}} bony fishes and cephalopods throughout the water column, including the bottom. Most commonly found over food-rich banks {{on the outer}} continental shelf, it makes occasional forays both close to shore and into the open ocean {{to a depth of}} [...] It also conducts long-distance seasonal migrations, generally shifting between shallower and deeper water. The porbeagle is fast and highly active, with physiological adaptations that enable it to maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water. It can be solitary or gregarious, and has been known to perform seemingly playful behavior. This shark is aplacental viviparous with oophagy, developing embryos being retained within the mother's uterus and subsisting on <b>non-viable</b> eggs. Females typically bear four pups every year.|$|E
500|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, {{which had}} been bought out by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1866 and later passed into {{the control of the}} Great Western Railway had, by the {{beginning}} of the First World War, fallen into disrepair due to lack of trade. This trade, particularly the Wales-Somerset traffic after the opening of the Severn Tunnel in 1886, had been lost to the railways; the canal continued to be used as a source of water. In the mid-1950s, the Port of Bridgwater was importing some [...] of cargo, mainly sand and coal by tonnage, followed by timber and flour. It was also exporting some [...] of bricks and tiles. By then, Bridgwater's brick and tile industry was in terminal decline. In the 1960s, British Rail, the owner of the docks, which were limited by the size of its locks to boats of maximum size , decided that they were commercially <b>non-viable.</b> British Railways offered to sell the docks to any buyer; however, there were no takers, so the docks were closed to river traffic.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, in Germany, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} her third {{trimester}} {{was involved in a}} motor vehicle accident, and died; the <b>non-viable</b> fetus was found between her feet. The vehicle caught fire following initial impact [...] The woman was unable to escape due to internal injuries and burned to death. Investigators {{came to the conclusion that}} the extreme heat of the fire burned away epidermal and subcutaneous tissue around the abdominal cavity, after which the anterior aspect of the uterus ruptured, causing the fetus to spill out of the uterine cavity and land on the floor between the woman's feet. The umbilical cord was still intact and connected the fetus to the placenta through the ruptured wall of the uterus. Unlike the woman, who suffered fourth-degree burns over her entire body, the body of the fetus was relatively undamaged. Because the primary cause of separation from the mother's body was thermally induced traumatic rupture of the abdominal and uterine cavities; traumatic separation was not related to normal decompositional processes; and expulsion of the fetus did not involve passage through the birth canal, this is not considered a case of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
500|$|The league was {{suspended}} the following {{season as a}} result of the outbreak of the Second World War, and professional play did not resume until the 1946–47 season. [...] City finished this and the following season in 21st place, the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league. The lacklustre performances did not deter the crowds, and, in 1948, Carrow Road attracted its record attendance; 37,863 spectators watched City play Notts County. [...] The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager Norman Low in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the 1956–57 season. Events off the field were to overshadow the team's performances as the club faced financial difficulties severe enough to render them <b>non-viable.</b> With debts amounting to more than £20,000, the club was rescued by the formation of a new Board, chaired by Geoffrey Watling and the creation of an appeal fund chaired by the Lord Mayor of Norwich, Arthur South, which raised more than £20,000. For these and other services to the club, both men (now deceased) were later honoured by having stands named after them at Carrow Road.|$|E
500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a <b>non-viable</b> egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and water exchange for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

[...] Orlowski points out the incoherent and contradictory argument by Greenpeace that nuclear fusion is <b>non-viable</b> but then warns of the dangers that commercial nuclear fusion posed on the environment despite their claims that nuclear fusion is an impractical, technological deadend. [...] Other publications also criticized Greenpeace's stand against genetically modified crops and the unlawful destruction of those crops by its members.|$|E
2500|$|Normal egg cells form after meiosis and are haploid, {{with half}} as many {{chromosomes}} as their mother's body cells. Haploid individuals, however, are usually <b>non-viable,</b> and parthenogenetic offspring usually have the diploid chromosome number. Depending on the mechanism involved in restoring the diploid number of chromosomes, parthenogenetic offspring may have anywhere between all {{and half of the}} mother's alleles. The offspring having all of the mother's genetic material are [...] called [...] full clones and those having only half are called half clones. Full clones are usually formed without meiosis. If meiosis occurs, the offspring will get {{only a fraction of the}} mother's alleles since crossing over of DNA takes place during meiosis, creating variation.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{species with}} the haplo-diploid sex-determination system, such as hymenopterans (ants, bees and wasps) and thysanopterans (thrips), haploid males [...] are {{produced}} from unfertilized eggs. Usually eggs are laid {{only by the}} queen, but the unmated workers may also lay haploid, male eggs either regularly (e.g. stingless bees) or under special circumstances. An example of <b>non-viable</b> parthenogenesis is common among domesticated honey bees. The queen bee is the only fertile female in the hive; if she dies without the possibility for a viable replacement queen, {{it is not uncommon}} for the worker bees to lay eggs. This is a result of the lack of the queen's pheromones and the pheromones secreted by uncapped brood, which normally suppress ovarian development in workers. Worker bees are unable to mate, and the unfertilized eggs produce only drones (males), which can mate only with a queen. Thus, in a relatively short period, all the worker bees die off, and the new drones follow if they have not been able to mate before the collapse of the colony. This behaviour is believed to have evolved to allow a doomed colony to produce drones which may mate with a virgin queen and thus preserve the colony's genetic progeny.|$|E
