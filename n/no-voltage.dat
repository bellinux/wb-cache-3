5000|$|... #Caption: 1917 DC motor manual {{starting}} rheostat with <b>no-voltage</b> and overload release features.|$|E
50|$|The {{possibility}} of accidentally opening the field circuit is quite remote. The four-point starter provides the <b>no-voltage</b> protection to the motor. If the power fails, the motor is {{disconnected from the}} line.|$|E
50|$|This starter {{includes}} a <b>no-voltage</b> magnetic holding feature, which causes the rheostat to spring to the off position if power is lost, {{so that the}} motor does not later attempt to restart in the full-voltage position. It also has overcurrent protection that trips the lever to the off position if excessive current over a set amount is detected.|$|E
50|$|Each {{paralleling}} station bus {{is connected}} to both north and south track catenary and feeder lines via automatic circuit breakers. The autotransformer {{is connected to}} the bus bars by an additional circuit breaker. The track breakers at the paralleling stations trip on sensing <b>no-voltage.</b> Thus when a line fault causes the supplying substation breakers to trip, the paralleling stations also trip. This action separates the two tracks from one another electrically and allows the substation to automatically restore one of the tracks (the non-faulted one). After a variable time delay (to reduce simultaneous inrush current), over-voltage relays will re-shut the track circuit breakers on the non-faulted track.|$|E
5000|$|The Kenwood Major (sometimes {{incorrectly}} {{referred to}} as the [...] "Chef Major"), a larger model of similar general appearance to the Chef models but with a 6-litre bowl of the same diameter but higher than the Chef's 4.6-litre bowl, has also been produced. The Kenwood Major has versions specially made for commercial use which include extra features as required by increased Health and Safety requirements, such as <b>no-voltage</b> dropout 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons in addition to the standard speed control/off dial, and a safety guard above the bowl. There also is a version which has a cook-and-stir function, that is called [...] "Cooking Chef" [...] but has the bowl size of a Major type machine.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept for}} a dual test item has been {{developed}} for use in simulating live initiators/detonators during ground testing to verify the proper operation of the safing and firing circuitry for ground and flight systems ordnance as well as continuous monitoring for any stray voltages. Previous ordnance simulators have consisted of fuses, flash bulbs, inert devices with bridge wires, and actual live ordnance items mounted in test chambers. Stray voltage detectors have included devices connected to the firing circuits for continuous monitoring and a final <b>no-voltage</b> test just prior to ordnance connection. The purpose of this combined ordnance simulation and stray-voltage detection is to provide an improved and comprehensive method to ensure the ordnance circuitry is verified safe and operational...|$|E
