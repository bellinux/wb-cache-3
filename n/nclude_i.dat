As the result of an analysis of utterances made by two Japanese learners who are assessed to be the highest-ranked and the lowest-ranked respectively in “comprehensibility” by eight Japanese native speakers, it has been confirmed that there have been many more corrections and the accompanying pauses in utterances that are difficult to understand. Further, it has been observed that corrections seen in utterances that are difficult to understand include various forms of corrections such as repetitions, paraphrases, and insertions of words.

In this paper, the maximum likelihood method {{is used to}} analyze the performance of the Differential Stress Induced Damage (DSID) model recently formulated by Xu and Arson. The stress/strain relationship is a nonlinear function of parameters <b>ncluding</b> unknown constants (<b>i.</b> e.,damage constitutive parameters) and known variables (e. g., elastic parameters and controlled stress state). Logarithmic transformation, normalization and forward deletion are employed, in order to find the optimum number of constitutive parameters, as a trade off between accuracy and simplicity. For Eastern France claystone subject to deviatoric stress loading (e. g., triaxial and proportional compression loading), it is found that (1) only one damage parameter (a₂) is needed in the expression of the free energy to predict stress/strain curves; (2) a₂ controls the deviation of the current principal directions of stress to the principal directions of damage; (3) model parameters involved in the damage criterion can be related to a₂. As a result, a₂ is the only parameter needed to model differential-stress induced damage in Eastern France claystone. It is also shown that within the set of assumptions made in this study, the DSID model is not sensitive to the initial damage threshold C₀, except for C₀> 10 ⁶ Pa a range of values in which only one constitutive parameter becomes insufficient to predict the stress/strain curves of damaged claystone. Coupling probabilistic calibration and optimization methods to numerical codes promises to allow adapting the complexity of anisotropic damage models to different rocks and stress paths...|$|R

In addition, a new methodology that {{was introduced in the}} preceding edition is being used for the country studies (Parts Two and Three). This methodology is based on national ac counts statistics expressed in the local currency, rather than United States dollars, and uses the base year employed by the relevant country. The chapters on regional issues (Part One) use statistics expressed in dollars and take 1995 as the base year for calculations at constant prices. In order to correct for seasonal variations, the 12 -month rate of inflation has been used, rather than annualized monthly rates, in computing the real interest rates shown in table 2 of the country studies. The modifications that were introduced in 1995 in the Survey's coverage of regional economic conditions have been maintained in this edition. Once again, the Survey has been published in a single volume consisting of three parts. Part One presents an overview of the regional economy in 1999 and the first half of 2000. This summary has also been published as a separate document. The other six chapters in Part One review the region's economic performance in 1999, as well as drawing upon data {{for the first half of}} 2000.

40|$|For {{spacecraft}} departing the Earth - Moon system, lunar flybys {{can significantly}} increase the hype rbolic escape energy (C 3, in km 2 /sec 2) {{for a modest}} increase in flight time. Within ~ 2 months, lunar flybys can produce a C 3 of ~ 2. Over 4 - 6 months, lunar flybys alone can increase the C 3 to ~ 4. 5, or they can provide for additional periapsis burns to increase the C 3 from ~ 2 - 3 to 10 or more, suitable for planetary missions. A lunar flyby departure can be followed by additional -V (such as that efficiently provided by a low thrust system, eg. Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP)) to raise the Earth - relative velocity (at a ratio of more than 2 : 1) before a subsequent Earth flyby, which redirects that velocity to a more di stant target, all within {{not much more than}} a year.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a preliminary investigation involving {{the development of}} a Cross-Border Deforestation Index (CBDI), which is an attempt to quantify the differences in deforestation between two countries or potentially any two administrative units. In this study, the focus was on countries. For each pair of bordering countries, a 50 km buffer zone was drawn and the average value of the Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) was calculated for each country in the pair. The ratio of these two averages is the CBDI. Values of 1 indicate similar levels of forest cover but values greater than 1 point towards dissimilar land use policies within countries and/or sub-national administrative levels. This index was calculated for all pairs of bordering tropical countries in South and Central America, Asia and Africa. In addition, a visual analysis of the spatial variation of the VCF was undertaken to show how this can complement the CBDI. The results showed that countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Laos, Thailand and DR Congo, in combination with different neighbouring countries, all have CBDI values differing from 1. These areas are worth examining in greater detail in order to understand what types of drivers are behind these outlying CBDI values. These drivers could include land use policy, population pressure, accessibility, etc. Future work will <b>i</b> <b>nclude</b> the addition of environmental factors.

40|$|This thesis aIms {{to produce}} a {{distinctive}} model for the sustainable horticultural development of Maori resources, primarily land. It is inclusive of tikanga Maori and indigenous production systems based on the unique body of knowledge aligned to Maori. The integration of this knowledge with western science is both argued and applied through the model itself. The hypothesis applied was that matauranga Maori relevant to horticulture and pedology can inform and add value to the future development of Maori land resources. The thesis is bui lt on {{a unique set of}} contributing knowledge bases aligned to soils and horticultural management supported by three case studies, identified through their common association i. e. whakapapa links. The format of the thesis intentionally follows science principles in structure and presentation and some assumptions are made regarding base knowledge surrounding Maori cultural factors and the science disciplines relative to soils and horticul ture. The indigenous element, including Maori knowledge, is incorporated into the model using a triadic kosmos/corpus/praxis approach. Where kosmos is applied as Te A o Miiori, corpus as miitauranga Miiori and praxis as tikanga Miiori, the relationship between each element is clear and the interpretation of the associated knowledge becomes more apparent and can be applied to cultural assessments of resources, <b>i</b> <b>ncluding</b> land.

The ability to apply a cultural layer drawn from a body of knowledge not previously included in decision models relative to land utility in New Zealand is the key point. of difference of the model.

40|$|Before a solar model becomes viable in astrophysics, one mus t {{consider}} how the ele- mental constitution of the Sun was ascertained, especially relative to its principle com- ponents: hydrogen and helium. Liquid metallic hydrogen has been proposed as a solar structural material for models based on condensed matter (e. g. Robitaille P. -M. Liq- uid Metallic Hydrogen: A Building Block for the Liquid Sun. Progr. Phys., 2011, v. 3, 60 – 74). There {{can be little doubt}} that hydrogen plays a d ominant role in the uni- verse and in the stars; the massive abundance of hydrogen in t he Sun was established long ago. Today, it can be demonstrated that the near isointe nse nature of the Sun’s Balmer lines provides strong confirmatory evidence for a dis tinct solar surface. The situation relative to helium remains less conclusive. Stil l, helium occupies a prominent role in astronomy, both as an element associated with cosmol ogy and as a byproduct of nuclear energy generation, though its abundances within the Sun cannot be reliably estimated using theoretical approaches. With respect to th e determination of helium lev- els, the element remains spectroscopically silent at the le vel of the photosphere. While helium can be monitored with ease in the chromosphere and the prominences of the corona using spectroscopic methods, these measures are hig hly variable and responsive to elevated solar activity and nuclear fragmentation. Dire ct assays of the solar winds are currently viewed as incapable of providing definitive in formation regarding solar helium abundances. As a result, insight relative to helium r emains strictly based on the- oretical estimates which couple helioseismological appro aches to metrics derived from solar models. Despite their “state of the art” nature, heliu m estimates based on solar models and helioseismology are suspect on several fronts, <b>i</b> <b>ncluding</b> their reliance on solar opacities. The best knowledge can only come from the so lar winds which, though highly variable, provide a wealth of data.
