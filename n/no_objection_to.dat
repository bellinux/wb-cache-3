He said that he had initially not been willing to take on the mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|While on the Eastern Front, Model showed <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> the {{treatment}} of civilians by the SS in the areas under his command, and oversaw several anti-partisan operations, mostly while commanding Ninth Army. These operations, conducted by Wehrmacht troops as well as SS, were bloody, although not unusual by German Eastern Front standards. In conjunction with the ruthless scorched earth policies he followed during his retreats, they {{would lead to the}} Soviet Union's declaring him a war criminal.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> Soviet {{involvement}} in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent {{of the government of}} the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E

5|$|Her {{more radical}} {{positions}} included acceptance of interracial marriage. Despite her opposition to giving African American men {{the right to}} vote without enfranchising all women and the derogatory language she had resorted to in expressing this opposition, Stanton had <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> interracial marriage and wrote a congratulatory letter to Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to Helen Pitts, a white woman, in 1884. Anthony, fearing public condemnation of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and wanting to keep the demand for female suffrage foremost, pleaded with Stanton not to make her letter to Douglass or support for his marriage publicly known.|$|E
5|$|Still {{awaiting}} imperial {{permission to}} build in the courtyard, the Perushim wished to rely on an old firman given to the Jews in 1623, which stated {{that there could be}} <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> them building in their own quarters. Having received a supporting document issued by the Qadi of Jerusalem in March 1824, it was possible for them begin rebuilding the dwellings in the courtyard. In practice, however, construction never materialised as they were unable to exercise their authority over the plot of land. This was apparently due to confrontation with the Arab squatters and the local government's disregard of the documents proving their ownership of the courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Scientists came in. Before {{they sat}} down, they stood on chairs {{and closed the}} transoms over the two doors to the rooms.

Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons.

5|$|During the {{following}} four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the Argentine government {{over the future of}} the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who was director of the Argentine Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the Argentine government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House building, its furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological instruments, to the Argentine government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played only a limited role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E

5|$|Bush left Tufts in 1919, {{although}} he remained employed by AMRAD, {{and joined the}} Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT, where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering, an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposal}} {{to revive the}} three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors Brand Whitlock of Toledo, Ohio, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change {{the composition of the}} cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director George E. Roberts testified and indicated he had <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the Senate Banking Committee. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was made fully legal tender by the Coinage Act of 1965, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.|$|E

5|$|The Hollywood Reporter ran {{a front-page}} story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's {{practice}} of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs {{that could be done}} by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve Kane. Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Schenck, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of Louis B. Mayer and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that Kane would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was <b>no</b> <b>objection</b> <b>to</b> its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made. Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.|$|E
