5|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> have a {{very long}} history, {{ammonium}} chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis (strong water), {{as well as other}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts. The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> were limited. Natural sources {{originated}} either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{have evolved}} many {{secondary}} metabolites involved in plant defense, which are collectively known as antiherbivory compounds {{and can be}} classified into three sub-groups: <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates and benzoxazinoids), terpenoids, and phenolics.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of substituted quinolines, pyrroles, indoles, and pyridines on deposit formation in a diesel fuel is evaluated. Significant increases in deposition rate are found which are {{dependent upon the}} basicity of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> within a given compound class. These effects correspond closely with those produced in a Jet A fuel. Removal of highly polar fuel components renders the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> influence inoperative. These components are therefore participants in deposit-forming reactions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays most {{heavy oil}} {{reservoirs}} are developed by thermal recovery methods, such as steam huff- puff and steam flooding. At the late stage of heavy oil steam drive, because of steam overlap {{in the upper}} reservoir formation, steam channeling can easily occur in production well. The {{research has shown that}} development effect of steam- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive is not as good as consideration after steam channeling. But by injecting water slug can decrease the effect of steam channeling. For increasing water phase saturation in high permeability channel, steam and nitrogen gas relative permeability will decrease. As result, it will enlarge the reservoir vertical producing degree, {{and at the same time}} take full advantage of the oil displacement effect of steam- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive. Through the numerical simulation, the study found that, steam- water- <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> drive technology can achieve better recovery degree using high hot water temperature and shorter injection time. Evaluation of Steam- <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>Compound</b> Drive After Steam Channeling in Steam Flooding For heavy oil development, steam flooding has been widely used as an effective thermal recovery method. However, due to the steam overlay effect, the leading edge of the steam chamber can march easily along the top of formation and form dominant flowing paths of steam- wate...|$|R
5|$|The lack of prokaryotic nitrogen-fixing {{bacteria}} limited {{the growth of}} ocean eukaryotes, which require oxidized nitrogen suitable {{for the production of}} organic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> or the organics themselves (like proteins) from prokaryotic bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
50|$|Nitrification is {{a process}} of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> {{oxidation}} (effectively, loss of electrons from the nitrogen atom to the oxygen atoms), and is catalyzed step-wise by a series of enzymes.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of substituted pyridines, pyrroles, indoles, and quinolines on the storage stability of conventional Jet A turbine fuel is evaluated. Significant {{increases in the}} amount of deposit formed in accelerated storage tests are found upon addition of these compounds at levels as low as one ppm nitrogen. While the effect is correlated with basicity of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> within a given compound class, the correlation does not hold between classes (pyridines, quinolines, etc.). Steric hindrance at the nitrogen atom greatly inhibits deposit promotion. The characteristics, but not the elemental composition, of deposits vary with the identity of the added <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> and with deposition temperature...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the work}} by Claude Louis Berthollet {{published}} in 1784, chemists knew ammonia to be a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound.</b> Early attempts to synthesize ammonia were performed in 1795 by Georg Friedrich Hildebrandt. Several others were {{made during the}} nineteenth century.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to bacteria, aquatic plants also eliminate nitrogen waste by metabolizing ammonia and nitrate. When plants metabolize <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds,</b> they remove nitrogen {{from the water}} by using it to build biomass that decays more slowly than ammonia-driven plankton already dissolved in the water.|$|E
25|$|Certain plants, namely Fabaceae, form root nodules {{in order}} to {{associate}} and form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. Due to the high energy required to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, the bacteria take carbon compounds from the plant to fuel the process. In return, the plant takes <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> produced from ammonia by the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, {{very few}} plants {{can use this}} directly. Most plants, therefore, require <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> {{to be present in}} the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a nitrogen fixation process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to harvesting wild oysters, oyster farming {{is a growing}} industry for the Bay to help maintain the estuary's productivity {{as well as a}} natural effort for filtering impurities such as excess nutrients from the water in an effort to reduce the effects of man-made pollution. The Chesapeake Bay Program is using oysters {{to reduce the amount of}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> entering the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{has been}} {{customary}} in electrolytic capacitors to bind the excess hydrogen {{with the help of}} reducing or depolarizing compounds, such as aromatic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> or amines, to relieve the resulting pressure, the researchers then searched for compounds of this type. Although the analysis methods were very sensitive in detecting such pressure-relieving compounds, no traces of such agents were found within the failed capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Hobbyist aquaria {{often do}} not have {{sufficient}} bacteria populations to adequately denitrify waste. This problem is most often addressed through two filtration solutions: Activated carbon filters absorb <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> and other toxins, while biological filters provide a medium designed to enhance bacterial colonization. Activated carbon and other substances, such as ammonia absorbing resins, stop working when their pores fill, so these components {{have to be replaced}} regularly.|$|E

50|$|The <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> sal {{ammoniac}} (ammonium chloride) was known {{since the time}} of the Ancient Egyptians. In the 1760s two scientists, Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley, isolated nitrogen from air, but neither realized the presence of an undiscovered element. It was not until several years later, in 1772, that Daniel Rutherford realized that the gas was indeed nitrogen.|$|R
50|$|Nitrogen-15 (15N) tracing is a {{technique}} to study the nitrogen cycle using the heavier, stable nitrogen isotope 15N. Despite the different weights, 15N {{is involved in the}} same chemical reactions as the more abundant 14N and is therefore used to trace and quantify conversions of one <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> to another. 15N tracing is applied in biogeochemistry, soil science, environmental science and environmental microbiology.|$|R
25|$|Fossil-fuel power stations, {{particularly}} coal-fired plants, are a {{major source}} of industrial wastewater. Many of these plants discharge wastewater with significant levels of metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, as well as arsenic, selenium and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> (nitrates and nitrites). Wastewater streams include flue-gas desulfurization, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. Plants with air pollution controls such as wet scrubbers typically transfer the captured pollutants to the wastewater stream.|$|E
25|$|Launching {{materials}} from Earth is expensive, so bulk materials for colonies {{could come from}} the Moon, a near-Earth object (NEO), Phobos, or Deimos. The benefits of using such sources include: a lower gravitational force, no atmospheric drag on cargo vessels, and no biosphere to damage. Many NEOs contain substantial amounts of metals. Underneath a drier outer crust (much like oil shale), some other NEOs are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons, {{as well as some}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{cause of}} acid rain is sulfur and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> from human sources, such as electricity generation, factories, and motor vehicles. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions {{that are responsible for}} acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.|$|E

30|$|Urea is {{a product}} of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compound</b> {{proteins}} and amino acids and {{plays a key role in}} the urine-concentrating mechanism in mammals (Sands 2002). As a small molecular product of protein metabolism production, urea is easily dissolved in water, which makes it a water-conserving nitrous product excreted in urine (Knepper and Mindell 2009). This may be particularly significant for the marine cetaceans, considering the saline environment they inhabit.|$|R

25|$|Efficiency of pollination: {{the rewards}} given to pollinators (commonly nectar or pollen or both, but {{sometimes}} oil, scents, resins, or wax) may be costly to produce. Nectar can be cheap, but pollen is generally expensive {{as it is}} relatively high in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b> Plants have evolved to obtain the maximum pollen transfer for the minimum reward delivered. Different pollinators, because of their size, shape, or behaviour, have different efficiencies of transfer of pollen. And the floral traits affect efficiency of transfer: columbine flowers were experimentally altered and presented to hawkmoths, and flower orientation, shape, and colour were found to affect visitation rates or pollen removal.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Freeth was in the Territorial Army, having joined in 1912, and spent six weeks in the trenches in France with the Cheshire Regiment as a major in early 1915, but was then sent back to Britain to continue his armaments research at Brunner Mond {{at the direction of}} Lord Moulton. Germany, {{at the start of the}} war, had an advantage over Britain in their ability to manufacture explosives inexpensively: they had pioneered mixing ammonium nitrate and TNT to create amatol, which was similar to pure TNT in effectiveness, and understood the Haber-Bosch process and applied it in plants to produce the necessary <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, the {{assumption}} that C. michiganensis does not overwinter in the soil is not without controversy. The genome of Clavibacter michiganesis has recently been sequenced and new theories will surely arise once more work has been completed. What is known is that Cmm can use hydrolysis products as carbon and energy sources {{by means of a}} number of ABC transporters and α- and β-glucosidases. This suggests that Cmm can survive in the soil {{as long as there is}} decaying host material present. It has also been determined that the genome of subsp. michiganensis does not have genes that encode for nitrate and nitrate reductases. This means that the bacteria depends on previously reduced <b>nitrogen</b> <b>compounds</b> or amino acids for its nitrogen source. Also lacking in the Cmm genome are genes for assimilatory sulfate reduction, which is associated with an auxotrophy for methionine - one of two amino acids that contain sulphur.|$|E

In 1971 C. T. Goetschel {{announced the}} preparation of NF4BF4 and also produced a white solid assumed to be tetrafluoroammonium fluoride (NFF−). This was made by treating nitrogen trifluoride and fluorine with 3MeV electron radiation at 77K. It decomposed above 143K back into those ingredients. Theoretical studies also show the ionic compound is very likely to decompose to nitrogen trifluoride and fluorine gas.|$|R
