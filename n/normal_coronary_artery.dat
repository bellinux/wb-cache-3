Results: We studied 38 consecutive pts with angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> that underwent non-invasive assessement of CFR in the LAD. We found that 9 pts out of 38 (group 1) had slow runoff and the remaining 29 had normal runoff (group 2). The CFR evaluated in the the 2 groups was not significantly different (see graph).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{evaluated}} the magnitude, patterns and clinical correlates of atherosclerosis in angiographically “normal” reference segments in patients undergoing transcatheter therapy for symptomatic coronary artery disease. Background. Pathologic {{studies indicate that}} the extent of coronary atherosclerosis is underestimated by visual analysis of angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> segments. Intravascular ultrasound allows detailed, high quality cross-sectional imaging of the coronary arteries in vivo. Methods. Intravascular ultrasound was used to study angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> reference segments in 884 patients evaluated for transcatheter therapy for symptomatic native coronary artery disease. The reference segment was the most visually normal intravascular ultrasound cross section within 10 mm proximal to the target lesion but distal to any major side branch. Results are presented as mean value ± 1 SD. Results. Only 60 (6. 8 %) of 884 angiographically normal reference segments were normal by intravascular ultrasound. Reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing measured 51 ± 13 % and correlated poorly with the target lesion percent cross-sectional narrowing (r = 0. 166, p < 0. 0001). Reference segments contained less calcific and dense fibrotic plaque and proportionately more soft plaque elements. Independent predictors of reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing were male gender, patient age, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and presence of multivessel disease. Independent predictors of reference segment calcification were patient age and serum creatinine levels. Reference segment percent cross-sectional narrowing in 723 patients undergoing transcatheter therapy {{was similar to that}} in patients studied for diagnostic purposes; however, reference segment arc of calcium was greater in treated patients (43 ± 81 vs. 25 ± 57, p = 0. 015). Reference segment disease was not an independent predictor of subsequent angiographic restenosis or clinical events within 12 months of follow-up. Conclusions. Atherosclerosis is ubiquitous in angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> reference segments. Reference segment disease parallels the severity of target lesion disease and is associated with many of the conventional risk factors for coronary artery disease. Because of its sensitivity in detecting atherosclerosis in angiographically normal reference segments, intravascular ultrasound should enhance the study of risk factors for atherosclerosis and the results of therapies to control disease progression...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We used {{intravascular}} {{ultrasound imaging}} of the epicardial vessels to assess coronary morphology, vasomotor response to exercise and exercise-vasomotion after betaadrenoceptor blockade {{in patients with}} syndrome X. Background. Syndrome X is defined as chest pain, abnormal exercise test results and <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> angiographic findings. Because {{of the limitations of}} coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound was used to define coronary pathophysiology. Methods. Thirty patients with syndrome X were studied with intravascular ultrasound imaging (30 MHz, 4. 3 F catheter) of all three major epicardial vessels. Supine arm exercise was performed during coronary imaging. Lumen area was assessed at rest and during peak exercise. The exercise-imaging protocol was repeated after loading with 0. 1 mg/kg body weight of intravenous propranolol. Results. Three morphologic groups were identified using intravascular ultrasound: <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (no plaque, intimal thickness < 0. 25 mm, n = 12), atheromatous disease (mean [±SD] area stenosis 37. 9 ± 7. 2 %, n = 10) and marked intimal thickening (0. 73 ± 0. 11 mm, n = 8). Patients with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> displayed a vasodilatory response to exercise (+ 16. 9 % area increase); patients with abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> displayed a vasoconstrictive response to exercise (− 17. 4 % in the group with plaque; − 17. 6 % in the group with intimal thickening). Propranolol loading attenuated the vasodilatory response in the group with <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (+ 6. 4 % area increase) and attenuated the vasoconstrictive response in the two groups with abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (− 8. 0 % in the group with plaque; − 8. 8 % in the group with intimal thickening). Conclusions. Most patients with syndrome X have abnormal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> by intravascular ultrasound. Intravascular ultrasound identifies three distinct morphologic groups: <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> atheromatous plaque and intimal thickening. Exercise-vasomotion is normal in patients with syndrome X who have <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> by ultrasound; patients with abnormal arteries (plaque or intimal thickening) have an abnormal (constrictive) response to exercise.

40|$|AbstractThe {{connection}} of the coronary vasculature to the aorta {{is one of}} the last essential steps of cardiac development. However, little is known about the signaling events that promote <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> formation. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway regulates multiple aspects of endothelial cell biology but has not been specifically implicated in coronary vascular development. BMP signaling is tightly regulated by numerous factors, including BMP-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER), which can both promote and repress BMP signaling activity. In the embryonic heart, BMPER expression is limited to the endothelial cells and the endothelial-derived cushions, suggesting that BMPER may play a role in coronary vascular development. Histological analysis of BMPER−/− embryos at early embryonic stages demonstrates that commencement of coronary plexus differentiation is normal and that endothelial apoptosis and cell proliferation are unaffected in BMPER−/− embryos compared with wild-type embryos. However, analysis between embryonic days 15. 5 – 17. 5 reveals that, in BMPER−/− embryos, coronary arteries are either atretic or connected distal to the semilunar valves. In vitro tubulogenesis assays indicate that isolated BMPER−/− endothelial cells have impaired tube formation and migratory ability compared with wild-type endothelial cells, suggesting that these defects may lead to the observed coronary artery anomalies seen in BMPER−/− embryos. Additionally, recombinant BMPER promotes wild-type ventricular endothelial migration in a dose-dependent manner, with a low concentration promoting and high concentrations inhibiting migration. Together, these results indicate that BMPER-regulated BMP signaling is critical for coronary plexus remodeling and <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> development...|$|E

40|$|Coronary spasm is the {{mechanism}} most often postulated {{to explain the}} rare combination of myocardial infarction and angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> although the reported evidence for its role is circumstantial rather than conclusive. Whereas the importance of thrombosis in myocardial infarction is uncontested {{in the presence of}} significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease, there is little in vivo evidence for thrombosis in angiographically <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Among 11 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) 3. 2 ± 0. 7 h after onset of chest pain, and angiography 10. 2 ± 4. 5 days later, three young men had <b>normal</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Their cases are documented electrocadiographically, enzymatically and angiographically. Mean plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A (FPA) and beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) were clearly elevated before and during rtPA therapy: FPA 52 ± 41 ng ml- 1, BTG 257 ± 46 ng ml- 1. They did not differ significantly from corresponding mean plasma levels in the eight patients with severe <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease: FPA 67 ± 66 ng ml- 1, BTG 181 ± 75 ng ml- 1. We conclude that fibrin formation and platelet activation are probably equally important {{in the early hours of}} myocardial infarction, whether or not significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease is presen...|$|R
