40|$|Ambient gas-phase and snow-phase {{measurements}} of formaldehyde (HCHO) were conducted at Summit, Greenland, during several summers, {{in order to}} understand the role of air-snow exchange on remote tropospheric HCHO and factors that determine snowpack HCHO. A gas-phase model was developed that included known chemistry relevant to Summit and was constrained by data from the 1999 and 2000 field campaigns. This gas-phase-only model could not account for the high ambient levels of HCHO observed at Summit in 1999 ($ 600 ppt). Simulations were conducted that included a snowpack flux of HCHO, based on HCHO flux measurements from 2000 and 1996. We conclude that, although the flux of HCHO from the surface likely has a significant impact on atmospheric HCHO above the snowpack, the time-dependent fluxes need to be better understood and quantified. It is also necessary to identify the HCHO precursors so we can better understand condensed phase HCHO chemistry at Summit. ^ Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is a <b>NOx</b> <b>reservoir</b> compound that has the ability to transport NOx to remote environments, allowing for NOx photochemistry and/or deposition of nitrogen to these clean locations. Measurements of PAN have been made at Alert, Nunavut and Summit, Greenland aimed at understanding the impact of PAN chemistry on atmospheric nitrogen in the Arctic. These measurements show concentrations of PAN that are only slowly varying, even during ozone depletion events at polar sunrise, when free radical photochemistry is relatively active. We used a zero-dimensional photochemical model incorporating known gas phase chemistry to simulate the observed behavior of PAN at Alert, Nunavut and Summit, Greenland. The model simulations suggest a substantial net production rate for PAN over sunlit surfaces, which is inconsistent with the measured gas phase concentrations. These observations allow us to explore the possibility that we are missing an important sink for atmospheric PAN above snow-covered surfaces. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{observations}} {{collected during}} the BOReal forest fires on Tropospheric oxidants over the Atlantic using Aircraft and Satellites (BORTAS) campaign in summer 2011 over Canada are analysed to study the impact of forest fire emissions on the formation of ozone (O 3 and total peroxy nitrates (sigma) PNs, (sigma) ROONO 2. The suite of measurements on board the BAe- 146 aircraft, deployed in this campaign, allows us to calculate the production of O 3 and of (sigma) PNs, a long-lived <b>NOx</b> <b>reservoir</b> whose concentration {{is supposed to be}} impacted by biomass burning emissions. In fire plumes, profiles of carbon monoxide (CO), which is a well-established tracer of pyrogenic emission, show concentration enhancements that are in strong correspondence with a significant increase of concentrations of (sigma) PNs, where as minimal increase of the concentrations of O 3 and NO 2 is observed. The (sigma) PN and O 3 productions have been calculated using the rate constants of the first- and second-order react Pions of volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation. The (sigma) PN and O 3 productions have also been quantified by 0 -D model simulation based on the Master Chemical Mechanism. Both methods show that in fire plumes the average production of (sigma) PNs and O 3 are greater than in the background plumes, but the increase of (sigma) PN production is more pronounced than the O 3 production. The average (sigma) PN production in fire plumes is from 7 to 12 times greater than in the background, whereas the average O 3 production in fire plumes is from 2 to 5 times greater than in the background. These results suggest that, at least for boreal forest fires and for the measurements recorded during the BORTAS campaign,fire emissions impact both the oxidized NOy and O 3;but (1) (sigma) PN production is amplified significantly more thanO 3 production and (2) in the forest fire plumes the ratio between the O 3 production and the (sigma) PN production is lower than the ratio evaluated in the background air masses, thus confirming that the role played by the (sigma) PNs produced during biomass burning is significant in the O 3 budget. The implication of these observations is that fire emissions in some cases, for example boreal forest fires and in the conditions reported here, may influence more long-lived precursors of O 3 than short-lived pollutants, which in turn can be transported and eventually diluted in a wide area...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 NO and NO 2 (NOx) are {{fundamentally}} important species to tropospheric chemistry. NOx abundances {{are tied to}} ozone production and thus determine the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. Nocturnal reactions of NOx are often considered a major loss pathway for NOx and ozone. Recent measurements have shown that nitryl chloride (ClNO 2) is produced at night by reactions of dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) on chloride containing particles. ClNO 2 is photolyzed during the morning hours after sunrise to liberate highly reactive chlorine atoms. This chemistry takes place primarily in polluted environments where the concentrations of N 2 O 5 precursors, NOx, and ozone, are high, though it can likely occur in remote regions at lower intensities. The following describes estimates and ambient measurements of the reactive processes central to ClNO 2 formation and field measurements illustrating the potential importance of ClNO 2 as a <b>NOx</b> <b>reservoir</b> and as a chlorine atom source. The nocturnal reactions of N 2 O 5 to form ClNO 2 were traditionally thought of as marine phenomena given the more obvious source of particle-phase chloride offered by sea spray emissions. However, long term chemical measurement databases and aerosol thermodynamic models are employed to show that this chemistry is likely widespread as is suggested by recent field measurements of ClNO 2 in Boulder, CO, a site far removed from local sea salt aerosol sources. Direct measurements of N 2 O 5 reaction probability on ambient aerosol particles were made in La Jolla, CA, using a custom flow reactor alongside measurements of aerosol particle size distributions and non-refractory composition. The largest apparent driver of day-to-day variability in the measured reaction probabilities at this site was the particle nitrate loading. The relative change {{as a function of}} particle nitrate illustrates the atmospheric importance of the so-called "nitrate effect" on N 2 O 5 heterogeneous reactions that lead to the formation of ClNO 2. The magnitude and sources of chlorine atoms in marine air remain highly uncertain but have potentially important consequences for air quality in polluted coastal regions. Continuous measurements of ambient nitryl chloride and molecular chlorine concentrations were made in southern California. In the Los Angeles region, ClNO 2 was more ubiquitous than Cl 2 during most nights of the study period. These observations are used to estimate the relative importance of chlorine atom sources in the polluted marine boundary layer. In contrast to the emphasis in previous studies, ClNO 2 and hydrochloric acid are likely the dominant primary chlorine atom sources for the Los Angeles basin. As part of a wintertime field study in Weld County, CO, vertically resolved ClNO 2 and Cl 2 measurements taken on a 300 meter tall tower are reported. Gas and particle phase measurements aboard a moveable tower carriage allowed for {{a detailed description of the}} chemical state of the nocturnal atmosphere as a function of height. These observations show significant vertical structure in ClNO 2 and Cl 2 mixing ratios that undergo dynamic changes over the course of a night. From these measurements ClNO 2 yields from N 2 O 5 -aerosol reactions are inferred. The derived yields in these plumes suggest efficient ClNO 2 production within distinct combustion plumes originating from the Denver-Boulder urban corridor. Finally, the effects of ClNO 2 production, photolysis, and subsequent chlorine atom reactions on chemical species relevant to air quality are examined. ClNO 2 formation is incorporated into an existing Master Chemical Mechanism box model framework constrained by a large number of measurements taken during field studies in a polluted coastal environment. These results are compared to model runs excluding ClNO 2 formation to assess the effects of ClNO 2 on tropospheric oxidants, ozone, and nitrogen oxide partitioning...|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} {{properties of the}} atmosphere at 0 – 8 km were measured during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiments from February to May 2000 at mid (40 °– 60 °N) and high latitudes (60 °– 80 °N). The observations were analyzed using a diel steady state box model to examine HOx and O 3 photochemistry during the spring transition period. The radical chemistry is driven primarily by photolysis of O 3 and the subsequent reaction of O(1 D) and H 2 O, the rate of which increases rapidly during spring. Unlike in other tropospheric experiments, observed H 2 O 2 concentrations are a factor of 2 – 10 lower than those simulated by the model. The required scavenging timescale to reconcile the model overestimates shows a rapid seasonal decrease down to 0. 5 – 1 day in May, which cannot be explained by known mechanisms. This loss of H 2 O 2 implies a large loss of HOx resulting in decreases in O 3 production (10 – 20 %) and OH concentrations (20 – 30 %). Photolysis of CH 2 O, either transported into the region or produced by unknown chemical pathways, appears to provide a significant HOx source at 6 – 8 km at high latitudes. The rapid increase of in situ O 3 production in spring is fueled by concurrent increases of the primary HOx production and NO concentrations. Long-lived reactive nitrogen species continue to accumulate at mid and high latitudes in spring. There is {{a net loss of}} NOx to HNO 3 and PAN throughout the spring, suggesting that these long-term <b>NOx</b> <b>reservoirs</b> do not provide a net source for NOx in the region. In situ O 3 chemical loss is dominated by the reaction of O 3 and HO 2, and not that of O(1 D) and H 2 O. At midlatitudes, there is net in situ chemical production of O 3 from February to May. The lower free troposphere (1 – 4 km) is a region of significant net O 3 production. The net production peaks in April coinciding with the observed peak of column O 3 (0 – 8 km). The net in situ O 3 production at midlatitudes can explain much of the observed column O 3 increase, although it alone cannot explain the observed April maximum. In contrast, there is a net in situ O 3 loss from February to April at high latitudes. Only in May is the in situ O 3 production larger than loss. The observed continuous increase of column O 3 at high latitudes throughout the spring is due to transport from other tropospheric regions or the stratosphere not in situ photochemistry...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we investigate}} different factors controlling summertime surface ozone (O 3) {{in the western}} U. S., including the impacts from increased wildre emissions, the modulation by North American summer monsoon as well as long-range transport of O 3 and its precursors from outside of North America. We first analyze the surface ozone observations from the Clean Air Status and Trend Network (CASTNet) using a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to investigate the impact of biomass burning on surface O 3 in the western U. S. (WUS) mountain ranges during the June-October fire season of 2007, one of the stronger fire years in the WUS in the past decade. GEOS-Chem O 3 captures the observed seasonal, synoptic and daily variations. Model daily afternoon average surface O 3 concentrations at the CASTNet sites are within 2 ppb of the observations, with correlation coefficients of 0. 51 - 0. 83 and Taylor scores of 0. 64 - 0. 92. Observed maximum daily 8 -hour (MAD 8) surface O 3 concentrations are 37 - 58 ppb at the sites, while the corresponding model results are higher by 6 ppb on average. Model results show July-September maximum surface O 3 enhancement of ~ 9 ppb on average because of biomass burning. Peaks in fire-contributed surface O 3 correspond broadly {{with high levels of}} potassium (K), reaffirming a strong fire influence. We find a policy relevant background (PRB) O 3 of 45. 6 ppb on average during July-September. Fire-contributed O 3 accounts for up to 30 % of the PRB O 3, highest in the intense fire region (Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming) with maxima in August and September. We also examine an unexpected summertime surface O 3 minimum (30 – 45 ppb) in July–August 2007 observed throughout the Southwestern U. S. (SWUS) by interpreting observations of O 3 and rainfall from the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) with a global chemical transport model. The O 3 minimum reflects competing chemical and dynamic factors as well as anthropogenic and natural influences. Its reoccurrence annually in 2000 – 11 corresponds to the seasonal rainfall maximum during the North American summer monsoon (NASM) (negative O 3 and positive rainfall anomalies at the CASTNet sites, r = - 0. 5 to - 0. 7, p < 0. 05). Relative to June 15 –July 15, 2007 (pre-onset of the NASM), increased cloudiness in July 15 –August 15 (post-onset) weakens photochemistry, reduces O 3 production from anthropogenic emissions, thereby depresses O 3 throughout the lower troposphere and at the surface (- 5 ppb at Chiricahua, AZ and - 3 ppb on average across the SWUS). The resulting changes are largest at rainfall maxima, particularly in the core of the Great Plains low-level jet. Enhanced lightning NOx emissions post-onset augments O 3 production in the middle troposphere followed by downward mixing in convective downdrafts, thereby increases O 3 significantly throughout the tropospheric column and non-negligibly at the surface (+ 2 ppb at Chiricahua and + 1 ppb averaged over the SWUS). The resulting O 3 changes is largest (+ 8 ppb) in the middle troposphere in the anti-cyclonic circulation associated with the reoccurring summertime high over the Southern U. S. Weaker photochemistry post-onset dominates the overall O 3 change near the surface, while enhanced lightning dominates in much of the free troposphere. Additionally, we find that transport leads to a net export of O 3 throughout the tropospheric column and the influence from stratospheric intrusion is vanishingly small. These competing effects suppress O 3 in the lower troposphere (O 3 change up to - 5 ppb) while enhance O 3 at higher altitudes (O 3 change up to + 7 ppb) across the SWUS during the monsoon. Better understanding of these effects is critical to estimate present and predict future background O 3 in the U. S. Southwest as the NASM changes under a changing climate. Lastly we use the GEOS-Chem 3 -D global tropospheric chemical transport model and its adjoint to quantify the source contributions to O 3 pollution observed at Mt. bachelor Observatory (MBO) during the summer of 2008. The adjoint computes the sensitivity of O 3 concentration at the receptor site to O 3 production rates at 2 ?x 2. 5 ? resolution over the history of air parcels reaching the site. We found that MBO experienced distinct O 3 pollution episodes from Siberia wildfire emissions. During the O 3 pollution episode from June 30 th to July 4 th in year 2008, 7. 5 ppb of MBO O 3 is produced over Siberia, comparable to the amount of O 3 (8 ppb) produced over North America. A significant amount of O 3 (18 ppb) production took place over the North pacific, with maxima just off the west coast of the U. S. where subsidence of air masses causes decomposition of PAN (peroxyacetylnitrate, a thermo-unstable <b>NOx</b> <b>reservoir</b> species) and drives further ozone production. We also used the adjoint of GEOS-Chem to show the model O 3 at MBO is largely sensitive to NOx emissions from biomass burning sources in Siberia and northern California, lightning sources over southwestern U. S. and Mexico, and anthropogenic sources in western U. S. and eastern Asia. For the CO emissions, the largest O 3 sensitivity is to the biomass burning sources in northern California and Siberia. The peak sensitivity to biomass burning CO emissions is comparable to the peak O 3 sensitivity to anthropogenic NOx emissions...|$|E
