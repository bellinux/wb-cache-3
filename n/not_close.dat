5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did <b>not</b> <b>close</b> until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} years, Bonds batted as the leadoff hitter. With Van Slyke {{also in the}} outfield, the Pirates had a venerable {{defensive}} tandem that worked together to cover {{a lot of ground}} on the field although they were <b>not</b> <b>close</b> off the field. The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25home runs in his second season, along with 32stolen bases and 59RBIs.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did <b>not</b> <b>close</b> off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last days of the war, when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire. The two battleships and the ancient central battery ironclad —which had {{been built in the}} mid-1870s—had been on a summer training cruise since July, and so were prepared for the conflict. On 1 October, shortly after the outbreak of war, Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest of the}} Ottoman fleet was moored at Beirut. The following day, the fleet departed for Constantinople for repairs in preparation to engage the Italian fleet. Nevertheless, the bulk of the Ottoman fleet, including Barbaros Hayreddin, remained in port for the duration of the war. By the end of the war, Barbaros Hayreddin and her sister were in very poor condition. Their rangefinders and the ammunition hoists for their main battery guns had been removed, their telephones did not work, and the pipes for their pumps were badly rusted. Most of the watertight doors could <b>not</b> <b>close,</b> and the condensers remained problematic.|$|E

5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do <b>not</b> <b>close</b> to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E
5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth {{in a close}} {{companionship}} marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably never saw her children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was <b>not</b> <b>close,</b> however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do <b>not</b> <b>close</b> up.|$|E

He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was <b>not</b> <b>close</b> to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors suggesting that it will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is <b>not</b> <b>close</b> enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Firing began {{early on}} the morning of June 5. The Indians did <b>not</b> <b>close,</b> but {{remained}} at a distance of two or three hundred yards. Such long range firing with smooth bore muskets caused little loss to either side. The Americans thought that the Indians held back because they had suffered heavy losses on the previous day. In fact, the Indians were buying time, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Crawford decided to hold his position in the trees and make a surprise attack on the Indians after nightfall. At this point, he was still confident of success, although his men were low on ammunition and water. Simon Girty, the British agent and interpreter, rode up with a white flag and called for the Americans to surrender, which was refused.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but <b>not</b> <b>close</b> terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} {{gradually}} close the tramway. New trams had been delivered in 1958, {{and it was}} decided that lines would only be closed as trams were naturally retired. At the time Oslo Sporveier had 421 vehicles. By 1974, the company had 163 vehicles, of which 100 were powered trams, 43 were trailers and 20 were working trailers. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the political climate changed, and in 1977 the city council decided to <b>not</b> <b>close</b> the tramway anyway. Between 1978 and 1981, ten tram vehicles were bought from the Gothenburg Tramway.|$|E

Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July. Opened to divers in 1996, The Times has named Nagato {{as one of the top}} 10 wreck diving sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{necessary}} certificates {{were granted}} on 10 April, {{and the first}} trial run was made the following day. Ordinary service started on 25 April, though without the dining car. The initial price was NOK 422, and travel time was 5 hours 45 minutes. The trains have four cars, of which three are regular open seating, and one is a dining car. From 15 June, full service was introduced. The company stated that the service {{was meant to be}} more luxurious than with SJ, including wider seating (three instead of four abreast) and a wooden interior. The company markets the service as all first-class seating. The trains also had Wi-Fi. After the full service was introduced, the price increased to NOK 593. By July, Ofotbanen had still not found a locomotive for the second train, and was still operating only a single round service. Passenger numbers were at 35 per departure, <b>not</b> <b>close</b> to the capacity of 84, or the necessary annual 100,000 needed to make a profit.|$|E

Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked, but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted Richard Cole as a roadie.|$|E
