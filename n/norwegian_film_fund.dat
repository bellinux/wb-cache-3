5000|$|The Norwegian Film Institute (Norsk filminstitutt) {{was founded}} in 1955 to support and develop the Norwegian film industry.

40|$|Sørfond - the <b>Norwegian</b> South <b>Film</b> <b>Fund</b> - is a <b>film</b> <b>fund</b> whose {{goal is to}} {{strengthen}} film production in developing countries. This evaluation report shows that although Sørfond is still a young fund that so far has supported {{a small number of}} film productions, it has already contributed to elevating several filmmakers from developing countries and strengthening the filmmaking communities surrounding them. The evaluation also shows that Sørfond facilitates increased cooperation between filmmaking communities in developing countries and in Norway. In the ever more globalised film industry, Sørfond represents a small, but efficient stimulant for elevating filmmakers from developing countries onto the international film scene...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{production}} {{was supported by}} the French TV channel Arte, the World Cinema Support (Aide aux cinémas du monde), SØRFOND (<b>Norwegian</b> South <b>Film</b> <b>Fund),</b> the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the European Union. The EU ACPCultures+ Programme awarded a grant in 2012 for the film project whose goal was described in the proposal as [...] "to reinforce the Haitian film industry, notably in terms of their technical skills, and to reach a wider, international audience". The applicant was Peck's French production company Velvet Film partnering with Figuier Productions from Haiti and Producciones Testimonio from the Dominican Republic. The film, produced by Peck's own production company, is with less than one million dollar costs considered 'low budget' compared to international standards, although Peck paid the production team, people who worked with him already on his previous films, at a [...] "very high level". The relative low funding also allowed Peck [...] "to work freely without having to answer to anyone".|$|R
50|$|Fante-Anne is {{considered}} to {{mark the beginning of}} the national breakthrough in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>film</b> culture. This was the first <b>Norwegian</b> <b>film</b> to feature professional actors. Unlike previous films made in Norway, Fante-Anne was also made with professionals working at all levels behind the camera. It is also noteworthy {{as one of the few}} <b>Norwegian</b> <b>films</b> from this period with Norwegians participating at all levels because <b>Norwegian</b> <b>films</b> were often created by Swedes, Danes, and Germans. Fante-Anne is therefore regarded as the first professional <b>Norwegian</b> feature <b>film.</b>|$|R

To produce a realistic effect, parts of Oslo were transformed into an early - 1940s look, a process that included flying the flag of Nazi Germany {{from the roof of}} the parliament building, {{for the first time in}} over 60 years. Some large sets from Stockholm, Sweden, are sequences from the Swedish film 1939.|$|E
