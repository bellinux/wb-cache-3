In his early years as a faculty member, Ijaz devoted much of his time to his teaching responsibilities, including acting as adviser to the university's roster of graduate students and doctoral candidates. He conducted his early research at the Physics department's newly installed nuclear reactor, which at the time was equipped with a <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> laboratory.

The determination of the concentration and pattern of distribution {{of some of these}} elements is essential for economic aspects. This study reports the analysis of vanadium in selected phosphate rock samples from the basin using accelerator-based thermal <b>neutrons</b> <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> (TNAA). Samples were irradiated in a thermal neutron flux of 2. 5 (.) 10 (6) n-cm(- 2.) s(- 1). The induced activity was measured with a HP-GMX detector coupled to a PC-based data acquisition and analysis system. The facility was calibrated using certified standards of vanadium. The minimum detection limit of vanadium was about 1 mg. Three independent measurements on each sample yielded comparable results indicating the reliability of the technique. The vanadium concentrations in the samples vary from 23 to 457 ppm...|$|R

To determine the essential elemental composition of soils obtained from Savannah and Rainforest parts of Nigeria, thermal <b>neutrons</b> <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> technique (TNAA) was used and the outer irradiation channel of Nigeria Research Reactor- 1 (NIRR- 1).

Group I elements identified as nutritionally-essential macronutrients to plants includes; Mg, K, Ca Na, Mn, and V. Group II elements identified to be non metabolic nutrients to plant includes Al Ti and Dy. However, Mg, K, Ca were present in large concentration and Na, Mn, V present in minor concentration in all the samples. Also, Al and Ti were present in minor concentration and Dy present in relatively low concentration in all the samples...|$|R
5|$|Californium-252 has {{a number}} of {{specialized}} applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a neutron startup source for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for <b>neutron</b> <b>activation</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the Georgia Institute of Technology received a loan of 119Âµg of californium-252 from the Savannah River Plant. It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.|$|E

The conventional proton incorporation model of perovskites in which oxygen ion vacancies, generated by the introduction of the trivalent dopant onto the tetravalent perovskite site, are filled with hydroxyl groups upon exposure of the sample to H 2 O containing atmospheres, predicts that the proton concentration in such materials should be no greater than the dopant concentration. In contradiction to this model, the proton concentration in BaPr 1 âxYxO 3 after humidification is as much as three times greater than the dopant concentration, and even undoped samples contain a high concentration of protons. Moreover, x-ray photoemission spectra suggest that the Pr oxidation state is lowered upon hydration. In contrast, BaCe 0. 9 Y 0. 1 O 3 shows a typical hydrogen concentration, of close to 90 % of the yttrium concentration. The results are interpreted in terms of the variable valence of Pr, which can become reduced from the 4 + to the 3 + oxidation state upon exposure to water, and effectively behaves as a self-dopant within the structure.
