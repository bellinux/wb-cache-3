5|$|New York State Route61 (NY61) is a {{state highway}} located almost entirely {{in the city of}} <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> in Niagara County, New York, in the United States. The road runs across the city in a northwest–southeast direction, {{terminating}} at NY384 at its southern extent and NY104 at its northern tip. Conceptually, the road, known as Hyde Park Boulevard, forms the eastern border of downtown <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> It is the second-shortest two-digit route in New York after NY71 in Columbia County. The NY61 designation was in 1958 after being approved by the <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> City Council.|$|E
5|$|Pugliese met Chiara Vaccaro in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> and {{the couple}} married in 1968. They had a {{daughter}} named Ida in 1976. He operated the Niagara Family Inn and Big Anthony's Restaurant in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> with his family until he died from a major aneurysm on August 19, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Mile Strip Expressway {{was to be}} part of the Belt Expressway, {{an outer}} loop {{connecting}} Buffalo and <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> This plan was ultimately cancelled. The only two portions of the loop that were constructed are the LaSalle Expressway east of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and the mile-long Mile Strip Expressway.|$|E
5|$|When NY324 was {{assigned}} , it began at NY384 (River Road; now NY266) {{in the town}} of Tonawanda and followed Sheridan Drive eastward to NY5 {{in the town of}} Clarence. By 1935, what is now NY324 between <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and Tonawanda via Grand Island was designated as NY325. NY324 was extended northward to NY384 in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> , supplanting the entirety of NY325. The NY325 designation was reassigned to the short piece of Sheridan Drive not designated as NY324. The route was extended one final time by 1948 to follow NY384 westward from the North Grand Island Bridge into downtown <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} of Tesla {{standing on}} a portion of an alternator was established at Queen Victoria Park in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> Ontario, Canada. The monument was officially unveiled on 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla's birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church, <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> and designed by Les Drysdale of Hamilton, Ontario. Drysdale's design was the winning design from an international competition.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route18, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} {{ran from the}} Pennsylvania state line at Ripley {{to the mouth of}} the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city of Buffalo. North of Buffalo, Route18 followed <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Boulevard (modern NY950K and U.S. Route62 or US62) to <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and current NY104 and NY18F between <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and Lake Ontario. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY34, which began at Main Street (NY5) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route18 through <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US219, NY417, NY353 and US62. In Cattaraugus County, NY18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September 1918, Styer married Dorothea Haeberle, the {{daughter}} of George C. Haeberle, a prominent businessman from <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> New York, in a ceremony at <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> They had a son, George Delp Styer, who graduated from Norwich University in 1942, and became an Army officer. In March 1919, Styer became {{a student at the}} U.S. Army Engineer School at Fort Humphreys in Virginia. He reverted to the rank of captain on 16 February 1920.|$|E
5|$|At , Highway420 is the {{shortest}} 400-series highway, travelling through <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> from Montrose Road to Stanley Avenue, {{on the outskirts of}} the city's tourist district. East of StanleyAvenue (Regional Road102) the highway becomes Niagara Regional Road420 and is known as Falls Avenue and Newman Hill on approach to the Rainbow Bridge. This portion was designated a part of Highway420 until 2000, when it was transferred to the City of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of it under a Connecting Link agreement.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{ceremony}} only designated the highway between St. Catharines and <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> The {{remainder of the}} road was known by various names, including the Toronto–Burlington/Hamilton Highway and The New Middle Road Highway.|$|E
5|$|NY61 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY384 (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial {{banks of the}} Niagara River in eastern <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> The route, named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length, heads north initially as a city-maintained, undivided four-lane highway; after two blocks, the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a small stream leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY61 intersects with Ferry Avenue, a one-way street carrying southbound U.S. Route62 (US62), {{in the area of}} the <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Courthouse. NY61 intersects with northbound US62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue. At the intersection, Gill Creek passes under both US62 northbound and NY61 as it switches to the east side of Hyde Park Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Pugliese {{promoted}} wrestling {{shows in}} <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> after {{retiring from the}} sport. He also ran an annual wrestling show at the CHIN Picnic in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Central Depot {{was widely}} {{known for the}} gardens which {{surrounded}} it. The longtime gardener, John Laidlaw, built enormous arrangements that evoked <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> the battleship Maine, and well-known landscapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II in September1939 temporarily halted McQuesten's ambitions, as funding was quickly {{shifted to the}} war effort. As a result, construction on the new superhighway was put on hold south of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy's Lane. Despite the war, work began on {{a link between the}} highway and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> This link would not be completed in time for the opening of the new bridge.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Welland River, the original {{route of the}} Welland Canal, the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, Highway420 meets the QEW at a large stack interchange, which replaced the former Lundy's Lane / Highway20 interchange. Exiting the northern fringe of the city, the freeway curves northwest and begins to descend through the Niagara Escarpment, a World Biosphere Reserve. Highway405, {{also known as the}} General Brock Parkway, merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access, Niagara-bound drivers can follow Highway405 to Lewiston, New York. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{association}} with the number 420 in cannabis culture, Highway 420 is also the location for the annual Cannabis Conference and Protest, usually taking place sometime around April20. The event includes a march beginning near <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and travelling to Highway 420.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Du Bois {{and several}} other African-American civil rights activists– {{including}} Fredrick L. McGhee, Jesse Max Barber and William Monroe Trotter– met in Canada, near <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> There they wrote a declaration of principles opposing the Atlanta Compromise, and incorporated as the Niagara Movement in 1906.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1977, the City of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> assumed River Road between Hiram Street, {{north of}} the Rainbow Bridge, and Glenview Avenue, east of Victoria Avenue. This section is still {{designated}} {{as part of the}} Niagara Parkway despite not being {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Niagara Parks Commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY429 north of Sanborn was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route30 entered Sanborn from the west on what is now NY31 and followed current NY429 north to Ridge Road, where it turned east toward Rochester. All of legislative Route30 west of Rochester became part of NY31 in the mid-1920s, while the remainder {{of what is now}} NY429 outside of North Tonawanda was taken over by the state of New York by 1926. In the late 1920s, NY31 was realigned between <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and the Lewiston–Cambria town line to follow Ridge Road west to the village of Lewiston. Its former routing to <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> via Sanborn became NY31A.|$|E
5|$|The route {{falls under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the Niagara Parks Commission, an agency of the Government of Ontario, for most of its length. However, the section from Hiram Street to Glenview Avenue belongs to the City of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{had been}} allied with NY City {{developer}} Howard Milstein. In 2010 Thompson {{arranged for a}} $400,000 grant from NY State's Economic Development Program for the Manhattan billionaire's <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Redevelopment company to demolish properties in NiagaraFalls, NY.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Tesla was established at <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> New York. This monument portraying Tesla reading {{a set of}} notes was sculpted by Frano Kršinić. It {{was presented to the}} United States by Yugoslavia in 1976 and is an identical copy of the monument {{standing in front of the}} University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route {{extending from}} <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> Niagara County {{in the southwest}} to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the northeast. From Rochester to Red Creek, Route30 was assigned to Ridge Road. Between Red Creek and the hamlet of Union Square (now Maple View) {{in the town of}} Mexico, it included most of modern NY104. At the same time, the roadway alongside the Niagara River between Ridge Road in Lewiston and Pine Avenue in downtown <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> was designated, but not signed, as part of Route18. By 1914, Route30 was amended to also include the section of Ridge Road from Porter (modern NY429) to Ridgeway (NY63). In 1914, another section—from Ridgeway to the Orleans–Monroe county line—was also included in Route30's definition as a spur route. The spur route became part of Route30 on March 1, 1921, when the mainline route was realigned to follow Ridge Road between Ridgeway and Rochester.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, NY31 was rerouted west {{of what is}} now NY429 to follow Ridge Road to Lewiston, where it ended at then-NY34. The former routing of NY31 into {{downtown}} <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> was redesignated as NY31A. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY31 was realigned east of Oneida Valley to continue east to Utica by way of its modern alignment plus Spring and Lowell Roads and several city streets. At the same time, NY3 was realigned to continue west to <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> over modern NY31, overlapping NY31A west of Sanborn. Two other portions of NY3—from the modern junction of NY31 and NY77 east of Lockport to Gasport and between Middleport and Medina—were also realigned at this time to use modern NY31 and the old routing of legislative Route30 Spur along modern NY31E, respectively.|$|E
5|$|North of Ontario Avenue, the {{buildings}} surrounding NY61 become more {{commercial and industrial}} in nature as the route approaches the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard. It crosses over {{the western end of}} the yard before intersecting Lockport Road. The <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Amtrak station, which Hyde Park Boulevard passes by but provides no access to, is located just off Lockport Road on 27th Street.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully {{petitioned the}} {{government}} {{for some kind of}} acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the Prince of Wales heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> he learned of Laura Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of £100. It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.|$|E
5|$|The Niagara Parkway {{begins at}} Fort Erie in the south. It passes through several villages {{along the river}} before passing through the tourist {{district}} of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> North of the city it provides access to several attractions, including the Whirlpool Rapids, Butterfly Conservatory, and Brock's Monument at Queenston Heights. The route ends at Fort George, southeast of the urban centre of Niagara-on-the-Lake.|$|E
5|$|The {{athlete is}} a 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games ambassador, and has given presentations at schools. Mortimer {{receives}} honorariums for these appearances, and hoped to earn $3,000 in speaking fees in 2012. She appeared on CBC's Play On! Street Hockey Championship in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> assisted with the post-position draw at the Pattison Canadian International Championship Stakes, and {{has appeared in}} publicity photo shoots.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} appointed Galen Clark as the grant's first guardian, {{but neither}} Clark nor the commissioners {{had the authority}} to evict homesteaders. Josiah Whitney, the first director of the California Geological Survey, lamented that Yosemite Valley would meet the same fate as <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> which at that time was a tourist trap with tolls on every bridge, path, trail, and viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. At this time, all of legislative Route20 west of Rochester became part of NY3, a cross-state route that began in North Tonawanda and ended in Plattsburgh. By 1926, NY31 was assigned to an alignment extending from <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> to Oneida. The route began at NY34 (now NY104) in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and followed College Avenue east to the city line, from where it continued eastward to Rochester on the alignment of legislative Route30. Within the city of Rochester, NY31 continued east on Ridge Road to Lake Avenue, where it turned south to enter downtown Rochester, becoming State Street at Lyell Avenue. At East Main Street, NY31 resumed its eastward alignment, crossing the Genesee River and continuing on Main Street to Monroe Avenue, which, at the time, connected directly with Main Street. NY31 turned right on Monroe Avenue, rejoining its present alignment of NY31 near Union Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} modern I-190 south of NY384 in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> was {{originally}} {{built by the}} New York State Thruway Authority {{as part of the}} New York State Thruway system. Construction on two segments of the highway—from South Ogden Street to Porter Avenue in downtown Buffalo and from Beaver Island Parkway to West River Road on Grand Island—began in 1953.|$|E
5|$|A day later, {{the owners}} of the {{previous}} bridge — the International Railway Company (IRC) — as well as the Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership of border crossings. In the end, the <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|According to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), NY324 {{begins at}} NY384 in eastern <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls.</b> NY324 heads south, {{overlapping}} with I-190 (the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) across the North Grand Island Bridge to Grand Island, where {{it leaves the}} expressway at exit20. However, as signed, NY324 begins {{at the north end}} of Grand Island, where it splits off from the Interstate Highway as Grand Island Boulevard. South of exit20, the official and signed routings are identical.|$|E
5|$|Antoine Maurice Thompson (born March 1, 1970) was a Democratic New York State Senator who {{represented}} the state's 60th Senate district, which includes parts of Buffalo and Tonawanda, the City of <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> and the Town of Grand Island. Thompson previously served for six years as the Masten District councilman in the Buffalo Common Council. Thompson has been a lifelong Buffalonian and held political and politically related professional positions in Buffalo before his service in elective politics.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls</b> Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the <b>Niagara</b> <b>Falls,</b> based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E
