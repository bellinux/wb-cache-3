25|$|In this manner, {{liability}} for past losses could be transferred {{year after year}} until it reached the current syndicate. A member joining a syndicate {{with a long history}} of such transactions could – and often did – pick up {{liability for}} losses on policies written decades previously. As long as the reserves had been accurately estimated, and the appropriate RITC premium paid every year, then all would have been well, but in many cases this had not been possible. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> predicted the surge in APH losses. Therefore, the amounts of money transferred from earlier years by successive RITC premiums to cover these losses were insufficient, and the current members had to pay the shortfall.|$|E
25|$|The {{present form}} of the Maggid Meisharim shows plainly that it was never {{intended}} for publication, being merely a collection of stray notes; nor does Karo's son Judah mention the book among his father's works (Introduction to the Responsa). It is known, on the other hand, that during Karo's lifetime the kabalists believed his Maggid to be actually existent (compare Vital-Calabrese, Sefer ha-Gilgulim, pp.119, 142, Vilna, 1885). The Maggid Meisharim, furthermore, shows a knowledge of Karo's public and private life that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> possessed after his death; {{and the fact that}} the maggid promises things to its favorite that were never fulfilled—e.g., a martyr's death—proves that it is not the work of a forger, composed for Karo's glorification.|$|E

25|$|In his {{capacity}} of archbishop, Chichele remained {{what he had}} always been chiefly, the lawyer and diplomatist. He was present at the siege of Rouen, and the king committed to him personally the negotiations for the surrender of the city in January 1419 and for the marriage of Katherine. He crowned Katherine at Westminster (20 February 1421), and on 6 December baptised her child Henry VI. He was of course a persecutor of heretics. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> attained or kept the position of archbishop at the time without being so. So he presided at the trial of John Claydon, Skinner and citizen of London, who after five years imprisonment at various times had made public abjuration before the late archbishop, Arundel, but now was found in possession of a book in English called The Lanterne of Light, which contained the heinous heresy that the principal cause of the persecution of Christians was the illegal retention by priests of the goods of this world, and that archbishops and bishops were the special seats of Antichrist. As a relapsed heretic, he was left to the secular arm by Chichele.|$|E
500|$|Verdi {{received}} the draft libretto {{a few weeks}} later, by early July 1889, {{at a time when}} his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done better than you", he wrote back. Like Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare's plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and Giulio Carcano, which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's Macbeth (in 1847) and Othello (in 1887) and had considered King Lear as a subject; Boito had suggested Antony and Cleopatra.|$|E

500|$|The Confederate Congress {{established}} a special committee {{to investigate the}} military losses; Benjamin testified before it. The Secretary of State, Virginia's Robert M. T. Hunter, had quarreled with Davis and resigned and in March 1862, Benjamin was appointed as his replacement. Varina Davis noted that some in Congress had sought Benjamin's ouster [...] "because of reverses which <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> averted, [...] the President promoted him to the State Department with a personal and aggrieved sense of injustice done {{to the man who}} had now become his friend and right hand." [...] Richmond diarist Sallie Ann Brock Putnam wrote, [...] "Mr. Benjamin was not forgiven... this act {{on the part of the}} President , in defiance of public opinion, was considered as unwise, arbitrary, and a reckless risking of [...] his reputation and popularity... was ever afterwards unpopular in the Confederacy, and particularly in Virginia". Despite the promotion, the committee reported that any blame for the defeat at Roanoke Island should attach to Wise's superior, Major General Benjamin Huger, [...] "and the late secretary of war, J.P. Benjamin".|$|E
500|$|Idaho, {{a mining}} state, was fraught with labor tensions, and {{violence}} was not uncommon. [...] In 1899, {{there was a}} strike, and {{a large group of}} miners dynamited facilities belonging to a mining company that refused to recognize the union. [...] The explosion killed no one, but the mob of miners that had come by hijacked train to destroy the company's plant shot and killed a strikebreaker. Governor Frank Steunenberg declared martial law and had more than one thousand miners arrested. [...] Paul Corcoran, secretary of the union, was placed on trial for murder and Borah was engaged as a prosecutor in a trial that began at Wallace on July 8, 1899. Prosecution witnesses testified to seeing Corcoran sitting on top of the train, rifle in hand, and later leap to the platform. [...] The defense contended that given the sharp curves and rough roadbed of the rail line, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> sat on top of the train, nor jump from it without severe injury. Borah used his skills as a teenage rail rider to ride the top of the train, and jump from it to the platform without injury. [...] Corcoran was convicted, but his death sentence was commuted, and he was pardoned in 1901, after Steunenberg left office. [...] Borah gained wide acclaim for his actions.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell stated {{that in order}} to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment {{at some point during the}} first ten episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s second season. In October, the special was revealed to be Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which was hosted by Emily VanCamp, who portrays Agent 13 in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and aired on November 4, 2014. The special features behind the scenes footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic-Con. Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not [...] "do the topic justice" [...] adding, [...] "For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, [...] "Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> imagined." ...|$|E
