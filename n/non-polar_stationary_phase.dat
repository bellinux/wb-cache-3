50|$|Reverse phase {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC) involves a <b>non-polar</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase,</b> often a hydrocarbon chain, and a polar mobile or liquid phase. The mobile phase generally consists of an aqueous portion with an organic addition, such as methanol or acetonitrile. When a solution of analytes is injected into the system, the components begin to partition out of the mobile phase and interact with the stationary phase. Each component interacts with the stationary phase in a different manner depending upon its polarity and hydrophobicity. In reverse phase HPLC, the solute with the greatest polarity will interact less with the stationary phase and {{spend more time in}} the mobile phase. As the polarity of the components decreases, the time spent in the column increases. Thus, a separation of components is achieved based on polarity. The addition of micelles to the mobile phase introduces a third phase into which the solutes may partition.|$|E

The cause of original nomenclature of is relevant. As original stationary phases of paper chromatography were superseded by more efficient materials such as diatomaceous earths (natural micro-porous silica) and followed by modern silica gel, the thin-layer chromatography stationary phase was polar (hydroxy groups attached to silica) and maximum retention was achieved with non-polar solvents such as n-hexane. Progressively more polar eluents were then used to move polar compounds up the plate. Various alkane bonded phases were tried with C18 becoming the most popular. Alkane chains were chemically bonded to the silica, and {{a reversal of the}} elution trend occurred.

Generally, two-dimensional liquid chromatography technique {{is required for the}} complete characterization of both distributions. By selecting a proper stationary and mobile phase condition, however, we can obtain fully resolved chromatograms of a FAE sample (Brij 30) with respect to both alkyl and PEO chain length by using a single reversed-phase C 18 column and aqueous acetonitrile mobile phase. FAEs show a peculiar reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) retention behavior with an aqueous-organic mobile phase, the retention mechanism of which has not been fully elucidated. For a fixed alkyl chain length, FAEs with higher-molecular-mass PEO block elutes first and the van't Hoff plot of the retention factor shows a curvature. The unique retention behavior can be understood from the opposite thermodynamic characteristics associated with RPLC retention of PEO block and alkyl chain: the sorption process of PEO to the <b>non-polar</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> shows ΔHo> 0 and ΔSo> 0 while the alkyl chain shows ΔHo< 0 and ΔSo< 0 in contrast. The relative magnitude of the two contributions can change the elution order of the FAE.

In RPLC using a C 18 bonded silica stationary phase and an acetonitrile-water mixture mobile phase, the sorption process of PEO to the stationary phase showed ΔH°> 0 and ΔS°> 0. Therefore, PEO retention in RPLC separation is an energetically unfavorable, entropy-driven process, {{which results in}} an increase of PEO retention as the temperature increases. In addition, at the enthalpy-entropy compensation point the elution volume of PEO {{was very different from}} the column void volume. These observations are quite different from the RPLC retention behavior of many organic polymers. The peculiar retention behavior of PEO in RPLC separation can be understood in terms of the hydrophobic interaction of this class of typical amphiphilic compounds with the <b>non-polar</b> <b>stationary</b> <b>phase,</b> on the one hand, and with the aqueous mobile phase, on the other. The entropy gain due to the release of the solvated water molecules from the PEO chain and the stationary phase is believed to be responsible for the entropy-driven separation process. On the other hand, in NPLC using an amino-bonded silica stationary phase and an acetonitrile-water mixture mobile phase, PEO showed normal enthalpy-driven retention behavior: ΔH°< 0 and ΔS°< 0, with the retention decreasing with increasing temperature and PEO eluting near the column void volume at the enthalpy-entropy compensation point. Therefore, high-resolution temperature gradient NPLC separation of high-molecular-mass PEO samples can be achieved with relative ease.

An extensive literature survey revealed that there are several bioanalytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods reported in the literature for the analysis of lafutidine in human plasma using HPLC-ESI-MS [6, 7], in tablet dosage form by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography [8] and in human serum by HPLC with fluorescence detection [9]. To the best of our knowledge, none of the currently available {{analytical method}}s can separate all the known related compounds and degradation impurities of lafutidine drug substance. There is no pharmacopoieal reference available for analysis of bulk API or solid dosage form of lafutidine.

40|$|Monolithic {{materials}} {{have become a}} well-established format for <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> {{in the field of}} capillary electrochromatography. Four types of monoliths, namely particle-fixed, silica-based, polymer-based, and molecularly imprinted monoliths, have been utilized as enantiomer-selective <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> in CEC. This review summarizes recent developments in the area of monolithic enantiomer-selective <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> for CEC. The preparative procedure and the characterization of these columns are highlighted. In addition, the disadvantages and limitations of different monolithic enantiomer-selective <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> in CEC are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are a {{class of}} nonmolecular {{solvents}} in which the cation/anion combination can be easily tuned to provide desired chemical and physical properties. When used as <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> in gas−liquid chromatography, ionic liquids exhibit dual nature retention selectivity. That is, {{they are able to}} separate polar molecules such as a polar <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> and nonpolar molecules such as a nonpolar <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> However, issues such as optimization of the wetting ability of the ionic liquid on fused-silica capillaries, the maximum operating temperatures of the <b>stationary</b> <b>phases,</b> and nonuniform film thickness {{on the wall of the}} capillary at high temperatures have limited their use in gas chromatography. As described in this paper, these limitations are overcome by cross-linking a new class of ionic liquid monomers by free radical reactions to provide a more durable and robust <b>stationary</b> <b>phase.</b> By lightly cross-linking the ionic liquid <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> using a small amount of free radical initiator, high-efficiency capillary columns were produced that are able to endure high temperatures with little column bleed. Two types of cross-linked IL <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> are developed. A partially cross-linked <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> allows for high-efficiency separations up to temperatures of ∼ 280 °C. However, by creating a more highly cross-linked <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> of geminal dicationic ILs, exclusively, an increase in efficiency is observed at high temperatures allowing for its use over 350 °C. In addition, through the use of solvation thermodynamics and interaction parameters, it was shown that the cross-linking/immobilization of the ionic liquid does not affect the selectivity of the <b>stationary</b> <b>phase</b> thereby preserving its dual nature retention behavior...|$|R
40|$|EN) The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focused on the research and characterization of retention and enantiorecognition mechanisms of chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> based on derivatized polysaccharides. The separation systems with a variety of modern <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> (both achiral and chiral) were characterized in detail to provide a comprehensive view of the interactions participating in the separation process. The study of the retention/separation behavior significantly facilitates the development and the optimization of new enantioselective methods {{for a wide variety of}} compounds. The work deals with the comparison of enantioselective performance of polysaccharide-based chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases.</b> The objectives are to show the differences of separation behavior among these chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases,</b> as they differ by the nature of the polysaccharide backbone (amylose versus cellulose), by binding of chiral polymer to silica support (coated versus immobilized <b>stationary</b> <b>phase)</b> and by the phenyl moiety in the reversed and normal phase HPLC. In both separation modes amylose-based chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> exhibited higher enantioselectivity, especially for acidic and bifunctional analytes. Chiral <b>stationary</b> <b>phases</b> based on derivatized cellulose showed higher enantiodiscrimination potential for basic analytes [...] . ...|$|R
