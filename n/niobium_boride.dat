Magnetization (M-T) and resistivity measurements (ρ-T) in case of <b>niobium</b> <b>boride</b> samples show the absence of superconductivity in stoichiometric NbB 2 sample (c = 3. 26  Å) while a clear diamagnetic signal and a ρ = 0 transition for boron excess NbB 2 +x samples.

40|$|We {{report the}} synthesis, {{magnetic}} susceptibility and crystal structure analysis for NbB 2 +x (X = 0. 0 - 1. 0) samples. The study helps find a correlation among the lattice parameters, chemical composition and the superconducting transition temperature T-c. Rietveld analysis {{is done on}} the X-ray diffraction patterns of all synthesized samples to determine the lattice parameters. The a parameter decreases slightly and has a random variation with increasing x, while c parameter increases from 3. 26 for pure NbB 2 to 3. 32 for x = 0. 4 i. e. NbB 2. 4. With higher Boron content (x > 0. 4) the c parameter decreases slightly. The stretching of lattice in c direction induces superconductivity in the non-stoichiometric <b>niobium</b> <b>boride.</b> Pure NbB 2 is non-superconductor while the other NbB 2 +x (x > 0. 0) samples show diamagnetic signal in the temperature range 8. 9 - 11 K. Magnetization measurements (M-H) at a fixed temperature of 5 K are also carried out in both increasing and decreasing directions of field. The estimated lower and upper critical fields (H-c 1 & H-c 2) as viewed from M-H plots are around 590 and 2000 Oe, respectively, for NbB 2. 6 samples. In our case, superconductivity is achieved in NbB 2 by varying the Nb/B ratios, rather than changing the processing conditions as reported by others...|$|E
40|$|The {{superconductivity}} of MgB 2, AlB 2, NbB 2 +x and TaB 2 +x is inter-compared. The stretched c-lattice parameter (c = 3. 52 A) of MgB 2 {{in comparison}} to NbB 2. 4 (c = 3. 32 A) and AlB 2 (c = 3. 25 A) decides empirically the population of their p and s bands {{and as a result}} their transition temperature, Tc values respectively at 39 K and 9. 5 K for the first two and no superconductivity for the later. Besides the electron doping from substitution of Mg+ 2 by Al+ 3, the stretched c-parameter also affects the Boron plane constructed hole type Sigma-band population and the contribution from Mg or Al plane electron type Pi band. This turns the electron type (mainly Pi-band conduction) non-superconducting AlB 2 to hole type (mainly s-band conduction) MgB 2 superconductor (39 K) as indicated by the thermoelectric power study. Keeping this strategy in mind that stretching of c-parameter enhances superconductivity, the NbB 2 +x and TaB 2 +x samples are studied for existence of superconductivity. The non-stoichiometry induces an increase in c parameter with Boron excess in both borides. Magnetization (M-T) and Resistivity measurements (R-T) in case of <b>niobium</b> <b>boride</b> samples show the absence of superconductivity in stoichiometric NbB 2 sample (c = 3. 26 A) while a clear diamagnetic signal and a R = 0 transition for Boron excess NbB 2 +x samples. On the other hand, superconductivity is not achieved in TaB 2 +x case. The probable reason behind is the comparatively lesser or insufficient stretching of c-parameter.

40|$|International audiencePhase equilibria and phase {{transformations in}} the ternary Al-B-Nb system were {{investigated}} by XRD, SEM/WDS and SEM/EDS techniques, DTA, and optic pyrometry. No ternary compound, including the ternary phases reported in literature, was found. It was experimentally measured that the Al-Nb phases epsilon (NbAl 3), sigma (prototype sigma CrFe) and delta (prototype Cr 3 Si) have evident ternary extensions with maximal solubility of boron amount to 1. 2, 10. 4 and 3. 2 at. %, respectively. The Al solubility in <b>niobium</b> <b>borides</b> is also significant. The obtained results {{were used to}} elaborate the thermodynamic description of this ternary system based on recently published thermodynamic models of the constituent binary subsystems using the CALPHAD approach (Thermo-Calc/PARROT). The Al-B-Nb reaction scheme, projections of the liquidus and solidus surfaces {{as well as a}} number of isothermal sections and isopleths were calculated using the proposed thermodynamic description and compared with the experimental results. The calculations were shown to reproduce adequate the experimental data. The main features of the phase equilibria in the range of melting/solidification are the existence of two quasibinary sections, NbAl 3 -NbB and NbB 2 -AlB 12, eutectic L-E - epsilon + sigma + (NbB) at 1850 K and cascades of invariant U-type reactions...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{alloying}} of elemental powders {{has been}} carried out by ball-milling in a number of systems containing boron and silicon with chromium and niobium. Detailed analysis of the milled powders has been performed by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy as a function of milling time. Compound formation occurs in both chromium and niobium silicides but only in <b>niobium</b> containing <b>borides,</b> whilst chromium containing borides never form up to 80 h milling time. In all cases, partial amorphization was observed after 60 h milling indicating that the amorphization process is independent of the different paths followed by the different systems. Amorphization is related to the degree of atomic disorder produced during the milling process. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The affect {{of boron}} (B) on the {{microstructure}} and creep {{behavior of a}} Ti- 15 Al- 33 Nb (at%) alloy was investigated. In addition to the normal constituent phases present in the monolithic alloy, the B-modified alloy contained borides enriched in titanium and <b>niobium.</b> These <b>borides</b> {{were present in the}} form of needles/laths up to 50 µm long and 10 µm wide which took up 5 - 9 % of the volume. Constant load, tensile-creep experiments were performed in the stress range of 150 - 340 MPa and the temperature range of 650 - 710 °C, in both air and vacuum environments. An addition of 0. 5 at % B did not improve the creep resistance of the monolithic alloy, while the addition of 5 at % B significantly improved the creep resistance...|$|R
