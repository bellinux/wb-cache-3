50|$|Polosmak and {{her team}} were guided by a border guard, Lt. Mikhail Chepanov, {{to a group of}} kurgans located in a strip of {{territory}} disputed between Russia and China. A kurgan is a burial mound filled in with smaller sediment and covered with a pile of rocks; typically, the mound covered a tomb chamber, which contained a burial inside a log coffin, with accompanying grave goods. Such burial chambers were built from <b>notched</b> <b>wood</b> logs to form a small cabin, which may have resembled the semi-nomads’ winter shelters. The Ice Maiden's tomb chamber was constructed in this way, and the wood and other organic materials present have allowed her burial to be dated. A core sample from the logs of her chamber was analyzed by a dendrochronologist, and samples of organic matter from the horses’ stomachs were examined as well, indicating that the Ice Maiden was buried in the spring, {{at some point during the}} 5th century BC.|$|E
50|$|Lady Kwali {{was born}} in the village of Kwali in the Gwari region of Northern Nigeria, where pottery was an {{indigenous}} female tradition. She learned to make pottery as a child by her aunt using the traditional method of coiling. She made large pots for use as water jars, cooking pots, bowls, and flasks from coils of clay, beaten from the inside with a flat wooden paddle. They were decorated with incised geometric and stylised figurative patterns, including scorpions, lizards, crocodiles, chameleons, snakes, birds, and fish. She would impress patterns on top of the figures by rolling small roulettes of twisted string or <b>notched</b> <b>wood</b> over the surface of the clay, sometimes as horizontal banding and sometimes in vertical panels. The wooden roulettes consisted of small cylinders of hard wood, two or three inches long and a half-inch in diameter, notched with straight, oblique, or parallel patterns. The earthenware vessels and decorative techniques have been dated back to neolithic period. Following the region's traditional method, they were fired in a bonfire of dry vegetation. Her pots were noted for their beauty of form and decoration, and she was recognized regionally as a gifted and eminent potter. Several were acquired by the Emir of Abuja, Alhaji Suleiman Barau, in whose home they were seen by Michael Cardew in 1950.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{safe and}} {{efficient}} use of wood members in construction requires rational design criteria. One type of construction member often used is a beam with a sharp cornered end notch at the bearing area. In the United States, this end notch is limited to ten per cent of the beam depth for glue-laminated beams and to twenty five per cent of the beam depth for solid sawn timber beams. The notch length is limited to {{one third of the}} span length [1]. Since the effect of notches was not well understood these requirements are to limit the notch location to lower stress areas. Because of the unknown effect of end notches, the design calculations have been empirically based upon the net shear area[2]. It is recognized this design concept is incorrect as it is not related to the stress concentration and fracture stresses inherent in a notched beam. Our objective is to develop design criteria for <b>notched</b> <b>wood</b> beams based on mixed mode fracture analysis for an...|$|E
40|$|An {{equation}} {{for predicting}} {{the strength of}} wood beams with end notches on the tension side (Tension-side End Notches or TEN) was derived using a critical fillet hoop stress (CFHS) theory. The equation combines the results of finite element and statistical analyses of 690 different TEN beam configurations and experimental tests of 362 full-size beams. It accounts {{for the effects of}} loading type, end support and beam and notch geometry variables such as beam height, fractional notch depth, radius, and notch location. The effect of span-to-depth ratio is implicit to the model. Notched beam strength is repre-sented by a material parameter, K, which can be obtained from notched beam tests. The equation is applicable to both filleted and sharp-comered notches. An effective radius, Re, which models the effect of a sharp-cornered notch, was determined and confirmed for two wood materials. A method of determining R, for other materials was established. The results of this study can be used to set new design criteria for the strength of <b>notched</b> <b>wood</b> beams...|$|E

The ball I used was of brass; it {{had belonged to}} an old electrical machine, was hollow, thin (too thin), and four inches in diameter; a brass wire was screwed into it, and the ball either turned in the hand by the wire, or sometimes, to render it more steady, supported by its wire in a <b>notched</b> piece of <b>wood,</b> and motion again given by the hand.

Just below, at the ruin of an outbuilding for the dairy farm, the <b>Notch</b> Trail and <b>wood</b> road crosses the brook at a bridge also dating from the dairy farm era. Shortly afterwards, at a Y-shaped junction, the Notch Trail follows the other branch of the Y toward the mountain {{on the other side}} of the stream's valley, Bull Hill. Red blazes for the Brook Trail take over on the woods road as it continues downhill alongside the stream.|$|R
40|$|In this study, the Duration of Load (DOL) for crack {{initiation}} and propagation, crack speed, and {{load carrying capacity}} were investigated for three Rates of Loading (ROL) and four sizes of <b>notched</b> <b>wood</b> beams using high-speed video imaging and neural networks. For the smallest ROL, there was a distinct volume effect on DOL to initiation which was almost inhibited at the largest ROL. The DOL for crack propagation for all volumes appeared to be random. The crack propagation was a wave phenomenon with positive and negative speeds that varied with the rate of loading. The study showed that the {{crack initiation}} load, peak load, and their respective gross stresses were independent of ROL but were nonlinealry correlated with volume and the smallest volume maintained the highest stress. The stresses followed the Weibull's weakest link theory. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) revealed meaningful trends for the combined effect of physical and geometric variables on the loads and stresses. Fracture toughness was insensitive to ROL and realtively constant for the three larger volumes. However, the smallest size produced the largest fracture toughness, which was explained by a neural network model that showed that the width had the greatest influence on fracture toughness highlighting plane stress conditions. The study showed the usefulness of ANN for analyzing interaction among many variables affecting wood fracture behaviour and their potential to become reliable predictors of load carrying capacity including maximum load and stress and fracture toughness under the uncertain influence of these variables...|$|E

Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, <b>Woods</b> <b>notched</b> his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|R

It was mandatory for all the youths over 15 years of age to stay in the Bukpui, where they received training in 'tribal welfare wrestling, hunting and village government'. These Bukpui’s are often of great size, and are on much higher platforms than the other houses. To reach the platforms, <b>notched</b> logs of <b>wood</b> serve as staircases, and long pieces of cane are often suspended from an overhanging beam close to the notched logs to assist the inmates to climb up and down. The boys who went to the Bukpui emerged as complete men. The Bukpui began to lose in importance after the appearance of the British on the scene. With the onset of modernity, the Bukpui system is no longer in practice among the tribe.|$|R
50|$|In the 12th century, the English monarchy {{introduced}} {{an early version}} of the bill of exchange {{in the form of a}} <b>notched</b> piece of <b>wood</b> known as a tally stick. Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th Century, even after paper forms of money had become prevalent. The notches were used to denote various amounts of taxes payable to the crown. Initially tallies were simply used as a form of receipt to the tax payer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise of the tax assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair - one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the amount of taxes to be paid later and the other held by the Treasury representing the amount of taxes be collected at a future date.|$|R
