40|$|The paper {{describes}} the modeling of NRTC (Non-Road Transient Cycle) test procedure based on previously measured characteristics of fuel consumption, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates (PM) production. It makes possible {{to compare the}} current technical condition of an internal combustion engine of an agricultural tractor with its previous state or other tractor’s engine. Based on measured characteristics, {{it is also possible}} to model any other cycle without further measurements (<b>NRSC</b> <b>test</b> procedure, cycle for specific conditions – mountain tractor, etc.). The result may thus contribute to improving the environment by reducing the production of harmful substances emitted into the air and save money due to reduced fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|Exhaust gas {{aftertreatment}} {{systems have}} been present in motor vehicles for decades and have contributed to reducing {{their impact on the}} environment and people. Most of them for oxidation or reduction of harmful emissions of particulates and fumes require a certain temperature to be reached that changes with the exhaust temperature, i. e. the points of engine operation. The article describes the effect of oxidation reactor and particulate filter temperatures on specific emissions of gaseous compounds and particulate matter during the modified <b>NRSC</b> engine <b>test.</b> Before the first measurement cycle, the engine was idling, before the second measurement cycle, the exhaust system was heated with exhaust gases at full engine load until passive regeneration of the particle filter occurred (noticeable decrease in instantaneous particle concentration) ...|$|R
40|$|Retrofitting, {{which means}} {{retrofitting}} old generation engine systems with modern exhaust after treatment systems, {{is becoming increasingly}} popular, which allow vehicles {{to adhere to the}} newer and more stringent emission norms. This can save the operators of such vehicles money using older engineered designs without the need to design a new unit or buy an expensive new machine or vehicle. At present, there is a growing interest in emissions from off-road vehicles and the introduction of minimum limits for older vehicles that must be met {{in order to be able}} to allow for their operation. For the purposes of this article, the Stage IIIA farm tractor has been fitted with a particulate filter in the exhaust system. The study investigated the impact of the use of exhaust after treatment systems on particle emissions in terms of mass, size distribution and number using PEMS analyzers in the modified <b>NRSC</b> stationary <b>test</b> by engine loading, using a mobile engine dynamometer and comparison of test results...|$|R
40|$|The exhaust {{emissions}} tests from non-road vehicles including machines used in agriculture are currently performed on engine dynamometers in <b>NRSC</b> and NRTC <b>tests.</b> Such tests do not entirely reflect the real machine operating conditions. Real operating conditions {{are characterized by}} variable loads and variable engine speeds and {{to a large extent}} they depend on other factors that occur under operation (variable weather conditions). In light of the growing emission requirements in relation to transport it seems justified to determine the real emissions under real operating conditions. This testing method {{is one of the main}} trends in the development of the emission testing methodology worldwide. The tests performed under real operating conditions should be used for the optimization of future powertrains used in both road and non-road vehicles. The results of such tests should also be included in the works on the improvement of the emissions legislation. The paper presents the results of the emission tests from the engines fitted in agricultural tractors (plowing). For the measurement of the emissions a portable {{exhaust emissions}} analyzer SEMTECH DS. by SENSORS was used. Based on the obtained results an analysis was developed of selected engine parameters. The performed analysis is a comparison of two tractors performing similar field work. In the final part of the paper the authors present the possibilities and trends in further works related to the emissions measurements under real operating conditions from vehicles used in agriculture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the test results}} of exhaust emissions from the engine of a wheeled harvester. On {{the basis of the}} present analysis, the ranges of most frequently used engine loads and speeds were determined. The obtained time density characteristics (distribution of engine speeds and loads in time) of the engines were referred to the measuring points of the exhaust emission homologation test. During the measurement of the exhaust emissions, the machine was in the forest engaged in tree cutting. Exhaust emission tests from non-road vehicle engines are currently performed on engine test beds in the <b>NRSC</b> and NRTC <b>tests.</b> The present methodology is a new solution {{that could be used in}} the future as a basis for the development of harvesting technology aimed at reducing exhaust emissions from engines. During the tests, the authors also measured the amount of timber harvested during the felling process in order to be able to relate the emission results to the amount of the generated product. Harvesters are more and more often used in forest operations but they still have to compete with handheld (gasoline powered) chainsaws and that is why in this paper the authors included a comparison of the exhaust emissions from a chainsaw with the emissions from the engine of a harvester. The authors used a portable analyzers (SEMTECH DS and LAM manufactured by SENSORS) for the measurement of the exhaust emissions. The said analyzer can measure the concentrations of exhaust gas components in an on-line mode, while the engine is running under field conditions...|$|R
