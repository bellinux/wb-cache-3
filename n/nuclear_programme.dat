50|$|When China {{announced}} expanded {{nuclear cooperation}} with Pakistan in 2010, proponents {{of arms control}} denounced both the deals, claiming that they weakened the NPT by facilitating <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> in states which are not parties to the NPT.|$|R
25|$|The EU-3 {{would rather}} {{continue}} {{to participate in}} fraudulent diplomacy rather than confront the hard truth—that it is the United States, and not Iran, that is operating outside international law {{when it comes to}} the issue of Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} coup, the clandestine nuclear energy project {{was no longer}} a secret to the outside world. Part of his {{strategy}} was the promotion of nuclear proliferation in anti-western states (such as North Korea, Iran, and communist China) to aid their own nuclear ambitions, to divert international attention which was difficult. In 1981, Zia contracted with China when he sent weapon-grade uranium to China and also built the centrifuge laboratory which increasingly enhanced the Chinese <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b> This act encouraged Abdul Qadeer Khan, who allegedly tried to aid the Libyan <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> but because Libya–Pakistan relations were strained, Khan was warned of serious consequences. This policy envisaged that this would deflect international pressure onto these countries, and Pakistan would be spared the international community's wrath.|$|E
25|$|He put the Pakistan Armed Forces on {{high alert}} to defend country's nuclear installations. He {{justified}} the tests on national security grounds, as they demonstrated Pakistan's nuclear deterrent capabilities against an armed Indian <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b> Under his premiership, Pakistan became the first Muslim country and seventh nation to become a nuclear power.|$|E
5000|$|Countries with {{expanding}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> require {{skilled and}} trained human resources {{to design and}} operate future nuclear installations. Capacity building through training and education and transferring knowledge from centres of knowledge to centres of growth are key issues.|$|R
25|$|On 26 February 1990, FW de Klerk issued {{orders to}} {{terminate}} the country's <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>programme,</b> which until then had been a state secret. South Africa becomes the first {{country in the world}} to voluntary give-up its <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>programme.</b>|$|R
50|$|After World War II the {{increased}} range {{and quantity of}} radioactive substances being handled {{as a result of}} military and civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> led to large additional groups of occupational workers and the public being potentially exposed to harmful levels of ionising radiation.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, India tested {{nuclear weapons}} {{for the second}} time (see Pokhran-II) which {{resulted}} in several US, Japanese and European sanctions on India. India's then-defence minister, George Fernandes, said that India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> was necessary as it provided a deterrence to potential Chinese nuclear threat. Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001.|$|E
25|$|Sarkozy {{pledged to}} {{maintain}} the defence budget at its current level; develop new weapons; create a national security council, which would respond to the President of the Republic; launch a reflection on nuclear deterrence; limit French military presence in Africa; maintain a firm policy concerning the Iranian <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme,</b> enacted {{in the frame of}} the UN.|$|E
25|$|The thaw in {{diplomatic}} relations {{came to an}} abrupt end. In May 2010, the USA renewed sanctions against Syria, saying that it supported terrorist groups, seeks {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has provided Lebanon's Hezbollah with Scud missiles in violation of UN resolutions. In 2011 the UN's IAEA nuclear watchdog reported Syria to the UN Security Council over its alleged covert <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
5000|$|North Korea must [...] "not conduct {{any further}} nuclear test or {{launch of a}} {{ballistic}} missile", [...] "suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile programme" [...] and [...] "abandon all nuclear weapons and existing <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner".|$|R

25|$|Operation Smiling Buddha: Operation Smiling Buddha was {{the name}} given to India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b> The task to keep it under tight wraps for {{security}} was given to RAW. This {{was the first time}} that R was involved in a project inside India. On 18 May 1974, India detonated a 15-kiloton plutonium device at Pokhran and became a member of the nuclear club.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{security}} threat from a US-backed Pakistan and its <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> in the 1980s, Israel and India started a clandestine relationship that involved co-operation between their respective intelligence agencies. Israel shared India's concerns about the growing danger posed by Pakistan and nuclear proliferation to Iran and other Arab states. After {{the end of the}} Cold War, formal relations with Israel started improving significantly.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, India tested {{nuclear weapons}} which {{resulted}} in several US, Japanese and European sanctions on India. India's then defence minister, George Fernandes, said that India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> was necessary as it provided a deterrence to some potential nuclear threat. Most of the sanctions imposed on India were removed by 2001. India has categorically stated that it will never use weapons first but will defend if attacked.|$|E
5000|$|In {{countries}} with stagnating <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes,</b> {{the challenge is}} to secure the human resources needed to sustain the safe operation of existing installations, including their decommissioning and related programmes for spent fuel and waste. Replacing retiring staff and attracting the young generation to a career in the nuclear field are key challenges.|$|R

50|$|Arms control advocates criticised the {{reported}} China-Pakistan deal {{as they did}} in case of U.S.-India deal claiming that both the deals violate the NPT by facilitating <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> in states which are not parties to the NPT. Some reports asserted that the deal was a strategic move by China to balance US influence in South-Asia.|$|R
25|$|The United Kingdom {{established}} the world’s first civil <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme,</b> opening {{a nuclear power}} station, Calder Hall at Windscale, England, in 1956. At the peak in 1997, 26% of the nation's electricity was generated from nuclear power. Since then a number of reactors have closed and by 2012 the share had declined to 19%. The older AGR reactors have been life-extended, and further life-extensions across the AGR fleet are likely.|$|E
25|$|India {{is a close}} ally of Bahrain, the Kingdom {{along with}} its GCC {{partners}} are (according to Indian officials) among the most prominent backers of India's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, and Bahraini officials have urged India to play {{a greater role in}} international affairs. For instance, over concerns about Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> Bahrain's Crown Prince appealed to India to play an active role in resolving the crisis.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} 1992, {{the party has}} {{emphasised}} unilateral nuclear disarmament and called for {{the rejection of the}} Trident <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> of nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom. To campaign for the latter measure it has teamed up with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Plaid Cymru, and the Scottish National Party. It wants to see the UK's Army turned into a home defence force, and has pledged to take the UK out of NATO unilaterally.|$|E
50|$|Anwar Ali {{is widely}} {{known for his}} role in the <b>Nuclear</b> {{deterrent}} <b>programme,</b> where he was the pioneering member of Nuclear Physics Division (NPD). Throughout his career, Ali is known to worked with both well-known Pakistani nuclear scientists Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan in <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>programme</b> throughout the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|North Korea: The G8 communiqué {{encouraged}} North Korea {{to abandon}} {{nuclear weapons and}} to cooperate in the verification of its dossier of <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes.</b> In support for a key concern of the Japanese government, the G8 leaders also urged progress in resolving unanswered questions about North Korea's abductions of Japanese civilians in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|R
2500|$|In {{opposition}} to her conservative opponent Nawaz Sharif, whose policy {{was to make}} the <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>programme</b> benefit the economy, Benazir Bhutto took aggressive steps to modernise and expand the integrated atomic weapons programme begun by her father in 1972, {{who was one of the}} key political administrative figures of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent development. During her first term, Benazir Bhutto established the separate but integrated <b>nuclear</b> testing <b>programme</b> in the atomic bomb programme, requiring the authorisation of the Prime minister and the military leadership. Despite Benazir's denial that she authorised the <b>nuclear</b> testing <b>programme</b> in her second term she continued to modernise the programme which she termed a [...] "contractual obligation".|$|R
25|$|The {{primary mission}} of R {{includes}} aggressive intelligence collection via espionage, psychological warfare, subversion, sabotage and assassinations. R maintains active collaboration with other secret services in various countries. Its contacts with FSB of Russia, NDS, the Afghan agency, Israel's Mossad, the CIA and MI6 have been well-known, {{a common interest}} being Pakistan's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b> R {{has been active in}} obtaining information and operating through third countries like Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Myanmar and Singapore.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October 2007, Huhne {{announced}} that he had secured the support of 10 of his 62 parliamentary colleagues for his formal nomination. His rival Nick Clegg announced the support of 33 MPs. Huhne also claimed backing from at least twelve peers, four MSPs, and three Welsh Assembly members. After former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown announced his support for Clegg, a previous Liberal leader Lord Steel declared his support for Huhne, based in part on Huhne's position on the Trident <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} two {{countries}} share some common strategic interests, India and Iran differ significantly on key foreign policy issues. India has expressed strong opposition against Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>programme</b> and whilst both the nations continue to oppose the Taliban, India supports the presence of NATO forces in Afghanistan unlike Iran. Iran is the second largest supplier of crude oil to India, supplying more than 425,000 barrels of oil per day, and consequently India {{is one of the}} largest foreign investors in Iran's oil and gas industry.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, James {{joined the}} Royal Navy as a rating. He trained as an {{electronic}} engineer, and specialised as a Weapons Engineering Artificer. He {{worked on the}} Resolution-class and Vanguard-class submarines, which operate the Polaris and Trident <b>nuclear</b> <b>programmes</b> respectively. In 1992, {{he was promoted to}} chief petty officer. He left the navy in September 1998 after 14 years of service.|$|R
