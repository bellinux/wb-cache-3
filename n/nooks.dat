Closed down wards became film locations as nightclubs (J block), hairdressers (H block) and free-French army barracks (an F block dining room).|$|E

25|$|The Barnes & Noble <b>Nook</b> (styled <b>nook</b> or <b>NOOK)</b> is a {{brand of}} e-readers {{developed}} by American book retailer Barnes & Noble, based on the Android platform. The original device was announced in the U.S. in October 2009, and was released the next month. The original <b>Nook</b> had a six-inch E-paper display and a separate, smaller color touchscreen {{that serves as the}} primary input device and was capable of Wi-Fi and AT 3G wireless connectivity. The original <b>nook</b> was followed in November 2010 by a color LCD device called the <b>Nook</b> Color, in June 2011 by the <b>Nook</b> Simple Touch, and in November 2011 and February 2012 by the <b>Nook</b> Tablet. On April 30, 2012, Barnes & Noble entered into a partnership with Microsoft that spun off the <b>Nook</b> and college businesses into a subsidiary. On August 28, 2012, Barnes and Noble announced partnerships with retailers in the UK, which began offering the <b>Nook</b> digital products in October 2012. In December 2014, B purchased Microsoft's <b>Nook</b> shares, ending the partnership.|$|R
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} for other wildlife are the reef-building species like the inshore horse mussel of Strangford Lough and the inter-tidal honeycomb worm of Morecambe Bay, Cumbria and Lancashire. These build up large structures over many years and, in turn, provide surfaces, <b>nooks</b> and crannies where other marine animals and plants may become established and live out some or all of their lives.|$|E
25|$|Crassostrea and Saccostrea live {{mainly in}} the {{intertidal}} zone, while Ostrea is subtidal. The hard surfaces of oyster shells and the <b>nooks</b> between the shells provide places where a host of small animals can live. Hundreds of animals, such as sea anemones, barnacles, and hooked mussels, inhabit oyster reefs. Many of these animals are prey to larger animals, including fish, such as striped bass, black drum and croakers.|$|E
25|$|By 1838 {{the towers}} {{were already in}} ruins, when in 1840 Ferdinand II of Portugal took up the task of conserving and {{improving}} {{the condition of the}} castle, in which he committed 240 réis annually. He consolidated the walls, reforested the spaces, created <b>nooks</b> and manicured spaces and conserved the chapel. Along the south flank of the chapel he built a monument to collect the bones discovered during the public works, planting a tree in the central nave of the chapel. These reforms in the enclosure were overseen by Baron von Eschewege, but likely made the archaeological exploration of the territory considerably difficult.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} {{powerful}} black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal, is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood {{was used by the}} American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic <b>nooks</b> and crannies of the very high surface-area charcoal.|$|E
500|$|ILM's {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar said that [...] "not {{only were the}} film's effects ambitious, they also had to be designed for 3-D", and explained the company's solutions for the new perspective: [...] "We did make sure things are as bright as possible; Michael called up theatre owners {{to make sure they}} keep the lamps bright in the theatres... make everything a little sharper, because we know that through the steps, no matter what, {{when you get to the}} final screening things tend to go less sharp." [...] On the last weekend of ILM's work on Dark of the Moon, the company's entire render farm was being used for the film, giving ILM more than 200,000 hours of rendering power a day—or equivalent to 22.8 years of rendering time in a 24-hour period. Farrar embraced the detail in creating giant robots for 3-D, making sure that in close-ups of the Transformers' faces [...] "you see all the details in the <b>nooks</b> and crannies of these pieces. It's totally unlike a plain surface subject like a human head or an animated head." [...] The supervisor said that Bay's style of cinematography helped integrate the robots into the scenes, as [...] "Michael is keen on having foreground/midground/background depth in his shots, even in normal live-action shots. He'll say, ’Put some stuff hanging here!' It could be women's stockings or forks and knives dangling from a string out of focus – it doesn't matter, but it gives you depth, and focus depth, and makes it more interesting." ...|$|E

500|$|The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul {{received}} positive critical reception.

[...] He liked [...] "My Lover's Prayer" [...] and [...] "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)", asserting that they were worthy of an Academy Award. The backing bands were for him [...] "thoroughly distinctive and remarkably adaptable, fitting to the <b>nooks</b> and crannies of Redding's voice with their supple but muscular performances." [...] Magazine Rolling Stone rated the album 4 out of 5 stars, stating that Redding [...] "delivers {{one of his most}} mature performances, smoky and at times almost langorous" [...] in [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", and the second single is [...] "hard and precise but swinging." [...] In 2009, Daryl Easlea of BBC music gave the album a positive review and stated that Redding was at the [...] "peak of his powers" [...] when he recorded it. One song from the album, [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", was said by Easlea to be Redding's most remembered song after only [...] "(Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay", which was released posthumously shortly after his death.

5000|$|Game-studies scholar Ian Bogost {{described}} <b>Nook</b> {{as central}} to Animal Crossing's effective depiction of the economics of consumption and debt:None of the townsfolk ever appear in Tom <b>Nook's</b> shop... In contrast, the player participates in a full consumer regimen; he pays off debt, buys goods, and sells goods. Tom <b>Nook</b> buys goods, which he converts to wealth. ... While the player spends more, <b>Nook</b> makes more. By condensing all of the environment's financial transactions into one flow between the player and Tom <b>Nook,</b> the game proceduralizes the redistribution of wealth in a manner even young children can understand.

In 2001, a charitable trust was set up in Brown's name.

The trust awards the Dennis Emanuel Brown (DEB) bursary for educational achievement each year to students between the ages of 10 and 12 years. In 2005, George <b>Nooks,</b> who had worked with Brown in the mid-1970s in his deejay guise as Prince Mohamed, released an album of Brown covers, George <b>Nooks</b> Sings Dennis Brown: The Voice Lives On, with <b>Nooks</b> stating: [...] "I was always inspired by his talent and I used to sing like him. Dennis had a large influence on me. To me he was the greatest. He was my number one singer."
