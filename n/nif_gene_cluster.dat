5000|$|Cyanobacteria are {{photosynthetic}} prokaryotes {{that have}} existed on Earth {{for an estimated}} 2.7 billion years. The ability of cyanobacteria to produce oxygen initiated {{the transition from a}} planet consisting of high levels of carbon dioxide and little oxygen, to what has been called the Great Oxygenation Event where large amounts of oxygen gas were produced. Cyanobacteria have colonized a wide diversity of habitats, including fresh and salt water ecosystems, and most land environments. Phylogenetically, Synechocystis branches off later in the cyanobacterial evolutionary tree, further from the ancestral root (Gloeobacter violaceus). Synechocystis, which is non-diazotrophic, is closely related to another model organism, Cyanothece ATCC 51442, which is a diazotroph. Thus, it has been proposed that Synechocystis originally possessed the ability to fix nitrogen gas, but lost the genes required for a fully functioning nitrogen fixation (<b>nif)</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for microbial nitrogen fixation in the anoxic methane seep sediments in a mud volcano, the number 8 Kumano Knoll, {{was characterized by}} molecular phylogenetic analyses. A total of 111 of the nifH (a gene coding a nitrogen fixation enzyme, Fe protein) clones were obtained from different depths of the core sediments, and the phylogenetic analysis of the clones indicated the genetic diversity of nifH genes. The predominant group detected (methane seep group 2), representing 74 % of clonal abundance, was phylogenetically related to the nifH sequences obtained from the Methanosarcina species but was most {{closely related to the}} nifH sequences potentially derived from the anoxic methanotrophic archaea (ANME- 2 archaea). The recovery of the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> including the nifH sequences of the methane seep group 2 and the subsequent reverse transcription-PCR detection of the nifD and nifH genes strongly suggested that the genetic components of the <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> would be operative for the in situ assimilation of molecular nitrogen (N 2) by the host microorganisms. DNA-based quantitative PCR of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, the group-specific mcrA (a gene encoding the methyl-coenzyme M reductase α subunit) gene, and the nifD and nifH genes demonstrated the similar distribution patterns of the archaeal 16 S rRNA gene, the mcrA groups c-d and e, and the nifD and nifH genes through the core sediments. These results supported the idea that the anoxic methanotrophic archaea ANME- 2 c could be the microorganisms hosting the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> and could {{play an important role in}} not only the in situ carbon (methane) cycle but also the nitrogen cycle in subseafloor sediments...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{filamentous}} cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis (ATCC 29413) possesses two molybdenum dependent nitrogenase systems, nif 1 and nif 2. The nif 1 {{system is}} regulated by a developmental program involving heterocyst differentiation; the nif 2 system {{is expressed in}} all cells only under anaerobic conditions and the expression is controlled environmentally. The genes fdxH 1 and fdxH 2, encoding two [2 Fe– 2 S] ferredoxins, {{are part of the}} these two distinct and differently regulated <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clusters.</b> The sensitivity of both ferredoxins to oxygen was different; the half-life of FdxH 2 in air was only ≈ 1. 5 h, while FdxH 1 retained 80 % of its nitrogenase activity after 24 h. We used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the role of individual amino acid residues responsible for oxygen sensitivity and found out that the FdxH 2 double mutant I 76 A/V 77 L was much more resistant to oxygen than the wild-type ferredoxin (FdxH 2) and similar to FdxH 1. By modelling it was shown that the accessibility of the cavity around the iron–sulfur cluster was responsible for that...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is a complex}} process requiring multiple genes working in concert. To date, the Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster,</b> divided into seven operons, {{is one of the}} most studied systems. Its {{nitrogen fixation}} capacity is subject to complex cascade regulation and physiological limitations. In this report, the entire K. pneumoniae <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> was reassembled as operon-based BioBrick parts in Escherichia coli. It provided ~ 100 % activity of native K. pneumoniae system. Based on the expression levels of these BioBrick parts, a T 7 RNA polymerase-LacI expression system was used to replace the σ(54) -dependent promoters located upstream of nif operons. Expression patterns of nif operons were critical for the maximum activity of the recombinant system. By mimicking these expression levels with variable-strength T 7 -dependent promoters, ~ 42 % of the nitrogenase activity of the σ(54) -dependent nif system was achieved in E. coli. When the newly constructed T 7 -dependent nif system was challenged with different genetic and physiological conditions, it bypassed the original complex regulatory circuits, with minor physiological limitations. Therefore, we have successfully replaced the nif regulatory elements with a simple expression system that may provide the first step for further research of introducing nif genes into eukaryotic organelles, which has considerable potentials in agro-biotechnology...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{nitrogen}} fixation {{is an essential}} function of acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities. However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and {{little is known about}} the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7, 776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32. 5 -kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> had significant differences from H. seropedicae.

40|$|One of {{the main}} hurdles to {{engineer}} nitrogenase in a non-diazotrophic host is achieving NifB activity. NifB is an extremely unstable and oxygen sensitive protein that catalyzes a low-potential SAM-radical dependent reaction. The product of NifB activity is called NifB-co, a complex [8 Fe- 9 S-C] cluster that serves as obligate intermediate in the biosyntheses of the active-site cofactors of all known nitrogenases. Here we study the diversity and phylogeny of naturally occurring NifB proteins, their protein architecture and {{the functions of the}} distinct NifB domains in order to understand what defines a catalytically active NifB. Focus is on NifB from the thermophile Chlorobium tepidum (two-domain architecture), the hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus infernus (single-domain architecture) and the mesophile Klebsiella oxytoca (two-domain architecture), showing in silico characterization of their nitrogen fixation (<b>nif)</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clusters,</b> conserved NifB motifs, and functionality. C. tepidum and M. infernus NifB were able to complement an Azotobacter vinelandii (ΔnifB) mutant restoring the Nif+ phenotype and thus demonstrating their functionality in vivo. In addition, purified C. tepidum NifB exhibited activity in the in vitro NifB-dependent nitrogenase reconstitution assay. Intriguingly, changing the two-domain K. oxytoca NifB to single-domain by removal of the C-terminal NifX-like extension resulted in higher in vivo nitrogenase activity, demonstrating that this domain is not required for nitrogen fixation in mesophiles...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology of}} biofilm in deep-sea environments is barely being explored. Here, biofilms were {{developed}} at the brine pool (characterized by limited carbon sources) and the normal bottom water adjacent to Thuwal cold seeps. Comparative metagenomics based on 50 Gb datasets identified polysaccharide degradation, nitrate reduction, and proteolysis as enriched functional categories for brine biofilms. The genomes of two dominant species: a novel deltaproteobacterium and a novel epsilonproteobacterium in the brine biofilms were reconstructed. Despite rather small genome sizes, the deltaproteobacterium possessed enhanced polysaccharide fermentation pathways, whereas the epsilonproteobacterium was a versatile nitrogen reactor possessing nar, nap and <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clusters.</b> These metabolic functions, together with specific regulatory and hypersaline-tolerant genes, made the two bacteria unique compared with their close relatives including those from hydrothermal vents. Moreover, these functions were regulated by biofilm development, as both the abundance and the expression level of key functional genes were higher in later-stage biofilms, and co-occurrences between the two dominant bacteria were demonstrated. Collectively, unique mechanisms were revealed: i) polysaccharides fermentation, proteolysis interacted with nitrogen cycling to form a complex chain for energy generation; ii) remarkably, exploiting and organizing niche-specific functions would be an important strategy for biofilm-dependent adaptation to the extreme conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{filamentous}} cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 fixes nitrogen under aerobic {{conditions in}} specialized cells called heterocysts that form {{in response to}} an environmental deficiency in combined nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation is mediated by the enzyme nitrogenase, which is very sensitive to oxygen. Heterocysts are microxic cells that allow nitrogenase to function in a filament comprised primarily of vegetative cells that produce oxygen by photosynthesis. A. variabilis is unique among well-characterized cyanobacteria in that it has three nitrogenase <b>gene</b> <b>clusters</b> that encode different nitrogenases, which function under different environmental conditions. The <b>nif</b> 1 <b>genes</b> encode a Mo-nitrogenase that functions only in heterocysts, even in filaments grown anaerobically. The <b>nif</b> 2 <b>genes</b> encode a different Mo-nitrogenase that functions in vegetative cells, but only in filaments grown under anoxic conditions. An alternative V-nitrogenase is encoded by vnf genes that are expressed only in heterocysts in an environment that is deficient in Mo. Thus, these three nitrogenases are expressed differentially in response to environmental conditions. The entire <b>nif</b> 1 <b>gene</b> <b>cluster,</b> comprising at least 15 genes, is primarily {{under the control of the}} promoter for the first gene, nifB 1. Transcriptional control of many of the downstream <b>nif</b> 1 <b>genes</b> occurs by a combination of weak promoters within the coding regions of some downstream genes and by RNA processing, which is associated with increased transcript stability.

40|$|Most {{biological}} {{nitrogen fixation}} is catalyzed by molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase, an enzyme complex comprising two component proteins that contains three different metalloclusters. Diazotrophs contain a common core of nitrogen fixation nif genes that encode the structural subunits of the enzyme and components required to synthesize the metalloclusters. However, the complement of nif genes required to enable diazotrophic growth varies significantly amongst nitrogen fixing bacteria and archaea. In this study, we identified a minimal <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> consisting of nine nif genes in the genome of Paenibacillus sp. WLY 78, a gram-positive, facultative anaerobe isolated from the rhizosphere of bamboo. We demonstrate that the nif genes in this organism are organized as an operon comprising nifB, nifH, nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, nifX, hesA and nifV and that the nif cluster is {{under the control of}} a s 70 (sA) -dependent promoter located upstream of nifB. To investigate genetic requirements for diazotrophy, we transferred the Paenibacillus nif cluster to Escherichia coli. The minimal <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> enables synthesis of catalytically active nitrogenase in this host, when expressed either from the native nifB promoter or from the T 7 promoter. Deletion analysis indicates that in addition to the core nif genes, hesA {{plays an important role in}} nitrogen fixation and is responsive to the availability of molybdenum. Whereas nif transcription in Paenibacillus is regulated in response to nitrogen availability and by the external oxygen concentration, transcription from the nifB promoter is constitutive in E. coli, indicating that negative regulation of nif transcription is bypassed in the heterologous host.

Sequence analysis revealed eight genes, six with sequence similarity to known nif genes and two with sequence similarity to glnB. The gene order, nifH, ORF 105 (similar to glnB), ORF 121 (similar to glnB), nifD, nifK, nifE, nifN, and nifX, {{was the same}} as that found in part in other diazotrophic methanogens and except for the presence of the glnB-like genes, also resembled the order found in many members of the Bacteria. Using transposon insertion mutagenesis, we determined that an 8 -kb region required for nitrogen fixation corresponded to the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster.</b> Northern analysis revealed the presence of either a single 7. 6 -kb nif mRNA transcript or 10 smaller mRNA species containing portions of the large transcript.

Distinctive features of the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> include the presence of the six primary nif genes in a single operon, the placement of the two glnB-like genes within the cluster, the apparent physical separation of the cluster from any other nif genes that might be in the genome, the fragmentation pattern of the mRNA, and the regulation of expression by a repression mechanism described previously. Our study and others with methanogenic archaea reporting multiple mRNAs arising from gene clusters with only a single putative promoter sequence suggest that mRNA processing following transcription may be a common occurrence in methanogens...|$|E

Since the N-terminal parts of NifV and LeuA from other bacteria are highly similar to each other, {{a single pair of}} PCR primers {{was used to}} amplify internal fragments of both Anabaena strain 7120 genes. Sequence analysis of cloned PCR products confirmed the presence of two different nifV-like DNA fragments, which were subsequently used as nifV- and leuA-specific probes, respectively, to clone XbaI fragments of 2. 1 kbp (pOST 4) and 2. 6 kbp (pOST 2). Plasmid pOST 4 carried the Anabaena strain 7120 nifV-nifZ-nifT genes, whereas pOST 2 contained the leuA and dapF genes. The nifVZT genes were not located in close proximity to the main <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> in Anabaena strain 7120, and therefore nifVZT forms a second <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> in this strain. Overlaps between the nifV and nifZ genes and between the nifZ and nifT genes and the presence of a 1. 8 -kb transcript indicated that nifVZT might form one transcriptional unit. Transcripts of nifV were induced not only in a nitrogen-depleted culture but also by iron depletion irrespective of the nitrogen status. The nifV gene in Anabaena strain 7120 was interrupted by an interposon insertion (mutant strain BMB 105) and by a plasmid integration via a single crossover with a nifV internal fragment as a site for recombination (mutant strain BMB 106). Both mutant strains were capable of diazotrophic growth, and their growth rates were only slightly impaired compared to that of the wild type. Heterologous complementation of the Rhodobacter capsulatus nifV mutant R 229 I by the Anabaena strain 7120 nifV gene corroborated the assumption that Anabaena strain 7120 nifV also encodes a homocitrate synthase.

The possibility that GroEL is required for the correct folding of NifA was supported by coimmunoprecipitation of NifA with anti-GroEL antibodies. Kinetic analyses of nitrogenase assembly in 35 S pulse-chased K. pneumoniae pointed to the existence of high-molecular-weight intermediates in MoFe protein assembly and demonstrated the transient binding of newly synthesized NifH and NifDK to GroEL.

In wild type K. pneumoniae, transformation with sugE accelerated the rate of nitrogenase biogenesis after nif derepression. In E. coli, transformation with sugE enabled bacteriophage T 4 growth in a groEL mutant. A continuous 178 codon open reading frame (ORF) in sugE encloses another, in-frame, 105 codon ORF similar to a predicted ORF in Proteus vulgaris. In vivo products of both sugE ORFs were observed in transformants expressing {{the gene from a}} T 7 promoter. In non-transformed cells, a typical sigma 70 -dependent promoter found upstream of the larger ORF directs sugE transcription during growth at 30 degrees C. At elevated temperatures or in stationary phase cells, another promoter, found within the coding sequence upstream of the smaller ORF, is activated independently of sigma 32. The results suggest that sugE encodes a chaperonin-related system whose composition might vary with temperature and growth phase...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} genetic methods in Methanococcus maripaludis to study {{nitrogen}} metabolism and its regulation. We present {{evidence for a}} "nitrogen regulon" in Methanococcus and Methanobacterium species containing genes of nitrogen metabolism that are regulated coordinately {{at the transcriptional level}} via a common repressor binding site sequence, or operator. The implied mechanism for regulation resembles the general bacterial paradigm for repression, but contrasts with well-known mechanisms of nitrogen regulation in bacteria, which occur by activation. Genes in the nitrogen regulons include those for nitrogen fixation, glutamine synthetase, (methyl) ammonia transport, the regulatory protein GlnB, and ammonia-dependent NAD synthetase, as well as a gene of unknown function. We also studied the function of two novel GlnB homologues that are encoded within the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster</b> of diazotrophic methanogens. The phenotype resulting from a glnB null mutation in M. maripaludis provides direct evidence that glnB-like genes are involved in "ammonia switch-off," the post-transcriptional inhibition of nitrogen fixation upon addition of ammonia. Finally, we show that the gene nifX is not required for nitrogen fixation, in agreement with findings in several bacteria. These studies illustrate the utility of genetic methods in M. maripaludis and show the enhanced perspective that studies in the Archaea can bring to known biological systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris {{is one of}} just a few prokaryotes described so {{far that}} has vnf and anf genes for alternative vanadium cofactor (V) and iron cofactor (Fe) nitrogenases in addition to nif genes for a molybdenum cofactor (Mo) nitrogenase. Transcriptome data indicated that the 32 genes in the <b>nif</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cluster,</b> but not the anf or vnf genes, were induced in wild-type and Mo nitrogenase-expressing strains grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions in Mo-containing medium. Strains that were unable to express a functional Mo nitrogenase due to mutations in Mo nitrogenase structural genes synthesized functional V and Fe nitrogenases and expressed vnf and anf genes in nitrogen-fixing growth media that contained Mo and V at concentrations far in excess of those that repress alternative nitrogenase gene expression in other bacteria. Thus, not only does R. palustris have multiple enzymatic options for nitrogen fixation, but in contrast to reports on other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, the expression of its alternative nitrogenases is not repressed by transition metals. Between 95 and 295 genes that are not directly associated with nitrogenase synthesis and assembly were induced under nitrogen-fixing conditions, depending on which nitrogenase was being used by R. palustris. Genes for nitrogen acquisition were expressed at particularly high levels during alternative nitrogenasedependent growth. This suggests that alternative nitrogenase-expressing cells are relatively starved for nitroge...|$|E
40|$|The {{location}} of structural nitrogen-fixation genes was determined for the slow- and fast-growing types of Rhizobium japonicum. Slow-growing R. japonicum strains do not harbor structural <b>nif</b> <b>genes,</b> homologous to nifD and nifH, on large plasmids (100 to 200 megadaltons). In contrast, all fast-growing R. japonicum strains, except PRC 194, contain structural <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> on large plasmids...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium trifolii T 37 {{contains}} {{at least}} three plasmids with sizes of greater than 250 megadaltons. Southern blots of agarose gels of these plasmids probed with Rhizobium meliloti nif DNA indicated that the smallest plasmid, pRtT 37 a, contains the <b>nif</b> <b>genes.</b> Transfer of the Rhizobium leguminosarum plasmid pJB 5 JI, which codes for pea nodulation and the <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> and is genetically marked with Tn 5, into R. trifolii T 37 generated transconjugants containing a variety of plasmid profiles. The plasmid profiles and symbiotic properties {{of all of the}} transconjugants were stably maintained even after reisolation from nodules. The transconjugant strains were placed into three groups based on their plasmid profiles and symbiotic properties. The first group harbored a plasmid similar in size to pJB 5 JI (130 megadaltons) and lacked a plasmid corresponding to pRtT 37 a. These strains formed effective nodules on peas but were unable to nodulate clover and lacked the R. trifolii <b>nif</b> <b>genes.</b> This suggests that genes essential for clover nodulation as well as the R. trifolii <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> are located on pRtT 37 a and have been deleted. The second group harbored hybrid plasmids formed from pRtT 37 a and pJB 5 JI which ranged in size from 140 to ca. 250 megadaltons. These transconjugants had lost the R. leguminosarum <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> but retained the R. trifolii <b>nif</b> <b>genes.</b> Strains in this group nodulated both peas and clover but formed effective nodules only on clover. The third group of transconjugants contained a hybrid plasmid similar in size to pRtT 37 b. These strains contained the R. trifolii and R. leguminosarum <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> and formed N 2 -fixing nodules on both peas and clover...|$|R
50|$|In most bacteria, {{regulation}} of <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> transcription {{is done by}} the nitrogen sensitive NifA protein. When there isn't enough fixed nitrogen available for the organism's use, NtrC triggers NifA expression, and NifA activates the rest of the <b>nif</b> <b>genes.</b> If there is a sufficient amount of reduced nitrogen or oxygen is present, another protein is activated: NifL. NifL inhibits NifA activity resulting in the inhibition of nitrogenase formation. NifL is regulated by the products of glnD and glnK. The <b>nif</b> <b>genes</b> can be found on bacterial chromosomes, but in symbiotic bacteria they are often found on plasmids or symbiosis islands with other genes related to nitrogen fixation (such as the nod genes).|$|R
