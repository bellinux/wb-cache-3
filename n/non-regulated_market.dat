40|$|THE BUNDLE OF GOODS {{represented}} by a residential mortgage loan may be separated into two components: (1) financing, provided by a mortgage lender; and (2) loan origination and administration, provided by a mortgage originator/service. In a competitive, <b>non-regulated</b> <b>market</b> each of these goods should be priced to cover its marginal cost of production. The marginal dollar cost {{of the first of}} these two goods, financing, is proportional to the total dollar amount of the loan, while the marginal dollar cost of the second, loan origination and administration, varies little by loan size. However, under federallysponsored residential mortgage loan programs, the revenues (prices) received by both the mortgage lender (i. e., interest payments) and the mortgage originator / servicer (i. e., origination and servicing fees) are proportional to the total dollar amount of the loan. 1 This paper examines the implications of this pricing structure for mortgagors and loan originator / servicers and suggests an alternative structure that should alleviate some of the problems engendered by the current system...|$|E

Projected outputs under both average-cost and marginal-cost pricing are compared with expected generation under continued rate-of-return regulation. Nuclear units at risk of early retirement are in regions with the lowest forecast prices or are old plants. But, if CO 2 regulation targets an emission reduction to 9 % below projected 2010 levels (projected to be 24 % above 1990 levels), {{there are only a few}} units at risk of early retirement after 2015. ...|$|R

We focus {{on the role of}} two sets of determinants: the stock exchange characteristics and the stock-specific factors. We find that a stock exchange’s ability to attract order flow of foreign equity is positively associated with its organizational efficiency, market liquidity, the regulations pertinent to the quality of investor protection and insider trading. Regulated stock exchanges are found to be more successful in attracting order flow of foreign stocks than <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets,</b> such as OTC and alternative markets and trading platforms. Among the stock-level factors, the share of trading on a foreign exchange is higher for companies that are smaller, riskier and have low return correlation with the host market returns.

40|$|The lack of real {{progress}} at the Durban {{climate change conference}} in 2011 —postponing effective action until at least 2020 —has many causes, {{one of which is}} the failure to address trade issues and, in particular, carbon leakage. This paper advances two arguments. First, it argues that the conventional view of Border Carbon Adjustments (BCAs) as a ‘dirty’ trade barrier should be turned on its head. Rather, the absence of a carbon price comprises an implicit subsidy to dirtier production in <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets.</b> Second, BCAs could act as a game-changer when climate policy negotiations move at a glacial pace, if at all. Materially stronger progress could be achieved indirectly from the threat of unilateral trade policies. The paper shows how this could come about, using a simple political game theory model. The appropriate game form is one in which parties move unilaterally and sequentially, given the failure to agree on a common course of action, and are fully aware of the impacts of their actions. The paper shows that properly crafted BCAs could help reduce trade distortions, limit the competiveness effects, and help build a broader coalition of interests for more global actions...|$|R

40|$|Many specialists {{consider}} that financial instruments such as credit derivatives are, among other factors, {{to be blamed}} for the current financial crisis. This financial engineering, called credit deriva-tives, long praised as a great way of diffusing risks for banks, encouraged many financial institutions to take higher risks on loans than they should have. Their huge success took everybody, including their creators, by surprise. In just a few years, the credit derivatives market reached a staggering $ 60 tril-lion contracts and, unfortunately, multiplied the complexity and opaqueness of the financial world. That is why some people considered that the massive use of these instruments {{played an important role}} in creating the financial crisis. Paradoxically, some specialists did not accuse the irresponsible use of sophisticated derivatives of having generated the crisis but the accounting rules applicable for these instruments and the reporting rules issued by the American and international standard-setters. Al-though it is true that accounting for financial instruments has been a controversial subject for bankers, insurers, standard-setters and practitioners for quite a while, placing the blame on it for the current crisis is a little too much. The complex features of some of these instruments, the <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets</b> many of them are transacted on and the difficulties in establishing their fair value have been good reasons for strong debates about the accuracy and adequacy of the accounting stan-dards during the last years. But the disputes have never been as virulent as they became as the crisis started. Many people have accused financial reporting endorsed by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of not disclosing enough informa-tion on financial instruments, on the valuation methods used or the risks associated with them. Hence the investors could not correctly assess the risks and made bad decisions. The policymakers, some in-vestor groups and other interested parties called for improved transparency and enhanced accounting guidance on fair value and financial instruments. The aforementioned standard-setters responded by amending some of the old rules and by issuing further guidance. This paper aims at analyzing the dis-closure rules on financial instruments before and during the crisis by studying the financial reports published by some major financial companies. financial instruments, fair value, financial statements, financial risks, financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} report addresses {{the challenges facing}} local government in making land available for affordable housing. It seeks to establish what challenges the three leading South African metropolitan municipalities of Johannesburg, Cape Town and eThekwini face in their attempts at making land available for affordable housing. Affordable housing is defined in this research as the housing market segment for households earning between R 3500 and R 10, 000 per month, which is usually referred to as ‘the gap market’ and which represents housing opportunities in the price range between R 100, 000 and R 400, 000. Many studies have argued {{that a combination of}} historical and policy options that have evolved in the post apartheid South Africa has caused this sector of the housing market to be conspicuously under-catered for by the private housing sector {{and as a result of}} Government’s focus on low income ‘RDP’ housing. This research, specifically focuses on obstacles to land availability. The research is exploratory in intent and qualitative in its approach. It relies on desktop research, supplemented by in-depth interviews of 16 strategically placed government and private sector representatives of the housing sector. The research reviews literature which touches on the concepts and debates relating to the complexity of accessing urban land for housing, from both international and local perspectives. Access to land for housing is a complex web of interacting factors, with intense debates surrounding the need for regulation or not. Affordable housing in a competitive urban environment fails due to its weak financial basis. The research arrives at the conclusion that the land question is particularly complex in South Africa arising from its clear but cumbersome policy and legislative framework. From a political and institutional perspective the research points out that there is the need to understand the political processes that impact on land and housing. Another finding is that there is obstructive use of legislation and, together with a reluctance to implement policy, significantly contribute to curtailing access to land for affordable housing The research concludes that the impediments result from a mixture of factors that include (i) the availability of land, (ii) the political, policy and legislative processes involved in its acquisition, (iii) the nominal and mandated roles of the metropolitan authorities and the private sector, (iv) the interplay between the regulated and <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets,</b> (v) local human resource capabilities and administrative matters across the spheres of government, in particular within the municipalities for dealing with cumbersome administrative steps and processes which require many people to deal with land transactions, and (vi) the obstructive use of legislation. Finally the observation is made that there is the need for a concerted effort to understand, confront and remedy these complex interacting factors to enable affordable housing to find its place in the housing spectrum...|$|R
40|$|At the beginning, {{the author}} {{points out that}} {{rent-seeking}} economy is a distinctive phenomenon for majority of the contemporary market economies. It {{is reflected in the}} aspirations of the well organised interest groups to capture public choice and politicians as a tool to gain non-market benefits for themselves, or to take activities to gain income by non-market redistributions instead to do it on the market. According to the author examples of rent-seeking economy are antitrust, arbitrary export-import restrictions, subsidies for various sectors of economy, unions' practices of closed shop or collective bargaining. The author notes that there are legitimate public goods and services (such as military and police services or infrastructure) and therefore legitimate taxing and spending for providing of such public necessities. In his opinion, however, rent-seeking economy results from the growing government intervention in economy based upon widening of its role and responsibility to handle a wide spectrum of illegitimate ‘’social’’ issues, rather than rest upon better providing of classical government services. Rent-seeking economy is a result of abandoning the strict market economy with no or little income gained by the extra market redistribution. The social environment where it is permissible and desirable to remove as great as possible economic activities from the free, <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets</b> to the public sector or to the sector of the highly regulated economy which is cartelised by coercion, leads entrepreneurs to change their orientation. They do not perceive the regular competition as {{the best way to make}} success, but by lobbying with the political bodies. The basic rule of rent-seeking is that when there is a chance to gain rent, there will be someone who will try to get it. Therefore, in the author's opinion the government and the public inclining towards state interventionism are the main to blame for the rise of rent-seeking. This is because they make chances to gain rents since the general social and political environment enables it, as well as because there is an insufficiency of detailed legislative and constitutional restrictions on the role of the government in economy. Therefore, the basic condition for elimination or at least reduction of the scope of rent-seeking economy, in the opinion of the author, is to drastically diminish the role of the government in economic affairs. In that way the economy would be strictly separated form the politics, and entrepreneurs would be sent a signal that the reallocation of resources from productive to lobbying activities for gaining privileges is not an appropriate way to gain income. Within this context, the author points to consideration of the achievements of the James Buchanan's public choice theory that deals with the defects of political decision-making. He also points to the fact that the essence of the liberal constitutional reform that could diminish the scope of rent-seeking could be best perceived in the words stated by Friedrich Hayek the Nobel prize winner, saying that the government should be prohibited to employ ‘’coercive discriminatory acts’’. This means that the government should not employ its monopoly of physical force to award economic privileges to anyone, but it should adopt laws of general use to be applied to the unknown number of cases in the future, concludes the author...|$|R
40|$|The {{current policy}} in the Netherlands is that rents in the social housing sector are {{regulated}} and do not reflect market conditions. Housing associations are studying the possibility to partly adjust rents to the market rent, {{or at least they}} want to have insight {{in the size of the}} implicit subsidy they provide to the tenant. Market rents cannot easily derived from a hedonic price model, because the <b>non-regulated</b> rental <b>market</b> is very small, so market rents are hardly available. In this paper an alternative method of determining ‘market rents’ is presented, based on the number of reactions, i. e. persons that showed interest in a house conditional on the non-negotiable asking rent. When the number of reactions is relatively high, it is assumed that the fixed asking rent is lower than the market rent, and vice versa. In this model the number of reactions is explained by the rent price, the transaction date, the house value and additional variables controlling for the quality of the house, where the house value is the yearly appraised value used for property tax. The market rent is defined such that the probability of not renting the house is small, say 5 %. Rents can be adjusted based on the outcomes of the model, such that the probability of not renting the house is 5 %. Results are presented for different regions in the Netherlands, based on a large database containing rents, values and reactions. The results are compared to market rents that are calculated from a user cost approach...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the possible implications of international cross-listings for {{the wealth of}} shareholders, for stock liquidity and volatility, and for the distribution of trading volumes across both the domestic and foreign stock markets where the shares are traded. For the purpose of clarity, these three issues are analysed in three empirical chapters in the thesis. The first empirical issue examined in this thesis is the effects of international crosslistings on shareholders’ wealth. This is discussed in chapter 2. The chapter compares the gains in shareholders’ wealth that result from cross-listing in the American, British, and European stock exchanges and then evaluates their determinants by applying various theories on the wealth effects of cross-listing. Moreover, it evaluates how the wealth effect of crosslisting has changed over time reflecting {{the implications of the}} significant developments in capital markets that have taken place in recent years. In particular, the effects of the introduction of the Euro in Europe and the adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the US are analysed. The findings suggest that, on average, cross-listing of stocks enhances shareholders’ wealth but the gains are dependent on the destination market. In addition, the regulatory and economic changes in the listing environment not only alter the wealth effects of cross-listings, but also affect the sources of value creation. Overall, this chapter provides in-depth insights into the motivations for, and the benefits of, cross-listings across different host markets in changing market conditions. The second empirical issue examined is the impact of cross-listing and multimarket trading on stock liquidity and volatility (chapter 3). Cross-listing leads to additional mandatory disclosure in order to comply with the requirements of the host market. Such requirements are expected to reduce information asymmetry among various market participants (corporate managers, stock dealers, and investors). An enhanced information environment, in turn, should increase stock liquidity and reduce stock return volatility. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the stock liquidity and volatility improves after crosslisting on a foreign stock exchange. Moreover, this study distinguishes between cross-listing and cross-trading. The distinction is important because cross-trading, unlike cross-listing, does not require the disclosing of additional information. Although such a distinction means there is a variation in the information environment of cross-listed and cross-traded stocks, the results do not reveal any significant difference in the liquidity and volatility of the stocks that are cross-listed and cross-traded. This evidence suggests that the improvement in the liquidity and volatility of cross-listed/traded stocks comes primarily from the intensified competition among traders rather than from mandatory disclosure requirements. iii The final empirical issue investigated in this thesis (chapter 4) is the identification of the determinants of the distribution of equity trading volume from both stock exchange and firm specific perspectives. From a stock exchange perspective, exchange level analysis focuses on the stock exchange characteristics that determine the ability of a stock exchange to attract trading of foreign stocks. While from a firm perspective, firm level analysis focuses on firm specific characteristics that affect the distribution of foreign trading. The results show that a stock exchange’s ability to attract trading volumes of foreign equity is positively associated with a stock exchange’s organizational efficiency, market liquidity, and also the quality of investor protection and insider trading regulations. Analysis also reveals the superior ability of American stock exchanges to attract trading of European stocks. Moreover, there is strong evidence suggesting that regulated stock exchanges are more successful in attracting trading of foreign stocks than <b>non-regulated</b> <b>markets,</b> such as OTC and alternative markets and trading platforms. From a firm perspective, the proportion of trading on a foreign exchange is higher for smaller and riskier companies, and for companies that exhibit lower correlation of returns with market index returns in the host market. Also this proportion is higher when foreign trading takes place in the same currency as trading in the firm’s home market and increases with the duration of a listing. Finally, the study provides separate evidence on the expected levels of trading activity on various stock exchanges for a stock with particular characteristics. Overall, the findings of this thesis suggest that international cross-listing is beneficial for both firms and their shareholders but the findings also suggest that there are significant variations in the implications of cross-listings for different firms and from listing in different destination foreign markets. Finally, these implications are not static and respond to changes and reforms in listing and trading conditions...|$|R
