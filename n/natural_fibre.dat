5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a <b>natural</b> <b>fibre.</b> Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of fine synthetic fibres such as nylon {{in the construction}} of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, multifilament nylon, monofilament or multimonofilament fibres become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> nets used in comparable situations.|$|E

25|$|Gillnets {{existed in}} ancient times as archaeological {{evidence}} from the Middle East demonstrates. In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and <b>natural</b> <b>fibre</b> nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar. They would attach stones {{to the bottom of}} the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up and down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead.|$|E

The truth seems to be, that though {{his life was}} always well filled, he {{inherited}} rather the easy and buoyant disposition of his father than the energy and strenuousness of his mother, though he too could be energetic and strenuous enough upon occasion. Both William Greg and his favourite brother were of what is called, with doubtful fitness, the feminine temperament. It was much less true of William than of Samuel Greg; {{but it was in}} some degree true of him also that, though firm, tenacious, and infinitely patient, 'he rather lacked that harder and tougher fibre, both of mind and frame, which makes the battle of life so easy and so successful to many men.' It may be suspected in both cases that their excessive and prolonged devotion to the practice of mesmerism and animal magnetism had tended to relax rather than to brace the <b>natural</b> <b>fibre.</b> Samuel Greg broke down at a comparatively early age; and though his brother's more vigorous system showed no evil results for many long years to come, there was a severe reaction from the nervous tension of their mesmeric experimentation.|$|E

It is best to be considered as the most potential replacement for the glass fibres which are widely used in the market right now. The use of the <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> composites are due to two aspects, which are for environmental and economical in developing countries. Even though <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> have many advantages, due to their low-cost and low density, {{but they are not}} totally free of problems. Since very little is known about the. properties of these natural fiber composites, this thesis involves testing of those composites. The testing is done in two stages where the monotonic testing is performed first producing the stress-strain (a- e) diagram and tensile strength (UTS). Then, the loading parameters are designed for the fatigue life analysis to obtain the stress-life (S-N) curve. The textile architecture of the <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> also analyzed using CCD (charge-coupled device),, and the comparison between the <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> using polyethylene and polypropylene matrix are exhibited.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{global demand}} for wood as a {{building}} material is steadily growing, while {{the availability of}} this natural resource is diminishing. This situation {{has led to the}} development of alternative materials. Of the various synthetic materials that have been explored and advocated, polymer composites claim a major participation as building materials. There has been a growing interest in utilizing <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcement in polymer composite for making low cost construction materials in recent years. <b>Natural</b> <b>fibres</b> are prospective reinforcing materials and their use until now has been more traditional than technical. They have long served many useful purposes but the application of the material technology for the utilization of <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> as reinforcement in polymer matrix took place in comparatively recent years. Economic and other related factors in many developing countries where <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> are abundant, demand that scientists and engineers apply appropriate technology to utilize these <b>natural</b> <b>fibres</b> as effectively and economically as possible to produce good quality fibre reinforced polymer composites for housing and other needs. Among the various <b>natural</b> <b>fibres,</b> sisal is of particular interest in that its composites have high impact strength besides having moderate tensile and flexural properties compared to other lignocellulosic fibres. The present paper surveys the research work published in the field of sisal fibre reinforced polymer composites with special reference to the structure and properties of sisal fibre, processing techniques, and the physical and mechanical properties of the composites...|$|R
