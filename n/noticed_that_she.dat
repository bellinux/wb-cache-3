5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was slow {{in learning to}} talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} congenital deafness after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E

25|$|On September 4, 1986, War Eagle V {{died of a}} {{ruptured}} spleen {{at the age of}} 8 and a {{half years}} old. War Eagle V was taken to Auburn's veterinary school the night before by her trainer, Jim McAlarney, who <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not behaving normally. McAlarney spent the night at the veterinary school while veterinarians made a futile effort to save the bird's life.|$|E
25|$|Ruth Handler {{watched her}} {{daughter}} Barbara play with paper dolls, and <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing {{that there could}} be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.|$|E
25|$|Having {{made his}} way into Freyja's chambers, Loki looked around {{to be sure that}} no one was awake, and found that Freyja was asleep. He landed on her bed and <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was wearing the necklace, the clasp turned downward. Loki turned into a flea and jumped onto Freyja's cheek and there bit her. Freyja stirred, turning about, and then fell asleep again. Loki removed his flea's shape and undid her collar, opened the bower, and {{returned}} to Odin.|$|E

25|$|She {{was born}} as Anna Katharina {{into a family}} of poor farmers and had nine {{brothers}} and sisters. From an early age, she had {{to help with the}} house and farm work. Her schooling was rather brief, but all those who knew her <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> felt drawn to prayer from an early age. At twelve, she started to work at a large farm in the vicinity for three years and later learned to be a seamstress and worked as such for several years.|$|E
25|$|This {{album is}} filled with {{feelings}} of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet most of the tracks sound warm and sweet, {{as opposed to those}} piquant self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> began to smile more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was released during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time in}} 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which has come under fire from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{continued}} her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally {{did as a}} freshman, but usually only if {{she thought she was}} playing well. By the end of her sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, an honor she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history a sophomore had claimed the honor. The other two sophomore recipients were UConn's Maya Moore and Oklahoma's Courtney Paris. Stewart started and played in all 40 games of 2013–2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per contest, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals. Her 324 boards marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 rejections was the third-highest mark.|$|E

25|$|Tibullus's {{first book}} {{consists}} of poems written {{at various times}} between 30 and 26. His first love, the subject of book i., is called Delia in the poems, but Apuleius (Apol. 10) reveals that her real name was Plania. As regards her station, it should be <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was not entitled to wear the stola, the dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (i. 2, 67 seq.). She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15 and 6, 7). Tibullus's suit was favoured by Delia's mother, of whom he speaks in very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 seq.). For Tibullus's illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, I seq., 55 seq. The fifth elegy was written during estrangement (discidium), and the sixth after {{the return of the}} husband and during Delia's double infidelity. It is impossible to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are arranged in no chronological order. Sometimes she appears as single, sometimes as married; but we hear nothing either of her marriage or of her husband's death. Yet it is clear that it was the absence of her husband on military service in Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity to see her, and he continued to do so when the husband returned. Delia was clever in deception—too clever, as Tibullus saw when he found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no avail; and after the first book no more is heard of Delia. In addition, several elegies in Book I concern themselves with Tibullus's love for a boy, who is named Marathus.|$|E
500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to get dressed and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely {{left to their own devices}} after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was listing.|$|E
500|$|Minogue was {{eventually}} signed to Mushroom Records (folded today as Warner Music Australia, Warner owns the Mushroom catalogue) in early 1987. The first song that Minogue had ever considered to record was the successful [...] "The Loco-Motion", which she instantly {{fell in love}} with when she first heard it. When she performed for a fundraiser in Australia, she performed Sonny & Cher's song [...] "I Got You Babe". Alan Hardy, who asked Minogue to perform at the fundraiser, <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was very nervous in performing. However, the crowd were estatic of her performance. Hardy later asked if she would do another and, to her surprise, she performed [...] "The Loco-Motion", already rehearsing the song before the performance. Minogue went to record the song in Melbourne but could not record the song in the same key as the backing track, so she went to improve her vocals so she could change her pitch to a E minor.|$|E

2500|$|During 1988, Arena {{appeared}} as a guest on Australian TV shows recalling her tenure on Young Talent Time {{and looking for a}} new record label. In 1990 she had a singing and dancing role in the David Atkins' musical, Dynamite, for a 10-month run. Also that year she signed with EMI and reinvented her image as a raunchy disco diva. In April she issued a single, [...] "I Need Your Body", which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane described it as [...] "uptempo" [...] with the associated music video [...] "projecting a raunchy disco-diva persona... flaunting a pouting rock starlet with bouncing cleavage and attitude to burn." [...] Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> used [...] "raunchy videos showing off her cleavage as if to prove she was a woman now." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to James Mellaart, he {{encountered}} {{a young lady}} called Anna Papastrati on a train from Istanbul to Izmir and <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was wearing an unusual armband. She is meant to have told him that this armband {{was part of a}} collection of antiquities, which was in the possession of her family. He therefore went to the house of Papastrati, who according to him was a young Greek lady and spoke good English with a slight American accent. There she showed him numerous pieces which were stylistically associated with the Yortan culture. The Yortan culture was one of the cultures which neighboured ancient Troy. Mellaart stayed several days in the house at Izmir, making sketches and notes. Photography of the pieces was forbidden, according to Mellaart. Papastrati promised to photograph the pieces herself at the next opportunity and send the photos to him. The items were said to have been found in shallow graves near the city of Dorak, south of the Sea of Marmara, during the Greco-Turkish War. Mellaart reported that he had seen photographs of the graves in which the Dorak treasure had been found and that there was a description of the discovery in Modern Greek, which he had also seen. Mellaart claimed that he left the house after a few days without correctly noting its location, although he noted a name and address (Anna Papastrati, 217 Kazim Direk Street, Izmir) on a piece of notepaper. No communication was received subsequently from Papastrati. Mellaart said that he did not make the discovery public at first because he was waiting for the photos and consent to publication. He claimed to have written to Izmir twice without receiving an answer.|$|E
