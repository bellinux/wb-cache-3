I was wearing trainers again—I learnt from the day before that I needed to bandage my feet up so they couldn't expand anymore! We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E
500|$|You Are the Apple of My Eye {{is based}} on Giddens' semi-autobiographical novel of the same name. He changed some details of the story to make the film more dramatic; for example, Ching-teng and Chia-yi's fight {{actually}} took place over the phone, not in the rain as depicted. Giddens said, [...] "although {{some of the reasons}} for the events in the film were changed, the main storyline remained unchanged". Asked if he was pressured by the recent success of Taiwanese films at the box office, he replied [...] "No, I am more pressured by whether the film is nice to watch, whether it will succeed in the box office, and whether it will become an embarrassment for me. Also, if the film is <b>not</b> <b>nice,</b> it will be a letdown to Chen-tung and Michelle, who have been working so hard".|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> people. When we decided that we hated each other, the company and me, {{one of the things the}} company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing." [...] Dale and the company (Grundy Television) parted on [...] "bad terms".|$|E
500|$|Cartman is {{partially}} named after {{and based on}} Matt Karpman, a high school classmate of Parker who remains a friend of both Parker and Stone. Cartman is also inspired by All in the Family patriarch Archie Bunker, who is himself inspired by Alf Garnett from Till Death Us Do Part, the original British version of All in the Family. Parker and Stone are big fans of All in the Family. They state that creating Cartman as a [...] "little eight-year-old fat kid" [...] {{made it easier for}} the two to portray a Bunker-like character after the introduction of political correctness to late-20th century television. While developing the character, Parker noted that everyone either remembers [...] "an annoying fat kid in their pasts", or [...] "they were the annoying fat kid". Stone has observed that [...] "kids are <b>not</b> <b>nice,</b> innocent, flower-loving little rainbow children [...] they don't have any kind of social tact or etiquette, they're just complete little raging bastards".|$|E
500|$|... {{was then}} taken to St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. Murphy commented of the role, [...] "The live nature of {{it makes it}} so dangerous. You're only there because of the good will of the audience, and that's {{compounded}} by its being a one-man show". His performance earned critical acclaim, garnering Irish Times Theatre Award and a Drama Desk Award. Sarak Lyall of the International Herald Tribune described Murphy's character Thomas Magill to be a [...] "complicated mixture of sympathetic and <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> at all– deeply wounded, but with a dangerous, skewed moral code", praising his ability to mimic wickedly. Lyall noted Murphy's [...] "unusual ability to create and inhabit creepy yet fascinating characters from the big screen to the small stage in the intense one-man show Misterman", and documented that on one evening the [...] "theater was flooded, not with applause but with silence", eventually culminating in a standing ovation at his powerful performance. Also in 2011, Murphy played {{the lead in the}} British horror Retreat, which had a limited release, and appeared in the science fiction film In Time, starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, which was poorly reviewed.|$|E

500|$|Benfica opened March {{with the}} quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup. They played Beira-Mar {{at home and}} won 1–0 with a goal from João Pereira in the 25th minute. Trapattoni {{analysed}} the game, saying, [...] "Everybody knew this match was an revenge for the league defeat. In the first half we dominated, in the second we were dominated. Beira-Mar was fresher – {{it is not easy}} to play every three days. Still, we deserved to win." [...] Three days later, on 6 March, Benfica played at Estádio da Madeira against Nacional and won 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. Near the end, Quim brought down Wendel Geraldo inside the box but failed to convert the penalty, hitting the woodwork. Trapattoni praised his team's commitment saying their victory was deserved and they were lucky with the missed penalty. On 12 March, Benfica played at home against Gil Vicente. With the chance to open a three-point lead over Porto, Benfica won 2–0 with an opening goal from Mantorras and a second from Miguel. After the game, Trapattoni argued with a fan after the second goal; he said, [...] "I argued with a fan, not fans. I was <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> to him, but since the first game, he has not been nice to me." [...] He added that the win was very important and that Benfica had not won anything yet. Benfica closed March with an away game against Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first, with Geovanni doubling the lead in the second half in a 2–0 win.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Duke of Gloucester, as Chief Liaison Officer to Lord Gort, spent almost the entire first year of the war in France. Besides boosting the troops' morale, he was useful as a first-hand witness of the situation; he reported to government officials and to the King, to whom he continually wrote detailed and objective accounts of what was happening. Always eager to get involved, the Duke often found himself in dangerous situations, but did not seem overly worried. [...] "Motoring about is <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> as many villages are being bombed," [...] he wrote to his wife in his usual straightforward and dismissive manner. The Duke's two narrowest escapes both came in May 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Anyway, a {{transfer}} to his summer residence {{was out of}} question for obvious reasons: then two days later he was accompanied to Gaeta, whence the corvette Persefone {{brought him to the}} island of Ponza. After several weeks, he was then transferred to the island of La Maddalena, and finally to Campo Imperatore, where he remained until 12 September 1943, when a German commando unit led by Otto Skorzeny freed him. After the arrest of Mussolini, the King met the queen, who told her husband: [...] "What you did right now was <b>not</b> <b>nice.</b> Mussolini was our guest." [...] At Villa Savoia, after Mussolini's departure, the King walked {{for a long time in}} the gardens with his Ordnance Officer, telling him [...] "Today I had my 18 Brumaire".|$|E

We've all seen these once-dominant guys having meetings in cafés, threatening Starbucks that they'll {{go to the other}} coffee shop if they're <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> to them. On some level, Dominic kind of breaks my heart." [...] "He's that kind of middle-aged fading white man who feels disenfranchised and is scared of women." [...] "My daughter worked for somebody very like him and I just wanted to be that character. Nobody knows it's me. People say, 'Why is that guy suddenly {{in the middle of the}} show?'"

2500|$|Political {{opponents have}} been {{reluctant}} to seize upon Dean's privileged early life. UPI quoted one of Dean's friends in his youth as saying, [...] "By Hamptons standards, the Deans were not rich. No safaris in Africa or chalets in Switzerland. Howard's father went to work every day. He didn't own a company, or have a father or grandfather who founded one, as mine did." [...] Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal that [...] "he doesn't seem like a WASP. I know it's <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> to deal in stereotypes, but there seems very little Thurston Howell, III, or George Bush, the elder, for that matter, in Mr. Dean.... He seems unpolished, doesn't hide his aggression, is proudly pugnacious. He doesn't look or act the part of the WASP...It will be harder for Republicans to tag Mr. Dean as Son of the Maidstone Club than it was for Democrats to tag Bush One as Heir to Greenwich Country Day. He just doesn't act the part." ...|$|E

His voice remained harsh and loud, and his look wild, as if he still saw before him Libyans or Cimbrians, and not well-bred and perfumed colleagues. ... is want of political culture was unpardonable... {{what was to be}} thought of a consul who was so ignorant of constitutional etiquette as to appear in triumphal costume in the senate! In other respects too the plebeian character clung to him. He was not merely—according to aristocratic phraseology—a poor man, but, what was worse, frugal, and a declared enemy of all bribery and corruption. After the manner of soldiers he was <b>not</b> <b>nice,</b> but was fond of his cups... he knew not the art of giving feasts, and kept a bad cook. It was likewise awkward that the consular understood nothing but Latin and declined conversation in Greek. ... Thus he remained throughout his life a countryman cast adrift among aristocrats." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really <b>not</b> <b>nice</b> to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. For a second, I was tempted to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls. Of Conner's sudden appearance on the show, Comăneci later commented in her memoir, [...] "There was nothing romantic about [...] motivation. It was based on his desire to help a young woman he'd met once who was an icon in our shared sport." ...|$|E
