Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's.

2500|$|The current I(t) {{through any}} {{component}} in an electric circuit {{is defined as}} the rate of flow of a charge Q(t) passing through it, but actual charges—electrons—cannot pass through the dielectric layer of a capacitor. Rather, one electron accumulates on the <b>negative</b> <b>plate</b> for each one that leaves the positive plate, resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other. Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above. As with any antiderivative, a constant of integration is added to represent the initial voltage V(t0). This is the integral form of the capacitor equation: ...|$|E

40|$|Batteries in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle applications operate from partial state of charge and are subjected to short periods of charge and discharge with high currents. These operating conditions create two major problems, namely low charge acceptance and progressive sulfation of the <b>negative</b> <b>plates.</b> The low specific electrochemically active surface of the <b>negative</b> <b>plates</b> can be expanded significantly by adding definite types of carbon materials, which improves substantially the charge acceptance of the battery. We assume that the slowest elementary process during charging <b>negative</b> <b>plates</b> is {{the dissolution of the}} lead sulfate crystals. This process can be accelerated by adding poly-aspartic acid (Baypure DS- 100 or DS) to the negative paste or to the electrolyte. DS causes partial amorphization of the PbSO 4 particles and reduces their size. Thus, the reversibility of the charge-discharge processes at the <b>negative</b> <b>plates</b> is improved and their sulfation is retarded. Besides, DS increases the overpotential of hydrogen evolution on the lead electrode. These effects of DS make it a useful additive to lead-acid batteries operated in the high-rate partial-state-of-charge duty...|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of the ultracapacitor integrated in the UltraBattery acts to limit the formation of hard sulfation inside the cell. REF This supports the battery’s ability to operate for long periods in a partial SoC where the battery operates more efficiently. REF Conventional VRLAs are somewhat constrained {{to operate in the}} inefficient region toward the top of their charge capacity in order to protect them against damage by sulfation. Research continues into the reasons why the {{presence of}} the ultracapacitor reduces sulfation so successfully. Experimental results show that the presence of carbon within VRLA cells has some mitigating effect but the protective effects of the parallel-connected ultracapacitor within the UltraBattery are much more significant. Hund et al., for instance, found that typical VRLA battery failure modes (water loss, <b>negative</b> <b>plate</b> sulfation, and grid corrosion) are all minimized in the UltraBattery. Hund’s results also showed that the UltraBattery, used in a high rate partial state of charge application, exhibits reduced gassing, mimimized <b>negative</b> <b>plate</b> hard sulfation, enhanced power performance and minimized operating temperature compared with conventional VRLA cells.|$|E
