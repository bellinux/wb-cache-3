25|$|There was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that Adelaide {{represent}} the very nadir of the Australian tour...The reasons behind {{the ease of}} their successful loss were fourfold: unenterprising captaincy, bad England batting, a good Lillee bowling performance {{and a lack of}} penetration in the depleted touring attack.|$|E

500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} McCain had {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that McCain {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E

500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E
500|$|Burton, who {{finished}} second, {{was happy with}} his performance, [...] " [...] Todd Berrier has come in and done a great job, the team’s done a great job. We had one hiccough early on pit road {{but the rest of}} them we picked out our spots every single time, and that’s what it takes; it takes a team effort." [...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> they were going to come this week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1981 NFL Draft, Taylor {{was drafted}} by the NFL's New York Giants as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL General Managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league's 28 GMs said {{if they had the}} first {{selection}} they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: [...] "Taylor is the best college linebacker I've ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There's <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> about Taylor. He's bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he's devastating." ...|$|E

500|$|Contemporaries of Edwards {{have been}} unstinting in their praise of his abilities. Bobby Charlton {{described}} him as [...] "the only player {{that made me feel}} inferior" [...] and said his death was [...] "the biggest single tragedy ever to happen to Manchester United and English football". Terry Venables claimed that, had he lived, it would have been Edwards, not Bobby Moore, who lifted the World Cup trophy as England captain in 1966. Tommy Docherty stated that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that Duncan would have become the greatest player ever. Not just in British football, with United and England, but the best in the world. George Best was something special, as was Pelé and Maradona, but in my mind Duncan was much better in terms of all-round ability and skill." [...] In recognition of his talents Edwards was made an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. [...] His memorabilia was exhibited at Dudley Museum prior to its closure, and was subsequently sold to Manchester United with a selection to be loaned back for display at the Dudley Archives.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> I would have made those saves. And {{the fact of the}} matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he would be surprised if Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he would be surprised if Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E

It is being released in the UK via Spinefarm Records. The album was produced by Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Drummer Jason Bittner recently stated about the band's new material, [...] "The songs {{are a little more}} on the darker, angry side... lots of heaviness, lots of crazy guitar, and LOTS of room for me to have some fun. There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that this will be the best performance of my career, so far, and I owe that to my guys for bringing me incredible riffs to write killer drum parts to." [...] As of the fall of 2009 the band was appearing on the 'Shock & Raw' tour of North America with 2Cents, Otep & Five Finger Death Punch. After a South American tour, Shadows Fall will be playing on the Jägermeister Stage in the 2010 Rockstar Mayhem Festival in July and August 2010.

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{interview}} he ever gave, in August 1970, Goddard told David Yallop that being Lord Chief Justice {{was not an}} easy job. When Yallop, who believed that Craig should have been imprisoned for manslaughter and Bentley thus cleared, asked Goddard about Derek Bentley's execution, he received the following reply, [...] "Yes, I thought that Bentley was going to be reprieved.
