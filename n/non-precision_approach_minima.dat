50|$|The {{preliminary}} investigation report {{stated that the}} crew breached air safety regulations on all three approaches by descending below the decision height of 200 ft before initiating a missed approach. On 6 May, the Civil Aviation Authority in the United Kingdom issued a Safety Notice advising all operators within the United Kingdom of new rules regarding <b>Non-Precision</b> <b>Approaches</b> and <b>Minimum</b> Descent Altitudes, applicable from 16 July 2011.|$|R
5000|$|By {{following}} controller {{commands to}} keep the landing aircraft on both glidepath and approach centerline, a pilot will arrive precisely over the runway's touchdown zone. In order to insure continuous radio communication integrity, controllers are required to make radio transmissions at certain minimum intervals {{depending on the type}} of approach flow and phase of the approach. In order to land, pilots must have the runway or runway environment in sight prior to reaching the [...] "decision height," [...] for PAR approaches (usually 100-400 ft above the runway touchdown zone) or prior to the [...] "Missed Approach Point" [...] for <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches.</b> The published <b>minimum</b> visibility and decision height/minimum descent altitude vary depending upon the approach and runway lighting, obstacles in the approach corridor, type of aircraft, and other factors. Pilots of revenue flights periodically must demonstrate PAR approach proficiency, and GCA controllers must conduct a minimum number of such approaches in a year to maintain competency.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Non-precision</b> <b>approach.</b> The MAP for a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> is {{typically}} crossed at the minimum descent altitude (MDA), {{and may be}} anywhere from well prior to the runway threshold to past {{the opposite end of}} the runway, depending on terrain, obstructions, NAVAID location and air traffic considerations.|$|R

50|$|The use of GNSS in {{aircraft}} {{is becoming}} increasingly common. GNSS provides very precise aircraft position, altitude, heading and ground speed information. GNSS makes navigation precision once reserved to large RNAV-equipped aircraft available to the GA pilot. Recently, more and more airports include GNSS instrument approaches. GNSS approaches consist of either overlays to existing <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> or stand-alone GNSS <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{a runway}} has both {{precision}} and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> defined, the MDA of the <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> {{is almost always}} greater than the DH/DA of the precision approach, {{because of the lack}} of vertical guidance on the non-precision approach: the actual difference depends on the accuracy of the navaid upon which the approach is based, with ADF approaches and SRAs tending to have the highest MDAs.|$|R

50|$|A runway {{equipped}} with NDB or VOR (or both) {{as the only}} navigation aid is called a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> runway; if it is {{equipped with}} ILS it is called a precision approach runway.|$|R
50|$|When the {{glideslope}} is unserviceable, the localizer element {{can often}} be conducted as a separate <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach,</b> abbreviated to 'LOC'. A standalone instrument approach installation without an associated glidepath carries the abbreviation 'LLZ'.|$|R
50|$|Simplified {{directional}} facility (SDF) is a localizer-based instrument <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> to an airport, {{which provides}} final approach course similar to {{instrument landing system}} (ILS) and localizer type directional aid (LDA) approaches, although not as precise.|$|R
50|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>minimums</b> for LNAV <b>{{approaches}}</b> {{are higher}} than that of ILS approaches, and RNAV approaches that incorporate vertical guidance. Aircraft executing an LNAV instrument approach must descend incrementally rather than follow a fixed glide slope. This is called a 'non-precision' approach to distinguish it from a precision approach in which there is electronic vertical (slope) guidance down to a decision altitude (DA). In the case of the <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach,</b> the aircraft can descend only to what is referred to as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). An MDA segment is flown until the airport is in sight and the pilot can land. If the airport is not in sight by the time the pilot reaches a missed approach point (MAP) on the MDA, the aircraft must execute a missed approach.|$|R

2500|$|Smolensk North Airport is {{a former}} {{military}} airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At {{the time of the}} crash, the airport was not equipped with an ICAO-compliant instrument landing system (ILS), the standard system used in western countries. The airport did have previously a Russian landing system installed, but that was decommissioned after civilian operations started. The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS. A non-directional beacon (NDB) was installed at the airport, but such device is essentially a navigational aid, and can be used only for <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches,</b> where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.

The crosswind runway 12/30 is 5,000 by 200 ft (1,524 by 61 m) with a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term {{fan marker}} {{refers to the}} older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type marker beacons were sometimes part of a <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{finding of}} the NTSB {{was that the}} probable cause of the accident was the stalling of the airplane (airspeed too low) because the captain failed {{to ensure that the}} flight remained within the required airspeed and altitude parameters for that <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> profile. No evidence was ever found of sabotage or foul play.|$|R
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the captain’s failure to adequately brief and execute the <b>non-precision</b> <b>approach</b> and the first officer’s and flight engineer’s failure to effectively monitor and cross-check the captain’s execution of the approach. [...] Contributing to these failures were the captain’s fatigue and Korean Air’s inadequate flight crew training.|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of head-up displays (HUD) in civil transport approach and landing operations, an operational evaluation was conducted on the flight simulator for advanced aircraft at Ames. A non-conformal HUD concept which contained raw data and Flight Director command information, and a conformal, flight path HUD concept was designed to permit terminal area maneuvering, intercept, final approach, flare, and landing operations. Twelve B- 727 line pilots (Captains) flew a series of precision and <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches</b> under a variety of environmental and operational conditions, including wind shear, turbulence and low ceilings and visibilities. A preliminary comparison of various system and pilot performance measures as a function of display type (Flight Director HUD, Flight Path HUD, or No HUD) indicates improvements in precision and accuracy of aircraft flight path control when using the HUDs. The results also demonstrated some potentially unique advantages of a flight path HUD during <b>non-precision</b> <b>approaches...</b>|$|R
