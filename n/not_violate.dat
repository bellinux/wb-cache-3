5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E

Arkansas, supra, Willoughby v. Stever, No. 15574-75 (D.D.C. May 18, 1973); aff'd. 504 F.2d 271 (D.C. Cir. 1974), cert. denied , 420 U.S. 924 (1975); Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist., 366 F.

5|$|In 1960, the Soviet Union {{shot down}} a United States U-2 spy plane. The Soviets {{captured}} its pilot, Gary Powers, and tried him for committing espionage against the Soviet Union. At first, the United States believed that Powers could be freed by crafting an argument regarding international principles. To this end, Miskovsky {{and two other}} lawyers (Alexander W. Parker and Frank Rogers) wrote a brief stating that Power's U-2 plane did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> Soviet airspace any more than Sputnik violated American airspace. However, the Soviet Union refused to allow foreigners to defend Powers. Powers was ultimately defended by a lawyer who acted as {{a spokesman for the}} Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, in the lead-up to {{the release}} of the first Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; Warner Bros., the film's distributor, sent a series of letters to owners of Harry Potter fansites, {{demanding}} that, to protect their copyright, they hand over their domain names. The action resulted in negative publicity for the company when Claire Field, the then 15-year-old webmaster of the British fansite harrypotterguide.co.uk, was reduced to tears by what were described by her father as unnecessary bully tactics. Eventually the corporation backed down in the face of media opposition and declared that, as the site was non-commercial, it did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> the trademark.|$|E

5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Court did not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. To the surprise of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court ruling. On September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does <b>not</b> <b>violate</b> the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
