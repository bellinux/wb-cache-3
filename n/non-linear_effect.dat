In order to properly account for this <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect,</b> the Norden used a system of slip-disks similar to those used in differential analysers. However, this slow change at long distances made it difficult to fine-tune the drift early in the bomb run. In practice, bombardiers would often set up their ground speed measurements in advance of approaching the target area by selecting a convenient [...] "target" [...] on the ground that was closer to the bomber and thus had more obvious motion in the sight. These values would then be used as the initial setting when the target was later sighted.|$|E
2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field. This is a <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect</b> of the constitutive relation between mechanical stress and finite strain in a material of continuous mass. In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the applied stress and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an applied stress. The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the applied stress and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material. In the limit of an unstressed material the sound velocities of the linear elastic theory are reproduced.|$|E

50|$|Electric {{stirring}} explicitly breaks time-reversal symmetry. This property {{can be used}} {{to induce}} spin polarization in conventional semiconductors by purely electric means. Strictly speaking stirring is a <b>non-linear</b> <b>effect,</b> because in linear response theory (LRT) an AC driving induces an AC current with the same frequency. Still an adaptation of the LRT Kubo formalism allows the analysis of stirring. The quantum pumping problem (where we have an open geometry) can be regarded as a special limit of the quantum stirring problem (where we have a closed geometry). Optionally the latter can be analyzed within the framework of scattering theory. Pumping and Stirring devices are close relatives of ratchet systems. The latter are defined in this context as AC driven spatially periodic arrays, where DC current is induced.|$|E

In this case, the equilibrium constant K also increases as {{the correction}} factor increases. Although the product enantioselectivity is relatively high compared to the enantiopurity of the chiral catalyst, this comes at a cost of the overall reaction rate. In order to achieve an asymmetric amplification, there must be a relatively large concentration of the heterochiral complex. In addition, this heterochiral complex must have a substantially slower rate of reactivity, rRS. Therefore, the reactive catalytic species should decrease in concentration, leading to an overall slower reaction rate.|$|E

In simulation studies to evaluate new proposals and to compare model-building techniques, researcherstend to consideroversimplifiedsettings orunrealisticallycomplex functional forms.

In addition, the mean square error of prediction is often used as the main criterion for evaluation. This is insufficient when the effect of individual variables is to be assessed, e. g., in exploratory studies in clinical epidemiology. After reviewing some of the proposals for simulation designs, we suggest a new design that avoids oversimplification and tries to capture structure often found in biomedical settings. Specifically, we posit a non-trivial correlation structure between covariates, a challenge for many techniques of model selection. In addition to continuous covariates, binary covariates are included. As well as strong <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects,</b> some near-linear effects of covariatesare considered. This allows one to judge whether a technique can distinguish between important <b>non-linear</b> <b>effects</b> and effects that might reasonably be represented by linear terms.
