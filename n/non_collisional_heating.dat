40|$|The {{identification}} of the mechanism(s) responsible for heating asteroids is among the major problems in planetary science. Because of difficulties with models of electromagnetic induction and the decay of short-lived radionuclides, it is worthwhile to evaluate the evidence for <b>collisional</b> <b>heating.</b> New evidence for localized impact heating comes from the high proportion of relict type- 6 material among impact-melt-bearing ordinary chondrites (OC). This relict material was probably metamorphosed by residual heat within large craters. Olivine aggregates composed of faceted crystals with 120 deg triple junctions occur within the melted regions of the Chico and Rose City OC melt rocks; the olivine aggregates formed from shocked, mosaicized olivine grains that underwent contact metamorphism. Large-scale <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is supoorted by the correlation in OC between petrologic type and shock stage; no other heating mechanism can readily account for this correlation. The occurrence of impact-melt-rock clasts in OC that have been metamorphosed along with their whole rocks indicates that some impact events preceded or accompanied thermal metamorphism. Such impacts events, occurring during or shortly after accretion, are probably responsible for substantially melting approximately 0. 5 % of OC. These events must have heated {{a larger percentage of}} OC to subsolidus temperatures sufficient to have caused significant metamorphism. If <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is viable, then OC parent asteroids must have been large; large OC asteroids in the main belt may include those of the S(IV) spectral subtype. <b>Collisional</b> <b>heating</b> is inconsistent with layered ('onion-shell') structures in OC asteroids (wherein the degree of metamorphism increases with depth), but the evidence for such structures is weak. It seems likely that <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> {{played an important role in}} metamorphosing chondritic asteroids...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear and Coulomb {{collisions}} in GRB jets {{create a}} hot electron-positron plasma. This <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> starts when the jet is still opaque and {{extends to the}} transparent region. The e+- plasma radiates its energy. As a result, a large fraction of the jet energy is converted to escaping radiation with a well-defined spectrum. The process is simulated in detail using the known rates of collisions and accurate calculations of radiative transfer in the expanding jet. The result reproduces the spectra of observed GRBs that typically peak near 1 MeV and extend to much higher energies with a photon index β - 2. 5.

Self-focusing in plasma can occur through thermal, relativistic and ponderomotive effects.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of collisionality's role in turbulent transport in magnetized plasma using the GS 2 gyrokinetic simulation software is presented. The investigation {{consists of three}} parts, conducted by way of numerical modeling: 1) input calibration using the conditions and results of a reference {{investigation of}} a different parameter's influence on turbulence, 2) direct variation of electron-electron and ion-ion collisionality parameters, and 3) comparison between results calculated with the inclusion and exclusion of an additional <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> term. The calibration exercise demonstrates reliable agreement between results obtained in the present investigation and those obtained in other studies, the variation of collisionality parameters suggests a stronger dependence of ITG-driven turbulence on electron-electron collisionality than on ion-ion collisionality, and {{the evaluation of the}} <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> diagnostic shows a diminished influence of <b>collisional</b> <b>heat</b> drive on turbulent transport as this parameter increases. Several significant changes in some steady-state turbulent fluxes are observed at certain "threshold" values of electron-electron or ion-ion collisionality (e. g. time-averaged particle flux changing sign twice as the normalized electron-electron collisionality parameter varies between 0 and 2. 5) as well as a lack of correspondence between steady-state heat, momentum and particle flux changes. These seemingly unrelated sensitivities to different ranges of collisionality parameters suggest different drives for these different transport quantities, implying a complex relationship between collisionality and turbulent heat, momentum, and particle transport of which a deeper understanding is fundamental to the design and performance of magnetic fusion projects. by Martin L.

40|$|High {{temperature}} {{laboratory and}} rarefied space plasmas {{can be considered}} in many situations as collisionless and their dynamics as Hamiltonian. The capability of generating, during the time evolution, smaller and smaller scales in the velocity space is a characteristic {{of the majority of}} the processes developing in such plasmas. Since the <b>non</b> <b>collisional</b> dynamics, especially during the non linear regime, is often driven by kinetic effects, to describe theoretically its evolution a kinetic approach is necessary. The analytical model used for the study of small scales <b>non</b> <b>collisional</b> dynamics is based on the Vlasov equation coupled, in the electrostatic limit, to the Poisson equation. However, this is a non linear system of equations usually very difficult to solve analytically. For this reason, in this context numerical simulations are one of the most effective tools of investigation. However, the necessity of a numerical approach to discretize the equations on a numerical mesh introduces a strong limit. In fact, in Vlasov simulations, when a process develops scales so small to be comparable to the size of the numerical mesh, the algorithm becomes necessarily unable to describe correctly the plasma dynamics, with the consequent effect of introducing in the system numerical dissipation and dispersion and consequently of breaking the Hamiltonian character of the system. Here we have studied the problem of the role of small scales on the evolution of the non linear, collisionless plasma dynamics by considering several specific physical phenomena of basic interest in plasma physics described by the Vlasov Poisson mode...|$|R

Our study reveals {{the presence of a}} luminous (L_IR≈ 4. 6 x 10 ^ 43 erg/s) and extended component of infrared dust emission, not connected with the main bodies of the galaxies, but roughly coincident with the X-ray halo of the group. We fitted the inferred dust emission spectral energy distribution of this extended source and the other main infrared emission components of SQ, including the intergalactic shock, to elucidate the mechanisms powering the dust and PAH emission, taking into account <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> by the plasma and heating through UV and optical photons. Combining the inferred direct and dust-processed UV emission to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) for each source we obtain a total SFR for SQ of 7. 5 M(sun) /yr, similar to that expected for non-interacting galaxies with stellar mass comparable to the SQ galaxies. Although star formation in SQ is mainly occurring at, or external to the periphery of the galaxies, the relation of SFR per unit physical area to gas column density for the brightest sources is similar to that seen for star-formation regions in galactic disks.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} laser-plasma {{processes}} are studied at transport and ion time scales. In order to study these processes the particle-in-cell code QNPIC with one spatial dimension and three dimensions in velocity space was developed. Collisional effects are included by a Monte Carlo procedure, and an electric field solver {{based on the}} quasineutrality condition has been implemented. This allows long time scale simulations without having to resolve the electron plasma frequency. <b>Collisional</b> <b>heating</b> of the electrons in the laser electric field {{is one of the}} major restrictions on the time step in particle-in-cell codes. We have developed a <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> procedure that is based on a Langevin equation. It utilizes a Fokker-Planck equation that describes heating time averaged over the laser frequency. This procedure, in conjunction with the fast field solver and procedures to represent collisions, allows simulation of long time scale in laser-plasma interactions without the need to resolve the short time scales to ensure numerical stability and suppress numerical artifacts. We have studied in detail homogeneously heated plasmas and the effects of electron-electron collisions and <b>collisional</b> <b>heating</b> on the electron distribution function. We have suggested a nonlocal, nonlinear heat transport model based on a earlier self consistent nonlocal transport theory that is formally restricted to small (linearized) temperature perturbations. Our model extends this model to the case of finite temperature perturbations. The model is tested successfully in simulations of hot spot relaxation of an initial temperature distribution that corresponds to the instantaneous release of heat into a spatially Gaussian temperature profile and Maxwellian velocity distributions of the electrons. In simulations of collisionally heated hot spots we qualitatively describe the effects of non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on the heat flux and the change of the distribution function due to transport in nonheated regions. For the representation of ion dynamics in QNPIC we have conducted studies of the two stream instability with counterstreaming electrons and ions. Predicted growth rates of ion sound waves are recovered and we find it possible to study anomalous heating and resistivity in ID ion sound turbulence. In laser plasmas ion sound turbulence due to the return current instability is thought to be one of the factors in the reduction of heat flux from hot spots. Since this instability is of kinetic nature it cannot be reproduced by hydrodynamic simulations. Our preliminary results of the return current instability in electron temperature gradients using QNPIC indicate the feasibility of particle codes to treat this problem. For the analytic description of ion dynamics we have developed kinetic closures of the ion fluid equations that allow a single representation of the dynamics over all regimes of collisionalities. We employ a Chapman-Enskog like procedure for the closure and use a 21 -moment representation for the collisional terms which ensure that the classical collisional limit of the transport coefficients is recovered. Ion sound like waves, transverse to a nonlinear perturbation, are investigated in a cold ion fluid model.
