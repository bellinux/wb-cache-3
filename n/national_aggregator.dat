50|$|The {{first version}} of CORE was created in 2011 by Petr Knoth with the aim {{to make it easier}} to access and text mine very large amounts of {{research}} publications. The value of the aggregation was first demonstrated by developing a content recommendation system for research papers, following the ideas of literature-based discovery introduced by Don R. Swanson. Since its start, CORE has received financial support from a range of funders including Jisc and the European Commission. Although CORE aggregates from across the world, it has the status of the UK's <b>national</b> <b>aggregator</b> of open access content, aggregating metadata and full-text outputs from both UK publishers' databases as well as institutional and subject repositories. The service operates as a one step search tool for UK's open access research outputs, facilitating easy discoverability, use and reuse. The importance of the service has been widely recognised by Jisc, which suggested that CORE should preserve the required resources to sustain its operation and explore an international sustainability model. CORE is now one of the Repository Shared Services projects, along with Sherpa Services, IRUS-UK, Jisc Publications Router and OpenDOAR.|$|E

40|$|A recent ZooKeys’ paper (Mesibov, 2013 : [URL] has {{highlighted}} {{data quality}} issues in aggregated data sets, {{but did not}} provide a realistic way to address these issues. This paper provides an aggregator’s perspective including ways that the whole community can help to address data quality issues. The establishment of GBIF and <b>national</b> nodes (<b>national</b> <b>aggregators)</b> such as the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) have integrated and exposed a huge diversity of biological observations along with many associated issues. Much of the admirable work by Mesibov (2013) was enabled bythe data exposed. Data quality, {{one of the highest}} priorities for GBIF, the national nodes and other aggregators, depends on both automatic methods and community experts to detect and correct data issues. Not all issues can however be automatically detected or corrected, so community assistance is needed to help improve the quality of exposed biological data. We do need to improve the infrastructure and associated processes to more easily identify data issues and document all changes to ensure a full record is permanently and publicly available...|$|R

The CENDARI Archival Directory consists of all available data in the AtoM application (“Access to Memory”) and data in the main repository, which is derived from international or <b>national</b> <b>aggregators</b> as well as national archives or other data providers. All data, whether manually inputted via the AtoM application or collected from institutions, form together the Archival Directory. In this guide the term “Archival Directory” refers only to the application AtoM and it hence will be used in this narrow sense. The term “Archival Directory AtoM” reinforces this definition. Unlike most of the other ARGs in CENDARI, this is not a thematic overview of a historical subject but instead a practical guide to the Archival Directory AtoM’s aims and how it was created and organised. This guide will present the methodology used by researchers associated with the CENDARI project when creating archival description and archival institution entries in CENDARI. It explains how material was selected to be entered into the Archival Directory AtoM, which institutions were considered as ‘hidden archives’ by the CENDARI team, what material was not included, the limitations of the project {{and the future of the}} Archival Directory AtoM. The CENDARI Archival Directory AtoM can be accessed both directly from the website and indirectly via the link provided in the Note-Taking Environment (NTE) ...|$|R

40|$|As a <b>national</b> <b>aggregator,</b> NARCIS {{contains}} the scientific output of 27 institutional OAI-PMH repositories (IRs), with publications {{and descriptions of}} research data (datasets) from the Dutch universities, the Academy (KNAW), the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), the institute for Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS, [URL] and other research institutes. NARCIS also contains information from the Current Research Information Systems (CRISs) in the Netherlands on research, researchers (expertise) and research organisations. The data from the IRs and the CRISs in NARCIS are interlinked by identifiers such as the Digital Author Identifier (DAI), a unique identifier assigned to each researcher in the Netherlands. The NARCIS Suite (National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System: [URL] consists of three main products: the NARCIS Portal (HTTP), the NARCIS Index (SRU) and the NARCIS Repository (OAI-PMH). The NARCIS Portal makes the combined data searchable and {{available to the public}} at a national level.

40|$|Poster apresentado no CERN Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication (OAI 9), Genebra, Suíça, junho 2015. OpenAIRE 2020 is the European Union {{initiative}} for the Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe which supports open scholarly communication {{and access to}} the research outputs of European funded projects. The infrastructure operates on three levels: gathering research outputs and policy harmonization and community outreach. The current OpenAIRE infrastructure and services, resulting from the FP 7 projects OpenAIRE and OpenAIREplus, build on Open Access research results {{from a wide range of}} repositories and other data sources: institutional or thematic publication repositories, Open Access journals, data repositories, Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) and aggregators. The poster briefly outlines three complementary areas of the process of gathering Open Access and funded content: 1) the set of guidelines available for OpenAIRE data source managers (for Literature Repositories, Data Archives and CRIS managers), 2) the metadata curation and enrichment process that follows the OpenAIRE data curation policy, 3) the validator tool available for testing the guidelines compatibility of the data sources and their registration into the infrastructure. OpenAIRE collects research outputs from a network of data sources. To facilitate this, an integrated suite of guidelines was developed with specific requirements supporting the identification and monitoring of Open Access and the European Commission’s funded research, namely for instutional and thematic literature repositories and <b>national</b> <b>aggregators,</b> data archives, OA publishers and CRIS systems. OpenAIRE accepts into its infrastructure: 1) All global Open Access research outputs harvested from a range of repositories <b>national</b> <b>aggregators</b> and ejournals (peer-reviewed open access publications as well as grey literature like workshop reports, conference proceedings, technical reports etc.); 2) OpenAIRE also welcomes global open access content from non-European repositories and currently harvests from a number of international resources (e. g arXiv. org); 3) Where possible, the content should be related to funding information to help measure the impact of funding information; 4) Non-open access material will be accepted when it is related to European Commission funding information, or related to another OpenAIRE affiliated funder; 5) To complement OpenAIRE’s data acquisition policy, OpenAIRE is also collecting metadata of research datasets that are outcomes of a funded research project identified by a project identifier, or that are linked with a publication in the OpenAIRE information space. OpenAIRE Guidelines give recommendations to repository and other scientific information data managers about encoding of bibliographic metadata, while the validation service makes sure that bibliographic information that enters the OpenAIRE Information Space meets the OpenAIRE guidelines and ensures formal quality of content description. The guidelines have adopted established and existing practices with different classes of content providers: i) guidelines for Literature Repositories using Dublin Core, ii) guidelines for Data Repositories using Datacite Metadata Schema, iii) guidelines for CRIS systems based on CERIF-XML. They have in common the recommended use of controlled vocabularies (for publication type, language and date encoding, rights information and access mode); of persistent identifiers for publications, datasets; of proper information encoding about funding bodies and project grant Ids. Currently, OpenAIRE provides a rich graph of information about Open Access and funded research results. In particular and wherever possible, publications are linked to datasets and project information. This requires collecting different kinds of information: authoritative files about projects from funder databases, lists of repositories and ejournals from registries like OpenDOAR, re 3 data, DOAJ, and bibliographic information from these institutional or thematic data sources. In addition OpenAIRE’s knowledge extraction services enrich metadata records with links between research outputs, citation information and similar research publications. Furthermore users, e. g. project coordinators, are able to flag up relationships between data and publications, manually claiming links via the OpenAIRE portal related to a project in the OpenAIRE Information Space or in CrossRef/DataCite. The OpenAIRE infrastructure will continue to be developed by OpenAIRE 2020, a 42 month (2015 - 2018) project funded by the European Commission Horizon 2020 Programme. Its main objective is to establish an open and sustainable scholarly communication infrastructure responsible for the overall management, analysis, manipulation, provision, monitoring and cross-linking of all research outcomes (publications, related datasets, software and services) across existing, planned and future repositories...|$|R
