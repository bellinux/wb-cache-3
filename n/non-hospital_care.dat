40|$|Background: Accounting for 36 % {{of public}} {{spending}} {{on health care}} in Canada, hospitals are a major target for cost reductions through various efficiency initiatives. Some provinces are considering payment reform {{as a vehicle to}} achieve this goal. With few exceptions, Canadian provinces have generally relied on global and line-item budgets to contain hospital costs. There is growing interest amongst policy-makers for using activity based funding (ABF) as means of creating financial incentives for hospitals to increase the ‘volume ’ of care, reduce cost, discourage unnecessary activity, and encourage competition. British Columbia (B. C.) is the first province in Canada to implement ABF for partial reimbursement of acute hospitalization. To date, there have been no formal examinations of the effects of ABF policies in Canada. This study proposal addresses two research questions designed to determine whether ABF policies affect health system costs, access and hospital quality. The first question examines the impact of the hospital funding policy change on internal hospital activity based on expenditures and quality. The second question examines the impact of the change on <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care,</b> including readmission rates, amount of home care provided, and physician expenditures.

40|$|The 1999 {{reform of}} the Italian {{healthcare}} system has softened {{the effects of the}} 1992 shift to market mechanisms and competition within healthcare by promoting cooperation and partnerships among providers and Local Health Units (LHUs). In addition, it has facilitated the completion of transfering organizational and financial responsibility to the regional governments. Such health policy developments require both the introduction of administrative tools, which stimulates integration, and the design of a coherent policy for quality of care. A 3 -fold integration between healthcare and social services has been promoted to tackle the introduction of administrative tools: institutional integration between municipalities and LHUs, managerial integration at the district level for the provision of primary care and <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care,</b> and professional integration between healthcare professionals. A similar approach has characterized the policy for quality of care: an essential benefit package is to be identified as a guarantee to all citizens, practice guidelines will be developed and implemented and an accreditation process is underway. Implementation issues aside, effective introduction of the suggested tools requires careful planning and organization of the system and, above all, coordinated interventions at the 3 levels of healthcare provision (i. e. the macro, intermediary and micro levels). Health policy, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|E
40|$|Cancer is an {{important}} cause of illness and death, accounting for {{a high percentage of}} mortality in Western countries. In the Netherlands, about 30 % of all deaths is due to cancel' and the prevalence, an indicator of the present burden of illness to society, is clearly rising (Coebergh, 1991). In the last decades cancer treatment has shown a rapid evolution. It is now a multidisciplinary treatment strategy incorporating surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The high incidence and prevalence of cancer make this disease a major economic issue. The direct medical costs are considerable and are still rising due to the increased use of expensive drugs, radiotherapy equipment, the growing attention to various kinds of palliative interventions and survival success. In the Netherlands, the total direct medical costs of malignant cancer amounted to 1052 million dollars in 1988, that is 4. 8 % of total health care costs. About 60 % of this expenditure was produced by inpatient hospital care, about 30 % by outpatient hospital care and about 10 % by <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care</b> (Koopmanschap et al., 1994). It is expected that in 2020, as a result of ageing, these costs will have increased much more rapidly than total health care costs. Finally, the high prevalence of morbidity, mortality and the consequent loss in production also cause high indirect costs...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: 42 percent {{long-term}} {{patients from}} the Berlin Deinstitutionalization Study sample have been discharged to full-time institutional settings. METHODS: The questionnaires of a mail-survey covered features of 58 different non-hospital full-time institutional settings {{and care for}} a group of 125 long-term mental patients. RESULTS: The return rate was more than 70 percent. For 78 percent of the discharged former long-term inpatients the political goal of complete psychiatric care in the patient's home area has been reached, but only 20 percent live in smaller institutions of up to 40 places. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of other data of the survey does not exceed that of stock-taking and certain indications because of the selective data and the limitations of the method. There is an urgent need for further research in examining the quality of <b>non-hospital</b> institutional <b>care</b> for psychiatric long-term patients...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to examine the}} {{influence}} of socio-economic conditions, mental health and functional status on survival of a sample of people with AIDS. It is a longitudinal prospective study carried out in five infectious disease wards in Rome and Naples, Italy. Patients enrolled (total 168) are all diagnosed as having AIDS in 1992. The Functional Multidimensional Evaluation Questionnaire for people infected with HIV was administered to all subjects. It collects information on social and economic conditions, physical and mental health, self-sufficiency in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and on the demand for and/or utilization of a package of <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care</b> services. In the overall assessment, 11. 3 % of patients had inadequate socio-economic resources to cover their needs. More than half of those interviewed were partially or totally dependent on help to perform ADLs. There was a high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (60. 6 %). Lower CD 4 count and lower ability to perform ADLs were related to shorter survival with a mortality risk ratio by Cox regression of 1. 5 (95 CI: 1. 2 - 1. 9) and 1. 6 (95 CI: 1. 1 - 2. 3), respectively. A lower ADL performance level was also associated with a higher prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and reduced socio-economic circumstances. The ADL performance level could be a useful predictor of survival in people with AIDS. There was, moreover, a marked association between functional status, socio-economic resources and mental health. The results support the hypothesis that these three factors {{have an impact on the}} survival of AIDS patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{trends in}} the {{perception}} of quality and safety between 2009 and 2013 in the European Union (EU). DESIGN: We analysed data from waves 72. 2 and 80. 2 of the Eurobarometer survey. Multilevel logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and country-level health expenditure were fitted to assess changes between 2009 and 2013 in each of the assessed outcomes. SETTING: Twenty-seven EU member states. PARTICIPANTS: A total of n =  26 663 (2009) and n =  26 917 (2013) individuals aged ≥ 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included the perception of being harmed in hospital and non-hospital care; rating of the overall quality of the healthcare system; and personal or family experience of adverse events. RESULTS: Respondents in 2013 were more likely to think that it was likely to be harmed in hospital (Odds Ratio [OR] =  1. 09; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1. 05 - 1. 13; P <  0. 001) and <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care</b> (OR =  1. 11; 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 15; P <  0. 001), compared to 2009. However, {{they were more likely to}} rate the quality of their country's healthcare system as good (OR =  1. 26; 95 % CI: 1. 21 - 1. 32; P <  0. 001) and no significant change over time was identified in reported experience of adverse events (OR =  1. 00; 95 % CI: 0. 95 - 1. 05; P =  0. 929). Lower health expenditure and decrease in health expenditure between the two waves were associated with worse outcomes in overall quality and perceptions of harm. There was significant variation between and within countries in all indicators. CONCLUSIONS: The public's perception of safety in European healthcare systems declined in recent years, which highlights that there are safety issues that could be addressed...|$|E

We examine {{the effect of}} Medicaid recipiency on the level and site of medical service utilization using data from 1985 and 1987 surveys of New York City homeless single men and women. Simple regressions of Medicaid on the use of health services among homeless adults indicate that Medicaid significantly increases the likelihood that these individuals receive services, especially emergency and inpatient hospital services. We test this result in further analyses that control for health status, use instrumental variables procedures, and examine differences between a similar population in 1985 and 1987. These analyses suggest that Medicaid neither increases nor diminishes access to emergency rooms.

30|$|Perception of PHCPs {{who worked}} closely with FMS was an {{essential}} piece of feedback information to primary health care in this country. This study had provided an opportunity for other primary healthcare providers, hospital specialists and administrative staff at the health offices to feedback on the FMSs’ roles and performance. It had also provided family medicine specialty and specialists an invaluable source of data for self-reflection. We reported that PHCPs had overall positive perception on FMS across all the domains investigated. PHCPs from <b>non-hospital</b> health <b>care</b> facilities and who had higher frequency of encounter with FMSs had more positive perceptions. Discrepancy between perceptions and the relevance of certain clinical practices such as home visit {{may need to be}} communicated locally. Having shorter appointment interval and allowing walk-in consultation would be the areas of improvement in FMSs’ family practice.

40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} waste {{management}} in urgency and emergency <b>non-hospital</b> health <b>care</b> service units. Method: Epidemiological cross-sectional study undertaken at three Non-Hospital Emergency Units.

40|$|Background. The {{main focus}} of the survey is {{on the extent to}} which {{clinical}} pathways are being used, and whether it might provide a basis for improved service planning and consequently strategic asset planning in health care. Methods. In the first stage, our aim was to make contact with one agency in each country (the primary agency below) that would be able to provide contacts within that country with a mix of experts from each of the following types of agencies: Health sector government regulator, Health care purchasing (insurance) agencies, Senior clinical managers in hospitals, Senior clinical managers in <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care</b> provider agencies (eg, home care, or primary medical care), Health professional societies (preferably medical and nursing), Accreditation or audit agencies, Consumer associations and Public or private agencies concerned with health facilities development. Definitions of these agencies and other terms were attached to the questionnaire itself. We would then ask the primary agency to choose the experts that were most likely to be aware of clinical pathway use. The persons thus contacted would then be asked to complete the questionnaire and send it back to the researchers. The aim was not to attempt to establish a random sample, but rather to target well-informed people. Results. 51 completed questionnaires were provided by largely self-selected experts from 17 EU countries. Respondents reported that pathways are important and becoming increasingly widely used (although the rate of progress is highly variable), the main constraints to their use are a cultural aversion among doctors and little encouragement from external parties, and there is growing recognition that multi-setting pathways have the greatest potential value. Conclusions. More needs to be done to achieve a common understanding of the ideas of pathways, strategic asset planning, and the interrelationships. Systems problems need systems solutions. In the case of clinical pathways, this means not only increased education in medical schools. It also means including pathways in licensing and accreditation activities; linking them to product classifications like diagnosis related groups (DRGs); specifying their use in purchaser provider contracts; encouraging health care provider agencies to use pathways as the basis for internal resource allocation; promoting the use of pathways as the framework for improving the quality of health care, internal clinical auditing; running clinical teambuilding workshops; and so on. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The Primary Health Care System of Lazio Region {{currently}} {{requires a}} reconfiguration of the organizational network of hospital and <b>non-hospital</b> <b>care.</b> In this regard, Lazio Region {{in collaboration with}} Fimmg Lazio (Italian Federation of General Practitioners), has proposed an experimental project called “Ambulatorio Med (AmbMed) : Percorso veloce codici bianchi e Verdi”, which developed from the former project “Ambulatorio Blu” (Flu Management). In The 10 th Congress of the Regional School of Training in Family Medicine and the 2 nd Regional Congress of Fimmg Lazio was held on March 22 - 23, 2013. Here, data collected from several ASLs and hospitals involved the “AmbMed” project were presented. Objectives: The aim of “AmbMed” is to address and resolve illnesses of General Medicine {{in the context of}} Primary Care. Methods: The experimental project “AmbMed” of “F. Spaziani” Hospital in Frosinone ran from June 11, 2012 to April 23, 2013; it ensured medical care to citizens seven days a week from 8 am to 8 pm, extending the access to primary care at ER. Although there were 60 requests of participation to the project, 30 doctors of General Medicine joined the project and worked H 12 in shifts of 6 hours. The access mode to the “Ambulatorio Med” was through the Emergency Department Triage where nurses decided the appropriate priority code for the patient, according to the project protocol. Patients with white and green codes were visited by the AmbMed doctor; then, they were discharged and addressed to their general practitioner or hospital specialist or re-evaluated and sent back to ER for reassessment of the triage. The areas of AmbMed intervention dealt with the pathologies treated in primary care and included in the AmbMed protocol. Results: The Amb Med access were 3748 : 1124 (30 %) white codes and 2624 (70 %) green codes; males was 62 % and females were 38 %. The patients with 65 years old were 20 %. The patients’ origin was found of 18 % by Frosinone city and 75 % by Frosinone province; moreover there was 30 % of access of foreign patients. A clear overcoming of the protocol valuables was registered: the waiting times of white and green codes was reduced more than 50 % (expected reduction of 10 %) and the persistence times of white and green codes at the ER was more than 60 % (expected reduction of 10 %). The most frequently diseases in patients with 65 years old were the dermatological-allergic (28, 42 %), osteoarticular (20, 89 %) and eyes pathologies (15, 75 %). Discussion and Conclusions: The objectives defined by the trial protocol have been largely obtained. Data analysis, achieved goals, health workers’ professionalism, high satisfaction rating from visited patients, allow us to continue in this innovative way centred on the latest healthcare demands which resulted from this experience, integrating it {{on the basis of the}} new requirements for the reorganization of territorial primary care...|$|E
40|$|After {{decades of}} {{development}} {{of information systems}} dedicated to health professionals, there is an increasing demand for personalized and <b>non-hospital</b> based <b>care.</b> An especially critical domain is cardiology: almost two third of cardiac deaths occur out of hospital, and victims do not survive long enough to benefit from in-hospital treatments. We need to reduce the time before treatment. But symptoms are often interpreted wrongly. The only immediate diagnostic tool to assess {{the possibility of a}} cardiac event is the electrocardiogram (ECG). Event and transtelephonic ECG recorders are used to improve decision making but require setting up new infrastructures. The European EPI-MEDICS project has developed an intelligent Personal ECG Monitor (PEM) for the early detection of cardiac events. The PEM embeds advanced decision making techniques, generates different alarm levels and forwards alarm messages to the relevant care providers by means of new generation wireless communication. It is cost saving, involving care provider only if necessary and requiring no specific infrastructure. This solution is a typical example of pervasive computing and ambient intelligence that demonstrates how personalized, wearable, ubiquitous devices could improve healthcare...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2007, {{a new set}} of {{guidelines}} for blood exposure incidents was introduced in The Netherlands to standardize management and reduce use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg). Accidents now have to be assigned into risk categories with the corresponding medical intervention. AIMS: To study the consequences of the guidelines on overall risk assessment and costs of hepatitis B virus (HBV) prevention. METHODS: Incidents (n = 461) from both hospital as well as <b>non-hospital</b> health <b>care</b> workers and others registered by a call centre from the year 2005 were reassessed and reclassified as 'no-risk', 'high-risk' or 'low-risk' according to the corresponding risk categories of the new guidelines. The differences in classification, use of HBV immunoglobulin, source testing and the costs of the HBV prevention strategy were evaluated. RESULTS: Of all incidents, 86 % could be reassigned directly into the new risk categories. However, there was a significant shift from 'low-' to 'high-risk' incidents. Overall, administration of HBV vaccination increased and administration of HBIg decreased significantly, although within the group of high-risk incidents, administration of HBIg increased. There was no effect on the frequency of reference serum taken after an incident. While fewer incidents needed intervention, the total costs of HBV prevention still increased by 50 %. Total costs increased by 13 %, due to a shift in classification. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the new protocol facilitated standardized risk assessment for blood exposure accidents. HBIg administration and source testing decreased. An increased proportion of high-risk classifications resulted in an increase in the associated costs...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand for {{developing}} personalized and <b>non-hospital</b> based <b>care</b> systems to improve the management of cardiac care. The EPI-MEDICS project has designed a Personal ECG Monitor (PEM) capable of recording a simplified 4 -electrode, professional quality 3 -lead ECG, detecting arrhythmias and ischemia by means of committees of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and alerting the relevant health care professionals. Our objective {{is to improve the}} patient risk stratification and {{to reduce the number of}} false positive and false negative alarms by taking into account the demographic and clinical data featured by the user's Electronic Health Record (EHR) stored in the PEM device. To design and assess such a new type of system, we adopted a decision making solution based on Bayesian Networks (BN) that we trained to predict the risk of a cardiovascular event (infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) based on a set of demographic and clinical data (age, BMI, etc.) as provided by the INDANA database, from which we randomly extracted a training set of 15013 subjects and a testing set of 5004 subjects. The BN is then compared to an ANN committee (N= 50) and a Logistic Regression (LR) model in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). AUC = 0. 80 for the BN, 0. 75 for the ANN committee and 0. 74 for the LR model. Conclusion: the Bayesian Network approach achieved a high overall accuracy over both the neural network and logistic regression models on the testing set, and therefore can be useful in pHealth systems such as the PEM. 1...|$|R
40|$|Falls {{in older}} people are common, costly and {{potentially}} debilitating. Falls are {{the leading cause of}} injury-related hospitalisation and death in people aged 65 years and older, and often result in high economic and social costs. 1, 2 Depending on the population under study, between 22 and 60 % of fallers suffer injuries from their falls. 3, 4 Major injuries including soft tissue damage, head trauma, dislo-cations and fractures occur in 5 to 15 % of all falls in any given year. Furthermore, {{it has been estimated that}} 20 % of older people who experience a fall sustain injuries that require medical attention. 5, 6 Studies undertaken in Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom have drawn attention to the significant direct health-care costs required for the treatment of fall-related injury. 7 – 12 Two recent studies have used aggregated data to examine the current and projected costs of fall injuries in Australia. 13, 14 One study examined all injury cat-egories and found that fall injuries were the most costly of any injury mechanism. 13 The second study, which was Hospital and non-hospital costs for fall-related injury in community-dwelling older people Abstract: Objectives: This study determined the cost of fall-related health care in a cohort of community-dwelling people.

40|$|Decentralisation {{and equity}} are key {{goals of the}} South African health sector. Yet {{decentralisation}} typically threatens the equity of health care financing. This chapter maps the public funding of <b>non-hospital</b> Primary Health <b>Care</b> services across local government areas in four provinces. It also calculates measures of deprivation for each district municipality to indicate need for heath services. The equity of financing of Primary Health Care in relation to need is then evaluated and the equity of health care financing from different public sector sources is compared. This study reveals that the funding of Primary Health Care is extremely inequitable both across and within provinces. Local Government funding is the least equitable funding source, inversely related to need. Provincial funding does little to correct inequities {{and in some cases}} exacerbates the picture. Without intervention the country-wide financing of the standard Primary Health Care package, proposed by the national Department of Health, will prove impossible.

40|$|AIMS—To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} a selective hospital based hepatitis B immunisation programme and the barriers to be overcome in obtaining a successful outcome.  METHODS—Retrospective case note review of 265 infants born over a five year period to hepatitis B carrier mothers at a university affiliated hospital in Hackney, London.  RESULTS—A total of 242 infants (91 %) were fully vaccinated; 217 (82 %) had serology; 31 required booster doses. Percentages failing to reach second, third vaccinations, and serology on schedule rose exponentially (7 %, 18 %, 33 % respectively). Mobility was high (25 %) and significantly affected outcome. A total of 95 % Hackney resident babies were fully vaccinated compared with 78 % non-residents. Uptake of routine immunisations was higher in Hackney residents than non-residents and greater in those who were eligible for hepatitis B vaccine. Name changes occurred in 35 %. Translation requirements were high (85 % for Turkish, Vietnamese, and Asian families). Requirements for specific postnatal counselling of mothers and hepatology referral fell significantly {{during the course of the}} study. Only seven of 22 babies born in 1995 in Tower Hamlets compared with 53 of 58 Hackney babies received a full vaccination course in <b>non-hospital</b> based primary <b>care.</b>  CONCLUSION—In inner city areas with high prevalence of hepatitis B carriage, mobility, and diverse ethnicity, a dedicated centralised immunisation service can be highly effective, provided that adequate support services (translation, counselling, and parental referral) are available. ...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission, after {{engaging}} {{in an open}} Consultation {{on the need for}} Community action on health services, proposed to adopt a draft Directive with an internal market legal basis on the Application of Patients’ Rights in Cross Border Health Care. This draft Directive would provide some clarity about the rules to be applied for the reimbursement of health care provided in other Member States and how the rights of the patients would be implemented; reflecting principles applicable to <b>non-hospital</b> and hospital <b>care</b> respectively, respecting domestic practice of general practitioner referral. It would also clarify the criteria for procedures to be followed for cross border health care. Such procedures must be objectively justified, necessary and proportionate. The draft Directive would also require the establishment of mechanisms to provide information and assistance to patients through national contact points. It would be the responsibility of the Member State on whose territory the health services are provided to ensure that such provision accords to clear standards of quality and safety defined by that Member State in advance. Furthermore, patients would have to have a means of making complaints and obtaining redress should they suffer harm {{as a result of the}} health care they received. The adoption of the draft Directive which was scheduled for 19 December 2007 was postponed until early 2008 because of ‘a series of open and controversial questions needing further discussion’.

40|$|The global {{tuberculosis}} {{epidemic is}} being fuelled by dual infection with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type I. Short-course chemotherapy is effective but usually fails for operational reasons. A community-based treatment programme of twice-weekly fully-supervised treatment is described in which 89 % of surviving patients completed treatment under programme conditions. Half the patients were successfully supervised by non-health workers. New approaches are needed to combat the global tuberculosis epidemic. This article describes a tuberculosis (TB) treatment program which achieved {{a high rate of}} compliance and completion by close supervision in a supervised intermittent ambulatory treatment (SIAT) program in Zululand, South Africa. After patients had reported to a hospital for sickness and were subsequently diagnosed positive for TB, they were aligned with a SIAT center and a TB treatment site was selected. In most cases these assignments were chosen by the patient as a matter of personal convenience. In 1993, 36 % of the adults diagnosed with TB were also infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). Supervisors were selected to oversee each treatment site and were given responsibility for ensuring that patients took their medication. Supervisors also kept treatment records which were inspected by trained medical personnel. In cases where patients missed treatment appointments, the trained medical personnel would investigate. The SIAT program included a 6 -month chemotherapy treatment procedure conducted at supervised sites which included hospital-run clinics and <b>non-hospital</b> operated health <b>care</b> sites. The author reports that a full and complete course of chemotherapy is a critical aspect in the management of TB.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} extent of {{adherence}} to hand hygiene {{as a means for}} infection control by in-patients’ caregivers, and to identify factors in relation to caregivers’ adherence of hand hygiene practice guidelines. Background: Low compliance rate of hand hygiene among inpatients’ caregivers may lead to cross infection in hospitals and may be associated with detectable changes in the incidence of healthcare-associated infections. While hand hygiene education regarding infection control is given to each health care worker working in hospital settings, health care assistants and patients’ family members who often provide care to in-hospital patients have not received or undergone compulsory hand hygiene training. Little is known about the inpatients’ caregivers’ attitude towards hand hygiene and their hand hygiene practices in mainland China. Such information is particular important since <b>non-hospital</b> health <b>care</b> assistants (HCAs) and patient’s family members (PFMs) are common caregivers for in-patients in mainland China. Such information can guide policymakers to formulate specific health polices to prevent healthcare-associated infections. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted from February 2015 to March 2015 in a tertiary public hospital in Guangzhou, southern China. Survey data were collected using the pretested questionnaire developed by Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan on 232 health care assistants and patient’s family members selected in the Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Surgery and Department of Geriatrics in this hospital. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the frequency, mean, standard deviation and other statistics. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} hand hygiene knowledge and hand hygiene practice when caring in-patients, adjusted for the effect of demographic variables. The level of statistically significant was set at 0. 05. Results: Nearly half of health care assistants and patient’s family members had good knowledge of hand hygiene (mean scores= 69. 11 + 8. 25). Over 90 % participants had positive attitudes towards hand hygiene and current health education tools regarding hand hygiene. Only 41. 4 % of participants had good hand hygiene practice (mean scores= 24. 47 + 4. 36). Results of multivariate linear regression analysis showed that female gender (β= 1. 511, P= 0. 034) and knowledge level towards hand hygiene (β= 0. 07, P = 0. 001) had positive correlation with hand hygiene practice. Obstacles to hand hygiene mainly included misperception of gloves use, lack of time, and poor hand hygiene knowledge. Increasing hand washing facilities was considered as the most effective intervention to improve their adherence. Conclusion: Although the majority of patient’s caregivers had a positive attitude towards hand hygiene, lack of knowledge regarding ‘Five Moments for Hand Hygiene’ and low hand hygiene adherence still persisted among health care assistants and patient’s family members. Future study should explore strategies to improve HCAs and PFMs knowledge and practice about hand hygiene. Health education and surveillance regarding hand hygiene should be conducted among patient’s caregivers. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
40|$|The Malaysian {{health system}} has evolved {{significantly}} from the public sector dominated delivery system in the 1950 ’s to a more balanced public private health care system found today. Rapid expansion of the private health sector occurred from the 1990 ’s and as a consequence, private shares of health financing {{have been on the}} increase. This thesis on fair financing of health is motivated by welfare concerns arising from consumption of private health care by the poor, specifically the impact on household welfare caused by household out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments. The concept of fair financing generally holds that society has a moral obligation to ensure that the health needs of the poor can be met without requiring them to fully pay for the health care needed and consumed which they may not otherwise be able to afford. Fair financing for health is examined using data from three comparable nationally representative household expenditure surveys conducted in 1993 / 94, 1998 / 99 and 2004 / 05. The first part of the study, assessment of financial risk protection for health, looks at the distribution of household OOP health payments as well as comparing household OOP payments to two payment thresholds - a catastrophic payment threshold which is set at a predetermined share of household consumption and official Malaysian household poverty lines. In essence this part of the study measures extent to which distributions of OOP payments are favouring richer or poorer persons, levels of catastrophic health payments and medical impoverishment. Availability of data allowed financial risk protection to be assessed for the years 1993, 1998 and 2004. Financial risk protection for health has also been examined by geographical regions in Malaysia (Peninsular, Sabah and Sarawak), urban rural strata and ethnicity. Distributions of OOP payments have also been examined by public private sector providers and categories of health care services. The second part of the study assesses the progressivity of entire health financing system by measuring the progressivity of six health financing sources, namely personal income tax, sales tax, non-tax Federal Government revenues, social security funds from the Employee Provident Fund and Social Security Organisation, private health insurance payments and OOP health payments, singly and in combination. Availability of data and information allowed progressivity to be assessed for the years 1998 and 2004. This study has found evidence of fair financing in Malaysia which included small OOP payment burdens for the average person with distributions favouring richer persons, low levels of catastrophic health payments and medical impoverishment as well as an overall progressive health financing system, mainly made up of four progressive financing sources namely personal income tax, social security funds, OOP health payments and private health insurance payments. As expected, this study has found that OOP payments have been predominantly for the purchase of private health <b>care,</b> mainly for <b>non-hospital</b> based <b>care</b> and pharmaceuticals. Financial risk protection was higher among some sub-populations in the country including those living in Sarawak, rural areas and the Chinese. However, over time from 1993 to 2004, some features of fair financing appeared to have diminished where the distribution of OOP payments and households incurring catastrophic health payments became less concentrated among the rich. The overall health financing system was found to be progressive in 1998 and 2004. Changes in progressivity were too small to make a definite conclusion of the trends over time. Declining fairness in health financing in Malaysia may be explained by increasing OOP payments for private care and increasing uptake of private health insurance by poorer households. This in turn may be due in part to declining quality of care provided by the public health system which may have been partially caused by the rapidly expanding private health sector. If so, the situation is likely to worsen further if remedial actions are not taken. This study has provided two main health policy lessons with regards to private provision and private financing of health care. The first is that extensive taxation-based funding of health care can ensure fair financing despite high OOP health payment shares of total health financing in a country. The second is that a situation of fair financing can co-exist with a large private health sector financed mainly from OOP payments. The main message {{is that it is not}} so much the quantum of payments that matters but rather the distribution of payments...|$|R
