50|$|Since the {{tropopause}} {{responds to}} the average temperature of the entire layer that lies underneath it, it is at its peak levels over the Equator, and reaches minimum heights over the poles. On account of this, the coolest layer in the atmosphere lies at about 17 km over the equator. Due to the variation in starting height, the tropopause extremes {{are referred to as}} the equatorial <b>tropopause</b> and the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) {{has several}} well known biases that have {{important}} dynamical implications for research. Some {{examples of these}} biases include a cold temperature bias near the tropopause at high latitudes, systematic biases in the mean zonal wind, and transient momentum fluxes that are too strong. One method for investigating the impacts that these biases have is to use data assimilation techniques to reduce the bias and observe how the system reacts. The cold <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> temperature bias found in CAM is common to climate models. For the Northern Hemisphere, the bias is generally observed in the summer months. By assimilating a July 2003 set of observations {{in the region of}} this bias, we observe that reducing this bias forces the zonal jet and storm tracks to shift poleward. This finding mirrors the results of several earlier studies where the height of the <b>polar</b> <b>tropopause</b> influences the location of storm tracks and zonal jets by moving them equatorward as the height decreases, and poleward as the height increases as is predicted to occur with increased atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gasses...|$|R

40|$|Cornell University 2010 The <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> {{region of}} Mars is {{dominated}} by massive ice deposits and sand seas, and has been {{thought to be the}} product of the arid processes typical of the current martian geologic epoch, the Amazonian. However, new results from near-infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution images indicate that liquid water, in addition to ice, has {{played a major role in}} producing the unique compositions and morphologies of sediments in this region, and potentially elsewhere on Mars, during the Amazonian. This first major goal of this work is to investigate the composition of <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> deposits by developing new methods to map the distribution of hydrated minerals, weathering rinds, and ferrous minerals using near-infrared spectra from the Mars Express OMEGA imaging spectrometer. The distribution of these minerals and phases places constraints on both the transport and aqueous history of sediments in the <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> region. While previous detections of aqueous alteration products in this region were limited to the sand sea of Olympia Undae, results presented in Chapter 2 indicate that hydrated minerals are ubiquitous throughout the <b>north</b> <b>polar</b> sand sea an...|$|R
