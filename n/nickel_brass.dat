2500|$|The {{official}} {{currency of}} Ceylon was the Ceylon Rupee. The Rupee {{evolved from the}} Indian Rupee, when in 1929 a new Ceylon Rupee was formed when it was separated from the Indian Rupee. In 1950, [...] the Currency Board, set up in 1872 {{as a part of}} the Indian monetary system, was replaced by the Central Bank of Ceylon, granting the country greater control over the currency. In 1951, the Central Bank of Ceylon took over the issuance of paper money, introducing 1 and 10 rupees notes. These were followed in 1952 by 2, 5, 50 and 100 rupees notes. The 1 rupee notes were replaced by coins in 1963. In 1963, a new coinage was introduced which omitted the monarch's portrait. Coins issued were aluminium 1 and 2 cents, <b>nickel</b> <b>brass</b> 5 and 10 cents and cupro-nickel 25 and 50 cents and 1 rupee. The obverse of the coins issued since 1963 carry the coat of arms. However, until 1966, the Ceylon Rupee remained pegged to the Indian Rupee at a value of 1:1. In 1966, the Ceylon Rupee was pegged to the US Dollar at 4.76 rupees per US Dollar.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{accession}} of King Juan Carlos, {{there were}} a few changes. The replacement of Franco's portrait with that of Juan Carlos on the 50 céntimos and 1 peseta in 1975 and the addition of a cupro-nickel 100 pesetas in 1976. 10 céntimos were discontinued. However, more significant changes occurred to each coin in 1982. Following this redesign the 50 céntimos was discontinued, with aluminium replacing aluminum-bronze in the 1 peseta. A 2 pesetas coin was also introduced featuring a map of Spain, though this denomination never became popular. More importantly, <b>nickel</b> <b>brass</b> 100 pesetas were introduced. The redesign centered around the 1982 World Cup and depicted football (soccer) related themes on the 1, 5, 25, 50, and 100 pesetas. Shortly afterwords, the large cupro-nickel 100 pesetas by a smaller aluminim-bronze coin, which also replaced the 100 pesetas banknote. cupro-nickel 10 pesetas was introduced in 1983, a denomination that had previously not been issued for many decades. This preceded a wholesale redesign in all circulating Spanish coins and abandonment of the [...] "star" [...] dating system. Cupro-nickel 200 pesetas were introduced in 1986, followed by aluminium-bronze 500 pesetas in 1987.|$|E
