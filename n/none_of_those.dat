After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Ordnance Committee determined that a few CTLS-4TAC and 4TAYs would be dispersed to the U.S. Army and employed in the Aleutian Islands campaign.

5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.|$|E

Shareece Wright was selected in the thirdround (89th, San Diego Chargers); in the sixthround were Ronald Johnson (182nd, San Francisco 49ers) and Allen Bradford (187th, Tampa Bay Buccaneers); and in three consecutive picks in the seventhround were Stanley Havili (240th, Philadelphia Eagles), David Ausberry (241st, Oakland Raiders) and Malcolm Smith (242nd, Seattle Seahawks). Jordan Cameron, {{who had tried to}} transfer onto the team but forced to wait a year at a junior college before enrolling, was also drafted in the thirdround (102nd, Cleveland Browns).|$|E

When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E
5|$|Tailors, {{attracted}} by the affluent and influential nature {{of the residents of}} Savile Row, started to open businesses in the area in the late 18th century, first in Cork Street, about 1790, then by 1803 in Savile Row itself. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> original tailors survive today, though Henry Poole & Co, who through Edward VII's patronage, helped make the street fashionable, still have a presence in Savile Row.

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} December {{some large}} convoys of heavy {{artillery}} arrived at Almeida, but every one supposed that they were intended to fortify this place, and <b>none,</b> even <b>of</b> <b>those</b> most in {{the confidence of the}} commander-in-chief, had any idea that a winter campaign was about to commence. The French were equally unsuspicious of the truth. Twice as strong as the British, they dreamt not that the latter would take the offensive, and the French marshals had scattered their troops at considerable distances from the frontier in winter quarters.|$|R
60|$|New as Quentin was to {{scenes of}} splendour, {{the effect of}} that which was now before him rather {{disappointed}} the expectations which he had formed of the brilliancy of a court. There were household officers, indeed, richly attired; there were guards gallantly armed, and there were domestics of various degrees. But he saw <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the ancient counsellors <b>of</b> the kingdom, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the high officers of the crown, heard <b>none</b> <b>of</b> the names which in those days sounded an alarum to chivalry; saw <b>none</b> either <b>of</b> <b>those</b> generals or leaders, who, possessed of the full prime of manhood, were the strength of France, or of the more youthful and fiery nobles, those early aspirants after honour, who were her pride. The jealous habits, the reserved manners, the deep and artful policy of the King, had estranged this splendid circle from the throne, and they were only called around it upon certain stated and formal occasions, when they went reluctantly, and returned joyfully, as the animals in the fable {{are supposed to have}} approached and left the den of the lion.|$|R
5|$|The accident, {{along with}} other similar events, {{prompted}} the IAEA to re-evaluate {{the effectiveness of the}} radioactive hazard trefoil as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as ISO 21482, and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the County Court in Gospić {{tried and}} convicted in {{absentia}} {{a group of}} seven Croatian Serbs for their involvement in the killings of eight civilians (members of the Nikšić and Orešković families, but not the Rakić family) in Široka Kula, handing out prison sentences. Nikola Zagorac, Miroslav Serdar and Dragan Vunjak were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, while Dane Serdar, Dušan Uzelac, Milorad Barać and Dragan Uzelac each received sentences of 15 years in prison. In 1997, the County Court in Gospić also tried Vladimir Korica and Branko Banjeglav in absentia for {{taking part in the}} massacre. Both of them were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> convicted in absentia served any prison time. Dane Serdar voluntarily returned to Croatia in September 2003 and was granted a retrial as he had been convicted in absentia. Dane Serdar's 1994 conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in September 2004, after prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence against him.|$|E
5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but if the results called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E

5|$|Roe {{was rated}} as {{being one of}} Somerset better batsmen in their early years of {{first-class}} cricket, but his form in club cricket did not translate into good performances for the county. Between 1881 and 1882, Roe scored thirteen centuries, but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> came in county cricket. In fact, {{it was not until}} 1884 that he made his first hundred in first-class cricket, scoring 132 against Hampshire. His work as a schoolmaster limited his availability for Somerset, and he only played three first-class matches for them in each of 1884 and 1885. After the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{states the}} need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering {{that it would be}} dangerous during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still in its early stages, with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings. The document proposes to favor patriots, and fill the state offices with them. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism. He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay, and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.|$|E

Also they said that now the feud between him and Urco was bitter, but that Urco had the upper hand and was still {{in command of the}} armies. These armies, they declared, were immense and would fight us on the morrow, adding, however, that certain regiments of them who were of the party of Kari would desert to us in the battle. Lastly, they said that there was great fear in Cuzco, since none knew how that battle would end, which was understood by all to be one for the dominion of Tavantinsuyu.|$|R

And I ask you to remember that marvellous essay on Natural Theology--if I may so call it in all reverence--namely, the 119th Psalm; and judge for yourself whether he who wrote that did not consider the study of Embryology as important, as significant, as worthy of his deepest attention, as an Owen, a Huxley, or a Darwin. Nay, I will go further still, and say, that in those great words--"Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being imperfect; and in Thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them,"--in <b>those</b> words, I say, the Psalmist has anticipated that realistic view of embryological questions to which our most modern philosophers are, it seems to me, slowly, half unconsciously, but still inevitably, returning.|$|R
