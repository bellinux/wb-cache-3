25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and <b>numerical</b> <b>answer</b> type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E

[...] However, in applications, one is often interested in the precision of a <b>numerical</b> <b>answer.</b> [...] Both the number of terms and the value at which the series is to be evaluated affect the accuracy of the answer. [...] For example, if we want to calculate ƒ(0.1) = sin(0.1) accurate up to five decimal places, we only need the first two terms of the series. [...] However, if we want the same precision for x = 1, we must evaluate and sum the first five terms of the series. [...] For ƒ(10), one requires the first 18 terms of the series, and for ƒ(100), we need to evaluate the first 141 terms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Traditional, {{quantitative}} simulation {{based on}} quantitative models aims at producing precise <b>numerical</b> results as <b>answers</b> to user’s {{questions about the}} problem domain. Such precise <b>numerical</b> <b>answers</b> are often overly elaborate, and they contain much more information than it is actually needed. In every day life, humans use common sense to reason about problems qualitatively, without numbers. In the area of Artificial Intelligence, methods exist for qualitative modelling and simulation. In this paper, we review some ideas of qualitative reasoning and modelling. We also discuss qualitative data mining as an approach {{to the analysis of}} numerical data, and Q 2 learning which combines qualitative and quantitative approaches to modelling from data. Keywords: modelling, qualitative, quantitative, simulation, data mining, Q 2 learning Quantitative vs. qualitative modelling Traditional, quantitative modelling and simulation give precise <b>numerical</b> <b>answers.</b> For everyday use, such answers are often overly elaborate. For example, consider the bath tu...|$|R

In general, kinetic {{treatments}} of gelation result in large, unwieldy, and dense sets of equations that give answers not discernibly better than those given by the statistical approach. A major drawback of the kinetic approach is that it treats the gel as essentially one giant, rigid molecule, and cannot actively simulate characteristic structures of gels such as elastic and dangling chains. Kinetic models have mostly fallen out of use given how clumsy the equations become in everyday use.
