40|$|The Libyan {{media has}} {{dramatically}} changed in recent years. This {{has been most}} prominently manifest in {{the introduction of new}} satellite television <b>news</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis was designed to investigate two elements - patterns of news media consumption and news credibility in Libya. It examined the patterns of major local and international TV <b>news</b> <b>services</b> operating across different media, broadcast and print, and associations between Libyan students' consumption of different news media platforms. In this context, it investigated the news consumption habits of young people, with special attention paid to their consumption of pan-Arab <b>news</b> <b>services</b> broadcast via satellite television. It looked at the perception of gratifications students obtained from these <b>news</b> <b>services.</b> It also reported findings on students' perceptions of the credibility of two local, Al Jamahiriya and Al Libiya TV, and two pan-Arab TV <b>news</b> <b>services,</b> Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. In order to address the thesis research questions, a survey was administered to a sample of 400 undergraduate students at AI-Pateh University using a stratified random sampling approach, with the sampling strata set by demographic variables. The study found that the new TV <b>news</b> <b>services</b> {{played an important role in}} attracting young Libyans with information they desire. The spread of new news media sources (television, radio and print) in Libya has created a new type of customer that transcends national boundaries. Statistical analyses indicated that there are distinct news consumption demographic differences defined in part by news platform (TV versus radio versus print) and in part by the type of news provider (local versus non-local TV <b>news</b> <b>services).</b> The findings were discussed in relation to the growing impact of international satellite broadcast <b>news</b> <b>services</b> and the need for local TV <b>news</b> <b>services</b> to find methods of making themselves distinctive in a way that provides an alternative but still relevant and valued news sources. With regard to news credibility, in general Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya were given higher credibility scores than Al Jamahiriya and Al Libiya <b>news</b> <b>services.</b> Higher credibility ratings, however, were significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of reported watching of both local TV <b>news</b> <b>services,</b> but only one of the pan-Arab TV <b>news</b> <b>services</b> (AI Jazeera).
