60|$|Yet I {{experienced}} {{sometimes that}} the most sweet and tender, the most innocent and encouraging society {{may be found in}} any natural object, even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still. There was never yet such a storm but it was Æolian music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing can rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy the friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me. The gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house today is not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my hoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass, {{it would be good for}} me. Sometimes, when I compare myself with other men, it seems as if I were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any deserts that I am conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands which my fellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not flatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never felt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but once, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of them since. Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the <b>nearest</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no place could ever be strange to me again.|$|E

50|$|Under uterine primogeniture, {{succession}} to {{the throne}} or other property is passed to the male most {{closely related to the}} previous titleholder through female kinship.

40|$|Insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus usually presents in childhood. Since {{it is generally}} accepted that persisting metabolic derangements {{contribute to the development}} of micro- and macrovascular complications, a primary aim of the management of children with diabetes is to achieve <b>near</b> normalization <b>of</b> metabolism. In adults continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been used to optimize control. Despite a reluctance amongst paediatricians to use CSII in children, several studies with pumps have been performed in adolescents. The results of these studies are contradictory with respect to acceptability and achieved metabolic control. Thus, some authors report a <b>near</b> normalization <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> glucose concentrations, whereas others only find a temporary improvement. Patient selection seems to account for many of these differences. This suggests that methods ought to be developed to predict success or failure of CSII in a particular adolescent patient. For diabetic toddlers with their age-specific problems CSII may be a therapy of choice. So far, good acceptability and improved metabolic control are reported in this group. More studies are needed to confirm this. It is important that the diabetic clinic as well as the patient is organized to a high standard before starting CSII. Home blood glucose measurements, education, and a 24 -h telephone service are essential factors for the management of diabetic children, treated conventionally or with CSII...|$|R

Determinants of 25 (OH) D were analyzed in a subcohort of 1, 500 participants of the US Radiologic Technologists (USRT) Study that included whites (n = 842), blacks (n = 646), and people of other races/ethnicities (n = 12). Participants were recruited monthly (2008 - 2009) across age, sex, race, and ambient UVR level groups. Questionnaires addressing UVR and other exposures were generally completed within 9 days <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> collection. The relation between potential determinants and 25 (OH) D levels was examined through regression analysis in a random two-thirds sample and validated in the remaining one third.
