25|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> has {{the most}} effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> preferring single ply <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> or <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated <b>drum</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rotary {{transformers}} {{are most}} commonly used in videocassette recorders. Signals must be coupled from the electronics of the VCR to the fast-moving tape heads carried on the rotating head drum; a rotary transformer is ideal for this purpose. Most VCR designs require more than one signal to be coupled to the <b>head</b> <b>drum.</b> In this case, the cup core {{has more than one}} concentric winding, isolated by individual raised portions of the core. The transformer for the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> shown to the right couples six individual channels.|$|R
5000|$|In Video8 and its successors, {{the smaller}} <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> and tape make {{recorders}} {{more susceptible to}} the effects of [...] "tape dropout", where magnetic particles are eroded from the tape surface. As the audio/video signal is contained in a smaller area on a Video8 tape, a single dropout has a more damaging effect. Hence, dropout compensation in Video8 systems tend to be more advanced in order to mitigate the format's vulnerability to dropouts. In this respect, VHS's and Betamax's larger <b>head</b> <b>drums</b> proved advantageous.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with almost}} all cassette-based {{videotape}} systems, VHS machines pull the tape {{out from the}} cassette shell and wrap it around the inclined <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> which rotates at 1798.2 rpm in NTSC machines and at 1500 rpm for PAL, one complete rotation of the head corresponding to one video frame. VHS uses an [...] "M-loading" [...] system, also known as M-lacing, where the tape is drawn out by two threading posts and wrapped around more than 180 degrees of the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> (and also other tape transport components) in a shape roughly approximating the letter M.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is made of}} processed cow skin. Usually {{there are}} 12 hinges that hold the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to the wooden trunk using thick ropes. Typical <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> size is about 32 cm and about 23 cm inner diameter. Playing area of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is about 20 cm in diameter. Wedges inserted inside the ropes are twisted to tighten or loosen the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> while tuning. A tubular wooden wedge is tied to edge of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to roll using dominant hand. Traditionally the chande must be tuned to an octave above singers tonic (Higher Shadja).|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of moisture between {{the tape and}} the rotating <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> increases friction which prevents correct operation and can cause damage to both the recording device and the tape. In extreme cases, if the dew sensor fails to function and stop the video recorder, moisture can cause the tape {{to stick to the}} spinning video head. This can pull a large amount of tape from the cassette before the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> stops spinning. The tape will be extensively damaged, the video heads will often become clogged, and the mechanism may be unable to eject the cassette.|$|R

50|$|Helical {{scanning}} was {{a logical}} progression beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, {{also referred to}} as transverse recording. In this scheme, the rotating <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> runs essentially perpendicular to a 2 in tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. quadruplex systems revolve the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four <b>heads</b> on the <b>drum</b> so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use.|$|R

50|$|After {{leaving the}} <b>head</b> <b>drum,</b> the tape passes over the {{stationary}} audio and control head. This records a control track {{at the bottom}} edge of the tape, {{and one or two}} linear audio tracks along the top edge.|$|R

50|$|The bass <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is known}} as the eda muchchige and the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is known as}} the bala muchchige. The right <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is similar to tabla <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> but differs {{slightly}} creating a major tonal difference. The maddale unlike Mrudangam, Parkwaj or Tabla produces tonic when playing on the rim and on ink. The left <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> produces lower pitched bass sounds. The right <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> has a circular disk in the centre called karne or the ink causing the drum to produce harmonic tones. The left drum is smeared with a tuning paste made from ash and rice called bona, before the performance to dampen the tone and to produce bass sound.|$|R

50|$|The dew sensor {{itself is}} mounted {{very close to}} the video <b>head</b> <b>drum.</b> Contrary to how one might expect this to behave, the sensor {{increases}} its resistance when moisture is present. Poor contacts on the sensor can therefore be a cause of random dew sensor warnings.|$|R
