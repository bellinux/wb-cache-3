Social and cultural anthropologists, and some who integrate the two, {{are found in}} most institutes of anthropology. Thus the formal <b>names</b> of institutional <b>units</b> <b>no</b> longer necessarily reflect fully {{the content of the}} disciplines these cover. Some, such as the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology (Oxford) changed their name to reflect the change in composition, others, such as Social Anthropology at the University of Kent [...] became simply Anthropology. Most retain the name under which they were founded.|$|R

In 1945, the Glavgastopprom Oil Shale Processing Plant was established based on the existing plant. In 1946, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union approved {{the establishment of the}} diversified enterprise Kombinat No 7 {{on the basis of the}} Glavgastopprom Oil Shale Processing Plant for mining and processing Dictyonema argillite ore (a type of oil shale). The new plant was built mainly by using labour of war prisoners. In 1947 when the new factory was built, the code <b>name</b> Military <b>Unit</b> <b>No</b> 77960 was assigned to the Kombinat No 7. In 1955, a new code name Enterprise POB 22 was assigned. During the Soviet period, the enterprise was renamed several times and its names included Factory No 7, Enterprise P.O.B. P-6685, Sillamäe Metallurgical Plant, and Sillamäe Chemical Metallurgical Production Association.|$|R

On 1 May 1936 it was transferred to the Auxiliary Air Force and in July of that year the squadron converted to Hawker Harts.

40|$|The {{following}} {{study of}} recursive <b>naming</b> <b>units</b> sought {{to test the}} methods of meaning predictability outlined in Štekauer’s (2005 a) onomasiological account of word-formation. One of his experiments was repeated with new <b>naming</b> <b>units</b> according to their onomasiological structure. The <b>naming</b> <b>units</b> with embedded onomasiological structures were selected from the headlines found on online news websites. Štekauer’s own methods proved useful and accurate in assessing the predictability of the <b>naming</b> <b>units</b> for the following study; however, some of Štekauer’s conclusions from his experiment were contradicted by the findings in the study.
