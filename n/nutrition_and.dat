Approximately 5000 years ago, workers in the city of Uruk (modern day Iraq) were paid by their employers in beer. During the building of the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt, each worker got a daily ration of four to five litres of beer, which served as both <b>nutrition</b> <b>and</b> refreshment that was crucial to the pyramids' construction.|$|E

Method: A qualitative approach was used to investigate athletes eye on <b>nutrition,</b> training <b>and</b> recovery. Ten interviews were done face to face and notes was taken since no recording were done.

The importance and performance of 16 tasks of <b>nutrition</b> teachers <b>and</b> dietitians were measured using questionnaires. The data was analyzed by using the SPSS software and Importance–Performance Analysis (IPA).
