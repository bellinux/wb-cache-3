500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> I {{was going to do}} or how I was going to be scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2006, Insane Clown Posse fan Jacob D. Robida {{attacked}} {{individuals in}} a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts with a handgun and a hatchet—a weapon {{featured in the}} logo of the group's record label, Psychopathic Records. Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious that this guy had <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> being a Juggalo is all about. If anyone knows anything at all about ICP, then you know that they have never, ever been down or will be down with any racist or bigotry bullshit".|$|E
500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E

500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. Bobby Cooper from DVD Talk praised how {{the rules of}} American football are [...] "explained to a foreign audience that has <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> it's all about", adding that instructions at the commercial breaks [...] "were informative and similar to the Go lessons of Hikaru No Go." [...] He also said the explanations was [...] "hilarious", but that [...] "Eyeshield 21 is an excellent introduction to football". The on-field action was also praised, with he saying the sports action is [...] "where Eyeshield 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline gets a little boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio". Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 [...] "has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, {{but it is so}} sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} that Muthis was a very shadowly usurper, maybe related to the other usurper Psammuthes. Another option is that [...] "Muthis" [...] was simply a copying error, and therefore never existed; the latter hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} name is clearly hellenized but there are <b>no</b> <b>clues</b> of <b>what</b> could have originally meant [...] "Muthis" [...] in Egyptian.|$|R

Due to ageing, many older adults suffer declination of cognitive, motor and physical abilities. Many of them experience difficulties using certain features when interacting with their mobile phones, especially technology shift from keypad-enabled to touch-screen mobile user interfaces. However, {{there is still no}} profound knowledge about how to design for local older adults, and which particular role of affordance might play to ensure usability of mobile user interface for older adults. The role of affordance is very much related to how an older adult perceives a new mobile user interface when they first expose to it that s/he has never seen it before, and have <b>no</b> <b>clues</b> <b>what</b> to do with it.
