5|$|On May 29, 2011, the Route 404 Memorial Garden, {{located near}} Denton, was dedicated, honoring {{those who were}} killed in car {{accidents}} along MD 404. The memorial consists of a flagpole surrounded by a circular path with bricks bearing the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who died along the route.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} of the sinking is unclear, due {{to a number of}} factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The tablets {{were written}} in Akkadian, and they give {{information}} about the kingdom, its customs, and the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who lived during that time. More than 3000 are letters, the remainder includes administrative, economic, and judicial texts. Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50years of Mari's independence (c. 1800 – 1750BC), and most have now been published. The language of the texts is official Akkadian but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari's inhabitants was Northwest Semitic.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> he knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning {{of the use of}} his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within the book, and the round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the {{personal}} <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> of the time nor {{in the names of}} funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E

5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

25|$|However, nouns of {{this type}} which are proper nouns (particularly <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people)</b> form their plurals by simply adding -s: the two Kennedys, there are three Harrys in our office. With place names this rule is not always adhered to: Germanys and Germanies are both used, and Sicilies and Scillies are the {{standard}} plurals of Sicily and Scilly. Nor does the rule apply to words that are merely capitalized common nouns: P Ferries (from ferry).|$|E

5000|$|After the Partisans entered Dubrovnik on 18 October 1944, {{they arrested}} more than 300 citizens. 48 men {{suspected}} of being Nazi sympathizers were executed on Daksa without trial. Exhumation and DNA analysis have confirmed the identities of 18 of these, while 35 remain unknown. The Partisans later published and distributed flyers through Dubrovnik with the words: [...] "In the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia" [...] and [...] "Judicial Council of the Court Martial of the Command of South Dalmatian region". The flyers contained the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> 35 <b>people</b> killed on that date.|$|R

25|$|On July 29, 2011, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth granted Kutler's request, saying {{historical}} interests trumped privacy, {{especially considering}} that Nixon {{and other key}} figures were deceased, {{and most of the}} surviving figures had testified under oath, have been written about, or were interviewed. The transcripts were not immediately released pending the government's decision on whether to appeal. They were released in their entirety on November 10, 2011, although the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> still alive were redacted.|$|E
25|$|In the past, the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> {{from other}} {{language}} areas were anglicised {{to a higher}} extent than today. This was the general rule for names of Latin or (classical) Greek origin. Today, the anglicised name forms are often retained for the more well-known persons, like Aristotle for Aristoteles, and Adrian (or later Hadrian) for Hadrianus. However, less well-known persons from antiquity are now often given their full original-language name (in the nominative case, regardless of its case in the English sentence).|$|E
25|$|Inconsistencies and {{irregularities}} in English pronunciation and spelling have gradually increased in number {{throughout the history}} of the English language. There are a number of contributing factors. First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the Great Vowel Shift, account for a tremendous number of irregularities. Second, relatively recent loan words from other languages generally carry their original spellings, which are often not phonetic in English. The Romanization of languages (e.g., Chinese) using alphabets derived from the Latin alphabet has further complicated this problem, for example when pronouncing Chinese proper <b>names</b> (<b>of</b> <b>people</b> or places).|$|E

25|$|According to some theories, Basques may be {{the least}} assimilated remnant of the Paleolithic {{inhabitants}} of Western Europe (specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region known as Azilian) to the Indo-European migrations. Basque tribes were mentioned by Greek writer Strabo and Roman writer Pliny, including the Vascones, the Aquitani, and others. There is considerable evidence to show their Basque ethnicity in Roman times {{in the form of}} place-names, Caesar's reference to their customs and physical make-up, the so-called Aquitanian inscriptions recording <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> and gods (approx. 1st century, see Aquitanian language), etc.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{actions of the}} novel are very closely based upon the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811 {{carried out by the}} Royal Navy in 1810 under Commodore Josias Rowley with the assistance of army forces under Harry Keating. O'Brian notes this in the preface. Réunion (Île Bourbon or Île Bonaparte) was taken completely in July 1810, and Mauritius (Île de France, earlier called Mauritius by the Dutch) was formally captured on 3 December 1810. Many of the <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> involved in that action are given to characters in the novel.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the theme, all the sleeping, dining, and lounge cars on the train were named for people, places, or events {{connected}} with Washington's life. In the sleepers the rooms were likewise given <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> associated with him. Booklets about Washington's life, followed by descriptions of the new train, were issued in great quantity, the train appeared in advertising in major magazines and on C timetables, and the whole introduction was given huge attention and publicity. A country starved for good news latched onto the railway's confidence {{in the future and}} willingness to spend money to introduce a fine new train.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes other terms, such as Muslim {{with capital}} M were used (that is, [...] "musliman" [...] was a {{practicing}} Muslim while [...] "Musliman" [...] {{was a member}} of this nation; Serbo-Croatian uses capital letters for <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> but small for <b>names</b> <b>of</b> adherents).|$|R
