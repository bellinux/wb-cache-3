25|$|In {{contrast}} to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances. In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a <b>net</b> <b>current</b> account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E

In particular, {{we consider the}} statistics for a finite <b>net</b> probability <b>current</b> (Poynting vector) flowing through an open ballistic Sinai billiard to which two opposite leads/wave guides are attached. We show that if the <b>net</b> probability <b>current</b> is small, the scattering wave function inside the billiard is well approximated by a Gaussian random complex field. In this case, the current statistics are universal and obey simple analytic forms. For larger <b>net</b> <b>currents,</b> these forms still apply over several orders of magnitudes. However, small characteristic deviations appear in the tail regions. Although {{the focus is on}} electron {{and microwave}} billiards, the analysis is relevant also to other classical wave cavities as, for example, open planar acoustic reverberation rooms, elastic membranes, and water surface waves in irregularly shaped vessels.
