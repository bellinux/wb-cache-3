40|$|AbstractA closed-boundary, generic {{reservoir}} {{model was}} used to simulate CO 2 injection in saline formations typical of the Gulf Coast area located near a hydrocarbon-rich region. Reservoir properties characteristic of two formations (a shallow reservoir and a deep reservoir) were {{used to evaluate the}} impact of a gas cap on CO 2 plume behavior under different reservoir conditions. The initial amount of <b>native</b> <b>gas</b> in the hydrocarbon area greatly impacts the plume maximum lateral extent in both instances. As the initial gas-cap volume increases and injector-gas-cap distance decreases, the CO 2 plume reaches farther. Compressibility was calculated for different gas-cap compositions, showing that the mix of injected CO 2 with <b>native</b> <b>gas</b> (CH 4) is affected by pressure variations within the formation, causing compressibility values to be different for each case considered. This difference in turn impacts the plume lateral extent. Residual-gas-saturation conditions in the depleted gas cap are not expected to affect plume extent as much as in cases where water is residual. Reservoir simulations and compressibility calculations were performed by means of CMG-GEM and CMG-Winprop, respectively...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGas 6 is a ligand for an Axl/Sky {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} subfamily and has a structure composed of a Gla domain, four EGF-like domains and a C-terminal sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) -like domain. When examining the role of each domain in receptor-binding and biological activities of Gas 6, we found that receptor-binding and mitogenic activities were markedly reduced by inhibiting γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain, while a Gas 6 mutant composed of only an SHBG-like domain retained both of these activities. Thus, the SHBG-like domain is apparently an entity indispensable for Gas 6 activities, and γ-carboxylation of the Gla domain has a regulatory role in retaining the activity of <b>native</b> <b>Gas</b> 6...|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} from “lodging,” or bending over, by shoots of 42 -day-old Avena sativa plants is controlled primarily by a negatively geotropic differential {{growth of the}} lower halves of the p- 1 node-pulvinus and {{the base of the}} p- 1 internode, relative to the upper halves. Although geostimulation causes a significant reduction in p- 1 internode length, dry matter accumulation in the p- 1 node-pulvinus is increased, apparently {{at the expense of the}} sheath. Recovery to an angle of 30 ° is associated with changes in endogenous gibberellin-like substances (GAs), and in differential metabolism of applied [3 H]GA 4 (1. 4 Curie per millimole). Although geostimulation depressed total GAs (relative to upright plant parts) to 0. 40 and 0. 13 for node-pulvini and sheaths, respectively, it increased them 2 -fold for internodes. Within the plant part geostimulation increased GAs (relative to upper halves) 29 - and 7 -fold in lower halves of node-pulvini and internodes, respectively, but reduced GAs to 0. 3 in lower halves of sheaths.

We present metabolic evidence that the D 1 gene of maize (Zea mays L.) controls the three biosynthetic steps: GA 20 to GA 1, Ga 20 to GA 5, and GA 5 to GA 3. We also present evidence that three gibberellins, GA 1, GA 5, and GA 3, have per se activity in stimulating shoot elongation in maize. The metabolic evidence comes from the injection of [17 - 13 C, 3 H]GA 20 and [17 - 13 C, 3 H]GA 5 into seedlings of d 1 and controls (normal and d 5), followed by isolation and identification of the 13 C-labeled metabolites by full-scan GC-MS and Kovats retention index.

40|$|Chronic lower {{respiratory}} disease is highly {{prevalent in the}} United States, and there remains a need for alternatives to lung transplant for patients who progress to end-stage lung disease. Portable or implantable gas oxygenators based on microfluidic technologies can address this need, provided they operate both efficiently and biocompatibly. Incorporating biomimetic materials into such devices can help replicate <b>native</b> <b>gas</b> exchange function and additionally support cellular components. In this work, we have developed microfluidic devices that enable blood gas exchange across ultra-thin collagen membranes (as thin as 2 [*]μm). Endothelial, stromal, and parenchymal cells readily adhere to these membranes, and long-term culture with cellular components results in remodeling, reflected by reduced membrane thickness. Functionally, acellular collagen-membrane lung devices can mediate effective gas exchange up to ~ 288 [*]mL/min/m[superscript 2] of oxygen and ~ 685 [*]mL/min/m[superscript 2] of carbon dioxide, approaching the gas exchange efficiency noted in the native lung. Testing several configurations of lung devices to explore various physical parameters of the device design, we concluded that thinner membranes and longer gas exchange distances result in improved hemoglobin saturation and increases in pO[subscript 2]. However, in the design space tested, these effects are relatively small compared to the improvement in overall oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer by increasing the blood flow rate. Finally, devices cultured with endothelial and parenchymal cells achieved similar gas exchange rates compared with acellular devices. Biomimetic blood oxygenator design opens the possibility of creating portable or implantable microfluidic devices that achieve efficient gas transfer while also maintaining physiologic conditions.

40|$|We {{describe}} an equilibrium model that links the metallicity of low-redshift galaxies to stellar evolution models. It enables {{the testing of}} different stellar initial mass functions and metal yields against observed galaxy metallicities. We show that the metallicities of more than 80, 000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies in the low-redshift range 0. 07 ≤ z≤ 0. 3 considerably constrain stellar evolution models that simultaneously relate galaxy stellar mass, metallicity, and star formation rates (SFRs) to the infall rate of low-metallicity extragalactic gas and outflow of enriched matter. A feature of our model is that it encompasses both the active star forming phases of a galaxy and epochs during which the same galaxy may lie fallow. We show that the galaxy-mass-metallicity-star-formation relation {{can be traced to}} infall of extragalactic gas mixing with <b>native</b> <b>gas</b> from host galaxies to form stars of observed metallicities, the most massive of which eject oxygen into extragalactic space. Most consequential among our findings is that, on average, extragalactic infall accounts for one half of the gas required for star formation, a ratio that is remarkably constant across galaxies with stellar masses ranging at least from M* = 2 × 10 ^ 9 to 6 × 10 ^ 10 M_. This leads us to propose that star formation is initiated when extragalactic infall roughly doubles the mass of marginally stable interstellar clouds. The processes described may also account quantitatively for the metallicity of extragalactic space, though to check this the fraction of extragalactic baryons will need to be more firmly established.

40|$|The Diadema {{field is}} located 40 km {{northwest}} {{of the city of}} Comodoro Rivadavia on the northern flank of the San Jorge basin, Argentina. A gas-bearing layer known as “Banco Verde ” horizon, which pertains to the Cretaceous-Tertiary Salamanca Formation, occurs among various hydrocarbon-producing horizons, at an average depth of 500 meters below surface. Gas was produced from the Banco Verde horizon approximately between 1950 and 2000. During that period of time, reservoir pressure dropped from 25 bar (initial pressure) to about 5 bars. A portion of the depleted gas reservoir was then converted for natural gas storage purposes. Gas storage operations are carried out in the so-called Repsol-YPF licensed block. Nine operation wells are used for gas injection and withdrawal. Gas is injected into the reservoir during summer using the gas pipeline pressure. Then, it is withdrawn during winter and sent back to the pipeline using compressors. Due to the presence of hydrocarbons in the aquifers occurring above the Underground Gas Storage Diadema (UGSD), geochemical and isotopic determinations were performed to determine the source and monitor the proportions of the mixture of <b>native</b> <b>gas</b> and stored gas. Original reservoir gas, gas injected into the storage facility, gas occurring in overlying aquifers (Río Chico and Patagonia Formations), and gas from oil reservoirs occurring beneath UGSD were sampled.

40|$|In vitro {{studies of}} adverse {{cellular}} effects induced by inhalable substances face {{a number of}} problems due to the difficulties in exposing cultured cells of the respiratory tract directly to test atmospheres composed of complex gases and particulate compounds. This paper discusses the characteristics of in vitro work and summarizes the use of different in vitro technologies to determine the adverse effects of inhaled pollutants. The exposure of cells to test atmospheres requires accurate control of the pollutant levels, as well as the close contact of cells and gas without interfering with the medium. Systems which rely on the solution of the gas in the medium overlay do not resemble the exposure conditions in vivo, and may not be suitable for studying, for example, the effects of poorly soluble gases. Exposure to gases or complex mixtures can be performed with roller bottles or flasks on rotating and rocking platforms and, using these techniques, the cells are periodically exposed to the test atmosphere. However, the most promising approach is based on a biphasic cell culture technique, where cells are grown on microporous membranes at an air-liquid interface. Here the cells are nutrified from the basal side of the membrane whilst the apical part with the cultivated cells is in direct contact with the test atmosphere. Based on this culture technique, different exposure systems have been developed and these are described and discussed. Exposure of cells from the respiratory tract to gases or particles is responsible for cell injury or cell activation associated with an overexpression of mRNA and the release of bioactive mediators. Therefore, in vitro studies using such a strategy, in combination with relevant and efficient exposure devices, open up new ways to test <b>native</b> complex <b>gases</b> and aerosols. Furthermore, such an experimental approach is not only suitable for cultivated cells, {{but it can also be}} used for exposing bacteria to inhalable test compounds. It is possible to analyze the mutagenic potency of in- and outdoor pollutants and several attempts have been made to determine the induction of revertants in a modified Ames assay after exposure to single gases or complex mixtures...|$|R

Some estimates indicate that <b>native</b> natural <b>gas</b> and oil reserves, on which Egypt's electricity generation currently relies, will run out in about 30 or 40 years, making the transition to alternative energy sources a pressing need to avoid stagnant economic development. Renewable energy technologies are slowly being introduced in rural communities to promote alternative sources of energy from biomass, which are abundantly produced. The calculated potential for biomass resources in Egypt {{is expected to reach}} 40 million tones per year. According to the New and renewable Energy Authority (NREA) the contribution of biomass to primary energy may reach more that 3. 6 million tones of equivalent energy. Furthermore, biodiesel and biofuel production technologies for domestic use are currently in the research and development phase. Bio-fuels are major source including the municipal solid waste reforming process. Municipal solid wastes have been inadequately managed for many years in the country. Waste collection systems have left large areas (up to 70 percent in some cases) of towns and cities unserviced or under-serviced. Large amounts of wastes piled up in streets and vacant areas between buildings, in addition to the spread of informal dumpsites in a number of central areas.

It covers the full spectrum of waste management activities from street cleaning to collection and treatment of all the household and commercial waste generated in the city.

In contrast to other exposure systems the reproducible testing of <b>native</b> environmentally relevant <b>gases</b> without changing their physical or chemical properties including heating, CO 2 -content and humidity is possible. Specially designed systems for medium flow and gas support guarantee the nutrification and humidification as well as the direct gas contact of the exposed cells which are cultivated on microporous membranes (0. 4 microm pore size). The system works independently of a cell culture incubator offering the possibility to analyze any relevant gas mixture directly under indoor or outdoor conditions. Several experimental approaches were carried out to characterize the properties of the system. In exploratory experiments without cells, the reproducibility and quality of the gas/membrane contact could be demonstrated. Exposures of human lung fibroblasts (Lk 004 cells) and human lung epithelial cells (HFBE- 21 cells) to synthetic air, ozone (202 ppb, 510 ppb) and nitrogen dioxide (75 ppb to 1, 200 ppb) established that cells could be treated for 120 minutes without significant loss of cellular viability. At the same time, the experiments confirmed that such exposure times are long enough to detect biological effects of environmentally relevant gas mixtures. The analysis of viability (viable cell number, tetrazoliumsalt cleavage) and intracellular end-points (oxidized/reduced glutathione, ATP/ADP) showed that both gases induced relevant cellular changes.

Previous studies have found two X-ray cavities in the central regions of A 4059 together with a ridge of X-ray emission 20 kpc south-west of the cluster center. These features are clearly related to the radio galaxy PKS 2354 - 35 which resides in the cD galaxy. Our new data confirm these previous findings and strengthen previous suggestions that the south-western ridge is colder and denser than, but in approximate pressure equilibrium with, the surrounding ICM atmosphere. In addition, we find evidence for a weak shock that wraps around {{the north and east}} sides of the cavity structure. Our data allow us to map the 2 -dimensional distribution of metals in the ICM of A 4059 for the first time. We find that the SW ridge possesses an anomalously high (super-solar) metalicity. The unusual morphology, temperature structure and metal distribution all point to significant asymmetry in the ICM atmosphere prior to the onset of radio-galaxy activity. Motivated by the very high metalicity of the SW ridge, we hypothesize that the ICM asymmetry was caused by the extremely rapid stripping of metal enriched gas from a starburst galaxy that plunged through the core of A 4059. Furthermore, we suggest that the onset of powerful radio-galaxy activity in the cD galaxy may have been initiated by this starburst/stripping event, either via the tidal-shocking of cold <b>gas</b> <b>native</b> to the cD galaxy, or the accretion of cold gas that had been stripped from the starburst galaxy.

40|$|Plasticization is of {{important}} concern in high pressure natural gas separation. Majority of the pure polymers and MOF-MMM systems suffer from plasticization at low pressures. Combination of polymer blending and MMM approach {{could lead to}} plasticization resistant membranes with improved membrane performance. In this work, the gas separation performance of Matrimid® and PSF blend membranes containing ZIF- 8 nanoparticles, were studied. The effect of ZIF- 8 loading on the gas transport and plasticization behavior of the blend-MOF MMMs was investigated. Gas permeability measurements of PI/PSF-ZIF- 8 MMMs showed significant improvements in permeability of both CO 2 and CH 4, compared to pure reference polymer membrane. At a high loading of 30 wt% ZIF- 8, MMM showed an enhancement of 136 % in CO 2 permeability compared to the pure PI/PSF membrane, while the selectivity stayed constant. This increase in the permeability {{could be related to}} the moderate increase in sorption capacity and faster diffusion of gases through the ZIF- 8 nanoparticles. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO 2 permeability and the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity were mainly governed by the increase in CO 2 diffusion coefficient. Blend MMMs were considerably more resistant to plasticization phenomenon compared to the pure PI membrane. For pure <b>gases,</b> <b>native</b> PI/PSF blend membrane showed a plasticization pressure of ∼ 18 bar, which increased to ∼ 25 bar up to 30 wt% ZIF- 8 loading. Short and long CO 2 exposure time experiments, with different upstream pressures, showed that the permeability stayed constant in time at pressures below the plasticization pressure while a noticeable increase in permeability was recorded in time at higher pressures. Additionally, these experiments showed that the extent of dilation in the pure PI/PSF membrane was much higher compared to the PI/PSF-ZIF- 8 MMMs. In mixed gas (50 / 50 mol% CO 2 /CH 4) experiments, the pure PI/PSF membrane and the MMMs did not show plasticization over the pressure range investigated, as confirmed by a constant mixed gas CH 4 permeability and nearly constant selectivity with pressure. While the pure PI and PI-ZIF- 8 MMMs showed the plasticization behavior. Comparing the mixed gas performance of PI/PSF-ZIF- 8 membranes with that of pure PI/PSF membranes at high pressures an increase of 197 % in CO 2 permeability and 30 % in CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity was obtained. These results showed that the combination of polymer blending and the mixed matrix membrane approach offers a simple and economically versatile tool to approach higher CO 2 permeabilities and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivities while maintaining a stable separation performance in processes involving higher CO 2 partial pressures...|$|R

In that sense, they are of first importance for a proper understanding of the behaviour of an aquifer where injected fluids differ from the <b>native</b> ones (natural <b>gas</b> seasonal storage, enhanced oil recovery, geological storage of hydrogen, geological storage of carbon dioxide). By multiphase {{flow properties}}, one mostly means two different properties: capillary pressure and relative permeability. These properties {{have been shown to}} be dependent on the rock itself (wetting character), on the fluids considered and on the conditions at which they are measured, namely the pressure, temperature and the ratio between the different forces (e. g. capillary and advective forces). The research effort on CO 2 geological storage during the past fifteen years has given rise to the study of the CO 2 /brine system in porous media. The main purpose of these works was to gather data for different rocks and conditions but also to understand the differences, if they exist, of this two-phase flow system compared to other ones. All these different works have also lead to the progressive building of best practices adapted to CO 2 /brine system at storage depth conditions. In this study, new measurements have been performed on Triassic sandstone from Paris Basin, France following these best practices. A full characterization of one sample has been done using the two-phase flow core flooding apparatus with Magnetic Resonance Imaging, designed and developed at Tsinghua University, China: porosity, permeability, capillary pressure, relative permeability (with hysteresis between drainage and imbibition) and residual trapping capacities have been assessed. New methodologies for relative permeability and capillary pressure (joint determination of capillary pressure and relative permeability curves using core-flooding technique by Pini and Benson, 2013, in Water Resour. Res.) and classical ones (steady-state measurement of relative permeability, mercury injection capillary pressure) have been undertaken. The extensive data set obtained allows discussing the challenges to be faced when doing such measurements. First the uncertainties linked with the different measurements have been quantified. In addition to that important aspect, we focused on two other challenges that seem of primary importance when the obtained parameters and curves have to be used for large scale storage assessment: 1) The variability of the parameters (especially two-phase flow ones) over time: in our case, some mineral dissolution seemed to occur during the experiments campaign and it has been possible to quantify the associated changes in absolute and two-phase flow properties. The evolution of each parameter has been studied independently and has shown an increase in porosity, absolute permeability and CO 2 -relative permeability and a decrease in capillary pressure. The pore structure modifications has been confirmed with regular MR measurements during the experimental campaign, and some mineralogical analyses have been done on initial and after-experiment rock samples to understand the causes of the observed changes in flow properties. 2) The heterogeneity within the sample: the sample used for the experimentations being slightly heterogeneous, we have been able to study the impact of these heterogeneities in the two-phase flow curves measurement. More precisely, a combination of different ways of measuring capillary pressure and of two-phase flow modelling enable a better understanding of the differences in capillary pressure along the core...|$|R
