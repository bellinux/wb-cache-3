Camping tents are often equipped with extra-fine mesh netting, called <b>no-see-um</b> nets, to keep the pests out. One experienced researcher recommends: [...] "A mesh size of 4900 (per square inch) will stop most biting midges, but to ensure that even the smallest cannot feast on you, a mesh size of 10,000 is necessary." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sandfly (or sand fly) is a colloquial {{name for}} any species or genus of flying, biting, blood-sucking {{dipteran}} (fly) encountered in sandy areas. In the United States, sandfly may refer to certain horse flies {{that are also}} known as [...] "greenheads" [...] (family Tabanidae), or {{to members of the}} family Ceratopogonidae, also known in Florida and elsewhere as a sand gnat, sandflea, <b>no-see-um</b> (no-see-em, noseeum), granny nipper, chitra, punkie, or punky. Outside the United States, sandfly may refer to members of the subfamily Phlebotominae within the Psychodidae. Biting midges (Ceratopogonidae) are sometimes called sand flies or no-see-ums (no-see-em, noseeum). New Zealand sandflies are in the Austrosimulium genus, a type of black fly.|$|E

5000|$|Ceratopogonidae, or biting midges, are {{a family}} of small flies (1-4 mm long) in the order Diptera. They are also known as <b>no-see-ums,</b> midgies, sand flies, punkies, and others in North America, and sandflies in Australia. (The name [...] "sandfly" [...] is ambiguous, as it is also applied informally to many other flies, such as the {{subfamily}} Phlebotominae.)

25|$|Frogs are {{commonly}} found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the American toad and species of chorus frogs commonly called spring peepers, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs. Mosquitoes, <b>no-see-ums,</b> and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are nearly universally fitted with screens. Invasive populations of honeybees have sharply declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and armadillos have been regularly seen throughout the St. Louis area, especially since 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{wildlife}} easily seen are house geckos (Gekkonidae), {{ground and}} tree lizards, hermit crabs, land crabs (Coenobitidae). sea turtles are reputed to come ashore to lay eggs but rare tracks {{are usually the}} only indication that they have visited. The island also provides habitation for pigeons and doves (Columbidae), common blackbird, tropical mockingbird, sandpipers, bananaquit, blue and crowned herons (Botaurus) and hummingbirds.

40|$|What is bluetongue? Bluetongue is {{a disease}} of {{ruminant}} livestock that {{is caused by the}} bluetongue virus. Bluetongue virus does not cause disease in humans. This virus is transmitted to livestock by selected species in the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Cerato-pogonidae). These small insects are biting midges and in some areas are called <b>no-see-ums,</b> sand flies or punkies. Bluetongue virus was among the first recognized insect borne viruses. The disease was first described in livestock in South Africa in 1902. Bluetongue virus is widely distrib-uted throughout the tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world wherever different competent species of Culicoides occur. Bluetongue outbreaks can result in millions of dollars in losses due to the impact on livestock health and notably in the loss of markets for livestock du...|$|R
50|$|Florida {{became a}} state in 1845, but the keys weren’t officially {{incorporated}} until 1870 after they were surveyed by Charles F. Smith. According to locals the key was named after an old settler circa 1855, other documents state the key as being named “Ellis Island before 1855.” The early pioneers suffered from clouds of mosquitos and <b>no-see-ums.</b> They lived in thatched roofed houses that were regularly mowed down by hurricanes, and were cut off from civilization because the island was only navigable by boat. After the FEC built the railroad in 1908, and it brought some prosperity to the area. It connected the island to civilization and opened up {{an opportunity for a}} tourism industry, and ease of moving goods like pineapple, key limes, sponges, charcoal, and shark skins.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Age-grading {{of insects}} is {{important}} in the control and monitoring of both insect populations and vector-borne diseases. Microscopy and morphological techniques exist to age-grade most blood-feeding flies, but these techniques are laborious, often destructive to the insects, and slow. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be automated and is a non-destructive technique for age-grading. We applied NIRS techniques to age-grade females of the biting midge, Culicoides sonorensis Wirth & Jones (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), the vector of bluetongue and other arboviruses in North America. Female flies of five known age cohorts (1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days post-emergence) from three laboratory colonies were used. The data indicate that NIRS can be used to differentiate age groups of C. sonorensis. Key words. Culicoides, age-grading, bluetongue, near-infrared spectroscopy. Blood-feeding species of Ceratopogonidae, commonly known as biting midges, <b>no-see-ums</b> or sandflies, are annoying pests and transmit arboviruses, malarial parasites and filarial nema-todes to humans, domestic animals and wildlife (Borkent...|$|R
40|$|Black light traps {{were used}} to measure the {{seasonal}} and geographical distribution of Culicoides spp. (biting midges or <b>no-see-ums)</b> at 9 cowsheds in the southern half of the Republic of Korea (ROK) from June through October 2010. A total of 25, 242 Culicoides females (24, 852; 98. 5 %) and males (390; 1. 5 %) comprising of 9 species were collected. The most commonly collected species was Culicoides punctatus (73. 0 %) followed by C. arakawae (25. 7 %), while the remaining 7 species accounted for < 1. 0 % of all Culicoides spp. collected. The mean number of Culicoides spp. collected per trap night (Trap Index [TI]) was highest for C. punctatus (409. 3), followed by C. arakawae (144. 2), C. tainanus (4. 1), C. oxystoma (1. 2), C. circumscriptus (0. 7), C. homotomus (0. 6), C. erairai (0. 4), C. kibunensis (0. 3), and C. nipponensis (0. 04). Peak TIs were observed for C. punctatus (1, 188. 7) and C. arakawae (539. 0) during July and August, respectively. C. punctatus and C. arakawae have been implicated in the transmission of arboviruses and other pathogens of veterinary importance that adversely impact on animal and bird husbandry...|$|R
