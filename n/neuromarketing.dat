25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called <b>neuromarketing,</b> is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when we die we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. <b>Neuromarketing</b> aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscience is also {{allied with}} the social and {{behavioral}} sciences as well as nascent interdisciplinary fields such as neuroeconomics, decision theory, social neuroscience, and <b>neuromarketing</b> to address complex questions about interactions of the brain with its environment. A study into consumer responses for example uses EEG to investigate neural correlates associated with narrative transportation into stories about energy efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The EEG {{has been}} used for many {{purposes}} besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. An early use was during World War II by the U.S. Army Air Corps to screen out pilots in danger of having seizures; long-term EEG recordings in epilepsy patients are still used today for seizure prediction. Neurofeedback remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attempted as the basis of brain computer interfaces. The EEG is also used quite extensively in the field of <b>neuromarketing.</b> In recent years, researchers have relied on EEG to understand the neural basis of swallowing.|$|E
25|$|Cells are the {{building}} blocks of all living organisms. Within these cells are coils of DNA, genetic information instructing for how our cells will develop and operate. A small segment of DNA is a gene which codes for the making of proteins and passing on traits to offspring in reproduction. The main goal of a gene is to reproduce and thrive in its environment in relative to competitors. Practical implications in crime investigation, disorders and increasingly talent prediction and career decision making have considered their association with genes and biology, but the idea of biology and marketing is a growing body of knowledge. <b>Neuromarketing</b> is a new phenomenon studying consumer’s reactions to marketing stimuli.|$|E
25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. <b>Neuromarketing</b> is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume the way we do still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{politics}} of <b>neuromarketing</b> is {{this idea of}} using advertisements to convince {{the mind of a}} voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go {{back to the days of}} the recalled governor, Gray Davis. In normal marketing, voters would use [...] "detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor". However, with <b>neuromarketing,</b> voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political <b>neuromarketing,</b> there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political <b>neuromarketing</b> are debatable. Some argue that political <b>neuromarketing</b> will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, [...] "a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial clients in 2010". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{experiments}} {{have shown the}} neural correlates of peoples' brand preferences. Samuel M. McClure used fMRI to show the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and midbrain were more active when people knowingly drank Coca-Cola as opposed to when they drank unlabeled Coke. [...] Other studies have shown the brain activity that characterizes men's preference for sports cars, and even differences between Democrats and Republicans in their reaction to campaign commercials with images of the 9/11 attacks. <b>Neuromarketing</b> companies have seized on these studies as a better tool to poll user preferences than the conventional survey technique. One such company was BrightHouse, now shut down. Another is Oxford, UK-based Neurosense, which advises clients how they could potentially use fMRI {{as part of their}} marketing business activity. A third is Sales Brain in California.|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} {{has become}} a mainstream component of consumer research methods. International market research company, Nielsen Research, has recently added <b>neuromarketing</b> to its services by acquiring Innerscope, a company specialising in <b>neuromarketing</b> research thus enabling Nielsen to add <b>neuromarketing</b> research to the suite of services available to clients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neuromarketing</b> is a {{distinct}} discipline closely related to neuroeconomics. While neuroeconomics has more academic aims, since it studies the basic mechanisms of decision-making, <b>neuromarketing</b> is an applied field which uses neuroimaging tools for market investigations.|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} (also {{known as}} <b>neuromarketing)</b> {{refers to the}} commercial use of neuroscience when applied to the investigation of marketing problems and consumer research. Some researchers {{have argued that the}} term consumer neuroscience is preferred over <b>neuromarketing</b> or other alternatives.|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} {{is similar}} to neuroeconomics and <b>neuromarketing,</b> but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them. Neuroeconomics {{is more of an}} academic field while <b>neuromarketing</b> and consumer neuroscience are more of an applied science. <b>Neuromarketing</b> focuses on the study of various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies. Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Neuro{{marketing}},</b> marketing designed on {{the foundation}} of neuroscience, is the most recent mechanical method utilized to understand consumers (Kolter, Burton, Deans, Brown & Armstrong, 2013). <b>Neuromarketing</b> is also used with Big Data in understanding modern-day advertising channels such as social networking, search behaviour and website engagement patterns.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, both Neurosense (UK) and Gerald Zaltman (USA) had {{established}} <b>neuromarketing</b> companies. In 2006, Dr. Carl Marci founded Innerscope Research, which {{was acquired by}} Nielsen in May 2015 and renamed Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience. Unilever's Consumer Research Exploratory Fund (CREF) too had been publishing white papers on the potential applications of <b>Neuromarketing.</b>|$|E

50|$|His {{research}} interests {{are in the}} fields of neuroscience, neuroeconomics and particularly <b>neuromarketing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Advocates {{nonetheless}} {{argue that}} society benefits from <b>neuromarketing</b> innovations. German neurobiologist Kai-Markus Müller promotes a <b>neuromarketing</b> variant, [...] "neuropricing", that uses data from brain scans to help companies identify the highest prices consumers will pay. Müller says [...] "everyone wins with this method," [...] because brain-tested prices enable firms to increase profits, thus increasing prospects for survival during economic recession.|$|E

50|$|<b>Neuromarketing</b> and its precursor, neuroeconomics, uses {{clinical}} {{information about}} brain functions and mechanisms tohelp explain {{what is happening}} inside of the “black box” so prevalent in many explanations of consumer behavior. In order to do so, specialists use neuroimaging techniques and record brain responses to different stimuli.The <b>Neuromarketing</b> Science & Business Association has launched on November 2012 a <b>Neuromarketing</b> Code of Ethics. This {{is a first step}} towards adopting international standards applied to using neuroscientific methods to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, packaging and product design, as well as communication campaigns from non-profit organizations and government institutions. However, some ethicists condemn the code as protecting only a very narrow class, and in the extreme position that <b>neuromarketing</b> itself should only be used for the advancement of what is reasonably believed to be public good, employing Thomas Aquinas' doctrine of double effect (DDE). Although one could make the argument that engineering profit serves the public good, it would not be saved under the DDE because the intention behind it is not to generate a greater good than to which the collective harm of manipulation is greater. However, <b>neuromarketing</b> programs to encourage healthy lifestyle choices may be saved under the DDE, provided it is based on good scientific information in the first place, such as regular exercise.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neuromarketing</b> {{engages the}} use of Magnetic Resance Imaging (MRI), {{electroencephalography}} (EEG), biometrics, facial coding, eye tracking and other technologies in investigating and learning how consumers respond and feel when presented with products and/or related stimuli (Kolter et al., 2013). The concept of <b>neuromarketing</b> investigates the non-conscious processing of information in consumers brains (Agarwal & Dutta, 2015). Human decision-making is both a conscious and non-conscious process in the brain (Glanert, 2012). Human brains process over 90% of information non-consciously, below controlled awareness; this information has a large influence {{in the decision-making process}} (Agarwal & Dutta, 2015). Conventional market research, such as focus groups or surveys, are typically used to understand behaviour and decision-making. However, these research methods do not reach the non-conscious thinking of consumers. This results in an incompatibility between market research findings and the actual behaviour exhibited by the target market at the point of purchase (Agarwal & Dutta, 2015). <b>Neuromarketing</b> rather focuses on the MRI and EEG scans which produce brain electrical activity as well as blood flow. Market researchers use this information to determine if products or advertisements stimulate responses in the brain linked with positive emotions (Kolter et al., 2013). The concept of <b>neuromarketing</b> was therefore introduced to study relevant human emotions and behavioural patterns associated with new products, ads and decision-making (<b>Neuromarketing</b> Science and Business Association, n.d.).|$|E
50|$|<b>Neuromarketing</b> {{derives from}} {{research}} on neural features of consumer behavior. Using neural activity to interpret consumer behavior provides {{insight into the}} neural mechanism underlying different consumer decision-making behavior. Marketing experts can then determine what will encourage different consumers to make a purchase and produce appropriate marketing strategy, including general marketing, branding and how these relate to customer loyalty. <b>Neuromarketing</b> research is mainly composed of neuro-consumer behavior, neuro-marketing strategy and neuro-advertising.|$|E
