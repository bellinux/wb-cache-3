Through INSPIRE Directive an improvement of existing national spatial data infrastructure is achieved, not only in EU member states, but in all European countries including Croatia. Spatial datasets comprised with INSPIRE are divided in three annexes (Annex I, II and III) in 34 themes. One of the themes in Annex III are <b>natural</b> <b>risk</b> <b>zones.</b> They are defined as vulnerable areas characterised according to natural hazards (all atmospheric, hydrologic, seismic, volcanic and wildfire phenomena that, because of their location, severity, and frequency, {{have the potential to}} seriously affect society).

40|$|International audienceLocated at {{the bottom}} of the Gulf of Guinea, Cameroon is exposed to a large variety of natural hazards, some of which are linked to {{volcanic}} activity. These are concentrated around the active volcano Mt. Cameroon which combines effusive and explosive types of activity. The threatened stakes are numerous and diversely exposed. They include people, habitat, industrial plantations, a petrol refinery complex and many other industries, equipments and infrastructures. In order to understand and strengthen civil protection measures, for the security of the population faced with natural hazards, the French Embassy in Cameroon, within the framework of a financial convention between Cameroon and France, put in place the GRINP (Management of <b>Natural</b> <b>Risks</b> and Civil Protection) project whose objective was to reinforce the capacity of Cameroon's civil protection department and thus, contribute to the improvement of the security of the population faced with catastrophes. At the end of the 2 years working program focused on the “Elaboration of the risk zoning map of the Mount Cameroon”, which corresponds to the 1 st phase of the 1 st component of the GRINP project, some key recommendations were made to Cameroonian authorities. In the framework of the implementation of recommendation n° 1, it was deemed necessary to carry on a risk prevention plan (RPP) project, which was the 2 nd phase of the 1 st component, with the aim of reducing the vulnerability of the stakes. The objective was to realize a Risk Prevention Plan at a local council scale, and taking into consideration the specific <b>natural</b> <b>risks</b> of each <b>zone.</b> The general objective of the RPP was to clearly draw land use maps for <b>risks</b> <b>zones,</b> showing the overlay of stakes with risk of different intensities. This then led to the setting up of regulations that can reduce the impact of natural catastrophes on human lives and properties...|$|R

The simulation results showed that the skidding routes with same length in gentle slopes have more coverage as compared to steep slopes. So that, was found significant diffrence between treatments (P v < % 5). Moreover, by reducing the straight length of skidding routes the overlapped area increased because of their spiral shape.

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} “INSPIRE data specification on <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones</b> – Guidelines” version 2. 0 as {{developed by the}} Thematic Working Group (TWG) <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones</b> using both natural and a conceptual schema language. This version is now available for the public consultation. Based {{on the results of}} the consultation (received comments and the testing reports), the final version 3. 0 will be prepared by the TWGs. The data specification is based on a common template used for all data specifications and has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I data specifications. This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the draft Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones</b> in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first. The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the Feature Catalogue (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the Feature Catalogue. Users might also find the Feature Catalogue especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones.</b> The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes. In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in italics...|$|E

Six control and seven intervention open chest dogs had occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Synchronized retroperfusion commenced 25 min later. Flow tracers (rubidium- 82 and nitrogen- 13 ammonia) were injected retrogradely. Three hours after coronary occlusion, fluorine- 18 (F- 18) deoxyglucose uptake in the control and treatment groups was compared. At 200 min of occlusion, infarct size was assessed. Retrograde flow tracer uptake was observed in the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> in the seven intervention dogs. Fluorine- 18 deoxyglucose uptake in the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> was increased {{in five of the}} six intervention dogs but was reduced in five of the six control dogs. The <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> to normal zone F- 18 deoxyglucose count ratio was higher in the interventionthan the control group (1. 13 ± 0. 39 vs. 0. 59 ± 0. 51; p < 0. 05). The endocardial subsegment <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> to normal zone F- 18 deoxyglucose count ratio was also significantly higher in the intervention group.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the EU Soil Thematic Strategy and the {{associated}} proposal for a Soil Framework Directive, and the INSPIRE Directive specifications on <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones,</b> a number of recommendations and developments have been made for common approaches and practices to identify and map landslide risk areas in Europe. First, recommendations have been issued for mapping landslide susceptibility areas based on geographically-nested, Tier approaches by collaborative work of the European Landslide Expert Group hosted by JRC. Further to these recommendations, a first version of the 1 km resolution (1 : 1 M scale) European Landslide Susceptibility Map (ELSUS 1000 version 1) has been recently published. The map was produced by spatial multicriteria evaluation modelling using pan-European slope angle, lithology and land use datasets and the location of over 102, 000 landslides throughout Europe. The map can be downloaded from the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC). Given the relevance of landslide data to identify risk areas, a comparative analysis of national and regional landslide inventories in Europe permitted to propose improvements in landslide databases to perform national-scale landslide zoning and to achieve interoperability and harmonisation in agreement with the above-mentioned EU policies. Work is now in progress to refine the European Landslide Susceptibility Map. JRC. H. 5 -Land Resources Managemen...|$|E
40|$|According to the United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction “natural hazards are {{processes}} or {{phenomena that}} may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, {{social and economic}} disruption, or environmental damage”. They are at the interface between human and natural systems. From this perspective natural hazards are a multidimensional domain including environmental issues, {{the private and public}} sector as well as citizens and governance ranging from local to supra-national. The vast amount of information and data necessary for comprehensive hazard and risk assessment presents many challenges regarding the lack of accessibility, comparability, quality, organisation and dissemination of natural hazards spatial data. In order to mitigate these limitations an interoperability framework has been developed and published in the INSPIRE Data Specification on <b>Natural</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Zones</b> – Technical Guidelines (DS) document. This framework provides means for facilitating access, integration, harmonisation and dissemination of natural hazard data from different domains and sources. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the paper highlights the key aspects of the interoperability to the various natural hazard communities and illustrates the applicability of the interoperability framework developed in the DS. And secondly, the paper “translates” into common language the main features and potentiality of the interoperability framework of the DS for a wider audience of scientists and practitioners in the natural hazard domain. In this paper the four pillars of the interoperability framework will be presented. First, the adoption of a common terminology for the natural hazard domain will be addressed. A common data model to facilitate cross domain data integration will then follow. Thirdly, the common methodology developed to express qualitative or quantitative assessments of natural hazards is presented. Fourthly, the extensible classification schema for natural hazards developed from a literature review and key reference documents from the contributing community of practice is discussed. Furthermore, the applicability of the interoperability framework for the various stakeholder groups is illustrated. This paper closes discussing main advantages, limitations and next steps regarding the sustainability and evolution of the interoperability framework. JRC.

In many developing nations with diverse ecological regions, it is still a large cause of human mortality. Owing to the incompleteness of epidemiological data and their spatial origin, the quantification of disease incidence burdening basic public health planning is a major constrain especially in developing countries. The present study focuses on the integrated Geospatial and Multi-Criteria Evaluation (AHP) technique to determine malaria <b>risk</b> <b>zones.</b> The study is conducted in Vadodara district, including 12 Taluka among which 4 Taluka are predominantly tribal. The influence of climatic and physical environmental factors viz., rainfall, hydro geomorphology; drainage, elevation, and land cover are used to score their share in the evaluation of malariogenic condition.

A better understanding of <b>risk</b> <b>zones</b> which are vulnerable to flood disasters can be evolved from the detailed studies on slope, geomorphology and land use / land cover pattern. Information of these parameters is an important input for the identification of vulnerable areas. Flood risk maps provide useful information about places that may be at risk from flooding. It offers a cost-effective solution for planning, management and mitigation strategies in risky areas. Traditional methods of flood risk mapping are based on ground surveys and aerial observations, but when the phenomenon is widespread, such methods are time consuming and expensive. The possible combination of DEM and other maps of area using an overlay operation method within the Geographical Information System (GIS) platform can lead to derivation and the understanding of spatial association between various parameters which could be used to predict flood <b>risk</b> <b>zones.</b> The study area i. e. Satluj River Basin has been broadly divided into five <b>risk</b> <b>zones</b> viz., very low, low, moderate, high and very high which helped to differentiate between areas that are at risk of different intensities of flood. The very high flood <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> covers only 3. 25 % of total study area, while the very low <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> covers 13. 63 %.
