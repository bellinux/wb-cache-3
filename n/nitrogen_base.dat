During the budding process, a parent cell produces a bud on its outer surface. As the bud elongates, the parent cell’s nucleus divides and one nucleus migrates into the bud. Cell wall material is filled in {{the gap between the}} bud and the parent cell; eventually the bud is separated to form a daughter cell of unequal size. Z. bailii cell size varies within a range of (3.5 - 6.5) x (4.5 - 11.5) µm and the cells exist singly or in pair, rarely in short chain.

50|$|The exact {{function}} of this <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> {{is still not}} fully elucidated, but {{it is thought that}} it may regulate gene expression or prompt DNA demethylation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that artificial DNA that contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) can be converted into unmodified cytosines once introduced into mammalian cells. Moreover, 5hmC is highly enriched in primordial germ cells, where it apparently plays a role in global DNA demethylation. Additionally, 5-Formylcytosine, an oxidation product of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine and possible intermediate of an oxidative demethylation pathway was detected in DNA from embryonic stem cells, although no significant amounts of these putative demethylation intermediates could be detected in mouse tissue. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine may be especially important in the central nervous system, as it is found in very high levels there. Reduction in the 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine levels have been found associated with impaired self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is also associated with labile, unstable nucleosomes which are frequently repositioned during cell differentiation.|$|E

40|$|Although {{alternative}} fuels are being widely discussed for Internal Combustion Engines (ICE), little attention and knowledge {{is available on}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>based</b> fuel. An interesting idea is if it´s possible get into the worlds natural nitrogen cycle, instead of the carbon cycle. That means capturing nitrogen in a similar, but easier fashion as capturing CO 2 from air. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} study is to investigate <b>nitrogen</b> <b>based</b> fuels to be used in existing ICE with as small modifications of the engine design as possible. The criteria of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>based,</b> closed loop produced fuel compatible with the design of an existing ICE utilizing small design modifications would be a breakthrough in the global vehicle fleet. A theoretical study was conducted in order to investigate the possibility of using nitrogen-based fuels in internal combustion engines. This idea prompted up since ammonia has been used as fuel for buses in Belgium during World War II [Kroch E]. Modern time issues such as climate change and depletion of fossil fuels could be solved by using a possible carbon-free nitrogen-based fuel. There are several <b>nitrogen</b> <b>based</b> fuel/fuel mixtures but not all are suitable for use in existing engine designs since many of these are aimed for use as rocket fuel. Our judgement is that ammonia, mainly used in dual fuel concepts, is the only convenient <b>nitrogen</b> <b>based</b> fuel for possible use in internal combustion engines in an reasonable future unless a major scientific breakthrough occurs. Ammonia is today mainly produced from natural gas that emits a large amount of carbon dioxide when combusted. It is thus more convenient to use natural gas direct in a natural gas vehicle rather than producing ammonia of it. Alternative production processes based on sustainable sources, i. e. solar and wind (electricity) can´t compete economically with hydrocarbons. A possible competitive carbon-neutral production method for future is to produce ammonia by biomass gasification that would enable almost zero carbon emission propulsion when considering Well-To-Tank. Using biomass for ammonia is better than using it for bio-fuel (hydrocarbon) production considering corn as feedstock. This is due to the larger amount of corn needed for bio-fuel production compared to ammonia production. A future use of biomass for ammonia production opens a window of opportunity to realize a carbon-free Well-To-Wheel chain. There are no engines currently that can run on ammonia, or ammonia as dual-fuel, at today’s standards and with the same operating conditions. The work performed are rather at research level, mainly as fuel research on Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) II engines, and have some way to go before being possible for engine application in transport vehicles. There is no engine architecture at present that supports ammonia as fuel. Ammonia as fuel for internal combustion engines is not possible in the near-term future if a carbon-free Well-To-Wheel chain is required. It might be possible, if further research is conducted in future. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>based</b> fuels {{do not seem to be}} an alternative for low Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in automotive engines. Currently, only ammonia seems feasible as fuel in engines. Being locally “low-carbon”, meaning emitting no or low GHG emissions, it cannot compete on the total Well-to-Wheel chain.

40|$|It {{have been}} {{described}} a general mechanism for the attack step of the reactions between nitrogen nucleophiles and carbonyl compounds to form a neutral tetrahedral addition intermediate. This general mechanism {{is based on the}} relative importance of the "concerted" hydronium-ion catalyzed attack of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> on the carbonyl compound with respect to the "step wise" mechanism that involves the previous formation of a zwitterionic tetrahedral intermediate (T±) and the posterior proton transfer to it from the hydronium-ion. The relative importance of this pathway gives origin to three kinds of profile rates vs pH for these reactions. On the other hand, the importance of the "stepwise" mechanism was attributed to a dependence on the stability of the T± intermediate that is related to the pKa of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base</b> and the Kad (the equilibrium constant for the formation of the neutral tetrahedral addition intermediate (T 0)). The comparison of the reactions of p-chlorobenzaldehyde and norcamphor with different nitrogen nucleophiles led to the observation that the general mechanism depends on each type of carbonyl compound. This is due to the great influence of the steric and electronic effects of the compounds structure, {{and the fact that the}} pKa value of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>base,</b> which is more related to the stability of the T± than the T 0 intermediate, is more important as a factor of prediction of the profiles than the value of Kad, this value being more related to the stability of the T 0 intermediate...|$|E
