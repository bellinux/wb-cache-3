In 2001, Russian programmer Dimitry Sklyarov demonstrated that an eBook vendor, <b>New</b> <b>Paradigm</b> Research Group (NPRG), used ROT13 to encrypt their documents; it has been speculated that NPRG may have mistaken the ROT13 toy example—provided with the Adobe eBook software development kit—for a serious encryption scheme. Windows XP uses ROT13 on some of its registry keys. ROT13 is also used in the Unix fortune program to conceal potentially offensive dicta.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> for multi-objective {{optimization}} {{based on}} novelty was presented using evolutionary algorithms. This <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search on objective space) {{in addition to}} the search for non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places. It is specially useful in overcoming bias and plateaus as well as guiding the search in many-objective optimization problems. Subpopulation Algorithm based on Novelty is the first algorithm based on this paradigm.|$|E

25|$|While the <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> {{is rarely}} as {{expansive}} {{as the old}} paradigm in its initial stages, it must nevertheless have significant promise for future problem-solving.

25|$|Even though Gadamer's {{interpretation}} of Heidegger has been questioned, {{there is little}} doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a gestalt formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> of thinking, and the hermeneutic circle offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.|$|E

25|$|Until the 1950s, the {{question}} of whether one could in fact infer the existence of unwritten doctrines from the ancient sources stood {{at the center of the}} discussion.

25|$|Under this paradigm, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} chemical reactions (such as {{the combination of}} water and alcohol) did not necessarily occur in fixed proportion. This belief was ultimately overturned by Dalton’s atomic theory, which asserted that atoms can only combine in simple, whole-number ratios. Under this <b>new</b> <b>paradigm,</b> any reaction which did not occur in fixed proportion {{could not be a}} chemical process. This type world-view transition among the scientific community exemplifies Kuhn's paradigm shift.|$|E

25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm.</b> So {{what looks like a}} single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E

25|$|The Tübingen {{paradigm}} was formulated {{and thoroughly}} defended {{for the first}} time by Hans Joachim Krämer. He published the results of his research in a 1959 monograph that was a revised version of a 1957 dissertation written under the supervision of Wolfgang Schadewaldt. In 1963, Konrad Gaiser, who was also a student of Schadewaldt, qualified as a professor with his comprehensive monograph on the unwritten doctrines. In the following decades both these scholars expanded on and defended the <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> in a series of publications while teaching at Tübingen University.|$|E

There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.|$|E

Marrett's student at Oxford University, {{as well as}} John Layard on Malakula, Vanuatu (1914–15), and to have Bronislaw Malinowski stationed in Mailu and later the Trobriand Islands during WWI. Haddon actively gave advice to missionaries, government officers, traders and anthropologists; collecting in return information about New Guinea and elsewhere.|$|E
