40|$|This article {{discusses}} how {{the notion}} of sustainable development in today's globalized world is being appropriated, legitimized and exploited, {{as well as the}} criticism that this construct is suffering. We have used categories of analysis which were constructed from critical theoretical references. The work hypothesis shows that sustainable development does not focus on the main elements of environmental degradation and that the options of the peripheral countries are <b>not</b> <b>reversing</b> the <b>picture</b> of nature destruction. To address this issue a review of published scientific literature on the environmental issue in general and sustainability in particular has been done. The conclusion points to the clue that real sustainable actions depend critically on the level and quality of public consciousness, on their perception of reality and experienced problems, and on their organizational skills to promote changes in this direction...|$|R
40|$|A {{massive star}} is defined {{to be one}} with a mass greater than 8 - 10 M. Central to the {{on-going}} debate on how these objects [massive stars] come into being is the so-called Radiation Problem. For nearly forty years now, {{it has been argued}} that the radiation field emanating from massive stars is high enough to cause a global reversal of direct radial in-fall of material onto the nascent star. We argue that only in the case of a non-spinning isolated star does the gravitational field of the nascent star overcome the radiation field. An isolated non-spinning star is a non-spinning star without any circumstellar material around it, the gravitational field beyond its surface is described exactly by Newton?s inverse square law. The fact that massive stars should have their gravitational field being much stronger than their radiation field is drawn from the analysis of an isolated massive star, where in this case the gravitational field is much stronger than the radiation field. This conclusion is erroneously extended to the case of massive stars enshrouded in gas & dust. We find that, for the case of a non-spinning gravitating body where we take into consideration the circumstellar material, that at 8 - 10 M, the radiation field will <b>not</b> <b>reverse</b> the radial in-fall of matter but a stalemate between the radiation and gravitational field will be achieved ? i. e., in-fall is halted but <b>not</b> <b>reversed.</b> This <b>picture</b> is very different from the common picture that is projected and accepted in the popular literature that at 8 - 10 M, all the circumstellar material ? from the surface of the star, right up to the edge of the core; is expected to be swept away by the radiation field. We argue that massive stars should be able to come into being if the molecular core from which they form exhibit some rotation because a rotating core exhibits an ASGF which causes there to be an equatorial accretion disk and along this equatorial disk, the radiation field can not be much stronger than the gravitational field hence this equatorial accretion disk becomes the channel via which the nascent massive star accretes all of its material.

30|$|The open-aperture Z-scan allows {{measuring}} the nonlinear absorption coefficient, β. When {{the sample is}} located far from the focal point, the laser radiation intensity is low and T(z) is close to 1. The intensity becomes higher as the sample moves closer to the lens focal point. As {{the result of the}} positive nonlinear absorption, T(z) becomes smaller and reaches the minimum at the focal point. In the case of negative nonlinear absorption, the <b>reverse</b> <b>picture</b> occurs.|$|R

60|$|It may be {{convenient}} when marking finger prints {{with letters}} for reference, {{to use those}} that look alike, both in a direct and in a reversed aspect, as they may require to be read either way. The print is a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of the pattern upon the digit that made it. The pattern on one hand is, as already said, a <b>reversed</b> <b>picture</b> of a similar pattern as it shows on the other. In the various processes by which prints are multiplied, the patterns may be reversed and re-reversed. Thus, if a finger is impressed on a lithographic stone, the impressions from that stone are reversals of the impression made by the same finger upon paper. If made on transfer paper and thence transferred to stone, there is a re-reversal. There are even more varied possibilities when photography is employed. It is worth recollecting that there are twelve capital letters in the English alphabet which, if printed in block type, are unaffected by being reversed. They are A.H.I.M.O.T.U.V.W.X.Y.Z. Some symbols do the same, such as, * + - = :. These and the letters H.O.I.X. have the further peculiarity of appearing unaltered when upside down.|$|R
