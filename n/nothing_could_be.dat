5|$|Hood was {{the closest}} to {{completion}} and her construction was continued in case the Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
5|$|Records showed {{training}} accidents between 1942 and 1945 {{accounted for}} the loss of 95 aviation personnel from NAS Fort Lauderdale In 1992, another expedition located scattered debris on the ocean floor, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> identified. In the last decade, searchers have been expanding their area to include farther east, into the Atlantic Ocean, but the remains of Flight 19 have still never been confirmed found.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more desperate than the measure, but I answer {{that the state}} of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

He said he had seen no ice. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> more straightforward, more direct. We felt assured from that moment that the Prince had not seen any ice.|$|R

5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this power}} allowed Leiva {{to perform a}} {{maneuver}} that Castelli had not anticipated. Although he approved the end of Cisneros' rule as viceroy, Leiva formed a Junta with Cisneros as its president; Cisneros would stay in power. The {{other members of the}} Junta would have been two peninsulars, the priest Juan Nepomuceno Solá and the merchant José Santos Inchaurregui, and two criollos, Saavedra and Castelli. The bulk of the natives rejected the proposal: they did not accept that Cisneros should remain in power, even under a different title. They were suspicious of the intentions of Saavedra, and believed that with Castelli alone in the Junta, little or <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved. Castelli and Saavedra resigned that same day to put pressure on Cisneros and force him to resign, and the Junta never came into power.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

5|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of his reign, he deemed it proper to promulgate by law the Church's belief in the Trinity and the Incarnation; and to threaten all heretics with the appropriate penalties; whereas he subsequently declared that he intended to deprive all disturbers of orthodoxy of the opportunity for such offense by due process of law. He made the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan creed the sole symbol of the Church and accorded legal force to the canons of the four ecumenical councils. The bishops in attendance at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553 recognized that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done in the Church contrary to the emperor's will and command, while, on his side, the emperor, {{in the case of the}} Patriarch Anthimus, reinforced the ban of the Church with temporal proscription. Justinian protected the purity of the church by suppressing heretics. He neglected no opportunity for securing the rights of the Church and clergy, for protecting and extending monasticism. He granted the monks the right to inherit property from private citizens and the right to receive solemnia or annual gifts from the Imperial treasury or from the taxes of certain provinces and he prohibited lay confiscation of monastic estates.|$|E
25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. He told me that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E
25|$|Before World War I (1914–18) Randle was {{approached}} by Richard Akinwande Savage and Casely Hayford about holding a West African conference. He was enthusiastic about the idea, and was elected chairman of the Lagos committee for the conference in 1915. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done during the war.|$|E

25|$|For {{ten months}} {{beginning}} in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives {{during the election}} dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent; all but 641 had been routinely destroyed by Western Union. However, the remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era, and <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made of them. 27 of these telegrams were leaked to the Tribune.|$|E
25|$|The book {{left the}} {{impression}} that some on the list may have been killed to silence them because of knowledge of the assassination. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{further from the truth}} in my daughter's case. The list apparently has developed {{a life of its own}} and for Today to repeat the calumny is reprehensible. Karyn no longer can suffer pain by such an inexcusable mention, but her parents and her brother Jerry can.|$|E
25|$|Assemblies in Churches and Chapels were {{permitted}} and prayers for the British Royal {{family and the}} welfare of the British Empire could be said although <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> said against the honour or interests of the German Government or Forces. German soldiers were free to attend services. Open air meetings were banned as were the Salvation Army, the Freemasons, the Oddfellows Society and the Ex-Servicemens clubs. La Sociéte Guernesaise and La Sociéte Jersisise {{were permitted}} to continue holding meetings.|$|E

25|$|Several dozen Italian anarchists {{left the}} United States for Mexico. Some have {{suggested}} {{they did so}} because of cowardice. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> more false. The idea to go to Mexico arose {{in the minds of}} several comrades who were alarmed by the idea that, remaining in the United States, they would be forcibly restrained from leaving for Europe, where the revolution that had burst out in Russia that February promised to spread all over the continent.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of War, the Speed Spitfire was modified to a hybrid PR Mk II with the special Merlin II being replaced by a Merlin XII driving a variable pitch de Havilland propeller, and the racing windscreen replaced by a PR wrap-around type. <b>Nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done about the reduced fuel capacity and it could never {{be used as an}} operational aircraft. Flown as a liaison aircraft between airfields in Britain during the war, K9834 was scrapped in June 1946.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired {{at each other for}} about a quarter of an hour. Then there was a lull but <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen {{for a minute or two}} because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E

25|$|At {{three o'clock}} Father William Corby, the University president, {{met with his}} wisest assistants and they {{determined}} that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done but close the college for the year. An hour after he communicated the decision to the students assembled in the church. Students {{did not want to}} leave, but Fr. Corby {{made it clear that the}} University could not provide any accommodations. Hence, the students were sent home for the semester. The loss was estimated at $200,000 and only $45,000 was recovered from the insurance. It was a terrible blow, for in three hours was wiped out the result of thirty-five years of hard, grueling sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were {{parked in front of the}} entrance to the church so that <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried to gain access to the grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church.|$|E
25|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, sought {{to stop the}} shooting. The 53-year-old presidente municipal took a white handkerchief, tied it to his cane {{and ran into the}} streets of his city hoping to quell {{the violence}}. As US troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to put down their weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by US military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official note from the US Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where <b>nothing</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done to save him.” He died a half-hour later.|$|E
