40|$|We use the Shapley {{value and}} the {{nucleolus}} {{to analyze the}} impact of three controversial pipeline projects on the power structure in the Eurasian trade of natural gas. Two pipelines, `Nord Stream' and `South Stream', allow Russian gas to bypass transit countries, Ukraine and Belarus. The third project, `Nabucco', aims at diversifying Europe's gas imports by accessing producers in Middle East and Central Asia. For the Shapley Value we obtain a clear ranking of the projects which corresponds to the observed investment patterns. <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream's</b> strategic value is huge, easily justifying the high investment cost for Germany and Russia. The additional leverage obtained through South Stream is much smaller and Nabucco is not viable. For the nucleolus in contrast, none of the pipelines has any strategic relevance at all, {{which appears to be}} at odds with the empirical evidence...|$|R
25|$|In September 2005 the {{agreement}} was signed {{on the construction of}} the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> offshore gas pipeline on the Baltic Sea, from Vyborg to the German city of Greifswald. The first line was expected become operational in 2011. Afterwards, the first line of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> was laid by May 2011 and was inaugurated on 8 November 2011; the second line was inaugurated on 8 October 2012.|$|E
25|$|As Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> pipeline project, which aims to supply Russian gas directly to Germany, thereby bypassing transit countries. The agreement to build the pipeline was signed {{two weeks before the}} German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, just a few weeks before Schröder stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover 1 billion euros of the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee had never been used. Soon after stepping down as chancellor, Schröder accepted Gazprom's nomination for the post of the head of the shareholders' committee of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG, raising questions about a potential conflict of interest.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Schröder {{switched}} to become manager of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2, {{an expansion of}} the original pipeline in which Gazprom is sole shareholder.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} Gazprom’s {{investment}} strategy regarding Russia’s gas exports and export market behaviour, {{with a focus}} on European infrastructure projects, in a the geopolitical context. Because of its large gas reserves, Russia is well-positioned to take advantage of gas exports even as it faces possible competition from other gas suppliers and uncertain gas demand. Gas export earnings are an important source of income for Russia. As a government-controlled firm, Gazprom depends to a large extent on Europe for its hard-currency income. For Russia and Gazprom, the stream of income from gas exports and its expansion are economically vital. In this regard, gas export infrastructures such as <b>Nord</b> and South <b>Stream</b> could act as important instruments to expand Gazprom’s market share in current markets and in growth markets. This study uses a real-option game model to assess the overall value of gas infrastructures in the face of demand uncertainties and potential competition. The result of this approach illustrates the strategic-economic character of Gazprom’s infrastructure investments in possibly creating a first-mover’s advantage. Yet, the model is of a highly stylised nature. Therefore, other aspects should be taken into account in assessing gas infrastructure investments. Besides the goal of possibly expanding Gazprom’s market share, infrastructure investments could serve to mitigate overall transit risks. However, Gazprom’s organisational constraints in realising gas infrastructures could put into question the rationale of such investments. In addition, Gazprom’s position {{as well as that of}} Russian gas may be pressured by European (regulatory) policy in favour of alternative gas and other energy sources. The desired market outcomes for Gazprom have an impact on the prioritisation of Russian investments in the gas value chain. ...|$|R

25|$|German Bundeswehr asked <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> {{to change}} the planned route because the {{pipeline}} is laid close to a sea testing ground near Rügen, which is actively used for naval exercises.|$|E
25|$|For the {{construction}} period, <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG created a logistic center in Gotland. Other interim stock yards {{are located in}} Mukran, in Kotka, in Hanko (Finland) and in Karlskrona (Sweden).|$|E
25|$|Russia {{plans to}} {{completely}} abandon gas supplies to Europe through Ukraine after 2018. Gazprom has already substantially reduced the volumes of gas it transits across Ukraine, and expressed its intention {{of reducing the}} level further by means of transit diversification pipelines (<b>Nord</b> <b>Stream,</b> Turkish Stream, etc).|$|E
25|$|By {{total length}} of {{pipelines}} Russia {{is second only}} to the United States. Currently many new pipeline projects are being realized, including <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> and South Stream natural gas pipelines to Europe, and the Eastern Siberia – Pacific Ocean oil pipeline (ESPO) to the Russian Far East and China.|$|E
25|$|The {{agreement}} {{to build the}} pipeline was signed ten days before the German parliamentary election. On 24 October 2005, {{a few weeks before}} Schröder had stepped down as Chancellor, the German government guaranteed to cover €1billion of the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> project cost, should Gazprom default on a loan. However, this guarantee expired at the end of 2006 without ever having been needed. Soon after leaving the post of Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder agreed to head the shareholders' committee of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG. This has been widely described by German and international media as a conflict of interest, the implication being that the pipeline project may have been pushed through for personal gain rather than for improving gas supplies to Germany. Information about the German government's guarantee was requested by the European Commission. No formal charges have been filed against any party despite years of exhaustive investigations.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{calls for}} European energy {{diversity}} being amplified {{as a result}} of the crisis, Russia's European customers have long term legal contracts for gas deliveries. Most of these contracts stretch beyond 2025–2030 and obligations to these contracts remain despite the crisis. Thus European countries can do little in the short-medium term in the ways of diversification away from Russian gas, but diversification of delivery routes away from Ukraine could potentially be achieved within a few years via projects such as the South Stream and <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> pipeline systems.|$|E
25|$|The former Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schröder, and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, {{were strong}} {{advocates of the}} {{pipeline}} project during the negotiation phase. International media alluded to a past relationship between the Managing Director of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG, Matthias Warnig, himself a former East German secret police officer, and Vladimir Putin {{when he was a}} KGB agent in East Germany. These allegations were denied by Matthias Warning, who said that he had met Vladimir Putin {{for the first time in}} his life in 1991, when Putin was the head of the Committee for External Relations of the Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{rapprochement}} with Tusk's government in Warsaw, {{after two years}} of tensions with the conservative government of Kaczynski. The cooperation on the Yamal-Europe pipeline has continued without serious problems. Nevertheless, some disagreements concerning control of the Yamal-Europe pipeline and transit pricing remain. Despite attempts to relieve tensions, consecutive Polish governments strongly oppose the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> project bypassing Poland and favour further development of overland alternatives. It remains a contentious issue {{that as a result of}} the Russian-Ukrainian gas dispute in 2009, Polish PGNIG gas company did not receive contracted supplies of Russian gas from Ukraine.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> {{offshore}} pipeline is {{operated by the}} special purpose company—Nord Stream AG. <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland on 30 November 2005. Shareholders of the company are the Russian gas company Gazprom (51% of shares), German gas companies Wintershall and E.ON Ruhrgas (both 15.5%), the Dutch gas company Gasunie (9%), and the French gas company GDF Suez (9%). [...] The Managing Director of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG is Matthias Warnig {{and the chairman of}} the shareholders' committee is German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main source}} of natural gas for the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> {{pipeline}} is Yuzhno-Russkoye field, which {{is located in the}} Krasnoselkupsky District, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Tyumen Oblast. [...] <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> is also fed from fields in Yamal Peninsula, Ob-Taz bay. Gazprom has also indicated that the majority of gas produced at the Shtokman field would be sold to Europe via the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> pipeline. [...] For this purpose, the pipeline from the Shtokman field via Kola peninsula to Volkhov or Vyborg in the Leningrad Oblast has to be built.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG started {{evaluation}} of an expansion project {{which would include}} two additional lines (later named <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2) to increase the overall annual capacity up to [...] In August 2012, <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG applied to the Finnish and Estonian governments for route studies in their underwater exclusive economic zones for {{the third and fourth}} lines. It was considered to route the additional pipelines to the United Kingdom but this plan was abandoned. [...] In January 2015, it was announced that the expansion project was put on hold since the existing lines were running at only half capacity due to EU restrictions on Gazprom.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 September 2005, Gazprom, BASF and E.ON {{signed a}} basic {{agreement}} {{on the construction of}} a North European Gas Pipeline. On 30 November 2005, the North European Gas Pipeline Company (later renamed <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG) was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland. On 9 December 2005, Gazprom started construction of the Russian onshore feeding pipeline. On 4 October 2006, the pipeline and the operating company were officially renamed <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG. [...] After establishment of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG, all information related to the pipeline project, including results of the seabed survey of 1998, were transferred from North Transgas to the new company, and on 2 November 2006, North Transgas was officially dissolved.|$|E
2500|$|As the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} waterway to Polish ports in Szczecin and Świnoujście, there were concerns {{that it will}} reduce {{the depth of the}} waterway leading to the ports.

2500|$|A {{former member}} of the European Parliament from Estonia, Andres Tarand has raised the issue that the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> {{pipeline}} could disturb World War II graves dating from naval battles in 1941. [...] A <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> spokesman has stated that only one sunken ship is {{in the vicinity of the}} planned pipeline and added that it wouldn't be disturbed. [...] However, on 16 July 2008 it was announced that one of DOF Subsea's seismic vessels had discovered during a survey for the planned <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> pipeline, in Finland's exclusive economic zone in the Gulf of Finland, the wreck of a submarine with Soviet markings, believed to have sunk during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Concerns raised, that {{originally}} <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG planned on rinsing out the pipeline with 2.3billion liters {{of a solution}} containing glutaraldehyde, pumped afterward into the Baltic Sea. [...] <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG responded that glutaraldehyde would not used, and even had the chemical been used, the effects would have been brief and localized due to {{the speed with which}} the chemical breaks down once it comes in contact with water.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, the Swedish prosecutor's office {{started an}} {{investigation}} based on suspicions of bribery and corruption after a college {{on the island}} of Gotland received a donation from <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream.</b> The 5million Swedish kronor (US$574,000) donation was directed to a professor at Gotland University College who had previously warned that the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> pipeline would come too close to a sensitive bird zone. The consortium has hired several former high-ranking officials, such as Ulrica Schenström, former undersecretary at the Swedish Prime Minister's office, and Dan Svanell, former press secretary for several politicians in the Swedish Social Democratic Party. [...] In addition, the former Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, had worked for <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> as an adviser since 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, an {{agreement}} to build two additional lines was signed between Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, and Engie. As {{the creation of a}} joint venture was blocked by Poland, on 24 April 2017, Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Royal Dutch Shell signed a financing agreement with <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 AG, a subsidiary of Gazprom responsible {{for the development of the}} <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 project. According to the agreement, each of five companies will provide €950million, of which €285million should be paid in 2017. The loan from the five companies will cover 50% of the project costs of €9.5billion. The rest would be financed by Gazprom who remains the sole shareholder of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 AG.

2500|$|<b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> (former names: North Transgas and North European Gas Pipeline; , Severny potok) is an {{offshore}} natural gas pipeline from Vyborg in the Russian Federation to Greifswald in Germany that is {{owned and operated}} by <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG. The project includes two parallel lines. The first line was laid by May 2011 and was inaugurated on 8 November 2011. The second line was laid in 2011–2012 and was inaugurated on 8 October 2012. [...] At [...] in length, it is the longest sub-sea pipeline in the world, surpassing the Langeled pipeline.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2017, Gabriel {{criticized the}} draft of new U.S. {{sanctions}} against Russia that target EU–Russia energy projects, including <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 gas pipeline. In a joint statement Gabriel and Austria's Chancellor Christian Kern said that [...] "Europe's energy supply {{is a matter for}} Europe, and not for the United States of America." [...] They also said: [...] "To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the U.S. market if they participate in natural gas projects such as <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{route of}} {{additional}} lines would mainly follow {{the route of}} existing lines, except in the Russian onshore and offshore sections. [...] In Russia, [...] of new pipeline and three compressor stations would be built, and five existing compressor stations would be expanded for feeding <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2. <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 will start at the Slavyanskaya compressor station near Ust-Luga port, located [...] south-east of the village of Bolshoye Kuzyomkino (Narvusi) in the Kingiseppsky District of the Leningrad Oblast, in the historical Ingria close to the Estonian border. Its landfall {{would be at the}} Kurgalsky Peninsula on the shore of Narva Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{president}} of the European Council Donald Tusk has said that <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 {{is not in the}} EU's interests. [...] Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán have questioned the different treatment of <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> II and South Stream projects. [...] The project is considered to violate the long-term declared strategy of the EU to diversify its gas supplies. [...] A letter, signed by the leaders of nine EU countries, has been sent to the EC in March 2016, warning that the <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2 project contradicts the European energy policy requirements that suppliers to the EU should not control the energy transmission assets, and that access to the energy infrastructure must be secured for non-consortium companies. A letter by American lawmakers John McCain and Marco Rubio to the EU also criticized the project in July 2016. Isabelle Kocher, chief executive officer of Engie, criticised American sanctions targetting the projects, and said they were an attempt to promote American gas in Europe. Although construction has started on <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> 2, the government of Denmark wants to have its foreign ministry prevent it being routed through Danish waters, and a bill is proposed to go through Parliament in October 2017, giving the foreign ministry the ability to do this on foreign policy grounds. Supporters of the pipeline, including Germany, believe that unlawful deferrence has been made to US wishes of the project not proceeding.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 December 2007, <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> AG {{submitted}} application {{documents to}} the Swedish {{government for the}} pipeline construction in the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone. [...] On 12 February 2008, the Swedish government rejected the consortium's application which it had found incomplete. [...] New application was filed later. On 20 October 2009, <b>Nord</b> <b>Stream</b> received a construction permit to build the pipeline in the Danish waters. [...] On 5 November 2009, the Swedish and Finnish authorities gave a permit to lay the pipeline in their exclusive economic zones. [...] On 22 February 2010, the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland issued the final environmental permit allowing construction of the Finnish section of the pipeline.|$|E
