500|$|When {{the third}} edition was {{published}} in 1845, Balzac {{was in love with}} his own creation. He had written two years earlier to Hańska: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> – it is a magnificent poem. I had never really read it before.… The passion is sublime, and I now understand why you have a cherished and special devotion to this book.… All in all, I am very pleased with it." [...] In a preface to the third edition, he described his plans for a part of La Comédie Humaine called Scènes de la vie militaire (Scenes from Military Life). In addition to Les Chouans with its focus on guerrilla combat, he planned another called Les Vendéans about the earlier full-scale civil war. Although in 1844 he discussed traveling to western France to write the book, it was never written.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was asked}} after the match whether Leeds United had failed during the season: [...] "Failed? Second in the championship. Cup finalists. Ninety percent of {{managers}} would pray for 'failures' like that." [...] Leeds manager Don Revie was disappointed to lose, but praised his players' efforts in defeat: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the better side won, but, {{at least the}} lads played their guts out for me. He admitted it was disappointing to finish second in both the League and FA Cup: [...] "It's a bit disappointing to finish second in both Cup and League, but {{we have had a}} wonderful first season back in Division One, and I am very pleased with the team." [...] Captain Collins echoed his manager's sentiments: [...] "We have had a great season, but lost both honours. We shall be having a go again next season." ...|$|E

500|$|For Dunne, the Dooley {{pieces were}} a burden, {{but one that}} brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that {{interest}} in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. [...] Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, The New Republic noted in an article, [...] "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded {{with a look of}} intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." [...] Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, [...] "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type few will dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense may not be so clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and that puts the future of the Dooley essay in serious question." [...] Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' [...] popularity, [...] "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".|$|E
500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E

[...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize."

However, the probabilistic interpretation on the quantum mechanics has insoluble semantic interpretations like reduction of wave packet on observations of physical values.

On this paper, we interpret the wave nature of particle as not the inherency of particle itself, but the motional property of particle in fluctuated space-time due to the kinetic energy and momentum the belief that the kinetic energy and momentum fluctuates the microscopic space-time, and the particle move through the fluctuated space-time adversely. Then, through the particle motion in the Euclidean space-time, the particle will be recognized as if it has the wave nature. We estimate the governing equation of fluctuations of microscopic space-time {{based on the}} macroscopic law of motion. On this paper, the equivalence between the governing equation and the Schrodinger equation is indicated. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
