25|$|One {{surgical}} procedure used is called <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplication.</b> In fundoplication, the gastric fundus (upper part) {{of the stomach}} is wrapped, or plicated, around the inferior part of the esophagus, preventing herniation of the stomach through the hiatus in the diaphragm and the reflux of gastric acid.

With proper patient selection, laparoscopic fundoplication recent studies have indicated relatively low complication rates, quick recovery, and relatively good long term results.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for severe GERD is the <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplication.</b> In this procedure, {{the upper part}} of the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to strengthen the sphincter and prevent acid reflux and to repair a hiatal hernia.

40|$|Introduction: In the {{presented}} {{series of}} a hundred consecutive cases the authors tried to assess objectively the efficacyof surgical treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Aim: To assess {{the influence of the}} procedure on oesophageal motility and the lower oesophagus sphincter. Material and methods: Thirty-seven female and 63 male patients were qualified to participate in the study. Based onthe preoperative manometry results patients were qualified for laparoscopic complete <b>fundoplication</b> (<b>Nissen</b> procedure) or incomplete fundoplication (Toupet’s procedure). The control examination was performed one year after surgicaltreatment. Results: Taking into account the preoperative oesophageal manometry results, 67 <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplications</b> and 33 Toupet’s fundoplications were performed. The mean age was 51. 54 years. Postoperative mortality was 0 %. Assessingthe oesophageal motility it was concluded that the values of particular parameters of the lower oesophagealsphincter (LES) – total length, length of the abdominal portion – increased significantly (p < 0. 001) and the mean restingpressure in the LES increased statistically significantly independently of the operative method. A significant influenceof the procedure on the peristaltic contraction amplitude, its duration, percentage of non-peristaltic contractionsand the percentage of low-amplitude contractions was observed. The greatest changes of the clinically significantparameters – the percentage of low-amplitude contractions and the number of non-peristaltic contractions – wereobserved in the group of patients with impaired oesophageal motility. During the postoperative period a decrease ofthe percentage of low-amplitude contractions and an increase of peristaltic contractions were observed. Both parameterswere statistically significant. Conclusions: Antireflux procedures regardless of the technique used cause normalization of lower oesophagealsphincter function. All anatomical parameters of the lower oesophageal sphincter return to normal values. Followingthe antireflux procedures the oesophageal motility significantly improves clinically, especially in the group of patientswith impaired oesophageal motility...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Repair of hiatal hernias {{has been}} {{performed}} traditionally via open laparotomy or thoracotomy. Since first laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair in 1992, this method had a growing popularity and {{today it is}} the standard approach in experienced centers specialized for minimally invasive surgery. Objective. In the current study we present our experience after 200 consecutive laparoscopic hiatal hernia repairs. Methods. A retrospective cohort study included 200 patients who underwent elective laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair at the Department for Minimally Invasive Upper Digestive Surgery, Clinic for Digestive Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade from April 2004 to December 2013. Results. Hiatal hernia types included 108 (54 %) patients with type I, 30 (15 %) with type III, 62 (31 %) with giant paraesophageal hernia, while 27 (13. 5 %) patients presented with a chronic gastric volvulus. There were a total of 154 (77 %) <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplications.</b> In 26 (13 %) cases Nissen procedure was combined with esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis-Nissen), and in 17 (8. 5 %) Toupet fundoplications was performed. Primary retroesophageal crural repair was performed in 164 (82 %) cases, Cleveland Clinic Foundation suture modification in 27 (13. 5 %), 4 (2 %) patients underwent synthetic mesh hiatoplasty, 1 (0. 5 %) primary repair reinforced with pledgets, and 4 (2 %) autologous fascia lata graft reinforcement. Poor result with anatomic and symptomatic recurrence (indication for revisional surgery) was detected in 5 patients (2. 7 %). Conclusion.

40|$|From September 1991 to January 1995 we {{performed}} 230 <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplications</b> by a laparoscopic technique. Whilst a loose 360 degree fundoplication secured by 3 or 4 sutures {{was performed in}} all instances, there was variation between surgeons regarding the performance of hiatal repair and division of short gastric vessels; 207 operations were completed laparoscopically and 23 were converted to an open operation when a satisfactory wrap could not be achieved. Operating time ranged from 30 to 260 min (median 95) and the median postoperative stay was 3 days (1 - 19). Twenty-three patients (10 %) underwent a subsequent operation (14 within 3 months of the original surgery), 2 for recurrent reflux, 10 for para-esophageal herniation, 2 for a misplaced fundoplication resulting in gastric obstruction, 7 for persistent dysphagia (4 due to stenosis of the esophageal hiatus), 1 for bleeding, and 1 for mesenteric thrombosis. (This patient died.) Five other patients were readmitted to hospital subsequent to their discharge [...] four because of pulmonary emboli and one because of gastric obstruction. Some 226 patients (98 %) are free of reflux symptoms with follow-up ranging up to 40 months (median 16). Absence of reflux {{and the integrity of}} the fundoplication has been confirmed by postoperative esophageal manometry and pH monitoring in 90 patients, and by barium meal in 126. Postoperative recovery has been quick and wound-related morbidity minimal. Although the rate of surgical revision was significant in this series, the likelihood of complications or further surgery, as well as incidence of conversion to open surgery, decreased {{in the second half of}} the experience.

40|$|Objective To detail robotic {{procedure}} {{development and}} clinical applications for mitral valve, biliary, and gastric reflux operations, and {{to implement a}} multispecialty robotic surgery training curriculum for both surgeons and surgical teams. Summary Background Data Remote, accurate telemanipulation of intracavitary instruments by general and cardiac surgeons is now possible. Complex technologic advancements in surgical robotics require well-designed training programs. Moreover, efficient robotic surgical procedures must be developed methodically and safely implemented clinically. Methods Advanced training on robotic systems provides surgeon confidence when operating in tiny intracavitary spaces. Three-dimensional vision and articulated instrument control are essential. The authors’ two da Vinci robotic systems have been dedicated to procedure development, clinical surgery, and training of surgical specialists. Their center has been the first United States site to train surgeons formally in clinical robotics. Results Established surgeons and residents have been trained using a defined robotic surgical educational curriculum. Also, 30 multispecialty teams have been trained in robotic mechanics and electronics. Initially, robotic procedures were developed experimentally and are described. In the past year the authors have performed 52 robotic-assisted clinical operations: 18 mitral valve repairs, 20 cholecystectomies, and 14 <b>Nissen</b> <b>fundoplications.</b> These respective operations required 108, 28, and 73 minutes of robotic telemanipulation to complete. Procedure times for {{the last half of}} the abdominal operations decreased significantly, as did the knot-tying time in mitral operations. There have been no deaths and few complications. One mitral patient had postoperative bleeding. Conclusion Robotic surgery can be performed safely with excellent results. The authors have developed an effective curriculum for training teams in robotic surgery. After training, surgeons have applied these methods effectively and safely.

50|$|Food {{can easily}} pass {{downward}} after the myotomy has {{cut through the}} lower oesophageal sphincter, but stomach acids can also easily reflux upward. Therefore, this surgery is often combined with partial fundoplication to {{reduce the incidence of}} postoperative acid reflux. In Dor or anterior fundoplication, which is the most common method, part of the stomach (the fundus) is laid over the front of the oesophagus and stitched into place so that whenever the stomach contracts, it also closes off the oesophagus instead of squeezing stomach acids into it. In Toupet or posterior fundoplication, the fundus is passed {{around the back of the}} oesophagus instead. <b>Nissen</b> or complete <b>fundoplication</b> (wrapping the fundus all the way around the oesophagus) is generally not considered advisable because peristalsis is absent in achalasia patients.|$|R

This thesis contains two randomised controlled trials and a combined data analysis of both studies to establish which techniques appear the most effective in controlling reflux. It also contains a pilot study to determine whether intraoperative manometry can predict which patients are likely to suffer from postoperative dysphagia. One hundred and three underwent partial fundoplication (Anterior or Posterior) and one hundred and twenty one patients underwent total/subtotal (Nissen or Lind) in the randomised controlled trials and 40 patients were recruited into the intraoperative manometry study. Patients were followed up for 12 months and their change in symptoms recorded. In the partial fundoplication trial, patients who underwent posterior fundoplication had better control of symptoms compared to those who underwent anterior fundoplication at the 12 month follow up point. There was no difference between the groups who underwent <b>Nissen</b> and Lind <b>fundoplication.</b> When the studies were collated, the laparoscopic total/subtotal fundoplication appears to be superior in the control of reflux when compared to the laparoscopic partial fundoplication.

40|$|Most {{operations}} in the abdominal cavity and chest can be performed using minimally invasive techniques. As yet {{it has not been}} determined which laparoscopic procedures are preferable to the same operations done through conventional laparotomy. However, most surgeons who have completed the learning curves of these procedures believe that most minimally invasive techniques will be scientifically recognized soon. The evolution, validation and justification of advanced laparoscopic surgical methods seem inevitable. Most believe that the trend towards procedures that minimize or eliminate the trauma of surgery while adhering to accepted surgical principles is irreversible. The functional results of laparoscopic antireflux surgery in the seven years since its inception have been virtually identical to the success curves generated with open fundoplication in past years. Furthermore, overall patient outcomes with laparoscopic procedures have been superior to outcomes with the traditional approach. Success is determined by patient selection and operative technique. Patient evaluation should include esophagogastroduodenoscopy, barium swallow, 24 h pH study and esophageal motility study. Gastric emptying also should be evaluated. Patients who have abnormal propulsion in the esophagus should not receive a complete <b>fundoplication</b> (<b>Nissen)</b> because it adds a factor of obstruction. Dor or Toupet procedures are adequate alternatives. Prokinetic agents, dilation or pyloroplasty are used for pyloric obstruction ranging from little to more severe.

40|$|The {{resistance}} of the lower esophageal sphincter to reflux of gastric juice {{is determined by the}} integrated effects of radial pressures exerted over {{the entire length of the}} sphincter. This can be quantitated by three-dimensional computerized imaging of sphincter pressures obtained by a pullback of radially oriented pressure transducers and by calculating the volume of this image, in other words, the sphincter pressure vector volume. Validation studies showed that sphincter imaging based on a stepwise pullback of a catheter with four or eight radial side holes is superior to a rapid motorized pullback. Compared with 50 healthy volunteers, the total and abdominal sphincter pressure vector volume was lower in 150 patients with increased esophageal acid exposure (p less than 0. 001) and decreased with increasing esophageal mucosal damage (p less than 0. 01). Calculation of the sphincter pressure vector volume was superior to standard techniques in identifying a mechanically defective sphincter as the cause of increased esophageal acid exposure, particularly in patients without mucosal damage. The <b>Nissen</b> and Belsey <b>fundoplication</b> increased the total and intra-abdominal sphincter pressure vector volume (p less than 0. 001) and normalized the three-dimensional sphincter image. Failure to do so was associated with recurrent or persistent reflux.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the symptomatic and objective outcomes in patients who underwent subsequent operation because of recurrent reflux symptoms or troublesome dysphagia after primary antireflux surgery. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Between January 1, 1994, and March 31, 2005, 130 patients (mean [SD] age, 48. 4 [14. 1] years) undergoing surgical reintervention after antireflux surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease were prospectively studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Symptomatic outcome was determined by questionnaires. Esophageal manometry and 24 -hour pH monitoring were performed to assess the objective outcome. RESULTS: A total of 144 reinterventions were performed in 130 patients, for recurrent reflux in 94 patients (65. 3 %) and for troublesome dysphagia in 50 patients (34. 7 %). Belsey Mark IV fundoplication through a left-sided thoracotomy was performed in 78 (54. 2 %) and a subsequent <b>Nissen</b> or partial <b>fundoplication</b> during 66 reinterventions (45. 8 %), including 16 laparoscopic procedures.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Indications {{for surgery}} in gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have {{decreased}} significantly since {{the introduction of}} proton pump inhibitors. At {{the same time there}} has been renewed surgical interest in this disease triggered by the development of laparoscopy. We present our results with laparoscopic treatment of GERD and the change in our surgical approach to the condition during the past few years. METHODS: All patients admitted to the surgical department underwent prior evaluation by a gastroenterologist. Indications for surgery were resistance to medical therapy in 30 cases, recurrence of GERD after cessation of treatment in 25 cases and personal preference of the patient when maintenance therapy was necessary in 6 cases. The data were reviewed and the patients contacted during the first trimester of 1998 to evaluate long-term results. RESULTS: 63 patients were operated on between 1991 and July 1997. Rossetti-Nissen fundoplication was performed routinely until March 1995. Thereafter, the type of antireflux surgery has been chosen according to the preoperative evaluation of the patients, including endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and gastric emptying studies. There was no mortality and, except for one case, only minor morbidity. Four patients required reoperation, two for severe gas bloat syndrome and two for recurrence of GERD. Overall, the long-term follow-up shows that 93 patients are satisfied or very satisfied with their outcome (Visick 1 or 2). 5 % of the patients need daily medication for heartburn, 5 % complain of occasionally disturbing dysphagia, and 12 % of sometimes distressing gas bloat. More patients have gas bloat after the Rossetti-Nissen procedure than after the <b>Nissen</b> or Toupet <b>fundoplications.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The enthusiasm of surgeons for the laparoscopic approach to GERD has prompted renewed interest in the pathophysiology of the disease. Consequently, indications for surgery are better defined, surgical technique is chosen according to the individual patient based on objective preoperative studies and follow-up has improved. In this setting, laparoscopic fundoplication represents an effective treatment for GERD. It is associated with lower postoperative morbidity than open surgery and represents the first choice when surgery is indicated...|$|R
