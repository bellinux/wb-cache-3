5000|$|A <b>pusher,</b> <b>pusher</b> <b>craft,</b> <b>pusher</b> boat, pusher tug, or towboat, is a boat {{designed}} for pushing barges or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow, a shallow draft, and typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for pushing barges of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a [...] "tow" [...] and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long distances, or long haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.|$|R
50|$|The Blackburn-Walker biplane was a {{tailless}} three-bay tandem <b>pusher</b> <b>craft</b> with a canard {{elevator and}} the engine in front of its two occupants, which was designed and built by Harold Blackburn and Albert Walker in 1909. The placement of the engine ahead of the wing leading edge was unusual, with a long driveshaft passing between the two occupants to the two-bladed pusher propeller. The flywheel was extensively drilled for lightness. A precarious step below the engine allowed access to the crank handle and radiator. Lateral control was provided by twin narrow-chord rudders between {{the upper and lower}} planes.|$|R
5000|$|Wheel {{fairings}} {{are often}} called [...] "wheel pants", [...] "speed fairings" [...] or, in the United Kingdom, [...] "wheel spats". These fairings are a trade-off in advantages, as they increase the frontal and surface area, but {{also provide a}} smooth surface, a faired nose and tail for laminar flow, {{in an attempt to}} reduce the turbulence created by the round wheel and its associated gear legs and brakes. They also have the important function of preventing mud and stones from being thrown upwards against the wings or fuselage, or into the propeller on a <b>pusher</b> <b>craft.</b>|$|R
60|$|The strangers {{stepped into}} the boat the instant her bow grated on the sand with the air of persons who are conferring rather than {{receiving}} a favor, and making no attempt to <b>push</b> the <b>craft</b> into deep water.|$|R
50|$|A setting pole is a pole, {{handled by}} a single individual, made to move {{watercraft}} by <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> in the desired direction. Because it is a pushing tool, it is generally used from the stern (back) of the craft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1917 Minister of Labour, John Hodge {{passed the}} Trade Unions' Amalgamation Act, which {{simplified}} the process whereby Trade Unions merged, amalgamated or federated. This was {{in response to}} both the difficulty of mergers under the previous legislation (requiring two-third majorities in favor in all participant unions), as well as a desire to <b>push</b> <b>craft</b> unions into general trade unions to cover entire industries. [...] However, difficulties still remained. When the first three members federated in 1917, they were legally prevented from accepting any new members. The ISTC focused on industrial negotiations, and new members joined its subsidiary, the British Iron, Steel and Kindred Trades Association (BISAKTA); formally, unions which federated after 1917 joined this association.|$|R
50|$|All {{jet engines}} are {{reaction}} engines that generate thrust by emitting a jet of fluid rearwards at relatively high speed. The {{forces on the}} inside of the engine needed to create this jet give a strong thrust on the engine which <b>pushes</b> the <b>craft</b> forwards.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear thermal rockets pass a {{propellant}} over {{a central}} reactor, heating the propellant and {{causing it to}} expand rapidly out a rocket nozzle, <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> forward. The propellant itself is not directly interacting with {{the interior of the}} reactor, so the propellant is not irradiated.|$|R
50|$|The capsule {{would not}} need propulsion: the wind and {{possible}} tidal currents are expected to <b>push</b> this buoyant <b>craft</b> around the sea for months.|$|R
6000|$|... "That’s me," [...] {{said the}} lighterman, as he <b>pushed</b> his {{unwieldy}} <b>craft</b> from the jetty. [...] "I’ll tell Sam {{your opinion of}} ’im. So long." ...|$|R
50|$|In June 1974, Rutan {{returned}} to California {{to establish the}} Rutan Aircraft Factory. In this business he designed and developed prototypes for several aircraft, mostly intended for amateur builders. His first design, executed {{while he was still}} at Bede, was the VariViggen, a two-seat <b>pusher</b> single-engine <b>craft</b> of canard configuration. The canard would become a feature of many Rutan designs, notably the very popular VariEze and Long-EZ.|$|R
50|$|His {{aptitude}} at flying was noticed {{early on}} in his career, and he became an airship captain, obtaining his airship license in 1911. However, when Eckener attempted his first flight on 16 May 1911 in the LZ 8, christened Deutschland II, he decided to launch it in a strong wind which <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> into the hangar wall, damaging it seriously. Nonetheless, he became a very successful airshipman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Arthur, quick!" [...] {{she cried}} {{to the young}} man, who was calmly wading near the beach, and he caught the note of terror in her voice and hastened to help <b>push</b> the little <b>craft</b> into the water.|$|R
60|$|After a {{while they}} {{distinguished}} a cluster of small dark objects some distance in front, and made toward them cautiously. The ducks {{did not seem to}} get much plainer, and Whitney thought they were swimming away. Stopping a few minutes to allay suspicion, Dick paddled again; but the ducks vanished as they crept on. Then he turned in toward the bank and <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> along the bottom, hoping the dark background would hide their approach. Presently they saw the ducks again and Whitney raised his gun.|$|R
60|$|Cheenbuk {{used his}} eyes as directed, and saw that a heavy stone {{had been placed in}} the stern so as to {{counteract}} the difference of weight. With an air of humility, therefore, he stepped into his allotted place, took up a paddle and sat down. Adolay <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> into deeper water, stepped lightly in, and, giving a vigorous shove, sent it skimming out on the lake. Then the two dipped their paddles with a will, and shot over the water like an arrow.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{performing}} {{roles in}} family TV series, Soledad's passion and wishes to <b>push</b> her <b>craft</b> led to play complex and different roles {{far away from}} herself in primetime television films and mini-series like Dromo, Maltratadas and Televisión x la inclusión. With her starring role in Contra las Cuerdas, she established her rising stardom. On stage, she displayed her acting abilities in the play Ceremonia Secreta, performing Cecilia Engelhardt a physically and mentally abused young woman who loses her mind. Her performance garnered her a Florencio Sánchez Award nomination in 2012.|$|R
50|$|It weighed 16 {{tons and}} had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. To prevent fouling of the {{propellers}} in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5-6 knots and its beaching capacity was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{technical}} characteristics for waterways forming {{part of the}} network should be those laid down for a class IV waterway in the classification of European Inland Waterways (CEMT), which allows {{the passage of a}} vessel or a pushed train 80 to 85 m and 9.50 m. Where a waterway forming part of the network is modernized or constructed, the technical specifications should correspond at least to class IV, should enable class Va/Vb to be achieved at a later date, and should make satisfactory provision for the passage of vessels used for combined transport. Class Va allows the passage of a vessel or a <b>pushed</b> train of <b>craft</b> 110 m long and 11.40 m wide, and class Vb allows the passage of a <b>pushed</b> train of <b>craft</b> 172 to 185 m long and 11.40 m wide.|$|R
50|$|It weighed 16 {{tons and}} had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. To prevent fouling of the {{propellers}} in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5 to 6 knots and its beaching capacity was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of a sailing craft's speed and direction {{with respect to the}} wind, together with wind strength, generate an apparent wind velocity. When the craft is aligned in a direction where the sail can be adjusted to align with its leading edge parallel to the apparent wind, the sail acts as an airfoil to generate lift in a direction perpendicular to the apparent wind. A component of this lift <b>pushes</b> the <b>craft</b> crosswise to its course, which is resisted by a sailboat's keel, an ice boat's blades or a land-sailing craft's wheels. An important component of lift is directed forward in the direction of travel and propels the craft.|$|R
50|$|The blended wings {{merge with}} the {{fuselage}} {{into a single}} airfoil to reduce aerodynamic drag, improve fuel economy, and increase flight endurance. Made largely of composites, including epoxy/carbon fiber and fiberglass, the airfoil is rigid, providing structural efficiency and stiffness, reducing materials and manufacturing costs. With net hooks in the nose and a rear <b>push</b> propeller, the <b>craft</b> lands in a mobile retrieval net.|$|R
2500|$|Hovercraft can be {{powered by}} one or more engines. Small craft, such as the SR.N6, usually have one engine with the drive split through a gearbox. On {{vehicles}} with several engines, one usually drives the fan (or impeller), which is responsible for lifting the vehicle by forcing high pressure air under the craft. The air inflates the [...] "skirt" [...] under the vehicle, causing it to rise above the surface. Additional engines provide thrust in order to propel the craft. Some hovercraft use ducting to allow one engine to perform both tasks by directing some of the air to the skirt, the rest of the air passing out of the back to <b>push</b> the <b>craft</b> forward.|$|R
50|$|A {{prototype}} motor {{landing craft}} (MLC1) was built and first sailed in 1926, finishing trials in 1927. It weighed 16 tons, with a draught of 6.5 ft. The MLC had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. It was also extremely noisy. In {{order to prevent}} fouling of the propellers in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5-6 knots and its beaching capacity was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R
60|$|When {{the canoe}} {{grounded}} Driscoll got {{on board and}} picked up a pole. As there was not another, Thirlwell paddled in the stern while they <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> through the slack. It was hard work and he noted how slowly the pines rolled past. By and by they reached an angry-white rush of current between an island and the bank, and as they could scarcely make progress Scott suggested putting down the poles and paddling across. Driscoll, however, grumbled that they were not far enough up stream, and getting out when they ran the canoe close to the driftwood that washed about the shingle, tracked her for some distance through the shallow water. While the fellow stumbled among the dead branches, Scott gave Thirlwell a meaning look that the latter thought he understood.|$|R
50|$|The pilot {{signals the}} {{departure}} and arrival of Mark Twain using a horn and bell system, along with various signals to other river craft attractions. Because the riverboat travels along an I-beam guide rail throughout the ride, the pilot does not maneuver the ship. Instead, the pilot serves as lookout for other river traffic, such as Davy Crockett's Explorer Canoes and the Rafts to Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island, and communicates his observations with the boiler engineer. The boiler engineer is stationed {{on the bottom}} deck towards the stern. This is where the throttle and reverser are located. From here, the boiler engineer controls the speed {{and direction of the}} riverboat. Steam from the boiler is used to power the paddle wheels and thus <b>pushes</b> the <b>craft</b> along its guide-way.|$|R
5000|$|The Army and Royal Navy {{formed a}} landing craft {{committee}} to [...] "recommend... {{the design of}} landing craft". A prototype motor landing craft, designed by J. Samuel White of Cowes, was built and first sailed in 1926. It weighed 16 tons and had a box-like appearance, having a square bow and stern. To prevent fouling of the propellers in a craft destined {{to spend time in}} surf and possibly be beached, a crude waterjet propulsion system was devised by White's designers. A Hotchkiss petrol engine drove a centrifugal pump which produced a jet of water, <b>pushing</b> the <b>craft</b> ahead or astern, and steering it, according to how the jet was directed. Speed was 5-6 knots and its beaching capacity was good. By 1930, three MLC were operated by the Royal Navy.|$|R
60|$|They <b>pushed</b> off the <b>craft</b> {{from the}} red hull of the Arabella, bent to their sweeps, then, {{hoisting}} sail, headed back for Port Royal, intent upon reaching it before darkness should come down upon them. And Bishop, the great bulk of him huddled in the stem sheets, sat silent, his black brows knitted, his coarse lips pursed, malevolence and vindictiveness so whelming now his recent panic that he forgot his near escape of the yardarm and the running noose.|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} save coal, as it was {{impossible}} to get that fuel at any point to be touched during the expedition, a look-out was kept for a wood-pile. On rounding a point a pirogue, skilfully paddled by a youth, shot out, and in its bow was a girl of fifteen, of fair face, beautiful black eyes, and demure manners. The boy asked for a paper, which was thrown to him, and the couple <b>pushed</b> their tiny <b>craft</b> out into the swell of the boat.|$|R
60|$|After hailing his fireman {{to bring}} the launch alongside, he threw a quick glance about. The shore boatmen were <b>pushing</b> their <b>craft</b> abreast of the ladder and {{shouting}} as they got in each other's way, but one boat had already left the ship and was pulling fast towards the harbor. There seemed to be only one man on board besides her crew, and Dick {{had no doubt that}} he was the flute-player. He must be followed, since it was important to find out whom he met and if, as Dick suspected, he meant to send off a telegram. But the liner's captain must be warned, and Dick turned hastily around. The windlass was rattling and the bridge, on which he could see the captain's burly figure, was some distance off, while the passage between the gangway and deckhouse was blocked by the departing guests.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was at this}} {{critical}} moment that Gilpatric stepped in to settle the argument. [...] "Essentially, Mr. President," [...] Gilpatric was recorded telling Kennedy, [...] "this is a choice between limited action and unlimited action, {{and most of us}} think it is better to start with limited action." [...] It was Gilpatric's intervention that changed the direction of the discussion, according to Harvard professor and former Department of Defense official Graham T. Allison, who authored a book, Essence of Decision, about the crisis. Proposing the blockade was McNamara and Gilpatric's solution to providing President Kennedy with a strong response [...] - [...] but short of the airstrike that McGeorge Bundy and others were <b>pushing.</b> By <b>crafting</b> their solution, and with the normally reticent Gilpatric speaking up forcefully for it, the two managed to change the thrust of policy.The President followed Gilpatric and McNamara's recommendation.|$|R
60|$|He paddled leisurely, {{letting the}} canoe drift {{down as he}} crossed towards the point. The sun was high yet, and nothing pressed. His work would {{commence}} only {{with the coming of}} darkness. Avoiding the Lingard jetty, he rounded the point, and paddled up the creek at the back of Almayer's house. There were many canoes lying there, their noses all drawn together, fastened all to the same stake. Babalatchi <b>pushed</b> his little <b>craft</b> in amongst them and stepped on shore. On {{the other side of the}} ditch something moved in the grass.|$|R
60|$|But the Sarci {{had already}} pressed quickly on, {{followed}} {{by some of}} the torch bearers, and {{were in the midst of}} the Roman tents before the legionaries gathered in sufficient force to meet them. The torches were applied to the tents, and fanned by the breeze, the flames spread rapidly from one to another. Beric blew the signal for retreat, and his men in a solid body, with their spears outward, fell back. The Romans, as they arrived at the spot, rushed furiously upon them; but discipline was this time on the side of the Sarci, who beat off all attacks till they reached the river bank. Then in good order they took their places in the boats, Beric with a small body covering the movement till the last; then they made a rush to the boats; the men, standing with their poles ready, instantly <b>pushed</b> the <b>craft</b> into the stream, and in two minutes they were safe on the other side.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. PropulsionThe quanter {{stands at}} the front of the barge or, for a punt, {{normally}} on the rear deck. The angle at which the quant is held depends on the depth of the water and the desired speed of travel. A steeper angle is required for deeper water (the bottom of the quant must be able to reach the bed of the river or canal) and a shallower angle required for speed. The quanter drives the quant downward and slightly backward to <b>push</b> the <b>craft</b> forwards. On a larger boat, the quanter then walks down the side of the boat, facing aft and braced against the quant pole, the boat being propelled forward at the speed he walks. To reverse, the quant can be pushed forwards. The quant is then pulled out of the water by placing hand over hand on it and pulling upwards (as if one were climbing down a pole).|$|R
50|$|Gueritz's {{immediate}} {{task was}} {{to solve the problem}} of vehicles becoming stuck in the soft sand, and to start getting men through the exits being cleared through the minefields and barbed wire by flail tanks. To add to his problems, a further brigade came ashore at 0930, only to find that high winds were driving the tide higher than expected, reducing the space available on the beach and <b>pushing</b> the landing <b>craft</b> on to the explosive obstacles left by the Germans. Despite all this by the evening of D-Day 30,000 troops, hundreds of vehicles and tons of ammunition and other supplies had been landed and moved through the beach area.|$|R
60|$|It {{happened}} that Anteek and Nootka had observed what Adolay was about, and were watching her with interest, so {{that before the}} kayak had turned fairly over their paddles dipped with a flash {{in the water and}} they rushed to the rescue. And not a moment too soon, for the poor girl's power of endurance was almost exhausted when her friends turned the kayak violently up. This was well, and Adolay drew a long gasping breath; but now the inexperience of the rescuers came into play, for, being ignorant of the cranky nature of a birch-bark canoe, they acted without the necessary caution, the canoe overturned and they all found themselves in the water. This time Adolay managed to wriggle out of her position, but being unable to swim she could only cling helplessly to the kayak. Nootka, equally helpless, clung to the canoe. Fortunately Anteek could swim like a fish, and bravely set to work to <b>push</b> both <b>crafts</b> towards the shore. But they were a long way out; the weight of the two girls made them difficult to push, and, being separate, they had a tendency to diverge in different directions.|$|R
500|$|On {{the night}} of 1011 November, the British Mediterranean Fleet {{launched}} a surprise air raid on the harbor in Taranto. Twenty-one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier [...] attacked the Italian fleet in two waves. They scored one hit on Caio Duilio, three hits on , and one on [...] The torpedo hit Caio Duilio on her starboard side; it tore an [...] hole in the hull and flooded the forward main battery magazines. A water tanker and several smaller <b>craft</b> <b>pushed</b> the battleship aground in shallow water to prevent her from sinking in the harbor. Temporary repairs were effected, and in January 1941, she was refloated and sent to Genoa for permanent repairs, which began on 26 January.|$|R
