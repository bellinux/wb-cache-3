The other new feature of this study is the usage of quarterly data. Granger causalities are calculated for time series of 15 European countries, the USA, and Japan in order to test if there is a positive relationship between the development of bond markets and economic growth also for shorter time periods. The significant Granger causalities found show the following tendency: Economic growth is causal for <b>net</b> <b>issue</b> values of government bonds, and net issuance of corporate and financial institutions bonds are causal for economic growth. That finding is important for the future architecture of the financial sector, in particular in emerging markets and the new EU member countries.

Previous research {{has tended to}} focus on only one savings channel at a time and then report only an aggregate savings rate. We note first that savings rates depend on the level of cash flows. For negative cash flows, savings rates are very low from cash flows and higher from net equity and <b>net</b> debt <b>issues.</b> For higher levels of cash flows, savings rates from cash flows increase substantially while savings rates from <b>net</b> debt <b>issues</b> and <b>net</b> equity <b>issues</b> fall. Using a sample of firms worldwide, we find that constrained firms have higher total savings rates than unconstrained companies which suggest that constrained firms which face costly external finance save more now in order to minimize the chance {{of not being able to}} fund valuable investment projects in the future. We also find that savings rates are positively related to investment opportunities, R&D intensity, multinational status, and whether firms are located in countries with a bank-oriented system and negatively related to whether firms pay dividends an...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1920 s, {{the federal}} {{government}} has used an array of farm programs to provide a “safety net ” for American agriculture. Farm programs have used price supports, disaster payments, income supports, direct payments, and supply management to provide a safety net for particular markets and producers. With the exception of land idling programs, the programs have provided incentives for production and the diversification of production throughout the continental United States. While the FAIR Act of 1996 has been generously applauded for allowing producers planting flexibility, maintaining export competitiveness through marketing loan programs, and maintaining full production, the Act has been criticized for its lack of sufficient counter-cyclical safety net. Although subsidized crop insurance programs and marketing loan provisions are counter-cyclical in nature, the ad hoc passage of emergency relief {{in each of the last}} three years 1998 - 2000 and the pending assistance in 2001 suggests that these programs have not provided sufficient support to program crop agriculture.

40|$|Since the 1920 's, {{the federal}} {{government}} has used an array of farm programs to provide a “safety net ” for American agriculture. Farm programs have used price supports, disaster payments, income supports, direct payments, and supply management to provide a safety net for particular markets and producers. This array of farm programs has rarely been organized or managed with the sole purpose of providing a minimum income level to farmers. With the exception of set aside programs, the programs have provided incentives for production and the diversification of production through out the continental United States. While the FAIR Act of 1996 has been generously applauded for allowing producers planting flexibility, maintaining export competitiveness through marketing loan programs, and maintaining production, the Act has been criticized for its lack of a sufficient safety net.

40|$|Abstract: The return {{predictability}} of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> and profitability {{has changed}} {{significantly in the}} past four decades. While the return-profitability relation has weakened, the return-net stock issues relation has strengthened over time. A model of investment under uncertainty with convex external financing costs suggests that the decreasing level and decreasing persistence of firm profitability may explain the time-varying return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> and profitability, respectively. We provide empirical evidence that while the change in firm fundamentals (i. e., profitability) can fully explain the time trend in the return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues,</b> investor sentiment cannot, contrary to what the market timing theory suggests. The return predictability of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> increases more significantly for small, growth, and young firms since these firms tend to experience a larger decrease in the level of profitability over time...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relation of}} the anomalies on accruals and <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> with the value/glamour anomaly. Our findings reveal, that hedge strategies on retained earnings, total accruals, net operating assets (accrual proxies), cash distributions to equity holders (<b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> proxy), past sales growth, book to market ratio and free cash flow yield (value/glamour proxies) constitute statistical arbitrage opportunities. We also find that the generated abnormal returns from hedge strategies that combine information on retained earnings (and on other accrual proxies) or cash distributions to equity holders and value/glamour proxies are significantly higher than those from each proxy alone. Thus, if one agrees that the notion of statistical arbitrage is incompatible with market efficiency our evidence suggests that the anomalies on accruals and <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> capture distinct forms of mispricing with the value glamour anomaly. Alternatively, our evidence suggests the specification of a broader set of risk factors to existing asset pricing models. accrual anomaly, <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> anomaly, value/glamour anomaly, market efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the informational content of retained and distributed earnings for future profitability and market mispricing. We find that investors {{act as if}} the components of retained earnings (current operating accruals, non current operating accruals and retained cash flows) have similar implications for future profitability, leading to an overvaluation of their differential persistence. They also do not distinguish between the distinct properties of distributed earnings, correctly anticipate the persistence of net cash distributions to debt holders (net debt repayment) and underestimate the persistence of net cash distributions to equity holders (dividends minus <b>net</b> stock <b>issues).</b> Our {{evidence suggests that the}} accrual anomaly documented in the accounting literature and the anomaly on <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> documented in the finance literature could be a subset of a larger anomaly on retained earnings.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} the following asset pricing anomalies viz. size, value, momentum, liquidity, accruals, profitability and <b>net</b> stock <b>issues</b> in India. Size effect is the strongest with a difference of 4. 4 % per month between small and big stock returns. A positive relationship is reported between accruals, stock issues and returns and a negative relation between profitability and returns which is in contrast to prior research. CAPM is unable to explain these anomalies with the exception of <b>net</b> stock <b>issues.</b> The Fama French (FF) model is able to capture value, profitability and accruals. While liquidity anomaly is explained by a liquid augmented FF model, the sector and earnings momentum factors do not contribute significantly towards explaining returns.

40|$|Given the {{historically}} high equity premium, {{is it now}} {{a good time to}} invest in the stock market?

The typical paper reports that the variable predicted well in an *in-sample* regression, implying forecasting ability. Our paper explores the *out-of-sample* performance of these variables, and finds that not a single one would have helped a real-world investor outpredicting the then-prevailing historical equity premium mean. Most would have outright hurt. Therefore, we find that, for all practical purposes, the equity premium has not been predictable, and any belief about whether the stock market is now too high or too low has to be based on theoretical prior, not on the empirically variables we have explored. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a large number of {{financing}} decisions of solvent firms are dictated by creditors, who use the transfer of control rights accompanying financial covenant violations to address incentive conflicts between managers and investors. After showing that financial covenant violations occur among almost one third of all publicly listed firms, we find that creditors use the threat of accelerating the loan to reduce <b>net</b> debt <b>issuing</b> activity by over 2 % of assets per annum immediately following a covenant violation. Further, this decline is persistent in that <b>net</b> debt <b>issuing</b> activity fails to return to pre-violation levels even after two years, resulting in a gradual decline in leverage of almost 3 %. These findings represent the first, of which we are aware, piece of empirical evidence highlighting the role of control rights in shaping corporate financial policies outside of bankruptcy. A fundamental question in financial economics concerns how firms make financing decisions (e. g., Myers (1984)).
