5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of The Quick and the Dead, Friendly was {{recruited}} to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums—a weekly show called Hear It <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as See It Now on Sunday, November 18, 1951.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Beck {{contributed to}} a tribute album for Bruce Haack and Esther Nelson and their label Dimension 5 Records. The album, Dimension Mix, {{released}} in 2005, was a benefit for Cure Autism <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> produced by Ross Harris, an early collaborator who designed the artwork for Mellow Gold.|$|E
60|$|It <b>is</b> he <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> caught, {{swallowed}} like {{a letter}} in the post.|$|R

6000|$|... "There--what did I tell you? <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the way {{to handle}} Eckert. You see, I have petted him along patiently, and put his suspicions to sleep. I am glad we came. You tell the boys about it when you go back. Cat eat a cocoanut--oh, my! <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just his way, exactly--he will tell the absurdest lie, and trust to luck {{to get out of}} it again.|$|R
500|$|... "Mine" [...] {{was one of}} the {{fourteen}} tracks in Speak <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> written solely by Swift. She also co-produced the song with Nathan Chapman, who co-produced all of Swift's studio albums. It was originally planned to be released on August 16, 2010, however, after the leak of an unauthorized low-quality mp3 file of the song, Big Machine Records decided to ship the song to country radio and iTunes twelve days earlier than planned on August 4, 2010. Swift commented that [...] "a leak is so out of my comfort zone, but it ended up good in the end. It made me so emotional that I started crying." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Smart was good, {{but having}} {{the ability to}} beat someone senseless! <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> real power. Education was often {{talked about in the}} apartment, but always with the implied threat that if your marks weren't acceptable, be ready to give up your soul to God because your ass belonged to our father ... nd As weren't acceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stoner {{has stated}} that he would prefer to shun the limelight and let his riding style do the talking. In an {{interview}} with Australian Motorcycle News, he {{was quoted as saying}} he would prefer a return to purer form of racing from the 500cc days, stating that [...] "Back in those days, it was just racing – Doohan, Rainey, Schwantz, Gardner, Lawson – not half as much bullshit as <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> the life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> strange. Everything {{depends on}} how one looks at things.--What do you think, Mrs Scholtz?" [...] asked Mrs Merton.|$|R
5000|$|... “To make {{something}} {{with a lot of}} money, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> easy; but to {{make something}} out of nothing - <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> something.” Baldassare Forestiere ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what I really admire. I {{like a man}} of character. You know, I've {{always been}} {{impressed}} by your strength and determination.|$|R
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> loosened, {{only the}} one around his knees remained.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{was very}} {{impatient}} to trace up his father, but just <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> impossible.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Simmons, ye so-oor,' chuckled {{the parrot}} in the veranda sleepily, {{recognising}} a well-known voice. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> absolutely all.|$|E
6000|$|... "My word! <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what I call a {{compliment}} worth having. But I hear the gentleman himself coming. Shall I repeat it to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly," [...] I answered. [...] "But {{you know}} that a great many things <b>are</b> allowed <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> once {{forbidden}} to the True Disbeliever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got a pair <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> mamma's, and a {{beautiful}} little pair of pearl and turquoise ones, <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> dying to wear," [...] sighed Rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Simmons, ye so-oor," [...] chuckled {{the parrot}} in the veranda, sleepily, {{recognizing}} a well-known voice. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> absolutely all.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{a shrewd}} thought. She {{was but a}} girl after all, and, under illness and exhaustion, subject to a girl's weaknesses.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{precisely}} what Fan wanted to know; again she looked anxiously at Mrs. Churton, {{and it was}} a great relief when that lady replied: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There <b>now!</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> {{what is so}} demoralising. You {{should stand}} out for the highest. When I came to you at St Albans, I had not dirty cuffs.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, Allan Quatermain! <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> strange, for {{certainly}} I {{would not}} have saved yours," [...] and he laughed a little, then turned over and went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|FOOL. Ah! <b>Now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> different. I am {{not afraid}} of you now. But I must come near you; {{somebody}} in there might hear what the Angel said.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. Oh, I'll see him <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> what hurt me most, {{lying to}} him about why I was leaving--letting him think I was sick of working with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{a pretty}} fair guess, Charlie," [...] said Dick, laughing. [...] "To tell ye the plain truth, I {{have been out}} arter a dear--full sail-- an'--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{better than}} a dozen sermons on the beauty of forgiveness, and did Charlie more good, for it showed him how sweet humility was, and proved that Rose practised as she preached.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{not exactly}} {{the state of the}} case," [...] he said, [...] "but we must not talk of those things <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> all passed and gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a go! Why, I'm goin' to help lay {{the great}} Atlantic Cable too. I'm one the stooard's boys. What may you be, young feller?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{they are}} only equal in duties and in rights. But, as you said just <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a very long story. Are they equal in nothing here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] he said huskily. [...] "Here comes a lad <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{born on the}} Bowery {{and knows}} every inch of it. If he's ever been above Bleecker street he's kept it to himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, such as he was. The Lord {{preserve}} me {{from such}} a one!" [...] said Dolly. [...] "It was thought he went off with Hugh Crombie, that keeps the tavern <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> fifteen years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then the}} crowd kept on chunkin' her till she run clear out of town. And {{the next day}} they finds her drowned dead in Hunter's mill pond. I mind it all <b>now.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> thirty year ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are in for}} it <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> certain," [...] {{observed}} Larry. [...] "They are {{not going}} to let us go until they are sure we are O. K." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> good of you, father. Of course I {{need not}} say <b>that</b> I <b>am</b> charmed at the {{prospect}} you open up to me. And--and when may I start?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{asking too}} much, Charlie, and I will promise nothing, because I cannot do it honestly," [...] she answered, so firmly {{that he knew}} appeal was useless.|$|R
