5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} enhanced vehicle physics, updated visuals, and strong sound design. Several reviewers also gave {{high marks for}} the game's Autovista mode. Some critics expressed frustration with Kinect features, and others also felt that the game was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an innovation from its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 3. These critics did, however, concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the eyes and mouth. Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E

In an era of increasingly bitter, partisan politics, Carper's actions and policies placed him at the political center, in keeping with Delaware's consensus style of governing.|$|E

25|$|Heading into 2003, Tom Long {{refused to}} work for Ernie Eves. Most speculated that Long saw Eves as too wishy-washy and <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a {{traditional}} hard-right conservative. Jaime Watt took Long's position as campaign co-chair and more or less all the same players settled into the same spot. A few new faces included Jeff Bangs as campaign manager. Bangs was a long-time Eves loyalist {{who had grown up}} in his riding of Parry Sound.|$|E
25|$|Lactose, the {{disaccharide}} sugar {{component of}} all milk, must be cleaved {{in the small}} intestine by the enzyme lactase, in order for its constituents, galactose and glucose, to be absorbed. Lactose intolerance is {{a condition in which}} people have symptoms due to <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the enzyme lactase in the small intestines. Those affected vary in the amount of lactose they can tolerate before symptoms develop. These may include abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea. Severity depends on the amount a person eats or drinks. Those affected are usually able to drink at least one cup of milk without developing significant symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if drunk with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E

25|$|On 4 November 2004, in a turnout {{of almost}} 48% in an all postal ballot, {{voters in the}} North East decisively {{rejected}} the proposed regional assembly. The reasons for this result are varied, however it is felt that the regional power would have been concentrated in an Assembly situated in Newcastle upon Tyne. which given the strong historic rivalries between urban centres in the North-East may have caused resentment from the people of Sunderland and Middlesbrough. Notwithstanding this, in the Newcastle upon Tyne local council area itself the majority of votes cast were against the proposal. It was also felt that <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a case had been put forward for the necessity of the Assembly, and it was feared that it would add another layer of politicians and public servants, thereby increasing taxes for {{the citizens of the}} areas affected.|$|E

500|$|The Cottonian Fragment [...] {{consists}} of a single leaf, containing annals for 1113 and 1114.

500|$|DiCaprio's {{next project}} was the drama film The Beach (2000), an {{adaption}} of Alex Garland's 1996 {{novel of the}} same name. He played an American backpacking tourist looking for the perfect {{way of life in}} a secret island commune in the Gulf of Thailand. Budgeted at $US50 million, the film became a financial success, grossing $US144 million worldwide, but as with DiCaprio's previous project, the film was negatively reviewed by critics. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that [...] "Richard [...] is too much the American Everyman and <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> a well-defined individual to entirely capture one's interest and imagination, and DiCaprio, while perfectly watchable, does not endow him with the quirks or distinguishing marks to make this man from nowhere a dimensional character." [...] The next year, he was nominated for another Razzie Award for his work on the film.|$|E

500|$|Faced with {{essentially}} united {{opposition from}} his own Party's Senate caucus, Eisenhower needed the help of Democrats to defeat the Amendment. [...] Caro summarized the problem: [...] "Defeating the amendment and thereby preserving {{the power of the}} presidency—his first objective—could not be accomplished even if he united his party's liberal and moderate senators against it; there simply were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> them. [...] He would have to turn conservative Senators against it too, conservatives who were at the moment wholeheartedly for it—and not just Democratic conservatives but at least a few members of the Republican Old Guard." [...] President Eisenhower continued his opposition. In January, he claimed that the Bricker Amendment would fatally weaken the bargaining position of the United States because the states would be involved in foreign policy, recalling the divisions under the Articles of Confederation.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine views Back to the Egg as [...] "a set of [...] most undistinguished songs" [...] that [...] "have no spark whatsoever", and bemoans [...] "the weak {{sound of}} the record and Wings' faceless performances". Among McCartney biographers, Vincent Benitez writes that the songs are [...] "uneven in quality", and Howard Sounes {{describes}} the album as [...] "a curate's egg, good in parts, with token attempts at sounding contemporary". Tom Doyle views [...] "the new wave-ish rockers" [...] like [...] "Spin It On" [...] as [...] "too smoothed out to be truly edgy" [...] and the two spoken-word tracks as [...] "weird – {{and not in a}} good way". Doyle considers that while Back to the Egg has its [...] "moments of inspiration", [...] "There was too much material , and yet <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> it to gel into a cohesive album." ...|$|E

500|$|Douglas Rankine of Wired UK and McKinley Noble of GamePro thought {{previously}} existing Nintendo DS {{games were}} revitalized with the Nintendo DSi XL's larger screens; games like Scribblenauts and The World Ends with You benefited from increased touchscreen precision and increased legibility of text, respectively. CVG's Mike Jackson {{argued that the}} bigger screens, which made its unchanged resolution blockier, would probably be less noticeable to the older demographic for which the XL is undoubtedly designed. However, Jackson and IGN's Scott Lowe and Chris Burke agreed its clear and vivid colors considerably compensated for its unchanged resolution. Carol Mangis of PC Magazine thought families looking to share a handheld between members should consider a DSi XL, but the larger screens were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> an incentive for current DSi owners to upgrade. Lowe, Burke, Jackson, and Bakalar concluded the larger DSi model is not an essential upgrade; Jackson explained [...] "if you tend not {{to carry it out}} with you, and only ever tend to use it at home, then the DSi XL is the better choice".|$|E
500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was unimpressed {{with the}} game, calling it [...] "a bit half-baked". He praised {{the opening of}} the game, arguing that, like Hansen himself, the player feels a strong sense of {{disorientation}} as they get used to being on the ship {{in the middle of a}} storm. However, he felt the strong opening soon gives way to clichés. He was highly critical of the absence of a map, arguing that because the environments all look similar, getting lost is a regular occurrence. GameSpot's Carrie Gouskos scored the PlayStation 2 version 6.9 out of 10 and the Xbox version 7.2 out of 10. She argued [...] "Atmospherically, Cold Fear is derivative and predictable, which is a shame considering that it is, at times, an enjoyable action game." [...] Although she praised the outdoor scenes on the boat, she felt there were <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> them, with too many [...] "generic indoor locations." [...] She was also highly critical of the lack of a map and the autosave feature, feeling the save points were unevenly distributed.|$|E
500|$|The last bomb hit at 08:06 in the {{vicinity}} of Turret II, likely penetrating the armored deck near the ammunition magazines located in the forward section of the ship. While <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the ship is intact to judge the exact location, its effects are indisputable: about seven seconds after the hit, the forward magazines detonated in a cataclysmic explosion, mostly venting through the sides of the ship and destroying much of the interior structure of the forward part of the ship. This caused the forward turrets and conning tower to collapse downward some [...] and the foremast and funnel to collapse forward, effectively tearing the ship in half. The explosion touched off fierce fires that burned for two days; debris showered down on Ford Island in {{the vicinity}}. The blast from this explosion also put out fires on the repair ship Vestal, which was moored alongside. The bombs and subsequent explosion killed 1,177 of the 1,512 crewmen on board at the time, approximately half of the lives lost during the attack.|$|E
