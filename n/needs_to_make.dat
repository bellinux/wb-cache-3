5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{changing}} security {{environment will}} lead to new demands being placed on the Australian Defence Force. Although it is not expected that Australia will face any threat of direct attack from another country, terrorist groups and tensions between nations in East Asia pose threats to Australian security. More broadly, the Australian Government believes that it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a contribution to maintaining the rules based order globally. There is also a risk that climate change, weak economic growth and social factors could cause instability in South Pacific countries.|$|E
5|$|The player {{takes the}} role {{of one of the}} three Jack {{brothers}} – Jack Frost, Jack Lantern, or Jack Skelton – who have visited the human world for Halloween, and need to return to the fairy world before the portal connecting the two worlds closes. The player <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way through six areas, which consist of a number of floors, defeating enemies by using character-specific attacks and collecting keys to be able to advance to the next floor. It received generally positive reception for its gameplay, but was criticized for the lack of puzzle elements and under-utilization of the Virtual Boy's 3D effect.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> amends with Lisa, {{but she is}} too hurt to even talk with him. Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E
5|$|The player <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> moral {{decisions}} {{at certain}} points during the game, including making choices that {{can determine the}} fate of both soldiers and civilians. These decisions affect the relationship between Walker and his squadmates, and will cause them to react differently. The game has several subtle effects as the team starts being broken mentally and physically, including the degradation of their combat uniforms. Walker has visual and auditory hallucinations later into the game, and his executions of enemies become more violent. The orders and shouts to his team become increasingly angry and ragged in contrast to his original stern command voice. His kill confirmations of enemies corrupts from professional in the beginning to psychotic. Similarly, loading screens initially display helpful gameplay hints for the player, but as the game progresses, the text becomes increasingly hostile towards Walker's actions, and sometimes breaks the fourth wall by addressing the player directly. The game features collectibles known as Intel, which are audio logs that provide additional backstory for players.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong invented his {{receiver}} as a {{means of}} overcoming the deficiencies of early vacuum tube triodes used as high-frequency amplifiers in radio direction finding equipment. Unlike simple radio communication, which only <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> transmitted signals audible, direction-finders measure the received signal strength, which necessitates linear amplification of the actual carrier wave.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} {{purposes}} are conflicting, and the dam operator <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> dynamic tradeoffs. For example, power generation and water supply {{would keep the}} reservoir high, whereas flood prevention would keep it low. Many dams in areas where precipitation fluctuates in an annual cycle will also see the reservoir fluctuate annually {{in an attempt to}} balance these difference purposes. Dam management becomes a complex exercise amongst competing stakeholders.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} Graystripe causes another problem. Firestar {{appointed}} Brambleclaw {{as the new}} deputy assuming Graystripe had died, yet Graystripe was still alive. To help make the decision on who should be deputy, Firestar sends Leafpool to the Moonpool to talk with StarClan. Leafpool is told that Firestar <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his own choice. Jaypaw follows her and when Leafpool sees him, she is amazed. In the end, Brambleclaw stays as deputy since he knows the Clan better.|$|E

25|$|By storing {{all this}} {{information}} the vendor can determine the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests a product or an update. As already stated the vendor can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system {{is that it will}} ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous stage, many fewer riders were interested in joining an early breakaway group as the stage featured over 60 kilometers of climbing. 17.5 kilometres into the stage, at the first sprint, there were still no riders who had escaped and so Robbie McEwen saw the possibility of going for it. He succeeded, but mainly because the other sprinters did not even challenge him; this means that they have probably given up for the points classification. It seems now that McEwen just <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to Paris to win that green jersey.|$|E

Aaron rushes over to find an intervention for him consisting of LeBron, Matthew Broderick, Chris Evert, and Marv Albert.

25|$|Three months later, Tony {{returns to}} Miami. All of his assets have been frozen, and {{the districts of}} Miami he used to {{dominate}} have been divided among other drug cartels. His first act is to ask George Sheffield (James Woods) to become his lawyer again. Sheffield reluctantly agrees, but at higher wages than before. As Tony has no real power anymore, he has little choice. He next travels to see his old friend and contact Felix (Carlos Ferro), who tells him Sosa is working with Gaspar Gomez (Cheech Marin) {{in an effort to}} take over all of Tony's old turf. He also warns Tony there are very few dealers who can be trusted anymore, as most report back to Sosa. Tony says he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some small deals so he can make enough money to buy his mansion back from the Vice Squad, and begin to rebuild his empire. Felix advises him to speak to a bartender named Coco (Willa Holland). She puts him in touch with some dealers, as he slowly begins to re-establish his name, earning enough to re-purchase his mansion. He calls Felix, who tells him that he thinks Gaspar is smuggling cash. Tony steals one of Gaspar's trucks, carrying $50,000, and uses it to open a bank account. Reconnecting with his old banker, Jerry (Michael York), Montana uses the bank to launder his money as he sets out to reclaim control of Little Havana from the Diaz Brothers. As Tony's reputation increases, the brothers attempt to have him killed. He survives the assassination attempt, and one of the killers tells him the Diazes have murdered his mother. Killing them both in retaliation, he regains control of Little Havana.|$|E
25|$|For marching band, schools {{compete against}} other {{schools in the}} same UIL conference. The 33 regions are grouped into seven areas for Class 5A and 6A schools, and five areas for Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A schools. All schools of all classes compete in region {{competition}} annually, as a fall semester activity. However, in even-numbered years schools in Class 4A and Class 6A can advance from region to area and state, and in odd-numbered years schools from Class 1A, 2A, 3A, and 5A can advance from region to area and state. In order for bands to advance from Region to Area, {{they need to get}} an overall Division 1 from at least two Region judges, whether it be a 1-2-1, 2-1-1, 1-1-2, etc... the bands then will advance to the Area Competition. In order to make State, the band <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to the Area Final competition AND {{make it to the top}} 3-5 bands to get to State. The Area and State winner is the school with the lowest ordinal score when the rankings from each judge are tabulated. For example, School 1 receives a first place score from three judges, a second place score from the fourth judge, and a fourth place score from the fifth judge. The ordinal score for School 1 is 9 (1+1+1+2+4). School 2 receives two first place scores and three second place scores. The ordinal score for School 2 is 8 (2+2+2+1+1). School 2 would be the champion despite receiving fewer first place scores because School 2's ordinal score is lower than School 1's. Thus, overall placement in the caption area for each judge is more important than the raw score awarded by the judge.|$|E

[...] He is worried that Erin only agreed because Naughty Nelly is a promiscuous character.|$|E

I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the reader feel at home in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} is really all about."

As {{a result of what}} Liz said, Jack fears that he will not be around so he decides to teach his unborn son how to live by {{recording}} a video containing advice for him. Later, Jack learns that he and Avery are in fact expecting a daughter and not a son.

500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was a little sad for him and a lotta sad for his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E
