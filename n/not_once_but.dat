5|$|Pope Innocent III {{also began}} preaching {{what became the}} Fourth Crusade in 1200, {{primarily}} in France but also in England and Germany. After gathering in Venice, the Crusade was used by Doge Enrico Dandolo and Philip of Swabia to further their secular ambitions. Dandolo's aim was to expand Venice's power in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Philip intended to restore his exiled nephew, Alexios IV Angelos, along with Angelos's father, Isaac II Angelos, to the throne of Byzantium. This would require overthrowing the present ruler, Alexios III Angelos, the uncle of Alexios IV. When an insufficient number of knights arrived in Venice, the Crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for a fleet, so they agreed to divert to Constantinople and share what could be looted as payment. As collateral, the Crusaders seized the Christian city of Zara; Innocent was appalled, and promptly excommunicated them. However, the French Crusaders eventually had their excommunications lifted. When the original purpose of the campaign was defeated by the assassination of AlexiosIV Angelos, they conquered Constantinople, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>but</b> twice. Following upon their initial success, the Crusaders captured Constantinople again and this time sacked it, pillaging churches and killing many citizens. The Fourth Crusade never came within 1,000 miles of its objective of Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>once,</b> <b>but</b> three times, the stumps were plucked by players {{eager to}} grab souvenirs of an {{historic}} occasion. First of all, the Australian captain bowled a full toss down the leg side {{and took it}} for granted that Compton would hit the ball to the boundary rails. He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.|$|E
25|$|In Chicago some 50,000 {{turned out}} to cap 10 days of radical protests and police repression.

Despite the climate of fear, an estimated 50,000 turned out for the International Unemployment Day protest, marching through the streets 12 abreast for about four hours. The demonstration concluded with a large open air meeting at the Chicago stockyards, addressed by CPUSA district organizer Clarence Hathaway, TUUL organizer Nels Kjar, and representatives of the Young Communist League and black workers.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{dispute between}} Último Guerrero and Rey Escorpión {{that led to}} that week's main event was very evident even before the match {{actually}} started. Guerrero entered the ring first, then attacked Rey Escorpión {{while he was still}} on the floor, before the bell rang. Guerrero dove out of the ring and knocked Escorpión down, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>but</b> three times in a row, inflicting enough damage that Rey Escorpión was not able to get inside the ring before the referee counted to 20, giving Último Guerrero the first fall by count out. Once Escorpión recovered he was able to fight back in the second round, he fought back against Guerrero, even {{going so far as to}} tearing at Guerrero's mask using his teeth. Escorpión gained a measure of revenge on Guerrero when he applied Último Guerrero's own Pulpo Guerrero ("The Guerrero Octopus") to Guerrero and forced him to submit, tying the match at one fall each. During the third fall Rey Escorpión team mate Dragón Rojo, Jr. came to ringside to distract the referee.|$|E

Thorpe [...] "ran around past and through them <b>not</b> <b>once,</b> <b>but</b> twice". He then walked over to Warner and said [...] "Nobody is going to tackle Jim", while flipping him the ball.|$|E

500|$|Of the film's humor, Wilmington {{wrote that}} Leprechaun [...] "isn't {{dumb enough to}} be fun". [...] Hicks {{described}} the film's humor as [...] "ill-advised slapstick", and Canby wrote that it is [...] "neither scary nor funny". [...] Berardinelli called the leprechaun's one-liners [...] "more idiotic than pithy". [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, critic Jeff Makos unfavorably compared the film's tone to that of Tremors, which he posited as an influence. [...] Makos said Davis does his best to be funny, but the film has no funny jokes, making audience feedback probably more entertaining than the film itself. [...] The use of Lucky Charms as humor also received commentary. [...] Harrington wrote that Jones is [...] "so bereft of inventive ideas that he refers to Lucky Charms cereal <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>but</b> three times", and Bourjaily criticized the Lucky Charms jokes as unfunny.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Kancha, the antagonist, Sanjay Dutt was cast. According to Malhotra, the script of Agneepath demanded that the villain be more {{powerful}} than the hero, and due to Dutt's bulky frame, he was considered perfect for the role. The character of Kancha demanded that Dutt go bald, but due to a prior commitment to the film Son of Sardar, which was being shot simultaneously, he could not do so for the sake of continuity. Therefore, Hollywood make up artist Robin Slater created a [...] "bald" [...] look for Dutt, with the use of prosthetics. However, due to the summer heat in Diu, the make-up would eventually drip down Dutt's face, which impelled him to finally shave his head. Director Malhotra admitted to being inspired by Marlon Brando's bald look in the film Apocalypse Now (1979) while designing Dutt's character. Dutt explained his look by saying, [...] "Kancha is suffering from an ailment that leaves him hairless. I shaved my head for the role, <b>not</b> <b>once</b> <b>but</b> twice, and the eye-brows and eye-lashes have been digitally removed." [...] Furthermore, Dutt worked out in the gym twice a day in order to bulk up for the role.|$|E

In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown <b>not</b> <b>once,</b> <b>but</b> twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that I wanted to have everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E
