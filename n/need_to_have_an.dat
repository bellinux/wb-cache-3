25|$|A recent area of {{research}} is {{in the field of}} bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer’s eyes.

Automotive companies wishing {{to bring in}} cars <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> AP to do so. APs were originally created to allow bumiputra participation in the automotive industry, since they were issued to companies with at least 70% bumiputra ownership. In 2004, The Edge (a business newspaper) estimated that APs were worth approximately RM 35,000 each. They also estimated that the late Nasimuddin Amin, {{the former chairman of}} the Naza group, received 6,387 in 2003, making him the largest single recipient of APs. More than 12,200 APs were issued in 2003. In addition to APs, foreign car marquees are required to pay between 140% to 300% import duty.|$|E

They also manufactured new chassis tubs consisting of a narrower front nose because the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> option to operate the hybrid system on the front wheels was no longer required. The company had limited resources, so they elected to run one TS030 Hybrid for the entire WEC season with a second vehicle participating in selected rounds including the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The first race of the season, the 6 Hours of Silverstone, saw Toyota bring two 2012-specification cars in place of the updated 2013 chassis. Nakajima was absent from Silverstone because of a Super Formula commitment. Despite a timing system malfunction that prevented lap times from being published for more than one hour, the No. 7 and No. 8 Toyota cars qualified in first and second place, separated by nearly two seconds. However, the event was at best uneventful, with neither car being able to match either Audi's pace, finishing third and fourth overall having struggled in the first few hours of the race with tyre management.|$|E

The courage with which she supports the most brutal bad luck has something quite creepy about it. Her irony is incessant and inventive; her practical charity very large; and she is wholly unaware of the philosophical use to which I put her.|$|E
