25|$|EVOH {{is used in}} {{multilayer}} {{films for}} packaging as a barrier layer (barrier plastic). As EVOH is hygroscopic (water-attracting), it absorbs water from the environment, whereby it loses its barrier effect. Therefore, it must {{be used as a}} core layer surrounded by other plastics (like LDPE, PP, PA or PET). EVOH is also used as a coating agent against corrosion at street lights, traffic light poles and <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> walls.|$|E
25|$|In Bamberg {{the upgrade}} plans caused protests among the citizens, as DB planned to build high noise barriers. Subsequently, the plans were rejected. Three new options {{emerged from a}} dialogue: {{optimised}} new <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> on the existing route, which would be lowered at sensitive points, a tunnel for freight trains or a complete bypass of Bamberg to the east through the main stretch of carr (marshy forest), parallel to the A73. The current draft of the Federal Transport Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) for 2030 includes the bypass along the A 73 because it has the best benefit/cost ratio.|$|E

25|$|The {{permanent}} {{track and}} the overhead {{line on the}} northern section between Ilmenau and Erfurt would be built between August 2010 and November 2013, on the middle section between Coburg and Ilmenau between December 2012 and December 2015 and on the southern section between Bad Staffelstein and Coburg between January 2013 and December 2015. The contracts, which comprise the fixed track, including {{the foundations of the}} masts for the overhead line and wind and <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> equipment, were let for the approximately 44 kilometre-long middle section for around €104 million and the approximately 22 kilometre-long southern section for around €60 million.|$|E
25|$|Terminal C {{was opened}} in May 2007 as a {{temporary}} solution because all other terminals operated on their maximum capacity. It has been largely used by Air Berlin until its demise. It features 26 check-in counters and the gates numbered C38-C51, C60–C67 (Section C2) and C80-C89 (in the newest addition Section C3). From 2008 until August 2009, 5 additional aircraft stands were constructed and the building was expanded by approximately 50% of its original size, in order to handle another 1.5million passengers per year. The extended terminal now houses a transit zone for connecting passengers which does not exist at any other terminal at Tegel Airport. Due to <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> treaties, {{the overall number of}} aircraft stands at the airport is restricted, thus aircraft stands on the apron (serving Terminals A and D) had to be removed for compensation. Terminal C is able to handle widebody-aircraft like Air Berlin's Airbus A330-200s, but features no jet bridges.|$|E
2500|$|An {{air source}} heat pump {{requires}} an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise. In 2013, the CEN started work on standards {{for protection from}} noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units. Although the CEN/TC 113 Business Plan outset was that [...] "consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations", no standards for noise barriers or other means of <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> had been developed by January 2016.|$|E

2500|$|Improvements {{were also}} made in income and work {{conditions}} for home workers, accident insurance {{was extended to}} non-working adults, and the Border Zone Assistance Act (1971) increased levels of assistance to the declining zonal peripheral area. The Occupational Safety Act (1973) required employers to provide company doctors and safety experts. A directive on protection against noise at the place of work was adopted in November 1970. If measurements showed or there was reason to assume that a noise level guide value of 90dB( [...] A) may be exceeded at the place of work, then the authority had to instruct the employer to arrange check-ups of the employees concerned and these employees had to use personal <b>noise</b> <b>protection</b> devices. A matching fund program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the possibilities {{and limitations of}} passive Hamiltonian protection of a quantum memory against depolarizing <b>noise.</b> Without <b>protection,</b> the lifetime of a single qubit is independent of N, the number of qubits composing the memory.

40|$|This {{paper was}} made with an aim to prepare the risk {{assessment}} of operators’ noise exposure in Atlas Copco’s existing machines. This work {{is divided into three}} major parts: low-frequency <b>noise,</b> hearing <b>protection</b> and sound propagation in mines. Several studies, regulations and books have been examined in order to collect data of relevance to this work. The existence of man-made low-frequency noise (20 - 200 Hz) has been reported in many environments as a critical pollution problem. Symptoms like hearing loss, tinnitus, annoyance, disturbance of rest and sleep, fatigue, lower performance and social orientation, feeling of pressure on the eardrum and head, headache, disorientation, nausea, and balance disturbance, have among other ailments been reported by exposure to low-frequency noise...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{supplement}} to our recent one about {{the analysis of the}} noise properties in the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system [Gingl and Mingesz, PLOS ONE 9 (2014) e 96109, doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0096109]. Here we use purely mathematical statistical derivations to prove that only normal distribution with special scaling can guarantee security. Our results are in agreement with earlier physical assumptions [Kish, Phys. Lett. A 352 (2006) 178 - 182, doi: 10. 1016 /j. physleta. 2005. 11. 062].

5000|$|Often {{interventions}} to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that hearing loss prevention programs revealed that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels. Giving workers {{information on their}} noise exposure levels by itself was not shown to decrease exposure to <b>noise.</b> Ear <b>protection,</b> if used correctly, {{has the potential to}} reduce noise to safer levels, but does not necessarily prevent hearing loss. External solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further study of this issue under real-life conditions is needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The implications is that further research could affect conclusions reached.|$|R

50|$|At first glance, {{it would}} seem that {{reducing}} the noise and volume would be sufficient to reduce or prevent listening fatigue altogether. However, it is evident that the issue is at least partly physiological in nature. In cases of sensory overload not related to purposeful listening of hazardous <b>noises,</b> common ear <b>protection</b> such as earplugs and earmuffs can help alleviate the issue. Discomfort and social embarrassment are some of the main concerns when using tools such as this.|$|R
50|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{is a major}} discipline {{within the}} field of electronic engineering, and includes a wide variety of technologies. It refers to enclosures and protective features built into the product itself, and not to shipping containers. It applies both to end products and to components. Packaging of an electronic system must consider protection from mechanical damage, cooling, radio frequency <b>noise</b> emission, <b>protection</b> from electrostatic discharge, maintenance, operator convenience, and cost. Prototypes and industrial equipment made in small quantities may use standardized commercially available enclosures such as card cages or prefabricated boxes. Mass-market consumer devices may have highly specialized packaging to increase consumer appeal. The same electronic system may be packaged as a portable device or adapted for fixed mounting in an instrument rack or permanent installation. Packaging for aerospace, marine, or military systems imposes different types of design criteria.|$|R
