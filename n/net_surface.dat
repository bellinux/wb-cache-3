Meanwhile the 65 different landscape metrics of each analysis unit were acquired using landscape analysis method. Then the most effective landscape metrics affecting <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation were determined by correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, stepwise regression method, etc. At both class and landscape levels, this paper comprehensively analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of the <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation {{as well as the}} effects of land cover pattern on it in Xiamen from a multi-seasonal perspective. The results showed that the spatial composition of land cover pattern shows significant influence on <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation while the spatial allocation of land cover pattern does not. The proportions of bare land and forest land are effective and important factors which affect the changes of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation all the year round. Moreover, the proportion of forest land is more capable for explaining <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation than the proportion of bare land. So the proportion of forest land is the most important and continuously effective factor which affects and explains the cross-seasonal differences of <b>surface</b> <b>net</b> radiation. This study is helpful in exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. It also gave theoretical hints and realistic guidance for urban planning and sustainable development...|$|R

50|$|When {{a surface}} is {{immersed}} in a solution containing electrolytes, it develops a <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge. This is often because of ionic adsorption. Aqueous solutions universally contain positive and negative ions (cations and anions, respectively), which interact with partial charges on the surface, adsorbing to and thus ionizing the surface and creating a <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge. This net charge results in a surface potential L, which causes the surface {{to be surrounded by}} a cloud of counter-ions, which extends from the surface into the solution, and also generally results in repulsion between particles. The larger the partial charges in the material, the more ions are adsorbed to the surface, and the larger the cloud of counter-ions. A solution with a higher concentration of electrolytes also increases the size of the counter-ion cloud. This ion/counterion layer is known as the electric double layer.|$|E

50|$|Chromatofocusing is a protein-separation {{technique}} that allows resolution of single proteins and other ampholytes from a complex mixture according {{to differences in}} their isoelectric point. Chromatofocusing utilizes ion exchange resins and is typically performed on fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) or similar equipment capable of producing continuous buffer gradients though {{this is not a}} requirement. In contrast to typical ion exchange chromatography, where bound molecules are eluted from the resin by increasing the ionic strength of the buffer environment, chromatofocusing elutes bound species by altering the pH of the buffer. This changes the <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge of bound molecules, altering their avidity for the resin. As the changing pH of the buffer system traverses the pI of a given molecule, that molecule will elute from the resin as it will no longer possess a <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge (a requisite for molecular binding to ion exchange resins). Chromatofocusing is a powerful purification technique with respect to proteins as it can resolve very similar species only differing by 0.02 pH units that may not separate well, or at all, using traditional ion exchange strategies.A major drawback to this technique is that some proteins will aggregate when they are present at relatively high concentrations and carry no <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge. This can cause blockage of the resin, which is highly problematic when using sealed columns of ion exchange resin on FPLC equipment, resulting in pressure buildup and possible equipment failure. Apparent aggregation issues can sometimes be overcome by limiting the sample concentration and use of buffer additives that deter aggregate formation.|$|E

5000|$|As {{stated by}} Lyklema, [...] "...the {{reason for the}} {{formation}} of a [...] "relaxed" [...] ("equilibrium") double layer is the non-electric affinity of charge-determining ions for a surface..." [...] This process leads to the buildup of an electric surface charge, expressed usually in C/m2. This surface charge creates an electrostatic field that then affects the ions in the bulk of the liquid. This electrostatic field, in combination with the thermal motion of the ions, creates a counter charge, and thus screens the electric surface charge. The net electric charge in this screening diffuse layer is equal in magnitude to the <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge, but has the opposite polarity. As a result, the complete structure is electrically neutral.|$|E
50|$|The flow {{around a}} lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton's second law, or {{conservation}} of momentum, both locally at every {{point in the}} flow field, and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow. For an extended region, Newton's second law {{takes the form of}} the momentum theorem for a control volume, where a control volume can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis. The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume (a surface integral), is equal to the integrated time rate of change (material derivative) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume (a volume integral). For a steady flow, the volume integral can be replaced by the <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary via Stokes' theorem.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of coagulation {{has been the}} subject of continual review. It is generally accepted that coagulation is brought about primarily by the reduction of the <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> charge to a point where the colloidal particles, previously stabilized by electrostatic repulsion, can approach closely enough for van der Waals forces to hold them together and allow aggregation. The reduction of the surface charge is a consequence of the decrease of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer by the presence of an electrolyte having opposite charge. In the EC process, the coagulant is generated in situ by electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate anode material. In this process, charged ionic species—metals or otherwise—are removed from wastewater by allowing it to react with an ion having an opposite charge, or with floc of metallic hydroxides generated within the effluent.|$|E

Staphylococcus aureus transports D-alanine from the cytoplasm to the surface teichoic acid which reduces the net negative charge by introducing basic amino groups. S. aureus also modifies its anionic membranes via MprF with L-lysine, increasing the positive net charge. The interaction of antimicrobial peptides with membrane targets can be limited by capsule polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Alterations occur in Lipid A. Salmonella species reduce the fluidity of their outer membrane by increasing hydrophobic interactions between an increased number of Lipid A acyl tails by adding myristate to Lipid A with 2-hydroxymyristate and forming hepta-acylated Lipid A by adding palmitate. The increased hydrophobic moment is thought to retard or abolish antimicrobial peptide insertion and pore formation. The residues undergo alteration in membrane proteins. In some Gram-negative bacteria, alteration {{in the production of}} outer membrane proteins correlates with resistance to killing by antimicrobial peptides. Nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae transports AMPs into the interior of the cell, where they are degraded. And H. influenzae remodels its membranes to make it appear as if the bacterium has already been successfully attacked by AMPs, protecting it from being attacked by more AMPs. ATP-binding cassette transporters import antimicrobial peptides and the resistance-nodulation cell-division efflux pump exports antimicrobial peptides. Both transporters have been associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance. Bacteria produce proteolytic enzymes,which may degrade antimicrobial peptides leading to their resistance. Outer membrane vesicles produced by Gram-negative bacteria bind the antimicrobial peptides and sequester them away from the cells, thereby protecting the cells. The outer membrane vesicles are also known to contain various proteases, peptidases and other lytic enzymes, which may have a role in degrading the extracellular peptide and nucleic acid molecules, which if allowed to reach to the bacterial cells may be dangerous for the cells.

The major contribution to the <b>net</b> cell <b>surface</b> negativity of all mammalian cells studied is made by the sialic acid moieties of the surface glycoproteins, while ribonuclease-susceptible sites have been shown to contribute to a lesser extent on some cell types. Experi-ments were done to determine whether these anionic groups at the cell periphery affect the aggregation and sorting behaviour of embryonic chick neural retina cells when cultured alone or in combination with embryonic heart cells. The <b>net</b> negative <b>surface</b> charge density, as determined by cell electrophoretic mobility, of neuraminidase- or ribonuclease-treated cells was significantly decreased immediately after incubation with the enzymes, and the treatment with neuraminidase resulted in a reduction in the binding of colloidal iron hydroxide particles at the cell surface. Both enzymes caused reduced aggregate size in gyratory shaker cultures of neural retina and mixed cell suspensions, and fewer neural retina cells adherent to microtest plate surfaces, but no differences were seen in their histological appearance or sorting pattern in mixed shaker culture. The results indicate that the neuraminidase- and ribonuclease-susceptible groups at the periphery of embryonic neural retina cells play a role in some aspects of cell contact behaviour in ways other than reduction in <b>net</b> negative <b>surface</b> charge...|$|R

A new elevation model of Antarctica derived from ERS- 1 satellite altimetry supplemented with conventional data was used to delineate the ice flow drainage basins across Antarctica. The areas of these basins were calculated using the recent digital descriptions of coastlines and grounding lines. The delineation of drainage basins was achieved using an automatic procedure, which gave similar results to earlier hand-drawn catchment basins. More than 1800 published and unpublished in situ {{measurements of}} <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> mass balance from Antarctica were collated and then interpolated. A <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> mass balance map was derived from passive microwave satellite data, being employed as a forcing field to control the interpolation of the sparse in situ observations. Basinwide integrals of <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> mass balance were calculated using tools available within a geographic information system. It is found that the integrated <b>net</b> <b>surface</b> mass balance over the conterminous grounded ice sheet is 1811 Gton yr− 1 (149 kg m− 2 yr− 1), and over the entire continent (including ice shelves and their embedded ice rises) it is 2288 Gton yr− 1 (166 kg m− 2 yr− 1). These values are around 18 % and 7 % higher than the estimates widely adopted at present. The uncertainty in these values is hard to estimate from the methodology alone, but the progression of estimates from early studies to the present suggests that around ± 5 % uncertainty remains in the overall values.
