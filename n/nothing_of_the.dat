To date, he has appeared in all Phineas and Ferb novelizations, published by Disney Press. Phineas appears in the Nintendo DS video game based on the series, simply titled Phineas and Ferb.

5|$|The Herne Hill Sorting Sidings {{closed on}} 1 August 1966 and the freight {{line to the}} east of the station was taken out of service. <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidings remains: {{residential}} accommodation has been built along Shakespeare Road (on the western sidings) and commercial premises have been built along Milkwood Road (on the eastern sidings).|$|E
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods suggesting that it was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E

5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick for a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. <b>Nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architecture of the classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture {{has proved to be}} more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at {{the western edge of the}} Fatih district. The Column of Constantine, erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.|$|E

5|$|On May 28, 1980, IAF guided {{missiles}} destroyed two armored cars carrying SA-9 batteries, {{manned by}} Libyan troops, near Sidon. The Israeli media declared that {{a solution to}} the SAM problem was found, but the IAF Commander, David Ivry, said that this assessment was premature, and that the SA-9 was not really significantly superior to its predecessors. The Prime Minister, Menachem Begin, then also Minister of Defense, announced that the IAF could destroy the SAM batteries in two hours. Ivry told the media that the IAF could do <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind.|$|E
5|$|Separated by {{distance}} and weather, the natives knew little of mainland and international politics. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some of}} his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda.

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit. With Soulcalibur IV, Ivy's look on the promotional artwork was modified on the English website to hide her undercleavage, leading to suspicion of censorship in the American release of the game. When asked about the censoring, director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated he had heard of <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort having taken place. When released in North America it was shown that no actual censorship had occurred within the game.|$|E

5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station to Station was the vehicle for his performance persona, the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> production.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly {{questioned}} {{about his relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns that the man who met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E
5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the World Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded the mission of Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} World Heritage Site group. In 1755 the mission of Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E

5|$|Almost <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} church—built on {{the site}} of a wooden Saxon church—remains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a plait interweave and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a quoin, which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re-consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch {{on the inside of the}} southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading {{on the left}} of the formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girdle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Springfield, Adil {{arrives and}} {{turns out to}} be very friendly, helping out Marge with the family chores. Homer {{immediately}} takes a shine to him, and it is noticeable that he is a better son and role model than Bart ever was. However, Marge challenges Homer that while she appreciates Adil's good behavior, part of being good parents is that they have the same respect for their natural children, in that is Homer being concerned for Bart while he is abroad. Unbeknown to the family, Adil is actually a spy sent by his government to obtain blueprints of the Springfield nuclear plant's reactor. Homer unwittingly takes him {{on a tour of the}} power plant and thinks <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many photographs Adil takes, which Adil sends home by a secret fax machine in Bart's tree house.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew <b>nothing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes the beginnings of the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located the beginnings of the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E
