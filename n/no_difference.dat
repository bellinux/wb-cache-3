5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets.

Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

5|$|C. c. perplexus, {{the western}} subspecies, occurs {{from the head}} of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia westwards into Western Australia where its {{northern}} limits are Shark Bay and the mulga-eucalypt boundary line. It is less specialised in its habitat, as it does not share its distribution with the little raven, and does not appear to correlate with the range of sheep. The western subspecies has a slightly lower-pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies, with similarities to calls of the little raven. Of smaller size overall, it has a more slender bill and shorter hackles. There is otherwise <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in plumage. Intermediate birds are found in the Eyre Peninsula, Gawler Ranges and vicinity of Lake Eyre in South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents.

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found <b>no</b> <b>difference.</b> Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} <b>no</b> <b>difference</b> in the prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This {{is in contrast to}} past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact of bias in data collection.|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the field}} of hemato-oncology, there is paucity of data {{assessing}} models of integration between hemato-oncology and other partner specialties. The aim of this national survey was to gather information {{about the status of}} the integration of this kind of activity in hemato-oncologic units existing in Italy. Methods: A national telephone survey was conducted to gather information about the status of the integration of hemato-oncologic and supportive care/anesthesiological services. From the national registry of hemato-oncology units, 149 centers were contacted by phone and a dedicated doctor was identified to gather information about the center through a telephone interview. Results: Eighty-one centers (54. 3 Â %) agreed to participate. A mean of 206 (SD 132) painful procedures/year/center were performed. <b>No</b> significant <b>differences</b> among regions and centers were found (P = 0. 680). Of the centers, 41. 9 Â % usually asked for anesthesiological consultation to perform painful procedures. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> were found between the regions (P = 0. 137). A mean of 1. 8 (SD 1. 2) days elapsed from the request to the procedure performance (P = 0. 271). <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among the regions were found (P = 0. 350). A mean of 220 (SD 89) central venous vascular accesses/year/center were performed. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among regions were found (P = 0. 170). <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among the centers were found (P = 0. 691). A mean of 1. 8 (SD 1. 2) days elapsed from the request to the performance of procedure. Of the centers, 64. 2 Â % had a palliative care team. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among regions were found (P = 0. 331). A mean of 31. 5 (SD 12. 2) consultations/year/center for pain control were required. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among the regions were found (P = 0. 556). Of the centers, 30. 8 Â % had some beds for palliative care. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among the regions were found (P = 0. 641). Of the centers, 32 Â % had a hospice was available. <b>No</b> <b>differences</b> among regions were found (P = 0. 298). Conclusion: Integration between hemato-oncology and other professionals is unlikely to be optimal in Italy. Such integration is complex and needs great efforts to solve several organizational problems...|$|R
