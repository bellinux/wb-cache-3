5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism {{is considered one of the}} great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live in shallow water and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E

5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the merger}} of Westland and Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2000, there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the {{separate}} EHI entity; the EH101 was formally re-branded as the AW101 in 2007. In 2008, the volume of AW101 orders was reported as having filled production capacity {{in excess of the}} following five years. By April 2009, more than 180 AW101s had been sold worldwide; the combined operational fleet had also accumulated a total of 170,000 flying hours.|$|E

5|$|From about 1560, the Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. Calvinists rejected ornamentation in places of worship. With <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> elaborate buildings divided up by ritual there was widespread destruction of Medieval church furnishings, ornaments and decoration. There {{was a need}} to adapt old buildings and build new churches suitable for reformed services, particularly by putting the pulpit and preaching at the centre of worship.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} {{argument}} has been fortified by {{the theory of}} connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning {{and other forms of}} representation are highly distributed and parallel. This would tend to indicate that there is <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires.|$|E

5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew {{of the presence of}} both Irish Oak and U-607, there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> Irish Oak to have warned the convoy.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike other}} {{countries}} during {{the evolution of}} their economies, Architecture became a tool for and manifestation of social policy, with architects and politicians determining just what features were adequate for the intended residents of housing projects. As late as in 1922, there were many who felt that working-class families had <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> their own bath; apartments and small houses only included a small kitchen {{and one or two}} rooms.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development was quite prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E

5|$|The {{group was}} {{reactivated}} again {{just prior to}} the Korean War, on 29 October 1948 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was dispatched to the Korean peninsula where it remained during three campaigns of the war, receiving three campaign streamers. However, as the war became a long, drawn out stalemate and with <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the military government group, it was deactivated in Korea on 28 October 1951 {{in the middle of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The last train ran on 4 July 1991, {{four days}} after the plant closed. Without {{production}} at the plants there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the railway; it would be more economical to transport the few last products by truck. The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping. The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnoset Line, where passenger traffic had remained until 1991.|$|E

5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined {{that there was no}} evidence to support the allegations and <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> further investigation.|$|E
