50|$|Radical {{polymerization}} also aids {{synthesis of}} nanocomposite hydrogels. These gels {{are made of}} water-swellable nano-scale clay (especially those classed as smectites) enveloped by a <b>network</b> <b>polymer.</b> They are often biocompatible and have mechanical properties (such as flexibility and strength) that promise applications such as synthetic tissue. Synthesis involves free radical polymerization. The general synthesis procedure is depicted in Figure 28. Clay is dispersed in water, where it forms very small, porous plates. Next the initiator and a catalyst are added, followed by adding the organic monomer, generally an acrylamide or acrylamide derivative. The initiator is chosen to have stronger interaction with the clay than the organic monomer, so it preferentially adsorbs to the clay surface. The mixture and water solvent is heated to initiate polymerization. Polymers grow off the initiators that are in turn bound to the clay. Due to recombination and disproportionation reactions, growing polymer chains bind to one another, forming a strong, cross-linked <b>network</b> <b>polymer,</b> with clay particles acting as branching points for multiple polymer chain segments. Free radical polymerization used in this context allows the synthesis of polymers {{from a wide variety}} of substrates (the chemistries of suitable clays vary). Termination reactions unique to chain growth polymerization produce a material with flexibility, mechanical strength and biocompatibility.|$|E
50|$|As mentioned, {{negative}} resists are photopolymers {{that become}} insoluble upon exposure to radiation. They {{have found a}} variety of commercial applications.

A characteristic found in most negative tone resists is the presence of multifunctional branches on the polymers used. Radiation of the polymers in the presence of an intiator results in the formation of chemically resistant <b>network</b> <b>polymer.</b> A common functional group used in negative resist is epoxy functional groups. An example of a widely used polymer of this class is SU-8. SU-8 {{was one of the first}} polymers used in this field, and found applications in wire board printing.

40|$|AbstractA {{physically}} based {{method is}} proposed to represent interpenetrating <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> and their electromechanical behavior. The mechanical {{behavior of the}} material is nonlinear elastic and the electromechanical coupling arises from electrostatic effects often called the Maxwell stress effect. Ha et al. have synthesized interpenetrating <b>polymer</b> <b>networks</b> (IPNs) that invalidate {{the need for an}} external pre-stretch mechanism in dielectric elastomers. IPNs of acrylic elastomer and 1, 6 -hexanediol diacrylate were successfully synthesized to create free-standing films with preserved prestretch. This results in a dual <b>polymer</b> <b>network,</b> with one <b>polymer</b> <b>network</b> in tension and the other in compression. The prestretch is preserved chemically in the dominant network. The internal prestretch is accompanied by an overall stiffening of the dual <b>polymer</b> <b>network</b> leading to compromised actuation strains. A mechanistically simple representation of the networks is proposed by means of a model of two springs in parallel, replaced by an equivalent single spring. A material parameter is introduced to account for the effect of the weight percent of the secondary network. The effect of the additive on the preserved prestretch in the primary network and hence the overall stress strain response is determined. Specifically, a modified Ogden strain energy function is proposed that describes the mechanical behavior of the new interpenetrating <b>polymer</b> <b>network.</b> The electromechanical response of the material is described using a previously presented constitutive formulation that works well for single <b>network</b> <b>polymers.</b> The model results indicate that ideally an interpenetrating <b>polymer</b> <b>network</b> DE should not stiffen when the secondary network is formed to avoid reduced actuation strains...|$|R

The polymer we create follows {{the form of a}} Cayley tree or Bethe lattice - known from the field of statistical mechanics.

As we follow the tree’s branches we want there to always be at least one path that leads onwards, as this is the condition of an infinite <b>network</b> <b>polymer.</b> At each node, there are z-1 possible paths, since one functional group was used to create the node. The probability {{that at least one of}} the possible paths has been created is (z-1)p. Since we want an infinite network, we require on average that (z-1)p ≥ 1 to ensure an infinitely long path.

5000|$|Changes in {{structural}} and chemical properties can be induced internally by chromophores that the polymer subunit already possesses, or externally by addition of photosensitive molecules. Typically a photopolymer {{consists of a}} mixture of multifunctional monomers and oligomers {{in order to achieve}} the desired physical properties, and therefore a wide variety of monomers and oligomers have been developed that can polymerize in the presence of light either through internal or external initiation. Photopolymers undergo a process called curing, where oligomers are cross-linked upon exposure to light, forming what is known as a <b>network</b> <b>polymer.</b> The result of photo curing is the formation of a thermoset network of polymers. One of the advantages of photo-curing is that it can be done selectively using high energy light sources, for example lasers, however, most systems are not readily activated by light, and in this case a photoinitiator is required. Photoinitiators are compounds that upon radiation of light decompose into reactive species that activate polymerization of specific functional groups on the oligomers. An example of a mixture that undergoes cross-linking when exposed to light is shown below. The mixture consists of monomeric styrene and oligomeric acrylates. Most commonly, photopolymerized systems are typically cured through UV radiation, since ultraviolet light is more energetic; however, the development of dye-based photoinitiator systems have allowed for the use of visible light, having potential advantages of processes that are more simple and safe to handle. [...] UV curing in industrial processes has greatly expanded over the past several decades. Many traditional thermally cured and solvent-based technologies can be replaced by photopolymerization technologies. The advantages of photopolymerization over thermally cured polymerization include high rates of polymerization and environmental benefits from elimination of volatile organic solvents.|$|E
