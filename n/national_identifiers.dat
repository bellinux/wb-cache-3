40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and seeks}} comment on legislative proposals {{to support the}} establishment and implementation of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> and enhanced arrangements for the privacy of health information. E-Health All Australian governments recognise {{the potential benefits of}} changing how information is accessed and shared across the healthcare system through the use of electronic communication and information technology to ensure that information is available when it is needed to provide patient care. The adoption of this technology, commonly described as e-health, is expected to transform the way in which healthcare providers practise and consumers interact with the health system and improve the safety and quality of healthcare and patient outcomes. To achieve the most from e-health, a national approach is needed to ensure that the frameworks and key infrastructure components are coordinated and aligned across Australia. Two elements that are regarded as central to the successful implementation of a national e-health system are the establishment of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> for consumers and providers and the establishment of robust regulatory arrangements to ensure appropriate safeguards for patient health information and encourage participation in e-health initiatives. Considerable work has been undertaken by all governments in relation to both the development of <b>national</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> and to address health information privacy issues nationally. <b>National</b> healthcare <b>identifiers</b> In 2006, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to a national approach to developing, implementing and operating systems for individual and healthcare provider identifiers as part of accelerating work on electronic health records to improve the safety of patients and improve efficiency for healthcare providers.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between group identification and political action in Indonesia. We made four contributions to the literature. First, we studied political action on behalf of religious groups and examined the role of religious identification alone and in combination with national identification. Second, we analyzed political action in a non-Western country where social cleavages occur primarily along religious lines and where a conflict and nonconflict region can be studied. Third, we compared Muslims and Christians, whose majority and minority status varies across the two regions, and fourth, we investigated both normative and nonnormative forms of political action (protest and violence). In line with the dual-identification model of politicization, we found that religious identification increased support for protest (but not violence) in the conflict region only and particularly among high <b>national</b> <b>identifiers.</b> In the nonconflict region, religious identification was not related to violence, and it was related to lower support for protest among high <b>national</b> <b>identifiers.</b> The patterns were largely similar for Muslims and Christians, but some differences were found depending on the majority-minority status. We conclude that particularities of the intergroup context should be taken into consideration when studying politicization...|$|E

40|$|One of the evidences of {{mainstreaming}} in Ukrainian philosophy {{discourse of}} the problem of philosophy national attribution has become the international discussion, recently initiated by Sententiae magazine. While analyzing its materials, the author justifies his own position concerning the several issues, discussed in it. As the nation is interpreted as culture project, and a new-liberal guidelines spokesmen avoid the comprehension of the national dimensions of the human beingness, then under their affect the attention of humanitarians is moving from the culture – the anthropologic textualisation of Other – to the civilization, because the civilization is vested by the universal and global senses («civilization without nations»). Then the scepsis concerning the searches for the culture <b>national</b> <b>identifiers</b> in the whole and philosophy culture especially appears. These searches are estimated as national philosophies political and ideology construction in definite philosophy environments. Having observed the attempt of the one member of the discussion to avoid such «ideology distortions» through the substitution of the “Ukrainian” identifier by the term “domestic” with an ancient empire semantics, the author demonstrates the ideological ground of such substitutes use. Author proves that national philosophy is not the ideologeme but the metaphilosophy concept, whereas the each philosophy conceptually expresses the mode of existence of the definite society and it is a theoretical system self-consciousness of either culture. There is one more dispute topic such as the national philosophy representation in a history of philosophy discourse by the relevant philosophy tradition upon the condition of its institualization. The author supports the using of cultural approach in the research of the titular problem as more efficient. But he puts forward the several counterarguments concerning the proposed philosophy tradition institualisation, and, owing to this, concerning the relevancy of this representation. Moreover, the article is accenting the excessive attention that professional philosophers prefer to pay to the history of philosophy studies to the detriment of original actual philosophy problem solving...|$|E
40|$|Ethical cosmopolitanism {{has been}} the subject of {{substantial}} theoretical elaboration over its long history. However, until recently, very little attention had been given to the question of how individuals might be encouraged to behave as cosmopolitans in practice. Political theorists have recently identified a small number of factors – including certain social identities, collective guilt, and prosocial norms – that may increase cosmopolitan behaviour, but whether those factors actually do increase cosmopolitan behaviour has not been empirically validated. Additionally, cognate work in the field of social psychology that may provide both new hypotheses about the motivators of cosmopolitan behaviour, and tentative tests of their empirical validity, has not been integrated into cosmopolitan theorists’ work. Thus, drawing from political theory and social psychology, this dissertation identified a series of factors that may increase cosmopolitan behaviour, and tested their efficacy in a series of six experimental studies (total N = 1562). To examine causal effects on cosmopolitan behaviour, the experiments manipulated: human-, dual- (i. e. national and human) and overlapping-identity salience (Study 1); collective guilt (Studies 2, 3 and 5); empathy (Studies 4 and 5); ingroup-directed anger (Study 5); and, national prosocial norms (Study 6). Results indicated that empathy (Study 4) and, for strong <b>national</b> <b>identifiers,</b> prosocial national norms (Study 6) significantly increased cosmopolitan behaviour. Contrary to existing theory and research, manipulations of collective guilt and ingroup-directed anger did not increase cosmopolitan behaviour (Studies 2, 3 and 5) because such manipulations increased not only collective guilt and ingroup-directed anger but also increased dehumanisation of outgroups (Study 3), reduced outgroup empathy (Study 5), and marginally reduced identification with all humanity (Study 5). The effects of identity salience on cosmopolitan behaviour were not clear because the identity salience manipulations were unsuccessful. Overall, the studies reported in this dissertation represent the first experimental evidence on the causes of cosmopolitan behaviour, and demonstrate that experimental methods can be fruitfully used to develop and test theories about individual-level cosmopolitan behaviour...|$|E
