40|$|In 2009 the European Union {{introduced}} the Lisbon Treaty. One {{of the changes}} this brought about was {{the introduction of a}} permanent president of the European Council. With this transformation the former EU presidency no longer exists and this thesis investigates the implications of this change. This is done by specifically looking at the <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> discussed in the European Council. Before the Lisbon Treaty Member States were able to influence the European Council by pushing their <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> but based on the new institutional settings of the permanent presidency, this seemed after Lisbon more unlikely. An analysis of nine rotating presidencies of the Council of the European Union after Lisbon has been made and compared to the respective European Council conclusions of that period. The results show that in fact <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> have been discussed in the European Council. Nevertheless, only a third of all <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> has been discussed. On the other hand, the analyses also reveal that on average the discussed <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in the European Council have significant similarity with the <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of the Member States. Furthermore, the analysis brought also forward that certain <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> that seem not significant for the European Council have been discussed in the European Council, which could indicate that Member States can still push their <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> In conclusion, <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> were discussed only to a low extent in the European Council, answering the research question of this thesis: to what extent are <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of Member States presiding over the Council of the European Union discussed during European Council meetings...|$|R

40|$|This article {{shows how}} <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in price-changing {{international}} commodity agreements {{can be measured}}. Two approaches are distinguished. Firstly, changes in <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> can be measured that are caused {{by the introduction of}} an international commodity agreement in an otherwise unregulated world market. This approach is based on a comparison of the situations with and without a commodity agreement. It represents a positive approach to measuring <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> Secondly, changes in <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> can be measured that result from the individual country's decision to participate in the agreement or to stay outside. This approach compares the situation of participation with that of non-participation in an existing commodity agreement. As the consequences of a national decision are analyzed, it is a normative or decision-oriented approach to measuring <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> The ICA is a particularly interesting scheme to show the two approaches, as some countries participate in the agreement while others do not. This has led to the co-existence of a controlled and an uncontrolled market with different prices. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of connection between <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> and the security policy of the European Union is to perceive the possibilities of the Balkan states to preserve their identity and achieve their vital and permanent <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> by their membership in the European Union. According to the author, {{the implementation of the}} security policy of European Union is often opposite to one’s own <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> However, a pragmatic question for political leaders is how to resolve the following dilemma: „is the created european security identity more important at the moment than the preservation of immediate or some permanent national interests“? The author points {{to the fact that the}} notion of <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> is a variable both historically and theoretically. Political, economic, security and other objectives determine vital <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in some historical periods. At the same time, not rarely, some states alter their strategies and objectives for their own interests assessing whether the conditions prevailing in the internal and external surroundings have changed. The author devotes special attention to a comparative analysis of defining, determining and conceptual determination of <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> from the aspect of national security policies of some important states and the European Union. The second part of the article contains an analysis of the response of a group of Macedonian experts to the questions pertaining to the possibility of preserving and achieving of <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of the Republic of Macedonia through its membership in the European Union...|$|R

This thesis examines the author's perceived global <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> of the United States in the post-Cold War era, based upon the Preamble of the United States Constitution.

The impetus for continued change in the governance structure of the defence sector is certain.
