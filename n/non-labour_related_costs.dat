The level of automation of industrial manufacturing systems was measured and interfaced with quality-related cost. The significance {{of the relationship between}} the two important industrial parameters was evaluated. The results indicate that quality <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> increase with increase in the level of automation of industrial machines. However at very high automation levels, quality <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> become significantly lower. Models depicting the relationship between quality-related cost and automation were developed and tested. The models can help in predicting quality-related costs of an industry given its level of automation...|$|R

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, the present study is the first to analyze the effects of DSIT {{operation}} on diabetes <b>related</b> medication <b>costs.</b> Our data clearly demonstrate that surgery revealed more than 90  % reduction in the costs of anti-diabetic medications (660.08 vs. 65.12 USD, p <  0.001). Apart from costs of medication, other disease <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> such as treatment and follow-up of co-morbidities, doctor visits, blood tests and glucose measurements have not been analyzed in the present paper and may be the further investigated in other studies.

An overview and discussion of the PERC model points out certain minimum tasks that must be completed to build relationships between program effectiveness and <b>related</b> <b>costs.</b> These tasks are: (1) trace what happens to students while attending the institution {{and how much money}} is spent from all sources in various programs to achieve results; (2) obtain data on specific intellectual and personal attributes of students on entry and completion of their programs; (3) collect data about student change and development from at least two sources; (4) use two types of measurements, quantitativ...|$|R
40|$|Generating {{companies}} use {{the maintenance}} cost {{function as the}} sole or main objective for creating the maintenance schedule of power generators. Usually only maintenance activities <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> are considered to derive the cost function. However, in deregulated markets, maintenance <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> alone do not represent the full costs of generators. This paper models various cost components that affect the maintenance activities in deregulated power markets. The costs that we model include direct and indirect maintenance, failures, interruptions, contractual compensation, rescheduling, and market opportunity. The loss of firm’s reputation and selection of loyalty model are also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) within an opportunity cost model. A case study is used to illustrate the modelling activities. The enhanced model is utilised in generator maintenance scheduling cases. The experimental results demonstrate the importance and impact of market <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> in maintenance schedules...|$|R

We {{pay attention to the}} acquisition costs of land for infrastructure and the indirect costs of land use caused by transport. The paper gives an overview of the problems associated with measuring land <b>related</b> <b>costs</b> of transport infrastructure. Estimates are given of land use (in m 2) for various types of transport infrastructure. In addition some of the land <b>related</b> <b>cost</b> categories are estimated. These costs are allocated to the various transport modes (cars and trucks of various types, barges, rail, and aircraft) {{on the basis of their}} relative transport kilometres and their passenger car equivalents. We find that direct and indirect land use equals respectively 7. 2 % and 1. 6 % of the total area of the Netherlands. Indirect land use appears to be especially important for aviation.

In order to investigate the effects of demand variability in capacitated production settings, we analyze a make-to-stock queue with general demand arrival times operated according to a basestock policy. We show that when demand inter-arrival distributions are ordered in a stochastic sense, increased arrival time variability indeed leads to an augmentation of optimal base-stock levels and to a corresponding increase in optimal inventory <b>related</b> <b>costs.</b> We quantify these effects through several numerical example...|$|R
