2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a water trough. Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH <b>neutral</b> <b>soil)</b> and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{nearly four}} weeks of {{fighting}} beginning on 8 August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken. As of [...] "The Black Day of the German Army", the German High Command realised {{that the war was}} lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. The day after that battle, Ludendorff said: [...] "We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either." [...] On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, [...] "I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended." [...] On 13 August, at Spa, Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden: [...] "Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier." [...] On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on <b>neutral</b> <b>soil,</b> and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected, and on 24 September Supreme Army Command informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The study {{examines}} if {{a short period}} of reaction after addition of biosolids to soils can reduce the solubility and potential phytotoxicity of biosolid-borne Zn and Cu. Methods: The effects of period of aging (zero, 60, and 120 days) of biosolids (applied at 0, 10, 20, and 30 g kg) with an acid, <b>neutral,</b> or alkaline <b>soil</b> on pH and concentrations of Zn, Cu, and dissolved organic C in solution over a 60 -day growth period of spinach were investigated using Rhizon pore water samplers. Results: In the acid and <b>neutral</b> <b>soils,</b> increasing aging period markedly reduced the concentrations of Zn and Cu in solution and there were concomitant increases in solution pH. The effect was much less pronounced in the alkaline soil. Soluble Zn and Cu concentrations were generally positively correlated with dissolved organic C concentrations, negatively correlated with pH in the alkaline and <b>neutral</b> <b>soils</b> but positively correlated with pH in the acid soil. Spinach yields were lower in the acid than <b>neutral</b> and alkaline <b>soils</b> and tended to increase with increasing rates of biosolids in all three soils. The concentrations of tissue Zn and Cu were notably high in shoots of plants grown in the acid soil. For all biosolid-amended soils, the concentrations of tissue Cu were lower in plants grown after 60 days rather than no aging. Conclusions: Following biosolids applications to soils, an aging period of only a few months is likely to lower the solubility, and potential phytotoxicity, of biosolid-borne Zn and Cu particularly in acid and <b>neutral</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimIn a pot experiment, the P-efficient wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{cultivar}} Goldmark {{was grown}} in ten soils from South Australia covering {{a wide range}} of pH (four acidic, two neutral, and four alkaline soils) with low to moderate P availability. Phosphorus (100 mg P kg- 1) was supplied as FePO 4 to acidic soils, CaHPO 4 to alkaline, and 1 : 1 mixture of FePO 4 and CaHPO 4 to <b>neutral</b> <b>soils.</b> Phosphorus uptake was correlated with P availability measured by anion-exchange resin and microbial biomass P in the rhizosphere. Growth and P uptake were best in the <b>neutral</b> <b>soils,</b> lower in the acidic, and poorest in the alkaline soils. The good growth in the <b>neutral</b> <b>soils</b> could be explained by a combination of extensive soil exploitation by the roots and high phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere, indicating microbial facilitation of organic-P mineralization. The plant effect (soil exploitation by roots) appeared to dominate in the acidic soils. Alkaline phosphatase and diesterase activities in acidic soils were lower than in <b>neutral</b> <b>soils,</b> but strongly increased in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil, suggesting that microorganisms contribute to P uptake in these acidic soils. Shoot and root growth and P uptake per unit root length were lowest in the alkaline soils. Despite high alkaline phosphatase and diesterase activities in the alkaline soils, microbial biomass P was low, suggesting that the enzymes could not mineralize sufficient organic P {{to meet the demands of}} plants and microorganisms. Microbial-community composition, assessed by fatty acid methylester (FAME) analysis, was strongly dependent on soil pH, whereas other soil properties (organic-C or CaCO 3 content) were less important or not important at all (soil texture).
