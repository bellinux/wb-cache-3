25|$|On {{the third}} day, Leicestershire progressed to 339 all out, with Darren Robinson scoring 100. However, the innings was controversial, with three {{debatable}} decisions {{going against the}} visitors. First Robinson was given out caught, when the ball probably hit his forearm. Then HD Ackerman was out leg before to a delivery that looked high. Then, at 220 for 5 Aftab Habib edged Jason Brown low to Martin Love at first slip. Habib thought it had not carried, and Love and one umpire were <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>The</b> other umpire said he was out, so off Habib went. But he returned to confront Shafayat who taunted Habib on the dismissal. Northamptonshire progressed to 45 for 0 at close.|$|E

500|$|Transformers: The Ride was {{primarily}} developed by Universal Creative, {{the research and}} development division of Universal Parks & Resorts. Universal Creative's Thierry Coup was the Creative Director of the ride, having worked on previous Universal attractions including Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, and Shrek 4-D. Michael Bay, director of the Transformers film franchise, collaborated with Universal Creative on the ride, despite an earlier blog post that suggested otherwise: [...] "I don't support it yet – I'm not involved and [...] <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> story of the ride works, and I know Optimus is not going to just show up to be directed by some new people that have never worked with him," [...] he wrote. Bay's involvement in the attraction's development was revealed by Mark Woodbury, president of Universal Creative, in an NBC documentary on Islands of Adventure's Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Industrial Light & Magic developed the special effects for the ride, having previously worked on Transformers, [...] and [...] Each installation is reported to have cost US$100 million.|$|E
500|$|Jennifer Armstrong of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} when O'Malley told Torres about his affair with Stevens, the scene was too [...] "melodramatic". Laura Burrows, also of IGN, said that the fourth-season premiere [...] "introduced a new side of George". Armstrong said of O'Malley and Stevens' reconciliation: [...] "George and Izzie are finally on the old Grey's Anatomy road to ruin. And I admit {{this is a good}} lesson in Grey's viewing as well as life: Sit tight if you hate something, as nothing is permanent." [...] Armstrong also commented that the [...] "sparkling" [...] {{friendship}} development between Lexie and O'Malley [...] "won her over". The following year, Monfette observed of O'Malley's lack of screen time: [...] "His growing interest in trauma surgery at the side of Owen leads to an interesting development in the finale, but the character is virtually side-lined this season." [...] Carina MacKenzie of the Los Angeles Times said of the character's death: [...] "The time-lapse episode was an interesting choice, and though we sped through six weeks of mourning in two hours, it didn't feel rushed to me. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> show could have held my attention for another season of crippling sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahalia Jackson's 1947 version {{received}} significant radio airplay, and as her popularity grew {{throughout the}} 1950s and 1960s, she often sang it at public {{events such as}} concerts at Carnegie Hall. Author James Basker states that the song has been employed by African Americans as the [...] "paradigmatic Negro spiritual" [...] because it expresses the joy felt at being delivered from slavery and worldly miseries. Anthony Heilbut, author of The Gospel Sound, states that the [...] "dangers, toils, and snares" [...] of Newton's words are a [...] "universal testimony" [...] of the African American experience. During the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, the song took on a political tone. Mahalia Jackson employed [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] for Civil Rights marchers, writing that she used it [...] "to give magical protection a charm to ward off danger, an incantation to the angels of heaven to descend... I was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> magic worked outside the church walls... {{in the open air}} of Mississippi. But I wasn't taking any chances." [...] Folk singer Judy Collins, who knew the song before she could remember learning it, witnessed Fannie Lou Hamer leading marchers in Mississippi in 1964, singing [...] "Amazing Grace". Collins also considered it a [...] of sorts, and saw its equal emotional impact on the marchers, witnesses, and law enforcement who opposed the civil rights demonstrators. According to fellow folk singer Joan Baez, {{it was one of the}} most requested songs from her audiences, but she never realized its origin as a hymn; by the time she was singing it in the 1960s she said it had [...] "developed a life of its own". It even made an appearance at the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969 during Arlo Guthrie's performance.|$|E

2500|$|Former Senator Phil Gramm was a {{co-chairman}} of the McCain campaign, and McCain's chief economic adviser. He {{stepped down from the}} campaign on July 18, 2008, about a week after he made remarks to The Washington Times about the nation's economic conditions. Gramm had said, [...] "You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," [...] and [...] "We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining." [...] McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying [...] "Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, I speak for me. I strongly disagree." [...] When asked if Gramm was still in contention for the U.S. Treasury Secretary position as previously speculated, McCain had said, [...] "I think Senator Gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador of Belarus, though I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> citizens of Minsk would welcome that." [...] Gramm said upon leaving that he had become a distraction to the campaign.|$|E
2500|$|In Washington, Barnett lobbied Congress {{and presidents}} to end China's isolation. In an {{interview}} with the New York Times shortly before his death, Barnett recalled a private meeting he attended between Richard Nixon and China scholars in 1969: [...] "I always felt that Nixon was the guy, because of his background...I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Democrats would have been capable of taking a major step toward China because of the fear of being clobbered". He coined the formula [...] "containment without isolation" [...] to describe a diplomatic opening that would still recognize China as a danger. In 1974 Barnett noted that Americans tended to shape their views of China “to fit their own preconceptions and mood of the moment, with minimal understanding of the realities of the situation.” [...] In the late 1970s, he supported President Jimmy Carter 's drive to follow Nixon's 1972 breakthrough with formal diplomatic recognition of China. In the early 1980s he advised against the sale of modernized jet fighters to the Republic of China on Taiwan, a position that was followed in the presidency of Ronald Reagan.|$|E

2500|$|John J. O'Connor, {{writing for}} The New York Times in January 1993, noted that pre-release {{advertisements}} for [...] offered [...] "a new Star Trek era" [...] and added, [...] "Welcome to the Dark Side. The determinedly optimistic Mr. Roddenberry was partial to plots that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, Rick Berman and Michael Piller, are shooting, so to speak, {{for something more}} ambivalent, less perfect." [...] In September 1996, {{before the start of}} Season Four, O'Connor was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> series was tackling contemporary themes adequately. He wrote, [...] "Inevitably, though, {{there is an element of}} exhaustion seeping through the concept. With the Cold War over, perhaps the Roddenberry optimism seems merely naive as headlines bring news of murderous divisions between Serbs and Muslims, Kurds and Turks, Israelis and Palestinians, Irish Catholics and Protestants, and so on across an increasingly depressing globe. Star Trek offered a vision that leapt 300 years into the future. For too many people today, three years would seem a stretch." ...|$|E
