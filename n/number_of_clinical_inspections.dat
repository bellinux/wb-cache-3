500|$|The Hippocratic School gave {{importance}} to the <b>clinical</b> doctrines <b>of</b> observation and documentation. These doctrines dictate that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.

He {{is said to have}} measured a patient's pulse when taking a case history to discover whether the patient was lying. Hippocrates extended clinical observations into family history and environment.

В. Якимець, М. С. Дрогомирецька A V Yakymets, M S Drogomyrec'ka Інститут стоматології Національної медичної академії післядипломної освіти імені П. Л. Шупика Institute of stomatology National medical academy for postgraduate education named after P. L. Shupyk, orthodontics department Abstract Choosing the method of treatment orthodontic plays a decision role, as exactly he determines possibility of the use of space in a dental arc and establishment of present teeth in position. But not always a plan of treatment of agenesis of lateral chisels is obvious. Reason of it is a variety <b>of</b> <b>clinical</b> presentation, that is formed by not only position of adherent teeth and by the type of occlusion correlations but also form, color of adherent teeth, accordance of sizes of bases of jaws. An aim of our work is creation of diagnostic algorithm that would be based on the statistical analysis of basic diagnostic data and would allow with the certain degree of authenticity to assert on factors forming of pathology in concrete clinical case. Materials and methods. During an inspection there was certain correlation of molars for Engle and vertical ceiling in a frontal area, mean values of the vertical ceiling and symmetry of agenesis of lateral chisels of upper jaw. Result. Conclusions. Analysis correlation of symmetry of pathology with the class of Engle and size of the vertical ceiling by us it was not educed reliable connection between the articles of patients. Therefore using the described protocol <b>of</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>inspection,</b> their results and introduction in orthodontic practice will allow to simplify the process of diagnostics of aedentia of lateral chisels of upper jaw, decrease loading on a patient by avoidance of superfluous researches, to improve co-operation between profile specialists (orthodontic, by a surgeon, orthopedist, internist).

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{evaluate}} clinical procedures simplification in fixed implant rehabilitations using OT Equator Profile (Rhein 83, Bologna, Italy) attachments. Method: 21 Patients (7 males, 14 females, mean age 70 ± 10 years) with full-arch fixed implant rehabilitations retained by innovative abutments EP were included in this clinical trial. From 4 to 7 implants were placed in edentulous arch. Fixed temporary rehabilitations are loaded immediately. Fixed definitive rehabilitation was realized 6 - 8 weeks after implant surgery. We evaluated the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clinical</b> patient sessions needed to achieve the final restorations. Result: The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clinical</b> steps and time of realization in the 21 cases under review resulted significantly reduced compared to standard procedures. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>clinical</b> sessions ranged between 3 and 4 (for 9 patients was 3, while for 12 patients was 4). Conclusion: This innovative abutment allows the realization of fixed implant rehabilitations in 3 or 4 clinical sessions, while the conventional techniques require at least 5. This procedure uses only a single prosthetic implant transmucosal abutment during the entire treatment plan: Equator Profile is capable of concentrating in a single piece healing screw, the temporary abutment and the final abutment...|$|R
