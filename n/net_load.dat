We quantified the <b>net</b> <b>loads</b> of DOC, POC, and THM-precursors from a constructed subsidence mitigation wetland on Twitchell Island in the Delta to determine the change in drainage water quality that {{may be caused by}} conversion of agricultural land on peat islands to permanently flooded, non-tidal wetlands.

The permanently flooded conditions in the overlying wetland resulted in a gradual evolution to anaerobic conditions in the shallow soil layer and a concomitant decrease in the flow could be minimized by reducing the hydraulic gradient between the wetland and the adjacent drainage ditch.

The term <b>net</b> <b>load</b> refers to the portion of system demand that must be provided by non-renewable resources, equivalent to system demand minus the generation from variable energy resources such as solar and wind. The ramp rate of <b>net</b> <b>load</b> refers to its rate of change. The ramp rate of a power generator refers to {{the rate at which}} it can change its generation level. As more intermittent renewable resources are integrated into a system, the ramp rate of <b>net</b> <b>load</b> increases, and with that, the need for flexible generators with higher ramping capability (i. e. the ability to quickly ramp their power output up and down as needed). As more intermittent renewable resources are integrated into a system, the ramp rate of <b>net</b> <b>load</b> increases, and with that, the need for flexible generators with ramping capability. This Masters Project takes data on the forecast and realizations of load and renewable generation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) region from 05 / 01 / 2014 to 10 / 31 / 2014, and examines the statistical properties of the forecast errors of these quantities and the resulting ramp in <b>net</b> <b>load.</b> It focuses on addressing questions regarding the effects of increased penetration of renewables on market and system operations practices: 1) what is the pattern of forecast error of ramp in <b>net</b> <b>load</b> for different daily time periods? 2) Since <b>net</b> <b>load</b> is equal to system demand minus renewable generation, the forecast uncertainty of the two components contributes to the forecast uncertainty of ramp in <b>net</b> <b>load.</b> What is the element that has larger influence on the forecast error of ramp in <b>net</b> <b>load?</b> 3) A common assumptions about forecast error in system operation is that it follows a normal probability distribution. Is this assumption still valid under current renewable penetration levels? Does this assumption still hold when instead of looking at the forecast error during the day, the analysis is conducted independently for different daily time periods? 4) What are the implications of {{the findings of this study}} about the probability distribution of forecast error in <b>net</b> <b>load</b> to the procurement targets for reserves and ramp capability?
