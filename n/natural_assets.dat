500|$|Since her introduction, Tifa has {{received}} an extremely positive reaction from both critics and fans. In 2000, GameSpot readers voted {{her as the}} fifth-best female character in video games, with the site's editors noting they agreed.

2500|$|The latest {{proposed}} reclamation, extending {{along the}} waterfront from Sheung Wan to Causeway Bay, faced public opposition, as the harbour has become a pivotal location to Hongkongers in general. Activists have denounced the government's actions as destructive {{not only to the}} natural environment, but also to what is widely considered {{as one of the most}} prized <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> of the territory. NGOs, including the Society for Protection of the Harbour, were formed to resist further attempts to reduce the size of the waterbody, with its chairman, Christine Loh, quoted as saying that the harbour [...] "...is a precious national asset and we must preserve it for future generations. I believe an insightful and visionary chief executive would support our stance and work with us to protect the harbour". Reclamation work also led to the demolition of Queen's Pier and Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier, structures of historic significance, to massive public opposition.|$|E
60|$|Yet it {{is clear}} that a policy of state work and state pay for all who are {{otherwise}} unable to find occupation involves appalling difficulties. The opportunity will loom large for the prodigal waste of money, for the undertaking of public works of no real utility and for the subsidizing of an army of loafers. But the difficulties, great though they are, are not insuperable. The payment for state labor of this kind can be kept low enough to make it the last resort rather than the ultimate ambition of the worker. Nor need the work be useless. In new countries, especially such as Canada and the United States and Australia, the development of latent <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> could absorb the labor of generations. There are still unredeemed empires in the west. Clearly enough a certain modicum of public honesty and integrity is essential for such a task; more, undoubtedly, than we have hitherto been able to enlist {{in the service of the}} commonwealth. But without it we perish. Social betterment must depend at every stage on the force of public spirit and public morality that inspires it.|$|E
