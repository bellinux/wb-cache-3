25|$|Australia {{had held}} the Ashes since 1958–59 and Cowdrey was keen to return them to England, but he was {{frustrated}} by the damp summer. There was <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the First Test at Old Trafford where Australia made 357 and England fell from 86/0 to 165 all out to the part-time off-spin of Bob Cowper (4/48) and lost by 159 runs, though Basil D'Oliveira made 87 not out in the second innings. The Second Test was the 200th {{between the two countries}} and Colin Milburn hammered 83 and Cowdrey 45 in England's 351/7 while Australia were hustled out for 78 after a freak hail storm whitened the ground. 15 hours were lost to the weather and after following on Australia salvaged a draw with 127/4.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that is <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E

When contacted by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Shane Morgan, the founder and chair of transgender advocate group TransOhio, stated that while 2014 witnessed gains for the trans rights movement, Alcorn's death illustrated how [...] "trans people are still being victimized and still being disrespected", highlighting {{the high rate of}} transgender people who had been murdered that year. Since the incident, TransOhio received letters from parents of transgender children describing how Alcorn's death had affected them.

[...] Like the other reviewers, he praised its controls. He also lauded its [...] "hilarious storyline, strong characters and ... intriguing setting", but complained about graphical slowdowns. Nick Clarkson of Amiga Computing cited the game's graphics as [...] "flawless", noting that [...] "the characters are superbly animated and the backdrops simply ooze atmosphere." [...] He highly praised its sound effects and music, and believed that its controls [...] "couldn't be simpler". The staff of Amiga Action wrote that the [...] "attention to detail and the finely tuned gameplay cannot be faulted."

500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD), {{the breaking}} down of biodegradable material by microorganisms {{in the absence}} of oxygen, is recognised as an effective method of waste disposal, with the potential to address the food waste problem nationally. AD technology has a small environmental impact, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting. However, although the process is well established in the water industry, it is less so within the waste sector. Despite this, the AD industry is being (and planned to be further) expanded by local councils and retailers to deal with food waste; several local authorities in the UK are planning to build anaerobic digestion plants, with the largest, to be located in Selby, due to operate from 2010. Supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's are both adopting AD technology to dispose of their waste, while Tesco's head of waste and recycling said: [...] "As renewable energy technologies now become mainstream, there is <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> sending waste to landfill that could actually be put to positive use." [...] AD technology remains an experimental field though, and there is potential for advancements to increase efficiency. In July 2014 Sainsbury's began powering one of its stores using anaerobic digestion.|$|E

500|$|Offitt, at birth, {{was given}} the {{forenames}} Andrew Jackson, which according to Hay shows that the bearer [...] "is the son of illiterate parents, with no family pride or affections, but filled with a bitter and savage partisanship which found its expression in a servile worship of the most injurious personality in American history". Hay despised President Jackson and Jacksonian democracy, which he deemed corrupt and responsible for {{the continuation of the}} slave system that Hay saw overthrown at huge cost in the American Civil War. [...] He feared a return to values he deemed anticapitalist, and made the Bread-winners [...] "the laziest and most incapable workmen in town", whose ideals are pre-industrialist and foreign in origin. Hay saw <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> violence; as {{the will of the people}} could be expressed through the ballot, the remedy for any grievances was the next election.

500|$|The New England colonies, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Rhode Island, formed a confederation called [...] "The Four United Colonies of New England". [...] Rhode Island, according to The Proceedings of the Rhode Island Historical Society, 1881–1882, was excluded, not for reasons of religious differences, but because its founder, Roger Williams, had been banished from Massachusetts [...] "for denying the right of the magistrates to take the lands of the Indians with out compensating the owners". [...] The United Colonies obtained Narragansett lands within the boundaries of Rhode Island by putting in motion a series of events that began with their promise of aid to the Mohegan Sachem, Uncas, whom they had supported during the Pequot War, if he declared war against the Narragansett Sachem, Miantinomo. During the ensuing war, Miantinomo was captured and brought to the commissioners of the Four United Colonies at Hartford. [...] "After obtaining him as a captive, they could find <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> putting him to death; and, to avoid the responsibility, they referred his case for decision to a convention of ministers in Boston; [...] Winthrop states, 'Miantinomo was killed near Hartford by a blow {{on the back of his}} head with a hatchet.'

500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, {{he would return to}} the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|E

500|$|On November 9, 1942, {{soon after}} making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people, Willkie argued {{the case of}} Schneiderman v. United States before the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, {{secretary}} of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship, stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization. Representing a communist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie's diminishing support in the Republican Party, but he wrote to a friend saying, [...] "I am sure I am right in representing Schneiderman. Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended, it is now." [...] In his argument Willkie quoted Lincoln and Jefferson {{by saying that the}} people could, if they deemed it necessary, remake the government, and he stated that Marx's view of revolution was mild by comparison. In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman, 5—3, restoring his citizenship. Although Willkie refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans, he stated in a speech that war was <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> depriving groups of people of their rights. He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war, warning against [...] "witch-hanging and mob-baiting". For his activities, he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.|$|E
500|$|Rachel has {{had several}} romantic {{relationships}} throughout Friends decade-long run, {{the most famous}} and prominent of which remains her on-again, off-again relationship with friend Ross. Although wildly popular among audiences, the couple has been met with mixed reviews from critics.

China Daily cited Ross and Rachel's reunion during the series finale [...] "The Last One" [...] among the episode's highlights, while Gary Susman of Rolling Stone believes that audiences {{would not have been}} happy had the couple not ultimately reunited. Contrastingly, The Wire's Joe Reid is of the opinion that the show's second season is [...] "the only time Ross/Rachel was truly great". Virgin Media wrote that the couple's dynamics [...] "had grown mightily tedious" [...] by season ten. E! cable network ranked Rachel and Ross the ninth greatest Friends couple, writing that their relationship gave [...] "Friends fans enough iconic quotes to fill a book", considering Phoebe's line [...] "See? [...] her lobster!" [...] to be among show's most iconic. Ross and Rachel's season three breakup has spawned a debate among Friends fans, who continue to argue over which of the two was at fault: Rachel for suggesting that they take a break from their relationship, or Ross for sleeping with another woman immediately afterwards. Writing for E!, Jenna Mullins ruled in favor of Rachel, elaborating, [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Ross sleeping with someone else after his lobster suggested taking a break", concluding that Ross [...] "blew it".
