5|$|Early in the series, Hyun-jun and Seung-hee {{encounter}} a young Japanese schoolgirl while in Akita {{by the name}} of Yuki (Karen Miyama). Her family operates one of the tourist traps nearby, and she exhibits affection for Hyun-jun and attempts to find herself in his company as much as possible. Later, it is Hyun-jun that needs her, as Yuki and her family help him when he <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> most.|$|E

After she hears her father and stepmother come in, she sees her friends {{in the mirror and}} realizes even though she is growing up, she still <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> in her life every now and again. In an instant, a number of the major characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room for a raucous celebration, and she reunites with Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. As they celebrate, Jareth, in his owl form, watches from outside and then flies away into the night.|$|E

25|$|Yet another impetus of both RISC {{and other}} designs came from {{practical}} measurements on real-world programs. Andrew Tanenbaum summed up many of these, demonstrating that processors often had oversized immediates. For instance, he showed that 98% {{of all the}} constants in a program would fit in 13 bits, yet many CPU designs dedicated 16 or 32 bits to store them. This suggests that, {{to reduce the number}} of memory accesses, a fixed length machine could store constants in unused bits of the instruction word itself, so that they would be immediately ready when the CPU <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> (much like immediate addressing in a conventional design). This required small opcodes in order to leave room for a reasonably sized constant in a 32-bit instruction word.|$|E
500|$|Ned is {{very honest}} and sincere in {{carrying}} out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness, and compassion. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even {{going so far as}} to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> first. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance. Ned’s dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.|$|E
500|$|When Homer and Marge [...] "snuggled" [...] to {{celebrate}} this development, she became pregnant. Homer {{was not happy}} {{when he found out}} about Marge's pregnancy, and was completely unenthusiastic about the impending birth. Because of the financial problems caused by the pregnancy, Homer was forced to make a sacrifice {{and go back to the}} power plant. However, Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back, and placed a large plaque in front of Homer's desk reading: [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer was once again unhappy at his work, but when Maggie was born, Homer instantly fell in love with her. Back in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not understand what that has to do with Maggie's photos. Homer merely mentions that they are in the place where he <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> the most. The scene then cuts to his workplace where all of the photos of Maggie are positioned on the plaque on the wall, which now reads: [...] "Do it for her".|$|E

500|$|On March 30, Specter won {{the backing}} of the AFL-CIO, which was {{considered}} one of the most important endorsements in the primary race. It was one of several major labor endorsements Specter had received, including the state Service Employees International Union and the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represented 200,000 state teachers. Representatives from the AFL-CIO cited Specter's backing of President Obama's stimulus package as a major factor in their decision. Sestak criticized the union federation's decision, pointing out he had a 100 percent rating from the national AFL-CIO while Specter had a 61 percent rating. He also attacked Specter for previously backing President George W. Bush's economic policies and said, [...] "Pennsylvania workers need a Senator they can count on to be there when they need him, not only when he <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> during an election." [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer writer Thomas Fitzgerald called the endorsement [...] "a powerful affirmation of how smoothly Specter has managed his political transition to the Democratic Party since leaving the Republican Party less than a year ago".|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] rating. He {{felt that the}} episode worked {{extremely}} well on a visual and character-based level. Handlen felt that, because the show was [...] "often scariest when it’s implying, rather than flat out stating," [...] its [...] "mythology only really works as something just out of sight". For this reason, {{he felt that the}} episode mixed [...] "the compelling with the absurd" [...] with [...] "mixed results". Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "has its moment," [...] but is ultimately hurt {{by the fact that it}} refuses [...] "to come to any serious conclusions," [...] as well as [...] "the inherent limitations of the [...] form". Not all reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the death scene of the Syndicate, noting that it was [...] "clumsily contrived, allowing [...] and Fowley to escape, but not because it makes sense, but because the show <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> to return at some point".|$|E

Jason (Kane Hodder) is resurrected again, this time by the telekinetic Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln), {{who is trying to}} resurrect her father who drowned in the lake when Tina was a child. Jason once again begins killing those who occupy Crystal Lake and is returned {{to the bottom of the}} lake after a battle with Tina. Jason is resurrected again in [...] (1989) by an underwater electrical cable. He follows a group of students on their senior class cruise to Manhattan, where he kills the ship's crew and the majority of the students. Upon reaching Manhattan, Jason chases Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and Sean (Scott Reeves), the two remaining students, into the sewers. Jason eventually melts away because the sewer is flooded with toxic waste. In [...] (1993), Jason, through an unexplained resurrection, is hunted by the FBI at Crystal Lake. The FBI sets up a sting that successfully kills Jason. Through possession, Jason manages to survive by passing his black heart from one being to the next. It is revealed that he has a sister and a niece, and that he <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> to get his body back. Jason resurrects himself, but his niece, Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan), stabs him with a mystical dagger and he is dragged into Hell.|$|E

500|$|... (1988) begins an {{undisclosed}} {{amount of time}} after Jason Lives. Jason (Kane Hodder) is freed from his chains by the telekinetic Tina Shepard (Lar Park Lincoln), who was attempting to resurrect her father. Jason begins killing those who occupy Crystal Lake, and after a battle with Tina, is dragged back {{to the bottom of}} the lake by an apparition of Tina's father. [...] (1989) sees Jason return from the grave, brought back to life via an underwater electrical cable. He follows a group of students on their senior class trip to Manhattan, boarding the Lazarus to wreak havoc. Upon reaching Manhattan, Jason kills all the survivors but Rennie (Jensen Daggett) and Sean (Scott Reeves); he chases them into the sewers, where he is submerged in toxic waste and dies. [...] (1993) marked the second time Jason was officially killed according to studio canon. Through an unexplained resurrection, he returns to Crystal Lake, where he is hunted by the FBI. The FBI sets up a sting to kill Jason, which proves successful. Through mystical possession, however, Jason survives by passing his demon-infested heart from one being to the next. Though Jason does not physically appear throughout most of the film, it is learned he has a half-sister and a niece, and that he <b>needs</b> <b>them</b> to retrieve and reinhabit his body. After resurrecting it, Jason is stabbed by his niece Jessica Kimble (Kari Keegan) and dragged into Hell.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she <b>needs</b> <b>them.</b> Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you right back to the beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E

The film received mixed reviews but Aniston's performance was once again noticed. Wesley Morris of The Grantland called her [...] "one of the great screen comedians. [...] Most of her scenes here are extraneous, but her vulgarity and tartness are so sharp that the movie <b>needs</b> <b>them.</b> [...] This isn’t just Aniston having the best stuff. It’s her having the most fun with her talent. She’s funny in every way." [...] She's [...] "one of the film’s few bright spots" [...] for Lou Lumenick from The New York Post.|$|E
