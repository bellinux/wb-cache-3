40|$|Objective: Approximately 50 % of newborn develop jaundice, however only 6 % of {{them have}} {{significant}} hyperbilirubinemia that need more evaluation. Actually, most of sampling (50 - 90 %) for detection of hyperbilirubinemia is not necessary and cause some problems such as infection, tissue injury, pain, discomfort, wasting time and money. So non-invasive methods is desirable to decrease unnecessary sampling. Material & Methods: This study performed on neonates who referred to Shiraz University of Medical Science affiliated Nemazee hospital <b>neonatal</b> emergency <b>room</b> due to jaundice. Initially 92 neonates were selected. After taking digital images and calculating mean and 95 percentile yellow wave's lengths of forehead skin and detection of total serum bilirubin, the correlation between wave's lengths and serum total bilirubin were determined. 95 percentile of skin yellow wave lengths that determined bilirubin level of 5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/dl were used for making 4 yellow strips of the icterometer. This icterometer was used for screening of 209 neonates who referred for evaluation of jaundice. Findings: Using icterometer in evaluation of 209 neonates with jaundice demonstrated sensitivity 94. 7 %, specificity 55. 2 %, positive predictive value of 85 %, negative predictive value of 95 % and accuracy 87 %.

ROP was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by exposure to 80 % oxygen from postnatal (P) days 0 to 11 (with 3 hours/day in room air), and then room air from P 12 – 18 (angiogenesis period). Shams were <b>neonatal</b> rats in <b>room</b> air from P 0 – 18. STI 571, a potent inhibitor of PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase, was administered from P 12 – 18 at 50 or 100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal (i. p.). Electron microscopy revealed that pericytes in the inner retina of both sham and ROP rats appeared normal; however STI 571 induced a selective pericyte and vascular smooth muscle degeneration. Immunolabeling for caspase- 3 and α-smooth muscle cell actin in consecutive paraffin sections of retinas confirmed that these degenerating cells were apoptotic pericytes. In all groups, VEGF and VEGFR- 2 gene expression was located in ganglion cells, the inner nuclear layer, and retinal pigment epithelium. ROP was associated {{with an increase in}} both VEGF and VEGFR- 2 gene expression and blood vessel profiles in the inner retina compared to sham rats. STI 571 at both doses increased VEGF and VEGFR- 2 mRNA and exacerbated angiogenesis in ROP rats, and in sham rats at 100 mg/kg/day.

MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal multicêntrico, realizado em 36 maternidades de 20 capitais brasileiras em junho de 2003. O coordenador local preencheu questionário com dados referentes à realização de ensino específico da reanimação neonatal e atuação em sala de parto de alunos de Medicina e de Enfermagem, residentes de Pediatria e de Neonatologia. Os dados foram analisados de forma descritiva. RESULTADOS: Das 36 maternidades, 23 recebiam alunos de Medicina: em 13, eles atuavam na sala de parto; 12 ofereciam ensino específico da reanimação e, em duas das 13 maternidades com internos atuando na sala de parto, não era oferecido treinamento em reanimação. Das 36 maternidades, 23 recebiam alunos de Enfermagem: em oito, os alunos atuavam na sala de parto. Apenas uma oferecia ensino, e nas outras sete não havia qualquer treinamento. Das 36 maternidades, 27 tinham residentes de Pediatria, que atuavam na sala de parto e recebiam treinamento em reanimação neonatal (teórico com 2 - 3 horas em quatro maternidades e teórico-prático com 4 - 64 horas em 23). Das 36 maternidades, 15 recebiam residentes em Neonatologia, que atuavam na sala de parto e recebiam treinamento em reanimação neonatal (teórico de 2 horas em uma e teórico-prático com 3 - 68 horas em 14).

40|$|D. Tech. (Biomedical Technology) Abstract: Contamination of {{hospital}} water systems with bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa {{is a potential}} risk for nosocomial infections to patients and medical personnel. Among these microorganisms, protozoa such as free-living amoebae (FLA) exist in high numbers in the natural aquatic environment where they play a useful role as predators of microorganisms. Free-living amoebae have also been isolated from man-made water systems such as cooling towers, hospital water networks and wastewater and drinking water plants. Although most FLA are non-pathogenic, some species including Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Acanthamoeba species are known human pathogens and also harbour and transmit bacterial pathogens in the environment. These bacteria referred to as amoeba resistant bacteria (ARB) include nosocomial pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas species, Legionella pneumophila and environmental Mycobacterium species. Other non-pathogenic FLA such as Vermamoeba vermiformis, are also known carriers of pathogenic ARB. The importance of drinking water quality distributed through public health care facilities in Johannesburg, with special reference to FLA and certain ARB, has not been studied previously. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and their associated bacteria in three selected public hospital water networks in Johannesburg. This was an observational, descriptive study of the three water distribution systems. Walk-through assessments were conducted for the three water systems to determine areas of high risk for infection by waterborne pathogens and history of waterborne diseases in those areas. A sampling strategy was then established. A total of 275 water (143) and swab (132) samples were collected from the inlets, theatres, intensive care units, endoscopy units, renal units, <b>neonatal</b> ward, milk <b>room,</b> diarrhoea ward and sterilization units. The water physico-chemical elements: pH, temperature, residual chlorine and total dissolved solids were determined at the site of collection. The water samples were also tested for the presence of microbial indicators using the micro-most probable number (MPN) method. All the samples were filtered and analyzed using an amoebal enrichment technique. Observed autochthonous amoebae were then purified and examined for the presence of FLA and intracellular bacteria transmission electron microscopy,. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of an infant’s condition at birth or during resuscitation remains mostly clinical {{and can be}} a challenge for practitioners [1 - 3]. In 2005, the addition of the transcutaneous oxygen saturation monitoring was suggested in the European guidelines [4] only to become part of AAP and ERC recommendations in 2010 [5, 6] By contrast, in the NICU, data from multimodal monitoring systems are generally integrated to the clinical evaluation to optimize newborn infants’ intensive care. Thus, respiratory mechanic information’s given by the ventilator provides useful informations on pressure, volume, leaks and respiratory function of the intubated infant [7]. While ventilation is the main intervention to support difficult transition to extra-uterine life, monitoring infants and medical procedures is only slowly integrating clinical practice in the delivery room [8]. Use of an experimental respiratory function monitor (RFM) at birth was suggested initially in 1984 in a study evaluating mask and bag ventilation in 9 term infants [9]. It reappeared 30 years later in a manikin study that discussed future use for research and as a training tool [10]. The RFM is connected to a computer for recording. A hot wire anemometer interposed between the mask and the pressure providing device (self-inflating bag SIB or T-piece) supply flow data, and therefore informations on tidal volume (VT), inspiratory and expiratory times, and leaks. The pressure line can be fitted at the T-piece gas inlet, the T-piece itself, or at a port on the SIB. Oxygen concentration can be quantified at the gas inlet, and integrated to the recording. Additionally, the software can accommodate heart rate and oxygen saturation data from a pulse oxymeter. A small webcam can also document both the infant’s visual aspect and actions undertaken. Clinical and simulation studies did highlight some technical difficulties of birth resuscitation and suggested ways to overcome them. Holding the face mask appropriately is surprisingly a difficult task. Large leaks are common, and are associated with lower VT’s [11]. Use of RFM in simulation studies allowed to investigate placement and hold of face masks [12]. Trainees also improved their technique when provided with RFM feedback [13]. RFM has been used to evaluate different pressure providing devices [14, 15]. The negative influence of chest compressions on the efficacy of manikin ventilation was documented with RFM [16]. In clinical practice, RFM was shown to decrease mask leak and helped to avoid excessive VT [17]. Currently, a randomized controlled trial evaluates if guiding neonatal resuscitation with RFM will improve infants’ outcomes. Studies with RFM in the delivery room did improve our understanding of respiratory adaptation at birth. Patterns of initial respirations have been further characterized, with long or delayed expirations observed mostly in preterm infants [18]. Very preterm infants’ respiration starts with increasing VT’s followed by smaller breaths and increased CO 2 exhalation[19]. With face mask ventilation, VT’s have a large variability, with lower volumes occurring when active inspiration is absent [11]. Additionally, obstructive phenomena (when positive pressure is not associated with insufflatory flow) seem common in the first minutes of life [20]. Our <b>neonatal</b> stabilization <b>room</b> now benefits from a RFM. This tool already has multiple applications. For new residents and for outreach training, the RFM helps to improve mask ventilation teaching on a leak-free manikin. Combined video and RFM recordings can be reviewed for educational and auditing purposes. We used it in a manikin study, to assess if different types of small manometers could improve bag and mask ventilation. Finally, RFM helps to evaluate the outcome of a resuscitation intervention in a randomized controlled trial. We are investigating the effect of either prophylactic suction before ventilation (as recommended by the AAP [6]) or no systematic suction (as in the ERC guidelines [5]) on the incidence of airway obstructions and neonatal adaptation.

40|$|Alarm fatigue is a well-recognized {{patient safety}} concern in {{intensive}} care settings. Decreased nurse responsiveness and slow response times to alarms are the potentially dangerous consequences of alarm fatigue. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the factors that modulate nurse responsiveness to critical patient monitor and ventilator alarms in the context of a private <b>room</b> <b>neonatal</b> intensive care setting. The study design comprised of both a questionnaire and video monitoring of nurse-responsiveness to critical alarms. The Likert scale questionnaire, comprising of 50 questions across thematic clusters (critical alarms, yellow alarms, perception, design, nursing action, and context) was administered to 56 nurses (90 % response rate). Nearly 6000 critical alarms were recorded from 10 infants in approximately 2400 hours of video monitoring. Logistic regression was used to identify patient and alarm-level factors that modulate nurse-responsiveness to critical alarms, with a response being defined as a nurse entering the patient's room within the 90 s of the alarm being generated. Based on the questionnaire, the majority of nurses found critical alarms to be clinically relevant even though the alarms did not always mandate clinical action. Based on video observations, for a median of 34 % (IQR, 20 - 52) of critical alarms, the nurse was already present in the room. For the remaining alarms, the response rate within 90 s was 26 %. The median response time was 55 s (IQR, 37 - 70 s). Desaturation alarms were the most prevalent and accounted for more than 50 % of all alarms. The odds of responding to bradycardia alarms, compared to desaturation alarms, were 1. 47 (95 % CI = 1. 21 - 1. 78; < 0. 001) while that of responding to a ventilator alarm was lower at 0. 35 (95 % CI = 0. 27 - 0. 46; p < 0. 001). For every 20 s increase in the duration of an alarm, the odds of responding to the alarm (within 90 s) increased to 1. 15 (95 % CI = 1. 1 - 1. 2; p < 0. 001). The random effect per infant improved the fit of the model to the data with the response times being slower for infants suffering from chronic illnesses while being faster for infants who were clinically unstable. Even though nurses respond to only a fraction of all critical alarms, they consider the vast majority of critical and yellow alarms as useful and relevant. When notified of a critical alarm, they seek waveform information and employ heuristics in determining whether or not to respond to the alarm. Amongst other factors, the category and duration of critical alarms along with the clinical status of the patient determine nurse-responsiveness to alarms...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} cause of newborn failure to {{transition}} at birth is perinatal asphyxia. Asphyxia is a multi-causal condition of simultaneous hypoxia and hypercapnia that leads to acideamia. Severely asphyxiated newborn infants are born bradycardic and apneic and require resuscitation to establish pulmonary gas exchange and restore cardiac function after birth. However, as {{there is a lack of}} evidence to support any specific resuscitation regime, there is currently no globally accepted resuscitation strategy for asphyxiated newborns. The evidence-base for current neonatal resuscitation guidelines remains low and data is extrapolated largely from adult or animal resuscitation studies. Most animal studies have been conducted in adult models or newborn animals that were hours or days into postnatal life, which is not reflective of the newborn circulation. This is because the fetal shunts (ductus arterious and foreman ovale) are functionally closed in these models, thus the circulation is more reflective of an adult as opposed to the newborn. Therefore, most of the information from these studies is of limited applicability to <b>neonatal</b> delivery <b>room</b> resuscitation. In my thesis, I have utilised for the first time a relevant animal model where near-term lambs are asphyxiated immediately after delivery. This almost exactly mimics that which occurs in the neonatal intensive care unit, and for the first time examines the pulmonary and cerebral circulatory response to different ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation strategies. Therefore, the global aim of my thesis is to determine the effects of different resuscitation strategies on the cardiorespiratory transition in an appropriate animal model of asphyxia immediately after birth. The outcomes from these studies provide a better understanding of the critical relationship between initial respiratory support in the delivery room and cardiorespiratory haemodynamics in asphyxiated newborns. A cornerstone of neonatal resuscitation teaching describes a rapid vagal-mediated bradycardic response to asphyxia and is one of the first signs of perinatal compromise. As such, heart rate is the primary parameter used to assess the well-being of the newborn. This understanding is based primarily on fetal studies. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate the heart rate response to asphyxia depending upon whether lambs were in utero or ex utero (Chapter 3). Heart rate response to asphyxia was markedly different depending upon whether the lamb was in utero or ex utero. Heart rates in in utero lambs rapidly decreased, while heart rates in ex utero lambs initially increased following cord occlusion before they started to decrease. Mean arterial pressure initially increased then decreased in both groups. This data indicates that our current understanding of the cardiovascular responses that indicate the stage and severity of a perinatal asphyxic event may not be as accurate as previously assumed. International neonatal resuscitation guidelines vaguely state that shorter or longer inflation times to can be used to establish initial lung inflation in apnoeic newborn infants. The second aim of this thesis was to compare three different ventilation strategies immediately after delivery asphyxiated near-term lambs on the cardiovascular and respiratory transition at birth (Chapter 4). Immediately after asphyxia, animals were either resuscitated with i) immediate start of ventilation with inflation times of 0. 5 s at a rate of 60 inflations per minute (conventional ventilation) ii) five initial inflations of 3 s duration (European approach) or iii) one long inflation of 30 s duration (experimental approach). A single sustained inflation of 30 s duration improved speed of circulatory recovery and lung compliance in this near-term lamb asphyxia model. However, the restoration in heart rate and blood pressure was so rapid that the resulting increase in cerebral blood flow may induce or enhance brain pathology. Therefore, ventilation with an initial single 30 s SI improves circulatory recovery, but is also associated with a rapid increase in cerebral blood flow, which may exacerbate brain injury suffered by asphyxiated newborns. The use an initial 30 s SI was found to rapidly improve circulatory recovery in asphyxiated lambs Chapter 4. The mechanism of this dramatic response in heart rate is unknown. It is known that aeration of the lungs is associated with a rapid increase in pulmonary blood flow (PBF). The third aim of this thesis was to determine if the entry of gas into the lungs was the major mechanism driving the cardiopulmonary transition in asphyxiated newborns (Chapter 5). It was found that an SI using nitrogen did not increase heart rate or PBF. Therefore, oxygen content during an SI is important in increasing heart rate in asphyxiated lambs. The increase in heart rate is likely driven by the increase in PBF and venous return to the heart. Chest compressions (CC) and adrenaline administration are recommended in asphyxiated newborns that have persistent bradycardia despite effective ventilation. Although this improves circulatory recovery in adults and infants, the effects of CC on cerebral blood flow in newborns at birth, when ductal shunts are patent, is unknown. The final aim of this thesis was to determine the effects of CC, with or without adrenaline administration on the return of spontaneous circulation, carotid blood flow (CBF) and carotid arterial pressure in asphyxiated near-term lambs (Chapter 6). We found that CC with adrenaline administration was required to increase CBF and restore spontaneous circulation in asphyxiated lambs. We also found the presence of a low CBF and retrograde diastolic CBF during CC, which was only abolished when adrenaline was administered, leading to the return in spontaneous circulation. In conclusion, the studies contained in this thesis increase our understanding of the effects of different resuscitation strategies on the cardiovascular transition at birth in an appropriate model of perinatal asphyxia. The knowledge of how these strategies influences cardiovascular and cerebrovascular haemodynamics will benefit the future design of ventilation strategies that aerate the lungs without compromising cardiac output...|$|R

A incidência de CA foi 18, 5 % nos < 1. 500 g e 32, 1 % nos < 28 semanas. A CA associou-se a: uso de AB antenatal (p< 0, 001), trabalho PPT (p< 0, 001), IG, sepse precoce (p= 0, 035), aumento das citocinas pró-inflamatórias (todos com p< 0, 05), leucocitose (p= 0, 019) e aumento de bastonetes (p< 0, 001). No modelo de regressão logística para DBP, mantiveram-se significativos, além de IG e oxigenioterapia, a CA, sepse tardia, uso tardio de surfactante e dias de NP. Os resultados reforçam o papel da prematuridade, lesão oxidativa e inflamação (CA e sepse) na patogênese da DBP e evidenciam a necessidade de adequadas práticas de manejo nutricional, da dificuldade respiratória precoce e de suporte ventilatório do prematuro, todas podendo influenciar na prevenção da DBP. The {{quality of}} pre and postnatal {{care and the}} structure of Neonatal Intensive Care Units have allowed the survival of increasingly premature infants, but have also increased morbidities such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Strong recent evidence has associated chorioamnionitis (CA) and systemic response with an imbalance between proinflammatory and antiinflammatory factors in the pathogenesis of this multifactorial disease. Understanding this process is vital for the development of appropriate strategies in preventing preterm delivery (PTD) and providing better neonatal care. The present prospective study aimed at assessing the incidence of BPD in very low birth weight infants (VLBW) and the impact of histologic CA in their development. Out of the initial 225 neonates and their mothers, 216 were studied after consent, and were analyzed data on prenatal care, characteristics of the neonate, resuscitation in delivery <b>room,</b> <b>neonatal</b> ventilation, hemodynamic and nutritional support, placental histology, and cytokines in the cord blood. The maternal conditions most associated to PTD were PT labor (43. 1 %), preeclampsia (39. 4 %), intrauterine growth restriction (30. 1 %), and urinary tract infection (23. 1 %). Antenatal steroids (ANS) and antibiotics (AB) were used in 72 % and 42. 7 %, respectively. Out of the 216 neonates, most (61. 6 %) were less than 30 weeks of age, 53. 7 % were females, 37 % were small for gestational age (SGA). Tracheal intubation (31. 6 %) was preferred over bag and mask ventilation (23. 7 %), and mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 78. 2 %, for an average of 12. 7 days. Surfactant was used in 64. 4 %. Mortality rate was 19. 9 %, and in neonates weighing under 1, 000 g, 38. 6 %. Early sepsis (EOS) (positive hemoculture) occurred in 3. 7 % and late sepsis (LOS) in 31. 5 %. Moderate and severe BPD occurred in 26. 0 % of cases. In the univariate analysis, BPD was associated with gestational age (GA) (p< 0. 001), birth weight (p< 0. 001), CA (p= 0. 005), LOS (p< 0. 001), EOS (p= 0. 020), days on MV and days in oxygen therapy (both p< 0. 001), surfactant (p< 0. 001), start of enteral feeding, days of parenteral nutrition (PN) and days to reach full enteral nutrition (EN) (all p< 0. 001). Incidence of histologic CA was 18. 5 % and 32. 1 % among those aged less than 28 weeks. CA was associated with antenatal AB (p< 0. 001), PT labor (p< 0. 001), GA, EOS (p= 0. 035), high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (all p< 0. 05), leukocytosis (p= 0. 019) and high band neutrophils (p< 0. 001). In the logistic regression model for BPD outcome, besides GA and oxygen therapy, the following variables remained significant: CA (p= 0. 020), LOS (p= 0. 002), days on PN (p= 0. 005) and late surfactant (p= 0. 030). The results reinforce the role of prematurity, oxidative injury and inflammation (CA and sepsis) in the pathogenesis of BPD, and indicates the need for better nutritional practices, as well as better care for early respiratory impairment and ventilation support, with possible influence in the prevention of BPD...|$|R
