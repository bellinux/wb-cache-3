5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Hudson Line, the Scarborough station became a Penn Central station once the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. Penn Central's {{continuous}} financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the MTA's Metro-North Railroad in 1983. In 2007, the MTA overhauled the station, installing <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> such as platforms, canopies, shelters, enclosed staircases, lighting, and benches. The station's overpass was demolished and a replacement was built with elevators on either side. The new overpass was designed in a less modern style and now has glass-sided elevators. During the construction, Metro-North built a temporary wooden station to the station's south.|$|E

5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E
5|$|Labour difficulties, late {{delivery}} of equipment, additional requirements for Australian operations, and the prioritisation of merchant shipping over naval construction delayed {{the completion of}} Majestic. Incorporation of the <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> and enhancements caused {{the cost of the}} RAN carrier acquisition program to increase to AU£8.3million. Construction and fitting out did not finish until October 1955. As the carrier neared completion, a commissioning crew was formed in Australia and first used to return Vengeance to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Players take up {{the roles}} of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space {{stations}} and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character can engage in trade. The player character's primary goal in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.|$|E

5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade {{changed its}} higher command {{for the first}} time in its history on 15 February 2008.

This would also mark the first time that the brigade served independently from the 1st Cavalry Division. Since returning from Iraq, the brigade has undertaken a number of duties around Fort Hood. These activities include testing <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> for use during deployments, remodeling infrastructure around the fort, and training on personal safety.|$|E
5|$|The trainer {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward {{fuselage}} features a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in chord (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and <b>new</b> <b>systems,</b> but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Software Reengineering is an {{effective}} technique for reuse the older application in the new environment. Nowadays, Reengineering techniques are increasing in spite of many difficulties and issues arise when the older application is converted to newer one. So {{there is a need}} to enhance the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> to satisfy the user requirements and quality aspects. Approach: For this enhancement of <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> we propose a method namely Automatic Specification Evaluator (ASE) where the interference and their effects on the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> were identified by their attributes and modify the interference if necessary. The accuracy of the migration was further increased by reimplementation of the same method. Results: After the proposed ASE method, the system interference was reduced and the efficiency of the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> was improved. In many migration situations, ASE produces the target system with zero interference. Conclusion: Our proposed method gives a good performance in the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> and hence the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> can adopt the properties of the legacy system and also satisfies the user requirement...|$|R
50|$|When a <b>new</b> <b>system</b> {{needs to}} be {{implemented}} in an organization, there are three different ways to adopt this new system: the big bang adoption, phased adoption and parallel adoption. In case of parallel adoption {{the old and the}} <b>new</b> <b>system</b> are running parallel, so all the users can get used to the <b>new</b> <b>system,</b> and meanwhile do their work using the old system. Phased adoption means that the adoption will happen in several phases, so after each phase the system is a little nearer to be fully adopted. With the big bang adoption, the switch between using the old system and using the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> happens at one single date, the so-called instant changeover of the system. Everybody starts to use the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> at the same date and the old system will not be used anymore from that moment on.|$|R
5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now founded as id Software, {{used some of}} these games to {{prototype}} ideas for their own games, including in late spring of 1991 Keen Dreams, which they used to develop <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> for their next set of major episodes of the series. They did not initially {{want to do a}} Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve the next full set of games for Apogee. The team reprised their roles from the first game, and prototyped an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed {{in less than a month}} even as the team simultaneously worked on another game.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, the Turkish {{government}} unveiled {{plans to}} further modernize the airport {{as part of}} Turkey's broader engagement in the local post-conflict reconstruction process. Among the scheduled renovations were <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> and infrastructure, including a modern control tower to monitor the airspace. In September 2013, the Turkish company Favori LLC began operations at the airport. The firm announced plans to renovate the aviation building and construct a new one, as well as upgrade other modern service structures. A $10 million project, it will increase the airport's existing 15 aircraft capacity to 60. In January 2015, a new, state-of-the-art terminal was opened at the airport. Featuring modern passenger facilities and a glass façade, it will enable the airport to double its number of daily commercial flights to 60, with a throughput of around 1,000 passengers per hour.|$|E
5|$|In October—December 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk, calling themselves Ideas from the Deep, developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After {{the release of the}} game in December, and the arrival of the first US$10,500 royalty check from shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created the game on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months. Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop <b>new</b> <b>systems</b> for their next major release in the Commander Keen series.

5000|$|In September 2013, FCS {{introduced}} FCS II [...] a <b>new</b> pre-glass fin <b>system</b> to the market. The <b>new</b> <b>system</b> {{boasts a}} number of key advantages over its predecessors. Firstly, the need for any screws or tool to secure the fins has been eliminated; the fins now simply lock into the plugs. Secondly, {{the leading edge of the}} fin resides inside the plug, and the base of the fins sit flush to the surface of the board creating a more seamless connection. The final key feature of the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> is that it’s backward compatible, meaning it will accept fins from the original dual tab system. Adding two grub screws and a small silicon insert allows you to secure your two tab fins into the <b>new</b> <b>system.</b> Many consider the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> inferior, Channel Islands Surfboards parted with FCS after the <b>new</b> <b>system</b> and Kelly Slater continues to surf the original FCS tabs on his Komunity Project fins.|$|R
