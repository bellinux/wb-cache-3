40|$|Abstract [...] The {{conditions}} {{determining the}} dynamical {{behavior of the}} ionized gas in the outer atmosphere of the earth are discussed. It is proposed to call this region in which the magnetic field of the earth dominates the 'magnetosphere. ' Observations by Van Allen and others indicate that this zone reaches out to between 5 and 10 earth radii, depending {{on the degree of}} magnetic disturbance. It is shown that the existence of an insulating layer at the base of this region, namely the <b>non-ionized</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> completely changes the type of control exerted by the magnetic field, allowing a class of motions to occur freely without the need to overcome any magnetic forces. The extent to which such motions may occur is discussed, and some of the indications from airglow and magnetic observations are mentioned. The theory predicts that, {{at the level of the}} F â€¢ layer and above, most motions will show strict symmetry between the two base points of a magnetic line of force. It has now become possible to investigate the region above the ionosphere in which the magnetic field of the earth has a dominant contro...|$|E
40|$|Low Frequency (LF) {{radio signals}} {{lie in the}} band 30 - 300 kHz. The {{electric}} field of three LF broadcasting stations-CLT (f = 189 kHz, Sicily, Italy), MCO (f = 216 kHz, France) and CZE (f = 270 kHz, Czech Republic) -has been monitored since 1997 with a sampling frequency of ten minutes at a site named AS and located in central Italy. During September-November 2002, we observed significant decreases in the electric field strength of the CLT broadcasting station. A similar effect did not appear on the MCO and CZE radio signals. On September 6 an earthquake with M = 5. 6 occurred offshore, about 40 kin far from Palermo city (Sicily), starting an intense seismic crisis {{for more than one}} month. On October 27, the Etna volcano (Sicily) started an eruption that in January 2003 was still active. On October 31, an earthquake with M = 5. 4 occurred at the border between Molise and Puglia regions (southern Italy) and, finally, in the period 3 - 6 November intense gas exhalations happened near the Eolie islands (southern Tyrrhenian sea). The CLT radio-signal decreases we observed appear clearly related to the previous activities with some possible premonitory behaviour. The LF signals are characterised by the ground-wave and the sky-wave propagation modes. The decreases in CLT radio-signal we mentioned previously are related to a reduction of the electric field strength both of the ground wave and of the sky wave. Changes in the troposphere-ground boundary zone and in the lower <b>non-ionized</b> <b>atmosphere</b> seem to be the main candidates to justify the phenomenology we observed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Since the 1974 {{proposal}} by Giuseppe Colombo {{to fly a}} tethered subsatellite from the Shuttle Orbiter, the creative thinking of many scientists and engineers from Italy and U. S. has generated {{a broad range of}} potential tether applications in space. Many of these applications have promise for enabling innovative research and operational activities relating to flight mechanics in earth orbit and at suborbital altitudes. From a flight mechanics standpoint the most interesting of the currently proposed flight demonstrations are: the second Tethered Satellite System experiment which offers both the potential for aerothermodynamics and hypersonics research and for atmospheric science research; the Tethered Initiated Space Recovery System which would enable orbital deboost and recovery of a re-entry vehicle and waste removal from a space station; and the Tether Elevator/Crawler System which would provide a variable microgravity environment and space station center of mass management. The outer atmospheric and orbital flight mechanics characteristics of these proposed tether flight demonstrations are described. The second Tethered Satellite System mission will deploy the tethered satellite earthward and will bring it as low as 130 km from ground and thus into the transition region between the <b>atmosphere</b> (<b>non-ionized)</b> and the partially ionized ionosphere. The atmospheric flight mechanics of the tethered satellite is discussed and simulation results are presented. The Tether Initiated Space Recovery System experiment will demonstrate the ability of a simple tether system to deboost and recover a reentry vehicle. The main feature of this demonstration is the utilization of a Small Expendable Deployment System (SEDS) and the low-tension deployment assumed to separate the reentry vehicle from the Shuttle. This low-tension deployment maneuver is discussed and its criticalities are outlined. The Tether Elevator/Crawler System is a new space element able to move in a controlled way between the ends of a deployed tethered system. A Shuttle test of an Elevator model is planned to demonstrate the unique capability of this element as a microgravity facility and to test the transfer motion control. The basic dynamical features of the Elevator system are presented and a preliminary assessment of the Elevator-induced tether vibrations is discussed...|$|R
