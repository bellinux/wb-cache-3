Lavigne's {{close friend and}} guitarist, Evan Taubenfeld, said, [...] "It's a very touchy subject {{to a lot of}} people, {{but the point is that}} Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene.

Lavigne also commented on the matter: [...] "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [...] rebel... punk, and I am so <b>not</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them."

500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific images that are reference points for us, but at any given point, it's <b>not</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E
500|$|Later, the race's top riders {{took the}} course to decide the overall standings. Robert Gesink, {{generally}} regarded as a poor time trialist, put up his second very strong individual performance in as many races, after having won the ITT at the Tour of Oman. He finished ninth on the day, 27 seconds back of Cancellara at an even 11 minutes, and successfully moved up to second in the overall standings. Ivan Basso, regarded as solid but unremarkable in the time trial discipline, had a difficult ride, finishing in 11'16" [...] and slipping to fourth overall. Michele Scarponi did him one second better, at 11'15", but fell short of overtaking even Gesink, let alone race leader Cadel Evans, with that time. Italian national champion Marco Pinotti finished sixth both in the time trial and the race overall, coming in at 10'57" [...] on the day. As race leader, Evans was the last man on course, and he clocked in at 11'04", ceding four seconds to Gesink in 12th place on the day, but this was sufficient for him to win the race overall. He knew Vincenzo Nibali's time, which was 11'14", before he began his ride, but <b>not</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the others of his rivals. Evans became the first rider from the southern hemisphere to win Tirreno–Adriatico. Third place finisher Scarponi won the points classification, having taken the jersey from Tyler Farrar after stage 6. Gesink took home the white jersey, having led the youth classification for the entire race. Stage 5 breakaway man Davide Malacarne was {{the winner of the}} mountains classification, and Basso and Nibali's [...] squad won the team award.|$|E

[...] More information is available on Hogan's dissatisfaction with his situation in Zanesville, which evidently stemmed from increasing limits on his control over the club. [...] An article that appeared in The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization. [...] "There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run", the paper reported. [...] "As Hogan has his own, which did not exactly coincide with the numerous directors, he resigned". [...] The Gazette Times praised Hogan's performance in Zanesville, stating that his club [...] "was a pennant contender at all stages of the championship race".

This is as clear a rejection of soft inheritance as one can find. However, Lawrence qualified it by including the origin of birth defects owing to influences on the mother (an old folk superstition). So Mayr places Wilhelm His, Sr. in 1874 as the first unqualified rejection of soft inheritance. However, the number of places in the text where Lawrence explicitly rejects the direct action of the environment on heredity justifies his recognition as an early opponent of Geoffroyism.|$|E

2500|$|Another specimen, the Wuwei Bronze Cannon, was {{discovered}} in 1980 and may possibly be the oldest as well as largest cannon of the 13th century: a 100 centimeter 108 kilogram bronze cannon discovered in a cellar in Wuwei, Gansu Province containing no inscription, but has been dated by historians to the late Western Xia period between 1214 and 1227. The gun contained an iron ball about nine centimeters in diameter, which is smaller than the muzzle diameter at twelve centimeters, and 0.1 kilograms of gunpowder in it when discovered, meaning that the projectile might have been another co-viative. Ben Sinvany and Dang Shoushan believe that the ball used to be much larger prior to its highly corroded state {{at the time of}} discovery. While large in size, the weapon is noticeably more primitive than later Yuan dynasty guns, and is unevenly cast. A similar weapon {{was discovered}} not far from the discovery site in 1997, but much smaller in size at only 1.5kg.

2500|$|Monahan's second {{produced}} screenplay was The Departed, {{an adaptation}} of the Hong Kong action film Infernal Affairs. Jack Nicholson, one of the leads in the film, influenced the screenplay. [...] "I had written the role as a post-sexual 68-year-old Irishman.

[...] Monahan received considerable praise from critics when the film was released in theaters, in 2006, and was applauded for accurately depicting the city of Boston. Monahan used his intimate knowledge of the way Bostonians talk and act, learned from his youth spent in the many neighborhoods of Boston, to create characters that The Boston Globe described as distinctly indigenous to the city. By the end of 2006 The Departed had won many critics' prizes. Monahan was honored by The Boston Society of Film Critics with the award for best screenplay, by the Chicago Film Critics Association for best adapted screenplay, and by the Southeastern Film Critics Association with another best adapted screenplay award. Monahan took an unusual route for a screenwriter and hired a publicist to run a campaign promoting his screenplay during awards season. Monahan ended up winning two Best Adapted Screenplay awards for The Departed, from the Writers Guild of America and the Academy Awards. [...] He received an award for his writing in film at the US-Ireland Alliance’s second annual [...] "Oscar Wilde: Honoring Irish Writing in Film" [...] ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|On March 18, 2013, opening {{statements}} were given in a Philadelphia court.

No formal ruling has yet been given for these dismissals. [...] Media sources following the trial have suggested {{that there may have}} been insufficient evidence of post-procedure life to sustain charges in law. Although prosecutors had argued the movements were voluntary and therefore signs of life, it was argued that the evidence offered by prosecutors were equally capable of being interpreted in some or all of these as single autonomous post-mortem motor movements or spasms instead of clinical signs of life, and additionally that none of the seven were capable of being alive as all had been previously killed clinically in utero by means of drugs as part of the procedure. [...] Also, although staff had used descriptions such as [...] "jumping" [...] and [...] "screaming" [...] in their testimony, Gosnell's defense noted that testimony had shown only single movements or breaths, stating that the testimony was not evidence of [...] "the movements of a live child", and the medical examiner had also testified that tests could not determine whether or <b>not</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the 47 fetuses found had been born alive due to tissue deterioration.|$|E
