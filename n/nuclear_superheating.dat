50|$|Nuclear thermal rocket engines {{differ from}} {{conventional}} rocket engines in that thrust is created strictly through thermodynamic phenomena, with no chemical reaction. The nuclear rocket typically operates by passing hydrogen gas through a <b>superheated</b> <b>nuclear</b> core. Testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulses of about 850 seconds (8,340 m/s), about {{twice that of}} the Space Shuttle engines.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{innovation}} was {{the engine}} of the aircraft, which was developed {{under the aegis of}} a separate project code-named Project Pluto, after the Roman god of the underworld. It was a ramjet that used <b>nuclear</b> fission to <b>superheat</b> incoming air instead of chemical fuel. Project Pluto produced two working prototypes of this engine, the Tory-IIA and the Tory-IIC, which were successfully tested in the Nevada desert. Special ceramics had to be developed to meet the stringent weight and tremendous heat tolerances demanded of the SLAM's reactor. These were developed by the Coors Porcelain Company. The reactor itself was designed at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory.|$|R
50|$|Prelude to Space {{recounts the}} fictional {{events leading up}} the launch of Prometheus, the world's first {{spacecraft}} capable of reaching the Moon. Prometheus consists of two components, named Alpha and Beta. Alpha is designed for travel from Earth orbit to the Moon and back. It is not capable of independent atmospheric flight. Beta is a nuclear-powered flying wing which carries Alpha into orbit. Beta uses a <b>nuclear</b> reactor to <b>superheat</b> either air (when flying in the lower, denser, part of the atmosphere) or its own internal supply of methane (in the higher reaches of the atmosphere and in space) to achieve thrust. Beta functions as a ramjet in the lower atmosphere and must be launched using an electric launch track. The return journey to the Moon proceeds as follows: Beta carries Alpha into orbit; Alpha separates from Beta and refuels from tanks previously carried into orbit by Beta; Alpha flies to and lands on the Moon while Beta remains in Earth orbit; Alpha returns to Earth orbit and the crew returns to Earth aboard Beta; Alpha remains in orbit to await the next flight.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{radioactive}} exercises taking place around the world anthropogenic radionuclides were introduce to Puerto Ricoâ€™s terrestrial and aquatic environments beginning in 1962. Two major projects {{took place in the}} island, the Rain Forest Project and the construction of a Boiling <b>Superheat</b> <b>Nuclear</b> Power Plant (BONUS). While in operation several accidental shutdowns occurred at the BONUS facility. One of these accidental shutdowns released 582 MBq into the nearby environment. Vieques an island located few miles east of the main island has received anthropogenic inputs of heavy metals resulting from military practices conducted by the US Navy. Due to the potential presence of Cs- 137 in soils and sediments in Puerto Rico a radiological assessment was performed. Downcore soil and sediment analysis as well as surface samples analysis was conduct in these three sites indicating the presence of Cs- 137. Activity range varies among site from below detection limit to 12 dpm/g at Vieques, 15 dpm/g at Espiritu Santo Estuary and 12 dpm/g at the BONUS Facility. ICP-OES analysis indicates the existence of an oxic environment at the sedimentary system of the island. Cs- 137 retention is strongly influenced by particle grain size and at the study sites clay was present in less than 20 % for most sites. An X-ray diffraction analysis show that kaolinite and smectite are present at all sampling sites and illite is absent. To further analysis the ability of soil and sediments to retain adsorption and desorption was conducted using clay reference material and samples from the island. All samples, reference and natural, used in the study were placed in an aqueous solution that contained MES buffer (5. 0 micromol, pKa of 6. 1), ammonium nitrate (0. 010 M) and the five metals (individual concentrations ranged from 0. 48 micromol to 1. 6 micromol). Solution pH was adjusted by titration with acid or base, depending {{on the nature of the}} sample. Results were quantified as distribution coefficients. These results indicate that the absorption and retention of Cs- 137 in the sediments in Puerto Rico is driven by the mineralogy of the site...|$|R
