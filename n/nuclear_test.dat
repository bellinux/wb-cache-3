5|$|An {{article in}} Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{describes}} how a North Korean underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> on 25 May 2009 was detected {{and the source}} located by GPS satellites. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of GPS satellites for detecting nuclear explosions enhances the ability to verify compliance with the Comprehensive <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Test</b> Ban Treaty, giving the United States more reason to ratify it.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Vela Incident in the {{southern}} Atlantic Ocean {{may have been an}} atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> in contravention of the PTBT by Israel and South Africa, both of which were parties to the treaty.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of New York University, joined {{the faculty of}} the University of Notre Dame in 1938. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy as an engineering officer. He headed a group that conducted blast measurements for the Trinity <b>nuclear</b> <b>test,</b> and served on Tinian with Project Alberta.|$|E
50|$|The 1986-1988 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> were a {{group of}} 24 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> {{conducted}} between 1986 and 1988. These tests followed the 1983-85 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series and preceded the 1989-91 French <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> series.|$|R

5|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from einsteinium and fermium) {{could be}} {{detected in the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b> Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Christy {{was one of}} {{a number}} of {{scientists}} from Caltech who publicly called for a ban on atmospheric nuclear testing. The 1963 Partial <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Test</b> Ban Treaty that Christy advocated put an end to one of his most unusual projects. He worked with Freeman Dyson on Project Orion, the design of a spacecraft propelled by atomic bombs.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{also the}} issue of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific. Since 1960, around 200 <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> have {{occurred}} around the Pacific, to the opprobrium of other Pacific states, Australia and New Zealand. In 1982, New Zealand reggae band Herbs released their breakthrough single, [...] "French Letter", which strongly criticised French <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> The end of the Cold War led to a French moratorium on <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing,</b> but it was lifted in 1995 by Jacques Chirac. French security forces have sought {{to interfere with the}} activity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> protesters. In 1972, the Greenpeace vessel Vega was rammed at Moruroa. The following year Greenpeace protesters were detained by the French, and the skipper claimed he was beaten. Also, in 1985 the French secret service bombed and sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland, New Zealand. Greenpeace had been a very vocal opponent of French <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific. Australia ceased military cooperation with France and embargoed the export of uranium to France.|$|R
5|$|On 26 July 2016, the National Security Archive declassified and {{released}} the entire stock of footage shot by surveillance aircraft that {{flew over the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> site just minutes after the bomb detonated.

5|$|Warren was {{commissioned}} as a {{colonel in the}} United States Army Medical Corps in 1943 and appointed Chief of the Medical Section of the Manhattan Engineering District. He {{was responsible for the}} health and safety of the thousands of personnel involved in the Manhattan Project. He was present at the Trinity <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> in Alamogordo, New Mexico where he was responsible for the safety aspects of the detonation of the world's first nuclear weapon. He led a survey team from the Manhattan Project to assess the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1946 he was Chief of the Radiological Safety Section of the Joint Task Force for Operation Crossroads, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> at Bikini Atoll.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the hydrogen bomb, though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Test</b> Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> and became an advocate of underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|R

But regrettably, India {{conducted}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> last May, {{which has}} run against the contemporary historical trend and seriously affected {{peace and stability}} in South Asia. Pakistan also conducted <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> later on. India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> have not only led to the escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan and provocation of nuclear arms races in South Asia, but also dealt a heavy blow to international nuclear disarmament and the global nonproliferation regime. It is only natural that India's <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> have met with extensive condemnation and aroused serious concern from the international community. Chinese Embassy, New Delhi ...|$|R
25|$|Scientists {{and diplomats}} have debated nuclear weapons policy {{since before the}} atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The public became {{concerned}} about <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>testing</b> from about 1954, following extensive <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in the Pacific. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the war, Bradner took a {{position}} studying high-energy {{physics at the}} University of California, Berkeley under Luis Alvarez, whom he had worked with at the Manhattan Project. He remained at the University until 1961. He worked on the 1951 atomic bombing test on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, {{which was part of}} the Operation Greenhouse <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> series.|$|E
5|$|Again {{working with}} Johnston, Alvarez's last {{task for the}} Manhattan Project {{was to develop a}} set of {{calibrated}} microphone/transmitters to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. He observed the Trinity <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E
5|$|Bradner {{worked on}} the 1951 Operation Greenhouse <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> series on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a {{geophysicist}} in 1961. He remained there {{for the rest of}} his career, becoming a full professor in 1963, and retiring in 1980. In retirement, continued to work both on oceanographic research, as well as on the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project.|$|E
50|$|In early 1985, Rainbow Warrior {{was in the}} Pacific Ocean campaigning against <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing.</b> In May, she {{relocated}} some 300 Marshall Islanders from Rongelap Atoll, {{which had}} been polluted by radioactivity from past American <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> at the Pacific Proving Grounds.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} cartographies of nuclearism and colonial-native {{relations in}} terms of the exclusions in <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> maps. It considers maps from French and British <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> at Mururoa in the South Pacific and Maralinga in Australia. The paper argues that these maps rely on older Euro-American cartographic and narrative traditions of imagining empty and deserted territories in order to advance political arguments for the displacement and deterritorialisation of native peoples who occupy <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> areas. Such official government nuclear cartography reproduces a colonial narrative of native abandonment. The explicit spatial expansionism of <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> maps emphasises that control of place is the crux of the struggle for an anti-nuclear narrative strategy...|$|R
50|$|Julin Bristol is the codename {{given to}} a <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>test</b> {{conducted}} at the Nevada Test Site on 26 November 1991. Conducted as part of Operation Julin, the final series of US <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests,</b> {{it was the last}} test explosion of a British nuclear weapon. Both the US and UK, as signatories of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, ceased <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> after Operation Julin.|$|R
5|$|Caltech did not spell {{an end to}} Bacher's {{service in}} Washington. He served two terms {{as a member of}} the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L. Fisk and Ernest Lawrence to examine how a Partial <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Test</b> Ban Treaty could be monitored.|$|E
5|$|Four {{operational}} missions {{with the}} D-21B took {{place under the}} codename of Senior Bowl. These were conducted over the People's Republic of China from 9 November 1969 to 20 March 1971 to spy on the Lop Nor <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> site. The USAF's 4200th Support Squadron, based at Beale Air Force Base, California, flew the missions, usually from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.|$|E
5|$|From June 1951 to May 1953, Hayward {{was head}} of the Military Applications Division of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he {{conducted}} atomic weapons laboratory work at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He also worked on the foundation of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory program in 1952 in close collaboration with Edward Teller. The culmination of this was working on the Ivy Mike <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1939, Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd wrote {{a letter}} to President Franklin D. Roosevelt warning him that the Germans might be researching the {{development}} of atomic weaponry and that it was necessary that the United States fund research and development of its own such project. Roosevelt agreed, and the result was the Manhattan Project—a top-secret research program administered by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. The first bomb was tested successfully in the Trinity <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> on July 16, 1945.|$|E
5|$|In May 1943, Bainbridge joined Robert Oppenheimer's Project Y at Los Alamos. He {{initially}} led E-2, the instrumentation group, {{which developed}} X-ray instrumentation for examining explosions. In March 1944, he became {{head of a}} new group, E-9, which was charged with conducting the first <b>nuclear</b> <b>test.</b> In Oppenheimer's sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory in August 1944, the E-9 Group became X-2.|$|E
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon testing is the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with <b>nuclear</b> <b>test</b> ban treaties, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Murphy {{established}} a systematic legal aid service for all courts, {{set up the}} Australian Law Reform Commission (and appointed Michael Kirby to be its inaugural chairman), the Australian Institute of Criminology and took the French Government to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to protest against its <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> in the Pacific. The French government conducted 41 atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>tests</b> at Mururoa after 1966, formally ceasing atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>testing</b> in 1974 {{as a result of}} public pressure facilitated by Murphy's ICJ case.|$|R
