50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are heavily}} used in {{automobile}} components such as rocker arm pivots, pumps, compressors, and transmissions. The drive shaft of a rear-wheel drive vehicle typically {{has at least}} eight <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> (four in each U joint) and often more if it is particularly long, or operates on steep slopes.|$|R
40|$|A <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearing</b> is {{a bearing}} which uses small {{cylindrical}} rollers. Bearings {{are used to}} reduce friction of any rotating surface. <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> have a large surface {{in contact with the}} bearing outer surfaces as compared to ball bearings. There is less added clearance(Diameter of the shaft and the diameter of the bearing are different) so they are much compact. The structure consists of a needle cage which contains the needle rollersthemselves and an outer race (The housing itself). Radial bearings are cylindrical and they use rollers parallel to the axis of the shaft. Radial pattern of needle are being used by thrust <b>needles.</b> Complement <b>bearings</b> have solid inner as well as outer rings and rib-guided cylindrical rollers. The bearings have the largest number of rolling elements and also have extremely high radial load carrying capacity and are suitable for compact designs. <b>Needle</b> roller <b>bearings</b> have relatively small diameter cylindrical rolling elements whose length is much larger than their diameter. As compared to other types of rolling <b>bearings,</b> <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearings</b> possess a small cross-sectional height and significant load-bearing capacity and rigidity relative to their volume. Also, because the inertial force acting on them is limited, <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> are an ideal choice for applications with oscillating motion. These bearings also work well in compact and lightweight machine designs and they serve as a ready replacement for sliding <b>bearings.</b> <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> features are great rigidity, smaller cross-section, higher loadcarrying capacity, and has lower inertia forces that facilitate to size and weight reductions in machinery. <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> are designed to stand in oscillation, performwell under any conditions, and interchange with the sliding of bearings...|$|R

50|$|A cam follower, {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> designed to follow cam lobe profiles. Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the cam follower mounts to its mating part; stud style cam followers use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|E
50|$|Engines for {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} an air compressor, to supply compressed air for the brakes. It is an air-cooled single-cylinder air-compressor driven by a belt. The air-intake is next to the engine intake manifold. The crankcase is not divided, the crankshaft is forged and has two ball bearings. The pushrod is housed in a <b>needle</b> <b>bearing,</b> the piston journal has a plain bearing pressed into the push rod bore. The piston has two piston rings and one oil control ring. Lubrication is done by a dry sump lubrication system, the compressor valves are poppet valves.|$|E

50|$|The {{person charged}} with {{drumming}} up new business during the Depression {{was a research}} engineer named Edmund K. Brown. He developed {{a new type of}} bearing for the company—a needle bearing—that eventually predicated the bulk of Torrington's business. On the heels of Brown's discovery came an important acquisition in 1935, when Torrington acquired the Bantam Ball Bearing Company. Brown's <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> and the addition of Bantam Ball Bearing signalled {{the beginning of a new}} era for Torrington, a future in which the production of bearings would fuel the company's growth and lift Torrington into the upper echelon of U.S. manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|By 1895, Wilhem His, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Leipzig, had {{published}} a three-dimensional reconstruction of Bach’s {{face from the}} skull based on his precise measurements of facial tissue depths of cadaver heads. To begin with, His collected tissue depth data by using a thin <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> a small rubber piece that would ride upward on the needle as it was pushed into the tissue of cadavers. The needle was placed {{at right angles to}} the bone and pressed into the tissue until its point touched the bone. The displacement of the rubber was measured and recorded for 15 specific locations on 24 male and four female suicide victims along with nine men who died of wasting illnesses.|$|E
5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin bore raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> in the clutch pressure plate, for smoother action. This <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|E
50|$|The <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearings</b> {{business}} {{was part of}} the broader Torrington acquisition Timken made in 2003.

50|$|As an {{autonomous}} subsidiary of Ingersoll-Rand, Torrington's second century began {{much as the}} first one had ended, with long-time Torrington officials presiding over the company's activities. New corporate headquarters were completed in 1970, marking {{the beginning of a}} decade that would see Torrington's financial performance sputter in the face of recessive economic conditions. Favorable developments {{came in the form of}} Torrington's involvement in the manufacture of steering column universal joints for the automotive industry and the continuing success of its <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> manufacturing business. Despite these developments, though, profits lagged throughout the decade, leading Ingersoll-Rand to exert its authority over Torrington for the first time by the decade's conclusion. Torrington's needle making business, an intrinsic and formative facet of the company's existence since its inception, was abandoned in 1980 after 114 years of contributing to the company's growth. Since the Ingersoll-Rand merger, Torrington's needle business had produced lackluster results and it was decided that both Torrington's and Ingersoll-Rand's future goals could best be accomplished without the business first launched by Migeon and Alvord.|$|E
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|E

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the engine failure was {{progressive}} in nature. Examination revealed constant rubbing of the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> cage with the rotor sleeve inner surface. Analysis shows that this was possible due to undersize of the bearing seating area on the eccentric shaft. The rubbing of the cage resulted in removal of the material from the rotor sleeve and thereby, making space for lateral movement of the shaft. The lateral movement of the shaft and the resultant induced vibration {{were responsible for the}} various damages seen on the engine components. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report with a few recommendations for preventing recurrence of similar failures...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Failed U-joint is {{the most}} common {{vehicles}} driveline problem. The entry of dirt and water, as well as grease leakage caused by improper lubrication and sealing lead to corrosion and wear of U-joint bearings. When signs of excessive wear occur U-joint lose operational ability. Investigations have shown that proper motion transmission between shafts and U-joint operational ability significantly depends on its dimensions. Therefore, it is necessary to replace failed U-joint by a new one or to repair it. The repair is restoring to worn elements their useful properties and elemental functions through reconstruction of shape and dimensions. But when does the U-joint is going to repair is the important thing to be determine. This paper gives the analysis to determine repair life of U-joint. This can be done by finding wear after certain revolution of rotation of <b>needle</b> <b>bearing...</b>|$|E

40|$|There was an {{incidence}} of failure in an indigenously developed 55 HP rotary engine during {{run on a}} test rig. The damaged components of the engine were subjected to detailed study for analyzing the cause of failure. Examination revealed that {{the failure of the}} <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> was the first in the chain of events. Following this, the shaft got misaligned leading to severe damages to various components and subsequent seizure in the engine. A comparative study carried out on the bearings of the failed engine and an imported engine suggests that the properties of the bearing used in the indigenously developed engine were not adequate for the application. It is recommended that a bearing similar to the imported one, capable of withstanding the load at the envisaged application temperature range be used to avoid recurrence of similar failure...|$|E

40|$|The two-axis joint is a {{mechanical}} device that provides two-degrees-of-freedom motion between connected components. A compact, moment-resistant, two-axis joint {{is used to}} connect an electromechanical actuator to its driven structural members. Due {{to the requirements of}} the overall mechanism, the joint has a low profile to fit within the allowable space, low friction, and high moment-reacting capability. The mechanical arrangement of this joint can withstand high moments when loads are applied. These features allow the joint to be used in tight spaces where a high load capability is required, as well as in applications where penetrating the mounting surface is not an option or where surface mounting is required. The joint consists of one base, one clevis, one cap, two <b>needle</b> <b>bearings,</b> and a circular shim. The base of the joint is the housing (the base and the cap together), and is connected to the grounding structure via fasteners and a bolt pattern. Captive within the housing, between the base and the cap, are the rotating clevis and the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings.</b> The clevis is attached to the mechanical system (linear actuator) via a pin. This pin, and the rotational movement of the clevis with respect to the housing, provides two rotational degrees of freedom. The larger diameter flange of the clevis is sandwiched between a pair of <b>needle</b> <b>bearings,</b> one {{on each side of the}} flange. During the assembly of the two-axis joint, the circular shims are used to adjust the amount of preload that is applied to the <b>needle</b> <b>bearings.</b> The above arrangement enables the joint to handle high moments with minimal friction. To achieve the high-moment capability within a low-profile joint, the use of depth of engagement (like that of a conventional rotating shaft) to react moment is replaced with planar engagement parallel to the mounting surface. The <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> with the clevis flange provide the surface area to react the clevis loads/moments into the joint housing while providing minimal friction during rotation. The diameter of the flange and the bearings can be increased to react higher loads and still maintain a compact surface mounting capability. This type of joint can be used in a wide variety of mechanisms and mechanical systems. It is especially effective where precise, smooth, continuous motion is required. For example, the joint can be used at the end of a linear actuator that is required to extend and rotate simultaneously. The current design application is for use in a spacecraft docking-system capture mechanism. Other applications might include industrial robotic or assembly line apparatuses, positioning systems, or in the motion-based simulator industry that employs complex, multi-axis manipulators for various types of motions...|$|R
