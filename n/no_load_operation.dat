30|$|Resonant {{converters}} are categorized {{into three}} basic topologies, {{depending on the}} manner by which resonant tank type the energy is extracted from. These are the series resonant converter (SRC), parallel resonant converter (PRC), and series-parallel converter (SPRC) [1, 6]. PRCs exhibit some desired features; easy output voltage regulation for above the resonance frequency operation at no load, less conduction losses, wide load variation (load insensitivity) and decreased ripple of the output voltage. Moreover, PRCs inherently ensure protection against short circuit conditions and have capability of <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>operation,</b> {{with the exception of}} near resonance frequencies. One major drawback of the PRC is that the output voltage of the converter is highly dependent on the load and therefore it can be increased to very high values under no load [4, 14]. Considering the facts mentioned above, PRCs seem {{to be one of the}} convenient topologies for battery charger applications.|$|E

The time histories of the one-third octave band frequency components of engine noise are also employed to identify the generation time of each noise response and its frequency characteristic. An approach for diagnosis of impact origins is carried out through vibration isolation and elimination of engine parts. Using these analysis techniques, the noise and vibration sources in a small air-cooled two-stroke cycle engine are clarified. As {{a result of these}} investigations, it was possible to obtain information about the generation times and frequency characteristics of radiated noise corresponding to each impact at any particular moment in a running engine.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} load {{control of a}} marine current energy {{converter}} using a vertical axis turbine mounted on a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The purpose of this thesis is to show the work done in the so far relatively uncharted territory of control systems for hydro kinetic energy conversion. The work is in its early stage and is meant {{to serve as a}} guide forfuture development of the control system. An experimental power station has been deployed and the first results are presented. A comparison between three load control methods has been made; a fixedAC load, a fixed pulse width modulated DC load and a DC bus voltage control of a DC load. Experimental results show that the DC bus voltage control reduces the variation of rotational speed with a factor of 3. 5. For all three cases, the tip speed ratio of the turbine can be kept close to the expected optimal tip speed ratio. However, for all three cases the average extracted power was significantly lower than the average power available in the turbine times the estimated maximum power coefficient. A maximum power point tracking system, with or without water velocity measurement, should increase the average extracted power. A simulation model has been validated using experimental data. The simulated system consists of the electrical system and a hydrodynamic vortex model for the turbine. Experiments of <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> were conducted to calibrate the drag losses of the turbine. Simulations were able to predict the behaviour in a step response for a change in tip speed ratio when the turbine was operated close to optimal tip speed ratio. The start position of the turbine was varied in the simulation to view the influence on the step response from a changed turbine position relative to the direction of the water flow.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, a Simulink model based on Matlab {{software}} {{is used to}} calculate the off-design running point for single shaft Centaur 40 power generation gas turbine engine.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{detailed}} study of how two error correction schemes affect the precision of shaft position estimation in state-observer techniques for sensorless control surface-mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM), variance correction and variable PI regulation. A novel sensorless estimation technique based on Linear Kalman Filter (LKF) through constant variance correction is proposed and compared with the conventional Flux Linkage Observer (FLO) method and other state-estimation sensorless control techniques namely, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), variable variance correction, Single Dimension Luenberger (SDL) observer and Full-Order Luenberger (FOLU) observer both through variable PI regulation. These five sensorless control techniques for PMSM are successfully implemented in the same lab-based hardware platform, i. e. full digital float-point-type DSP control inverter-fed PMSM system. Experiments are reported on each sensorless method covering position estimation, speed response, self-startup and load behaviour. Intensive analysis has also been carried out {{on the impact of}} error correction of estimated position on the steady/dynamic PMSM characteristics with different sensorless approaches. The experiment demonstrates that the novel Linear Kalman Filter can achieve the minimum average position estimation error throughout the electrical cycle of the five sensorless estimation techniques during <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> at rated speed and also makes PMSM capable of self-startup for any initial rotor position except the dead area. A speed response experiment for LKF shows that individual speed estimation can be extracted directly from LKF state estimation for sensorless control PMSM. Experiments on the five sensorless methods proves that position error correction scheme is the dominating factor for state estimation sensorless control PMSM and better dynamic/steady control performance can be achieved using a variance correction scheme applied in EKF/LKF than with variable PI regulation applied in SDL/FOLU. The thesis also concludes that the novel Linear Kalman Filter is an optimised cost-effective sensorless estimation method for the PMSM drive industry compared with classic and Flux Linkage observers/Extended Kalman Filters...|$|E

40|$|Diesel {{engines in}} {{generator}} configuration are normally optimized for operations at medium to high engine loads. It is suspected that <b>operations</b> at low <b>loads</b> may increase operational problems {{and thus the}} damage frequency. It is also suspected that negative effects off low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are aggravated by recent exhaust emission regulations issued by IMO. This thesis describes {{an investigation of the}} impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> on modern four-stroke diesel engines in generator configuration. The problem has been approached by reviewing existing literature, studying damage cases, analysis of existing finding data and by assessing engine manufacturers experiences with low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines are defined as engine operations below 40 % of maximum continuous rating. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> are typical for, but not limited to, offshore vessels with dynamic positioning systems. Low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> of diesel engines cause lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperature. Low temperature can lead to ignition problems and poor combustion which causes increased soot formation and aggregation of unburned fuel in the cylinder. Low cylinder pressure, soot and unburned fuel deteriorate the piston ring sealing efficiency allowing hot combustion gases, soot particles and unburned fuel to leak past the piston rings. This results in increased lubricating oil consumption and dilution. Fuel dilution of the lubricating oil reduces the viscosity which can collapse critical oil film thicknesses. This can cause premature wear of pistons, rings, liners and crank case bearings. The mechanisms of low load lead to a cycle of degradation which means that diesel engines that run at low loads {{for longer periods of time}} can become irreversibly damaged. This is illustrated in this paper by an engine damage case. The damage case presents an engine crankcase breakage initially caused by piston scuffing from lubrication oil breakdown after excessive low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Most modern diesel engines operate at lower cylinder pressure and thus lower temperatures to comply with stringent IMO NOX emission requirements. The IMO Tier I and II standards are met by primary measures which aim at reducing the amount of NOX formed during combustion by optimizing certain engine parameters. Modern NOX optimized engines are more exposed to low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> than their predecessors due to initially lower cylinder pressures and temperatures. However, recent developments such as common rail, variable injection timing and variable valve control permit engine <b>operations</b> at lower <b>loads</b> than earlier. Existing finding data from DNV GL s database have been analysed to determine whether one can substantiate the impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> quantitatively. The finding data have been analysed by simple frequency measurements. The results show higher finding frequencies for DP-vessels than non-DP vessels, which could indicate that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> may have a negative impact on the operational problems and thus the damage frequency. The finding data have also been evaluated with respect to time to determine whether NOX optimization aggravates the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> The result showed generally higher finding frequencies for engines installed after 2000 than the ones installed prior to 2000. This could indicate that the introduction of Tier I compliant engines have increased operational problems. However, it could not be determined whether NOX optimized engines have aggravated the negative impacts of low <b>load</b> <b>operations.</b> Engine manufacturers that have been interviewed agree that low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> affect the engine operation negatively, but they do not want confirm that low <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> increases the engine damage frequency. It is consensus among the engine manufacturers that the engines must be loaded to at least 50 % of rated power regularly during low <b>load</b> <b>operations</b> to prevent operational problems. The time interval and load requirements can vary from one engine to another and depending on the engine design...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the type}} of {{ancillary}} service provisioned, operation mode of a power plant may change to part <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> In this contribution, part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> is understood as delivering a lower power output than possible at given ambient temperature because of gas turbine power output control. If it is economically justified, a power plant may operate in the part load mode for longer time. Part load performance of a newly built 80 √Ç¬†MW combined cycle in Slovakia was studied in order to assess the possibilities for fuel savings. Based on online monitoring data three possibilities were identified: condensate preheating by activation of the currently idle hot water section; change in steam condensing pressure regulation strategy; and the most important gas turbine inlet air preheating. It may seem to be in contradiction with the well proven concept of gas turbine inlet air cooling, which has however been developed for boosting the gas turbine cycles in full <b>load</b> <b>operation.</b> On the contrary, in a combined cycle in the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> mode, elevated inlet air temperature does not affect the part <b>load</b> <b>operation</b> of gas turbines but it causes more high pressure steam to be raised in HRSG, which leads to higher steam turbine power output. As a result, less fuel needs to be combusted in gas turbines in order to achieve the requested combined cycle's power output. By simultaneous application of all three proposals, more than a 2 % decrease in the power plant's natural gas consumption can be achieved with only minor capital expenses needed.
