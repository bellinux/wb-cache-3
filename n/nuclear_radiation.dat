25|$|Excluding {{contained}} {{waste and}} unintentional releases from nuclear plants, coal-plants carry more radioactive wastes {{into the environment}} than nuclear plants per unit of produced energy. Plant-emitted radiation carried by coal-derived fly ash delivers 100 times more radiation to the surrounding environment than does the normal operation of a similarly productive nuclear plant. This comparison does not consider {{the rest of the}} fuel cycle, i.e., coal and uranium mining and refining and waste disposal. The operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>radiation</b> dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E
25|$|A {{screening}} {{program a}} year later in 2012 {{found that more than}} a third (36%) of children in Fukushima Prefecture have abnormal growths in their thyroid glands.

25|$|Coal is {{the most}} {{abundant}} fossil fuel on the planet, and widely used {{as the source of}} energy in thermal power stations. It is a relatively cheap fuel, with some of the largest deposits in regions that are stable politically, such as China, India and the United States. This contrasts with natural gas, the largest deposits of which are located in Russia, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan and the US. Solid coal cannot directly replace natural gas or petroleum in most applications, petroleum is mostly used for transportation and the natural gas not used for electricity generation is used for space, water and industrial heating. Coal can be converted to gas or liquid fuel, but the efficiencies and economics of such processes can make them unfeasible. Vehicles or heaters may require modification to use coal-derived fuels. Coal is an impure fuel and produces more greenhouse gas and pollution than an equivalent amount of petroleum or natural gas. For instance, the operation of a 1000-MWe coal-fired power plant results in a <b>nuclear</b> <b>radiation</b> dose of 490 person-rem/year, compared to 136 person-rem/year, for an equivalent nuclear power plant including uranium mining, reactor operation and waste disposal.|$|E
500|$|Accurate {{casualty}} {{figures are}} impossible to determine, because many victims were cremated by the firestorm, along with all record of their existence.

500|$|Although the Able bomb missed its target, Nevada, {{by nearly}} half a mile, and it failed to sink or to {{contaminate}} the battleship, a crew would not have survived. Goat #119, tethered inside a gun turret and shielded by armor plate, received enough fireball radiation to die four days later of radiation sickness having survived two days longer than goat #53, which was on the deck, unshielded. Had Nevada [...] been fully manned, she would likely have become a floating coffin, {{dead in the water}} for lack of a live crew. She was later finished off by an aerial torpedo. In theory, every unprotected location on the ship received 10,000 rems (100 Sv) of initial <b>nuclear</b> <b>radiation</b> from the fireball. Therefore, people deep enough inside the ship to experience a 90% radiation reduction would still have received a lethal dose of 1,000 rems. In the assessment of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, [...] "a large ship, about a mile away from the explosion, would escape sinking, but the crew would be killed by the deadly burst of radiations from the bomb, and only a ghost ship would remain, floating unattended in the vast waters of the ocean." ...|$|E

2500|$|Subsequently, {{lawyers for}} 2000 {{residents}} asked epidemiologist Stephen Wing of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, {{a specialist in}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, to re-examine the Columbia study. Wing was reluctant to get involved, later writing that [...] "allegations of high radiation doses at TMI were considered by mainstream radiation scientists to be a product of radiation phobia or efforts to extort money from a blameless industry." [...] Wing later noted {{that in order to}} obtain the relevant data, the Columbia study had to submit to what Wing called [...] "a manipulation of research" [...] {{in the form of a}} court order which prohibited [...] "upper limit or worst case estimates of releases of radioactivity or population doses... such estimates would lead to a mathematical projection of less than 0.01 health effects." [...] Wing found cancer rates raised within a 10-mile radius two years after the accident by 0.034% +/- 0.013%, 0.103% +/- 0.035%, and 0.139% +/- 0.073% for all cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, respectively. An exchange of published responses between Wing and the Columbia team followed. Wing later noted a range of studies showing latency periods for cancer from radiation exposure between 1 and 5 years due to immune system suppression. Latencies between 1 and 9 years have been studied in a variety of contexts ranging from the Hiroshima survivors and the fallout from Chernobyl to therapeutic radiation; a 5-10 year latency is most common.|$|E

2500|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are tar components produced by pyrolysis in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke. [...] Several of these PAH's are already toxic in their normal form, however, many of then can become more toxic to the liver. Due to the hydrophobic nature of PAH's {{they do not}} dissolve in water and are hard to expel from the body. [...] In {{order to make the}} PAH more soluble in water, the liver creates an enzyme called Cytochrome P450 which adds an additional oxygen to the PAH, turning it into a mutagenic epoxides, which is more soluble, but also more reactive. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell, a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenicity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing <b>nuclear</b> <b>radiation.</b> Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustion less vaporizer technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes. Although such products have become increasingly popular, they still represent a very small fraction of the market, and no conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove the positive health claims.|$|E
2500|$|The Day After (1983) was a [...] "made for TV" [...] {{movie that}} became fodder for {{talk shows and}} {{commentary}} by politicians at the time due to its depiction of the runup to a nuclear war between the US and the Soviets with graphic explosions on American soil, {{the aftermath of the}} attack and alleged political causes.

Countdown to Looking Glass, (1984) a 'docudrama,' shows an international incident, the breakdown in diplomacy, the escalation in international tensions leading up to a nuclear crisis, the breakout of ground and naval combat overseas, and ends with the president taking off in the airborne E-4 command post ("Looking Glass") and the activation of the Emergency Broadcast System and air raid sirens. [...] Manhattan Project (1986), is not about the actual The Manhattan Project but how, using stolen plutonium, a high school student builds an atomic bomb for a science class project. Threads (BBC TV production made 1984, shown 1985), based on British government exercise Square Leg, shows the effects of an all-out nuclear war on the town of Sheffield, England, UK.

Broken Arrow (1996) depicts the theft of two thermonuclear weapons by a rogue US bomber pilot.
