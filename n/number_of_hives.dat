2500|$|In summer 1841 Selwyn was {{appointed}} {{to be the first}} Anglican Bishop of New Zealand and Cotton offered to go with him as his chaplain. [...] This decision met with disapproval from Cotton's father who said [...] "You are not missionary material". [...] Cotton did have some of the practical skills which would be valuable; he could use various tools, including a lathe, ride a horse, and row and sail boats. [...] The Tomatin sailed from London for Plymouth Sound without its clerical cargo who went overland to Plymouth before eventually boarding the ship there. Cotton had loaded some hives of bees aboard but had not packed them securely within a hogshead as planned in My Bee Book. Delayed in the English Channel by contrary winds the bee hives were so thrown about aboard the Tomatin that they were jettisoned overboard in Plymouth Sound in Cotton's absence. The missionary party of 23 members set sail from Plymouth late on 26 December 1841 on board the barque Tomatin. [...] On the ship, in addition to their luggage, were various animals and possibly, an unknown <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> of bees. [...] Cotton's letter dated 30 December 1841, passed to a homeward bound brig on 21 January, stated the bees were safe. However, given the short time available from the Tomatin's arrival in Plymouth Sound on 19 December, the daily hope that contrary winds would abate so they could sail [...] "on the morrow," [...] and the party boarding on 23 December, there's little likelihood he had the time to organize a replacement lot of bees. Either way, the fate of the bees is unknown, they did not survive the trip to Sydney. [...] Also on board was a Māori boy who taught many of the passengers, including Cotton, to speak the Māori language. [...] In April 1842 the Tomatin arrived in Sydney. [...] The boat was damaged by a rock on entering their landing place and, rather than wait for its repair, some of the party, including Selwyn and Cotton, set sail for New Zealand on the brig Bristolian on 19 May. They arrived in Auckland on 30 May. [...] After spending some time as guests of Captain William Hobson, the first Governor of New Zealand, Selwyn and Cotton set sail for the Bay of Islands on the schooner Wave on 12 June, arriving on 20 June. Amongst the party was a clerk, William Bambridge, who was an accomplished artist and was later to become photographer to Queen Victoria.|$|E

50|$|Some crops, {{especially}} when planted in a monoculture situation, require {{a very high}} level of pollinators to produce economically viable crops. This may be because of lack of attractiveness of the blossoms, or from trying to pollinate with an alternative when the native pollinator is extinct or rare. These include crops such as alfalfa, cranberries, and kiwifruit. This technique is known as saturation pollination. In many such cases, various native bees are vastly more efficient at pollination (e.g., with blueberries), but the inefficiency of the honey bees is compensated for by using large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives,</b> the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> foragers thereby far exceeding the local abundance of native pollinators. In a very few cases, it has been possible to develop commercially viable pollination techniques that use the more efficient pollinators, rather than continued reliance on honey bees, as in the management of the alfalfa leafcutter bee.|$|R

The model includes the following elements to characterize the artificial feeding scenario: a function to model the preference of the bees for natural food over artificial food; parameters to quantify the quality and palatability of artificial diets; a function to account for the efficiency of the foragers in gathering food under different environmental conditions; and a function to represent different approaches used by the beekeeper to feed the hive with artificial food. Simulated results are presented to illustrate the main characteristics of the model and its behavior under different scenarios. The model results are validated with experimental data from the literature involving four different artificial diets. A good match between simulated and experimental results was achieved...|$|R

50|$|The common {{agents of}} disease that affect adult honey bees include fungi, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, parasites, and poisons. The gross {{symptoms}} displayed by affected adult bees are very similar, whatever the cause, {{making it difficult}} for the apiarist to ascertain the causes of problems without microscopic identification of microorganisms or chemical analysis of poisons. Since 2006 colony losses from Colony Collapse Disorder have been increasing across the world although the causes of the syndrome are, as yet, unknown. In the US, commercial beekeepers have been increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> to deal with higher rates attrition.|$|E
50|$|The US Department of Agriculture {{recommends}} using {{at least}} one beehive per acre (4,000 m2 per hive) for pollination of conventional, seeded varieties for commercial plantings. Seedless hybrids have sterile pollen. This requires planting pollinizer rows of varieties with viable pollen. Since the supply of viable pollen is reduced and pollination is much more critical in producing the seedless variety, the recommended <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> per acre (pollinator density) increases to three hives per acre (1,300 m2 per hive). Watermelons have a longer growing period than other melons, and can often take 85 days or more {{from the time of}} transplanting for the fruit to mature.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the nectar and pollen {{sources in}} a given area, the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> that can be placed in one apiary can vary. If too many hives are placed into an apiary, the hives {{compete with each other}} for scarce resources. This can lead to lower honey and pollen yields, higher {{transmission}} of disease and robbing. The maximum size of a permanent apiary or bee yard may depend on the type of bee as well. Some honey bee species or races fly farther than others. A circle around an apiary with a three-mile (5 km) foraging radius covers 28 sq mi. A good rule of thumb is to have no more than 25-35 hives in a permanent apiary, although migrating beekeepers may temporarily place one hundred hives into a location with a good nectar flow.|$|E

50|$|The {{blossoms}} of most California Almond varieties are self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with other varieties {{to produce a}} crop. The single most important factor determining a good yield is pollination during the bloom period. More than a million colonies of honey bees are placed in California Almond orchards {{at the beginning of}} the bloom period to pollinate the crop. California beekeepers alone cannot supply this critical need, which is why honey bees travel across the country to the San Joaqin Valley each year. Although the recommended <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> per acre is 2 to 3, due to the high demand in conjunction with the reduced availability of commercial beehives, many almond growers have to make do with a lower hive density during pollination. These growers started using semiochemical formulations, like SPLAT Bloom, to compensate for the low hive density. SPLAT Bloom manipulates the behavior of the bees, inciting them to spend more time foraging, and thus pollinating flowers in entire the almond orchard (increasing pollination and fruit set), not only close to the hive.|$|E
50|$|Like apples, pears are self-incompatible {{and need}} to attract insects {{in order to be}} pollinated and produce fruit. One notable {{difference}} from apples is that pear blossoms are much less attractive to bees due to their pale coloring and light odor. Bees may abandon the pear blossoms to visit dandelions or a nearby apple orchard. The majority of pollinators of pear trees are honey bees, although pears are also visited by blow flies and hoverflies. A way to combat the low attraction of honey bees to pear blossoms is to use bee attractants to entice the bees to pollinate the flowers. Bee attractants may include pheromones that mimic the brood pheromone or the juvenile pheromone, or other attractants. There are also other methods for attracting honey bees to pear blossoms. One is saturation pollination, that is to stock so many bees that all area blossoms are worked regardless of the attractiveness to the bees. Another method is to delay the movement of the beehives into the orchards until there is about 30 percent bloom. The bees are moved into the orchard during the night and will usually visit the pear blossoms for a few hours until they discover the richer nectar sources. The recommended <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> per acre is one.|$|E

40|$|Pollination is a {{critical}} ecosystem service affected by various drivers of land-use change, such as policies and programs aimed at land resources, market values for crop commodities, local land-management decisions, and shifts in climate. The United States is the world's most active market for pollination services by honey bees, and the Northern Great Plains provide the majority of bee colonies used to meet the Nation's annual pollination needs. Legislation requiring increased production of biofuel crops, increasing commodity prices for crops of little nutritional value for bees in the Northern Great Plains, and reductions in government programs aimed at promoting land conservation are converging to alter the regional landscape in ways that challenge beekeepers to provide adequate <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> for national pollination services. We developed a spatially explicit model that identifies sites {{with the potential to}} support large apiaries based on local-scale land-cover requirements for honey bees. We produced maps of potential apiary locations for North Dakota, a leading producer of honey, based on land-cover maps representing (1) an annual time series compiled from existing operational products and (2) a realistic scenario of land change. We found that existing land-cover products lack sufficient local accuracy to monitor actual changes in landscape suitability for honey bees, but our model proved informative for evaluating effects on suitability under scenarios of land change. The scenario we implemented was aligned with current drivers of land-use change in the Northern Great Plains and highlighted the importance of conservation lands in landscapes intensively and extensively managed for crops...|$|R

A total of 39 beekeepers were investigated through both interviews and a structure questionnaire. The main results were as followed : - Beekeepers are still essentially male (97. 0 %) aged 18 to 58 {{with an average of}} 38 years old. All of them are educated. Many beekeepers (52. 0 %) have received training with at least 5 years experience in beekeeping. The purpose of the activity is to improve household income. - The average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> per beekeeper is 42 varying from 2 to 300. Improved hives are used by 43. 3 % of the beekeepers, but traditional types of hive are still more frequently used. - Colonisation of hives is based only on capturing of natural swam between September and March, the most favourable period of the year for this region, using different types ofbait, wax being the most frequently used. Hive colonisation rate is relatively low (64. 4 %), being higher for traditional hives compared to improved ones (78. 5 and 43. 3 % respectively). - Honey, the major hive product exploited is harvested once a year (from March to July) with an average of 6 to 10 liters of honey per colony and per year. The gain is estimated to 10 500 - 10 750 and 18 750 - 19 000 FCFA per hive and per year respectively for traditional and improved hives.
