25|$|One {{rationale}} {{given for}} extensive ethanol {{production in the}} U.S. is its benefit to energy security, by shifting the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> foreign-produced oil to domestically produced energy sources. Production of ethanol requires significant energy, but current U.S. production derives most of that energy from coal, natural gas and other sources, rather than oil. Because 66% of oil consumed in the U.S. is imported, compared to a net surplus of coal and just 16% of natural gas (figures from 2006), the displacement of oil-based fuels to ethanol produces a net shift from foreign to domestic U.S. energy sources.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Sir William Hotham {{described}} Young {{during his}} time at the Admiralty as being ‘diligent in application, clear in method and generally informed’. Young's biographer, P. K. Crimmin described his command of the Dutch blockade as being 'well performed and praiseworthy', while describing him as a 'conventional upholder and representative of the existing naval social order, though aware of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reform and having some sympathy with seamen's grievances.' His opposition to Cochrane's radicalism and insubordinate attitude to superior officers led to him being harshly criticised by Cochrane's admirers, such as Captain Frederick Marryat, who included him in his novel Frank Mildmay as 'Sir Hurricane Humbug'. Sir William Hotham instead declared that his manners 'tho' rather formal and cold, were those of a perfect gentleman, while he had the most punctilious sense of integrity'.|$|E
25|$|Graduate {{education}} is a particularly important aspect in BME. While many engineering fields (such as mechanical or electrical engineering) do not need graduate-level training to obtain an entry-level job in their field, the majority of BME positions do prefer or even require them. Since most BME-related professions involve scientific research, such as in pharmaceutical and medical device development, graduate {{education is}} almost a requirement (as undergraduate degrees typically do not involve sufficient research training and experience). This can be either a Masters or Doctoral level degree; while in certain specialties a Ph.D. is notably more common than in others, it is hardly ever the majority (except in academia). In fact, the perceived <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> kind of graduate credential {{is so strong that}} some undergraduate BME programs will actively discourage students from majoring in BME without an expressed intention to also obtain a master's degree or apply to medical school afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Jagdwaffe defences of Germany {{were not}} {{considered}} {{a part of the}} offensive air effort. The German strategy of focusing on offensive aviation to achieve superiority on the enemy, on the home front the force was considered second-rate and unimportant. It did not receive the investment it needed and was too weak in respect of other Luftwaffe arms for proper expansion after the start of hostilities. As a consequence, the force had no representation in the High Command. The organisation remained split under different Air Fleets and was not put under a unified command. When the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> sort of air defence was recognised before the outbreak of war, the rush to build the Jagdwaffe was so fast that quality in cohesion and organisation suffered. The expansion, when it did come, came too late. Only nine Jagdgeschwader were in existence in 1939, and no new Geschwader (Wings) were created until 1942. The years 1940 and 1941 were wasted. Only eight were created for defence duties, and the force increased in size by only one-third. The growth of the force and its concepts owed much to the activity of its enemies. The planning of defence was always reactive.|$|E

40|$|We {{determine}} tight bounds on the smallest-size integer grid {{needed to}} represent the n-node intersection graphs of a convex polygon P with P given in rational coordinates. The intersection graphs use only polygons that are geometrically similar to P (translates or homothets) and must be represented such that each corner of each polygon lies on a point of the grid. We show the following generic results: if P is a parallelogram and only translates of P are used, then an Ω(n 2) × Ω(n 2) grid is sufficient and is <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> graphs; if P is any other convex polygon and only translates of P are used, then a 2 Ω(n) × 2 Ω(n) grid is sufficient and is <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> graphs; if P is any convex polygon and arbitrary homothets of P are allowed, then a 2 Ω(n) × 2 Ω(n) grid is sufficient and is <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> graphs. The results substantially improve earlier bounds and settle the complexity of representing convex polygon intersection graphs. The results also imply small polynomial certificates for the recognition problem for all graph classes considered...|$|R

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to complete the}} railway through to Boden sparked interest in Norrbotten {{among the members of}} the Swedish General Staff, and the chief, Axel Rappe, conducted a survey trip to the region in 1887. His report mentioned the changed strategic options due to the railway lines {{on both sides of the}} Gulf and a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> kind of fortification in Boden, but he also toned down the earlier thoughts on the Russian interest in the Luleå–Narvik line. Rappe's report directly affected the future stretch of the railway line in Norrbotten. His recommendations, largely based on his and the General Staff's military planning, not to build the line along the coast, or build it all the way to the Swedish-Finnish border at Haparanda were later followed. The subsequent report completed in 1890 by the Neutrality Committee of 1888 (...) with Axel Rappe as one of its memberssuggested that a credible neutrality required an increased defence of the north-eastern border and proposed a budget of 1.3 million Swedish kronor, corresponding in today's money to around US$11 million (as of 2011), for the construction of permanent fortifications in Boden.|$|E
500|$|Woolverton created Belle {{as part of}} [...] "her self-directed {{mandate to}} move women and girls forward." [...] The Express-Times {{described}} the character as an intelligent young woman who [...] "sings songs about reading and wanting to gain knowledge, rather than falling in love." [...] Woolverton credits Belle's knowledge and love of books with providing the character with a [...] "point of view {{of her life and}} that doesn't necessarily involve a man getting her there." [...] One of the film's main themes, Belle is considered an outsider because her love of reading provides her with knowledge of the outside world as opposed to her [...] "narrow-minded" [...] village peers. Writing for Wired.com, Matt Blum dubbed Belle [...] "the geekiest heroine of any Disney animated film", exemplified by an opening number that demonstrates just how much she does not fit in with her peers due to her intelligence and active imagination. Similarly, Boxoffices Amy Nicholson coined the character [...] "Disney's Smartest Heroine," [...] while Rob Burch of The Hollywood News observed that the character [...] "comes across as arrogant at times" [...] because she [...] "spends much of the first act complaining." [...] In her book Sex, Love and Abuse: Discourses on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, author Sharon Hayes described Belle as [...] "the quintessential beautiful young ingenue." [...] Comparing Belle's personality to that of the princess in the Brothers Grimm's fairy tale [...] "The Frog Prince", The Meanings of [...] "Beauty and the Beast": A Handbook author Jerry Griswold described the character as a similarly [...] "feisty and outspoken" [...] heroine. Writing for St. Francis Xavier University, Dawn Elizabeth England observed that Belle possesses equally as many traditionally feminine as she does masculine traits, citing her bravery, independence and assertiveness as masculine, and her sensitivity and fearfulness as feminine. According to Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era author Susan Jeffords, [...] "Belle's credentials as heroine are established ... when she {{is the only one of}} the town's single women not to swoon over Gaston," [...] while the character's love of reading is essentially manipulated [...] "to mark her as better than the rest of the townspeople." [...] Writing for The Statesman, David O'Connor cited Belle's intelligence and bibliophilia as [...] "in stark opposition to the insensitive and significantly dim-witted Gaston." [...] Critics continue to debate over whether Belle or the Beast is the film's protagonist. Susan Jeffords, author of Hard Bodies: Hollywood Masculinity in the Reagan Era, felt that although Belle appears to be the protagonist in Beaumont's original fairy tale, the character becomes [...] "less the focus of the narrative" [...] in Disney's adaptation and more of a [...] "mechanism for solving the Beast's 'dilemma'." [...] In her article [...] "The Tangled Evolution of the Disney Princess", Noelle Buffam felt that Belle arrived just in time when Disney's heroines were [...] "in a dire <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> change," [...] awarding her [...] "the red stamp of approval" [...] for her intelligence and spirit.|$|E
