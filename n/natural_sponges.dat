50|$|To assure proper {{contact between}} the inmate's head and the electrode, a saline-soaked sponge stuffed between the two was necessary. In the Tafero incident, a <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> was {{replaced}} with a synthetic sponge that caught fire during the execution. In the Medina incident, prison officials apparently did not properly soak the sponge in saline and it caught fire as well. Photographs that surfaced after Davis's execution clearly showed that his nose had been severely compressed by a misfitted head strap.|$|R
50|$|A generous {{amount of}} powder {{is needed to}} reduce {{unwanted}} shine. If a performer’s makeup is under-powdered, his skin oils will break through quickly, producing shine and possibly running. After powder {{is applied to the}} entire face, starting under and around the eyes, it is gently pressed for thirty seconds. The excess is brushed off with a large soft brush or piece of cotton. A wet <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> or cotton is wiped lightly across the face to set the makeup, to remove any visible powder, and to eliminate the masky feeling.|$|R
40|$|Geometrical {{restrictions}} of incoherent water transport in different aggregated particle systems {{and in a}} <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> were studied using an NMR field gradient technique. Two series of experiments were carried out. First, the temperature and concentration dependences of the water diffusion coefficient were measured in aqueous systems of bovine serum albumin and gelatin {{above and below the}} bulk-water freezing temperature. The concentrations ranged from dilute solutions to almost dry powders being only partly hydrated. The diffusion coefficient within clusters of overlapping hydration shells is reduced by one order of magnitude compared with that of bulk water. Geometrical restrictions manifest themselves (a) by the obstruction effect observed at high water concentrations, (b) by the topologically two-dimensional diffusion in the network of overlapping hydration shells, and (c) by the percolation threshold appearing at about 15 %b. w. water. The second series of experiments indicated geometrical restrictions {{in the sense that the}} transport behaviour in some special systems turned out to be anomalous. Hydrated protein aerogels were produced by means of a lyophilization/rehydration procedure. For comparison, hydrated silica fine- particles having a similar diameter as the proteins were investigated in addition. In both cases, the spin-echo decays by diffusion suggest anomalous behaviour. The same conclusion was drawn for water percolating through the pores of a <b>natural</b> <b>sponge,</b> i. e. for an incoherent flow process...|$|R

40|$|Marine sponges are {{potential}} sources of many unique metabolites, including cytotoxic and anticancer compounds. <b>Natural</b> <b>sponge</b> populations are insufficient or inaccessible for producing commercial quantities of metabolites of interest. This review focuses on methods of producing sponge biomass to overcome supply limitations. Production techniques discussed include aquaculture in the sea, the controlled environments of aquariums, and culture of sponge cells and primmorphs. Culti-vation in the sea and aquariums are currently the only practicable and relatively inexpensive methods of producing significant quantities of sponge biomass. In the future, metabolite production from cultured sponge cells and primmorphs may become feasible. Obtaining a consistent biomass yield in aquariums requires attention to many factors that are discussed in this work...|$|R

5000|$|The {{creation}} of the industrial area of Porto Marghera, which lies immediately behind Venice, amplified the effects of high waters for two reasons: first, the land upon which the area is built was created by filling {{large parts of the}} lagoon where smaller islands just above sea level previously lay.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>sponge</b> fibre (Acanthus montanus) {{was used}} as {{reinforcement}} for ceiling materials in this research work. This fibre, being fairly strong and stiff as well as cheap and plentiful with low energy demand during manufacture, are strong contenders for the reinforcement of cement-based materials. The fibre, whose mass fraction was the variable in this work, was cut down into smaller sizes and mixed with pulverised waste paper, cement and water. The resulting slurry was then poured into rectangular moulds which were compacted until the excess water was expelled and resulting composites became hard. Demoulded samples were left to cure in the open laboratory air for 28 days. Flexural and water absorptivity tests were carried out on the various samples which showed that reinforcement and best mechanical properties were obtained at optimum fibre mass fraction of 4 % {{when compared with the}} brittle matrix in the absence of reinforcement. These tests confirmed the possible use of sponge fibres as reinforcement in cement matrices for ceiling purposes...|$|R
40|$|Pulverised stem fibres of the <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> plant, SP, (Acanthus montanus) and {{stranded}} coconut fibre, CF, (Cocos nucifera) {{from the}} coir tree {{were used as}} reinforcements for thin cement sheets in this research work. The mixture of cement and pulverised waste paper, which formed the matrix, was maintained constant while the fibre mass concentration of both fibres were varied. The slurry formed by adding water to the mixture of the matrix materials and the reinforcement fibres, was poured into rectangular mould and consequently pressed to eject excess water. De-moulded samples were allowed to cure in the laboratory for twenty-eight days before flexural and compressive tests were carried out. The analysis of the experimental results established that sample coded as S 4, with 30 % CF and 70 % SP, showed the most promising result. This implied that particulate reinforcement in cement matrix composite contributed to higher and improved flexural load bearing capacity and ductility when utilised in a higher proportion than long fibres...|$|R
5000|$|It is not {{permitted}} to celebrate the Eucharist without an antimins. The antimins is kept in {{the centre of the}} Holy Table (altar) and is unfolded only during the Divine Liturgy, before the Anaphora. At the end of the Liturgy, the antimins is folded in thirds, and then in thirds again, so that when it is unfolded the creases form a cross (see photo, right). When folded, the antimins sits in the centre of another, slightly larger cloth called the eileton (Greek: Slavonic: Ilitón) - similar to the Western corporal, except it is usually red in colour - which is then folded around it in the same manner (3 x 3), encasing it completely. A flattened <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> is also kept inside the antimins, which is used to collect any crumbs which might fall onto the Holy Table. When the antimins and eileton are folded, the Gospel Book is laid on top of them.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} <b>natural</b> <b>sponges</b> is fixed upon a {{terracotta}} basin or concolina {{and held in}} place with a wooden bar laid across the rim. The dried peel is folded and pressed against the sponges several times in a circular motion, causing a mixture of essential oil and peel liquids to pass into the concolina. After finishing with the peel, the sponges are squeezed to recover additional oil and liquids. Finally, the oil is decanted away from the heavier watery phase, which contains detritus from breaking the peel.|$|E

5000|$|Abrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, {{as well as}} {{physical}} objects. Loofahs, microfiber cloths, <b>natural</b> <b>sponges,</b> or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as microbeads, sea salt, sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.|$|E
40|$|Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of {{endogenous}} noncoding RNA receiving increasing attention.

40|$|A simple {{synthetic}} {{approach was}} developed to transform ordinary polypropylene tubes into high-surface, protein-retaining plastics. The inner surface of native tubes was activated by incubation with aqueous persulfate. Infrared spectroscopic analyses of plastics treated in this fashion revealed significant amounts of carboxylic acids, ketones and alcohol groups as products. Concomitant to activation, a transformed surface was yielded, which displayed a meso-structured, high-area topology. The topology, reminiscent to the appearance of <b>natural</b> <b>sponge,</b> {{appeared to have been}} caused by an oxidation-induced phase separation. The enhanced chemical reactivity of oxidized surface-pendent functional groups greatly facilitated re-engineering of surface physico-chemical traits. The oxidized surfaces were treated with the hydrolysis products of aminopropyltriethoxysilane, and ninhydrin or glutaraldehyde, affording the corresponding amino and aldehyde surface derivatives. The performance of each tailored surface was assessed by the extent to which albumin could be loaded and retained following several washings. The results of the immobilization study indicated that appropriately engineered mesoscale topologies could greatly improve the retention of noncovalently adhered proteins. A model is proposed to rationalize the contribution of the mesostructure to protein binding...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. Silicon is the second most common element on the Earth's crust and its oxide (SiO(2)) the most abundant mineral. Silica and silicates are widely used in medicine and industry as well as in micro- and nano-optics and electronics. However, the fabrication of glass fibres and components requires high temperature and non-physiological conditions, in contrast to biosilica structures in animals and plants. Here, we show for the first time the use of recombinant silicatein-α, the most abundant subunit of sponge proteins catalyzing biosilicification reactions, to direct the formation of optical waveguides in-vitro through soft microlithography. The artificial biosilica fibres mimic the <b>natural</b> <b>sponge</b> spicules, exhibiting refractive index values suitable for confinement of light within waveguides, with optical losses in the range of 5 - 10 cm(- 1), suitable for application in lab-on-chips systems. This method extends biosilicification to the controlled fabrication of optical components by physiological processing conditions, hardly addressed by conventional technologies.

5000|$|Typical ProduceBergamotto di Reggio Calabria (PDO)Bergamot {{essential}} oil {{is produced in}} the thin coastal strip that stretches between Villa San Giovanni and Gioiosa Jonica, between the Ionian and the Tyrrhenian Sea, and includes a number of towns {{in the province of}} Reggio Calabria, Bergamot name derives from the Turkish [...] "Beg-armudi," [...] but of the Lord, for his resemblance to the PEAR bergamot. The origin of the citrus is uncertain: many argue that derives from mutation to another citrus species; others believe it was imported from the Canary Islands by Christopher Columbus; However, the most suitable and unique habitat for its cultivation, the only place where fruit well, is the province of Reggio Calabria. The first bergamotteto was implanted near the town in 1750.

50|$|The erotic {{connotations of}} Nuage articulé, with its {{umbrella}} covered with <b>natural</b> <b>sponges,</b> embodied a dynamic sense of contradiction: bloom with stalk; sponge as symbol of nature, as a feminine utensil, which touched and cleaned naked female skin; umbrella as a masculine symbol {{of order and}} protection from natural forces. It thus became widely recognized among the Surrealists and their growing public. Geo Dupin, Paalen´s sister-in-law, remembered that Alfred H. Barr, Jr. had been extremely taken with Paalen's object and had chosen not to buy it, for the Museum of Modern Art in New York, only {{because it was too}} fragile and difficult to transport. Nuage articulé was published later in a more political context in the Surrealist magazine London Bulletin, together with a text by André Breton translated by Samuel Beckett with acomment that the sponge-umbrella would bring to mind another, sadly prominent, umbrella-that of Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference and the failure of the British policy of appeasement.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{suitable}} scaffolds onto {{which human}} stem cells can be seeded to generate functional three-dimensional tissues {{is a major}} research goal. A <b>natural</b> marine <b>sponge</b> skeleton was selected as a potential scaffold {{on the basis of}} the hydration potential of the fiber, the presence of open interconnected channels created by the fiber network, the collagenous composition of the fiber, and the structural diversity of fiber architecture. The skeleton of an undetermined species of Spongia (Class Demospongiae: Order Dictyoceratida: Family Spongiidae), composed of spongin, supported growth of human osteoprogenitor cells. Cell attachment and invasion into the framework were observed within 16 h, followed by development into membranous sheets between the sponge fibers by concentric infilling. Histochemical staining for alkaline phosphatase and type I collagen indicated formation of bone matrix as confirmed by birefringence. At 9 and 14 days alkaline phosphatase-specific activity in sponge fiber-osteoprogenitor cell cultures was significantly greater than in control cultures on cell culture plastic. Adsorption with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 confirmed the potential of this sponge skeleton as a delivery scaffold for osteogenic factors. The abundance and structural diversity of <b>natural</b> marine <b>sponge</b> skeletons and their potential as multifunctional, cell conductive and inductive frameworks indicate a promising new source of scaffold for tissue regeneration...|$|R
