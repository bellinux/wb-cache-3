40|$|Background: Although laparoscopic {{cholecystectomy}} is {{the preferred}} method for cholecystectomy, performing routine drainage after laparoscopic cholecystectomy {{is an issue of}} considerable debate. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of using a drain on complications following an uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Methods: In this study, 86 patients with biliary colic were candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patients were randomly divided into two (the intervention and control) groups. In the intervention group, a drain was placed postoperatively, but the control group did not receive any intervention. The amount of fluid collection, length of hospital stay, recovery rate and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain were recorded in all patients. Results: Mean age of patients was 46. 33 Â± 12. 53 and 45. 88 Â± 10. 66 years in the drain and <b>non-drain</b> groups. The drain group was hospitalized 0. 76 days more than the <b>non-drain</b> group (P= 0. 001). Complications were seen in the drain (7) and <b>non-drain</b> (4. 7) groups. VAS was significantly higher in the drain group than the <b>non-drain</b> group (P= 0. 001). Conclusion: Drainage does not {{have a positive effect on}} the postoperative abdominal secretions, recovery and the probable complications. Moreover, it can cause a significant increase in both length of hospital stay and pain score...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Drains {{are usually}} left after thyroid surgery to prevent {{formation}} of hematoma and seroma in the thyroid bed. This {{is done to}} reduce complications and hospital stay. Objective evaluation of the amount collected in the thyroid bed by ultrasonography (USG) can help in assessing the role of drains. Methods A randomized prospective control study was conducted on 94 patients undergoing 102 thyroid surgeries, {{over a period of}} fifteen months. Patients included in the study were randomly allocated to drain and <b>non-drain</b> group on the basis of computer generated random number table. The surgeon was informed of the group just before the closure of the wound Postoperatively USG neck was done on first and seventh postoperative day by the same ultrasonologist each time. Any swelling, change in voice, tetany and tingling sensation were also recorded. The data was analyzed using two-sample t-test for calculating unequal variance. Results Both groups were evenly balanced according to age, sex, and size of tumor, type of procedure performed and histopathological diagnosis. There {{was no significant difference in}} collection of thyroid bed assessed by USG on D 1 & D 7 in the two groups (p = 0. 313) but the hospital stay was significantly reduced in the <b>non-drain</b> group (p = 0. 007). One patient in the drain group required needle aspiration for collection in thyroid bed. No patient in either group required re-operation for bleeding or haematoma. Conclusion Routine drainage of thyroid bed following thyroid surgery may not be necessary. Not draining the wound results in lesser morbidity and decreased hospital stay. </p...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on 607 consecutive patients who underwent a pterional craniotomy for treatment of intracranial anterior circulation aneurysms over a 5 -year period. Between January 2000 and December 2004, 607 patients were divided into two groups, those who had a prophylactic suction drain during closure of the surgical site (drain group, DG) and those who did not (<b>non-drain</b> group, NDG). Head computed tomography (CT) was taken routinely on postoperative day (POD) 1, 7, and 14. Patients ' demographics, incidence of surgical site complications, and courses of surgical site healing which were evaluated radiologically by the thickness of the surgical site myocutaneous layer, were analyzed between DG and NDG.

40|$|Objective: This {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical trial}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the necessity of drainage after total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for benign thyroidal disorders. Methods: A total of 116 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for benign thyroidal disorders were randomly allocated to be drained or not. Operative and postoperative outcomes including operating time, postoperative pain assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), total amount of intramuscular analgesic administration, hospital stay, complications, necessity for re-operation and satisfaction of patients were all assessed. Results: The mean operating time was similar between two groups (the drained and <b>non-drained</b> groups). The mean VAS score {{was found to be}} significantly low in the <b>non-drained</b> group patients in postoperative day (POD) 0 and POD 1. The mean amount of intramuscular analgesic requirement was significantly less in the <b>non-drained</b> group. One case of hematoma, two cases of seroma and three cases of transient hypoparathyroidism occurred in the <b>non-drained</b> group, whereas one case of hematoma, two cases of seroma, two cases of wound infections and two cases of transient hypoparathyroidism occurred in the drained group. No patient needed re-operation for any complication. The mean hospital stay was significantly shorter and the satisfaction of patients was superior in the <b>non-drained</b> group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that postoperative complications cannot be prevented by using drains after total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for benign thyroid disorders. Furthermore, the use of drains may increase postoperative pain and the analgesic requirement, and prolong the hospital stay. In the light of these findings, the routine use of drains might not be necessary after thyroid surgery for benign disorders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Thyroidectomy is {{a common}} {{surgical}} procedure, after which drains are placed routinely. This study aims to assess the benefits of placing postoperative drains, its complications and affects on postoperative stay, in thyroid lobectomy. Methodology Randomized Clinical Trial of 60 goitre patients undergoing lobectomy was conducted at Civil Hospital Karachi, during July’ 11 -December’ 11. Patients were randomly assigned into drain and non drain groups. Patient demographics, labs and complications were noted. Ultrasound of neck was performed on both groups. For drain group, the amount of fluid present in the surgical bed and redivac drain was added to calculate fluid collection while in non drain group it was calculated by ultrasound of neck on first and second post-op days. Data was entered and analyzed on SPSS v 16 using Independent T tests. Result The mean total drain output for 2 [*]days in <b>non-drain</b> group was significantly lower 10. 67 (± 9. 072) ml while in drain group was 30. 97 (± 42. 812) ml (p[*]=[*] 0. 014). The mean postoperative stay of drain group (79. 2 ± 15. 63 [*]hours) was significantly higher, as compared to mean postoperative stay of non drain group (50. 4 ± 7. 32 [*]hours). Mean Visual Analogue Score (VAS) for pain day 1 (6. 2 ± 0. 997) and day 2 (4. 17 ± 0. 95) in drain group were significantly higher compared to day 1 (2. 6 ± 1. 163) and day 2 (1. 3 ± 0. 877) of non drain group. From drain group, 2 patients complained of stridor, dyspnea on Day 1 which subsided by Day 2 and 1 case of voice change, with no such complains in non drain group. No patients from both groups developed seroma, wound infection or hematoma. Conclusion In uncomplicated surgeries especially for lobectomy, use of drain can be omitted. </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the high temperature compression behavior of the solid phase found in a semi-solid 6061 alloy by using an original procedure. A drained compressive test has been carried out to drain the majority of the liquid from the semi-solid alloy and obtain a solid representative of the solid phase of the alloy within the solidification range. The drained compressive tests have shown that the behavior of the semi-solid state is viscoplastic and depends on the initial morphology of the solid skeleton and on the accumulated strain. Then, compressive tests at high temperature have been carried out on drained and <b>non-drained</b> 6061 alloy.

40|$|The SEED {{technology}} is a commercially available rheocasting process used {{in the production of}} high quality semi-solid slurries. The process, which is currently used in the foundry industry, is still actively developed and fully supported by a team of scientists, engineers and technicians. In the later years, works were conducted toward optimizing the process and equipment. At first, the focus was on developing a simplified version of the SEED process to eliminate the so-called "drainage" phase while preserving the prime quality of the slurry produced. Improvement of some system components and integration of new features were also targeted to secure the overall equipment efficiency (OEE) and increase the process reliability. This work, backed with the optimization of process parameters and comprehensive techniques adapted for semi-solid casting, led to the consolidation and even improvement of the properties of the parts produced for common foundry alloys as 356 / 357 and 319. Furthermore, the <b>non-drained</b> SEED version was applied to the validation of the process capabilities for uncommon cast alloys, with works on AA 6061 wrought alloys, high strength 206 cast alloys and Duralcan metal matrix composites.

T-cell priming after mucosal immunization via the nasal route was studied by investigating the distribution of antigen-loaded antigen presenting cells (APCs) and primed antigen-specific T cells. Nasal immunization studies were conducted using the model protein antigen ovalbumin (OVA) plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotide adjuvant. Trafficking of antigen-specific primed T cells was analyzed in vivo after adoptive transfer of OVA-specific transgenic T cells in {{the presence or absence}} of fingolimod, a drug that causes lymphocytes sequestration within lymph nodes. Antigen-loaded APCs were observed in mediastinal lymph nodes, draining the respiratory tract, but not in distal lymph nodes. Antigen-specific proliferating T cells were first observed within draining lymph nodes, and later in distal iliac and mesenteric lymph nodes and in the spleen. The presence at distal sites was due to migration of locally primed T cells as shown by fingolimod treatment that caused a drastic reduction of proliferated T cells in <b>non-draining</b> lymph nodes and an accumulation of extensively divided T cells within draining lymph nodes. Homing of nasally primed T cells in distal iliac lymph nodes was CD 62 L-dependent, while entry into mesenteric lymph nodes depended on both CD 62 L and a 4 b 7, as shown by in vivo antibody-mediated inhibition of T-cell trafficking.

Focusing on two small agricultural watersheds in southwestern Minnesota, simulation results from the Agricultural Drainage And Pesticide Management (ADAPT) model were combined with a linear-optimization model to evaluate the environmental and economic impact of alternative land-use policies for reducing nitrogen losses. Of particular importance was the study's explicit focus on agricultural subsurface (tile) drainage, which has been identified as the major pathway for agricultural nitrogen losses in the upper Midwest, and the use of drainage-focused abatement policies. Results indicate that tile-drained land {{plays a key role in}} nitrogen abatement, and that a combined policy of nutrient management on tile-drained land and retirement of <b>non-drained</b> land is a cost-effective means of achieving a 20 - or 30 -percent nitrogen-abatement goal. Results also indicate that although it is cost-effective to abate on tile-drained land, it is not cost-effective to undertake policies that plug or remove tile drains from the landscape, regardless of whether the land would be retired or kept in production. Therefore, results imply that although tile-drained land is a major source of nitrogen lost to waterways, it is not cost-effective to remove the land from production or to remove the drainage from the land. Because of its value to agricultural production, it is better to keep tile-drained land in production under nutrient management and focus retirement policies on relatively less-productive, <b>non-drained</b> acres. drainage, hypoxia, ADAPT, nitrogen, watershed, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

We investigate whether: i) microglial activation is secondary to laser injury or to a higher IOP and; ii) the presence of rod-like microglia is related to OHT. Three groups of mice were used: age-matched control (naive, n= 15); and two lasered: limbal (OHT, n= 15); and <b>non-draining</b> portion of the sclera (scleral, n= 3). In the lasered animals, treated eyes as well as contralateral eyes were analysed. Retinal whole-mounts were immunostained with antibodies against, Iba- 1, NF- 200, MHC-II, CD 86, CD 68 and Ym 1. In the scleral group (normal ocular pressure) no microglial signs of activation were found. Similarly to naive eyes, OHT-eyes and their contralateral eyes had ramified microglia in the nerve-fibre layer related to the blood vessel. However, only eyes with OHT had rod-like microglia that aligned end-to-end, coupling to form trains of multiple cells running parallel to axons in the retinal surface. Rod-like microglia were CD 68 + and were related to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) showing signs of degeneration (NF- 200 + RGCs). Although MHC-II expression was up-regulated in the microglia of the NFL both in OHT-eyes and their contralateral eyes, no expression of CD 86 and Ym 1 was detected in ramified or in rod-like microglia.

Our aim was to determine the relation between the intrinsic viscosity and the relaxation times of the polymer internal normal modes within the bead-spring approach. In the theoretical part we generalize the Zimm theory of the polymer dy-namics by taking into account the permeability of the solvent into the polymer coil interior and the hydrodynamic interac-tions between different coils. For theta solvents the polymer relaxation is described as depending on the draining parame-ter and the concentration of the coils. Using the calculated relaxation times, the intrinsic viscosity has been obtained. The free-draining (Rouse) and <b>non-draining</b> (Zimm) expressions for this quantity follow from the theory as special cases of in-finite and zero permeability, respectively. In the experimental part we studied the viscosity of high-molecular poly(N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone) water solutions at different temperatures down to such low concentrations when conventional capil-lary viscosimetry fails to probe the viscosity without a complicated additional treatment of the data. Using a new Couette-type viscosimeter with a magnetically suspended rotor allowed us to directly determine the intrinsic viscosity. It notably differs from the previous values reported in the literature.

Naive, CD 8 -enriched, CFSE-labelled F 5 cells were transferred into normal or CD 4 + cell-depleted mice and the mice were vaccinated with MVA. HIVA-NP. At different time points during the primary response, F 5 cells were re-isolated and analysed on divisional basis for a number of parameters. We demonstrated that the primary CD 8 + T cell response in the absence of CD 4 + T cell help differed from that in normal CD 4 + cell-undepleted mice. While in the absence of CD 4 + T cell help, the initial migratory progress from the local response to a systemic one was not grossly affected, the proportion of dying F 5 cells during the expansion phase was markedly increased and resulted in an overall smaller expansion and significantly decreased frequency of CD 8 + T cell memory after contraction. T cells primed without help displayed accelerated proliferation and activation, while expression of interferon-gamma remained similar. These phenomena were observed in the lymph nodes draining the MVA. HIVA-NP immunization site and were similar, but delayed by 2 - 3 days in spleen and <b>non-draining</b> lymph nodes...|$|R
40|$|Visna/Maedi virus (VMV), a small {{ruminant}} lentivirus responsible for lymphoproliferative pneumonia, encephalitis, arthritis and/or mastitis in sheep, has been detected in different non-lymphoid organs. However, {{only a few}} investigations {{have been carried out}} in lymphoid tissues. In this study, some lymphoid tissues and lymph node draining or <b>non-draining</b> VMV target organs from five sheep infected experimentally by the respiratory route three years previously were investigated. Archival samples of spleen, red bone marrow, caudal mediastinal lymph nodes, mammary lymph nodes, popliteal lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes were tested by PCR for the presence of proviral DNA. Popliteal and mesenteric lymph node samples were tested also by immunohistochemical staining of the viral capsid antigen p 28. The proviral DNA was detected by PCR in all the lymphoid tissue samples from the infected sheep. The viral antigen was stained in mononuclear cells in popliteal and mesenteric lymph nodes of the infected sheep. Although the lymph nodes draining the classical target organs seem to be more infected than the others, both the viral capsid antigen and the proviral DNA were present also in lymph nodes draining non-target organs, such as the mesenteric lymph nodes. These findings show the presence of VMV in different lymphoid tissues in the late stages of infection and suggest a potential role of these tissues as a site for viral reservoir and replication, even three years after infection...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) {{causes a}} {{systemic}} infection in mice with virus replication occurring in both peripheral tissues and secondary lymphoid organs. Because {{of the rapid}} systemic dissemination of the virus, the secondary lymphoid organs responsible for the induction of the LCMV-specific CD 8 T cell response are poorly defined. We show that the mediastinal lymph node (MedLN) serves as the primary draining lymph node following LCMV infection. In addition, we demonstrate that the MedLN is responsible for priming {{the majority of the}} virus-specific CD 8 T cell response. Following resolution of the acute infection, the draining MedLN exhibits characteristics of a reactive lymph node including an increased presence of germinal center B cells and increased cellularity for up to 60 days post-infection. Furthermore, the reactive MedLN harbors an increased frequency of CD 62 L 2 effector memory CD 8 T cells as compared to the <b>non-draining</b> lymph nodes. The accumulation of LCMV-specific CD 62 L 2 memory CD 8 T cells in the MedLN is independent of residual antigen and is not a unique feature of the MedLN as footpad infection with LCMV leads to a similar increase of virus-specific CD 62 L 2 effector memory CD 8 T cells in the draining popliteal lymph node. Our results indicate that CD 62 L 2 effector memory CD 8 T cells are granted preferential access into the draining lymph nodes for an extended time followin...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of cavity drainage in the surgical treatment of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinuses. METHODS: The study was prospectively carried out in 803 patients randomized into two groups of respectively 401 and 402 patients. In the first group, primary excision and closure were associated with drainage of the wound; in the second group, the wound was not drained. We have analyzed time off work, time to walk without pain, time to sitting on the toilet without pain, recurrences, and wound infections. We have also evaluated the satisfaction rate and esthetic results. RESULTS: On comparing time off work, time to walk without pain, and time to sitting on toilet without pain postoperatively, there were no significant differences between the two groups. A significant difference between the two groups with regard to wound infection rates (p[*]=[*] 0. 5) and recurrence rates (p[*]=[*] 0. 6) was not observed. In order to prevent prolonged inpatient stay and social intolerance, this study suggests that the post-operative period is tolerated by a few when a drain was used. The visual analog scale (VAS) in the drained group was 3. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 9, and VAS in the <b>non-drained</b> group was 3. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 9 with a significant statistical difference (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001). As regards the cosmetic appearance of the scar after surgery, we achieved a high satisfaction rate among patients in either group with 82. 9...|$|R
40|$|Context: Shear wave {{velocity}} tests (Vs) {{are commonly used}} to estimate the increase in resistance of explosive densified soils. In some historical cases, Vs tests performed after the soil improvement process do not show {{a significant increase in}} soil resistance, even though the soil surface sits more than 0. 50 m. It is believed that this response is due to the presence of gas on the soil mass. Method: This paper presents the results of monotonic triaxial tests performed on samples of dense gaseous sandy soils to evaluate the effect of occluded gas on the response to the shear {{wave velocity}} in densified sands with explosives. For sand sampling, it was collected from a loose sand deposit located in South Carolina, USA. These samples were densified in-situ with explosives, and consolidated to the in-situ effective stress conditions, which are considered representative in the conditions of effort at the moment of the densification with explosives. Results: Triaxial tests were performed under global <b>non-drained</b> conditions. The results of these tests show that gas causes the shear wave velocity values obtained for the gaseous sands to approximate the shear wave velocity values obtained in the saturated samples tested under drained conditions. In addition, behavior tends to be more pronounced as the soil is denser. Conclusions: These response may offer some insights as to why the shear wave velocity does not increase significantly in densified soils with explosives, even though the density increases considerably...|$|R
