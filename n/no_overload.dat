X-linked dominant erythropoietic protoporphyria is a relatively mild version of porphyria with the predominate symptom being extreme photo sensitivity causing severe itching and burning of the skin due to the buildup of Protoporphyrin IX. One possible treatment was discovered when treating an individual with supplemental Iron for a gastric ulcer.

Mice were submitted to 60 - vs 90 -min session/day, once vs twice a day, with 2 or 4 % of the weight of the mouse or no workload attached to the tail, for 4 vs 6 weeks of exercise training. Blood pressure was unchanged in all groups while resting heart rate decreased in the trained groups (8 - 18 %). Skeletal muscle citrate synthase activity, measured spectrophotometrically, increased (45 - 58 %) only as a result of duration and frequency-controlled exercise training, indicating that endurance conditioning was obtained. In groups which received duration and endurance conditioning, cardiac weight (14 - 25 %) and myocyte dimension (13 - 20 %) increased. The best conditioning protocol to promote physiological hypertrophy, our primary goal in the present study, was 90 min, twice a day, 5 days a week for 4 weeks with <b>no</b> <b>overload</b> attached to the body.

The flux focusing axial magnetic gear (FFAMG) was assembled for future testing of power transmission, conversion, and generation applications.

On a traditional mechanical gear this ratio is the ratio of teeth on the load gear to the teeth on the drive gear. The innovative FFAMG uses a ratio of magnetic poles on the driver gear to load gear to accomplish the power transmission that a traditional mechanical gear would achieve.

This study compared G 6 PD activity in 2 protocols of right ventricle (RV) systolic overload in young goats. MethodsTwenty-seven goats were separated into 3 groups: sham (<b>no</b> <b>overload),</b> continuous (continuous systolic overload), and intermittent (four 12 -hour periods of systolic overload {{paired with a}} 12 -hour resting period). During a 96 -hour protocol, systolic overload was adjusted to achieve a 0. 7 RV/aortic pressure ratio. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic evaluations were performed before and after systolic overload every day postoperatively. After the study period, the animals were humanely killed for morphologic and G 6 PD tissue activity assessment. ResultsA 92. 1 % and 46. 5 % increase occurred in RV and septal mass, respectively, in the intermittent group compared with the sham group; continuous systolic overload resulted in a 37. 2 % increase in septal mass. A worsening RV myocardial performance index occurred in the continuous group at 72 hours and 96 hours, compared with the sham (P < . 039) and intermittent groups {{at the end of}} the protocol (P < . 001). Compared with the sham group, RV G 6 PD activity was elevated 130. 1 % in the continuous group (P = . 012) and 39. 8 % in the intermittent group (P = . 764). ConclusionsContinuous systolic overload for ventricle retraining causes RV dysfunction and upregulation of myocardial G 6 PD activity, which can elevate levels of free radicals by NADPH oxidase, an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of heart failure. Intermittent systolic overload promotes a more efficient RV hypertrophy, with better preservation of myocardial performance and and less exposure to hypertrophic triggers...|$|E

The intended application area for the NOC is the real-time communication of multiprocessors that are hosted by a single Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed NOC is an on-chip multistage interconnection network for which an upper limit can be guaranteed that is at most needed for the latency while delivering data between sending and receiving processors. The reason for the deterministic interprocessor communication is the constant path length from input to any output port of the NOC. In contrast to contemporary NOCs, no intermediate routers exist. Thus, <b>no</b> <b>overloaded</b> router with hot spot problems can occur, and the proposed NOC can be used for real-time applications.

40|$|Abstract: To get the {{distribution}} network {{to operate at}} its optimum performance in an automated distribution system reconfiguration was been proposed and researched. Considering, however, that optimum performance implies minimum loss, <b>no</b> <b>overloading</b> of transformers and cables, correct voltage profile, and absence of phase voltage and current imbalances, network reconfiguration alone is insufficient. It has to be complemented with techniques for phase rearrangement between {{the distribution}} transformer banks and the specific primary feeder with a radial structure and dynamic phase and load balancing along a feeder with a radial structure. This paper contributes such a technique at the low-voltage and medium-voltage levels of a distribution network simultaneously with reconfiguration at both levels. While the neural network is adopted for the network reconfiguration problem, this paper introduces a heuristic method for the phase balancing/loss minimization problem. A comparison of the heuristic algorithm {{with that of the}} neural network shows the former to be more robust. The approach proposed here, therefore for the combined problem, uses the neural network in conjunction with a heuristic method which enables different reconfiguration switches to be turned on/off and connected consumers to be switched between different phases to keep the phases balanced.

Method Detailed searches through PUBMED, OVID, EMBASE and LILACS databases were made. Articles published up to December 2011 and those reported on the clinical, radiographic and/or histological outcome of oral implants subjected to so-called overload were considered eligible for inclusion. Identified studies were assessed by one non-blinded reviewer according to well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. When doubt arose, the co-authors were counselled until final agreement was obtained. The PICO questions formulated was:“what is the effect of overload vs. <b>no</b> <b>overload</b> on bone/implant loss in clinically stable implants?” Results The database searches as well as additional hand searching, resulted in 726 potentially relevant titles. Eventually, 16 clinical and 25 animal studies were considered relevant to the topic. After inclusion/exclusion criteria assessment, all clinical studies and all but three animal studies and one systematic review were considered at high risk of bias and excluded. The included animal studies did not reveal an association between overload and peri-implant bone loss in the absence of peri-implant inflammation, whereas in its presence, overload seemed to aggravate the peri-implant tissue breakdown. Conclusions The effect of implant overload on bone/implant loss in clinically well-integrated implants is poorly reported and provides little unbiased evidence to support a cause-and-effect relationship. The PICO question remained unanswered. At the animal level, “overload”, mimicked by supra-occlusal contacts acting in an uninflamed peri-implant environment, did not negatively affect osseointegration and even was anabolic. In contrast, supra-occlusal contacts in the presence of inflammation significantly increased the plaque-induced bone resorption. status: publishe...|$|E

One possible explanation is an overproduction of endogenous NO (nitric oxide) due to the residual quote of acetate (4 mM) in the BD dialysate formulation. <b>NO</b> <b>overload</b> might cause the impairment of cardiovascular reactivity observed during BD. In this study, a potential direct impact of the residual quote of acetate on the cardiac cells was investigated. METHODS: Ventricular cardiac myocytes isolated from adult rat hearts were treated with three different dialysis baths with or without acetate: BD, AFB and AFB + 4 mM of acetate (AFB(+)). Corresponding levels of expression of the inducible NO synthase 2 (NOS 2) were assessed after the treatments along with the measurement of single-cell action potential (AP). RESULTS: Incubation with acetate-containing dialysis solutions significantly enhanced (P < 0. 05) the expression of NOS 2 mRNA (BD: 1. 11 +/- 0. 31; AFB(+) : 0. 73 +/- 0. 04, NOS 2 /GAPDH intensitometric ratio) {{with respect to the}} acetate-free bath (AFB: 0. 03 +/- 0. 01). Accordingly, protein translation was also enhanced (BD: 0. 176 +/- 0. 021; AFB(+) : 0. 135 +/- 0. 009, NOS 2 /alpha-tubuline intensitometric ratio) with respect to AFB (0. 002 +/- 0. 001, P < 0. 05). Measurement of the AP indicates that acetate-containing solutions determine a shortening of the repolarization phase as compared to treatment with AFB (BD: 95 +/- 13; AFB(+) : 76 +/- 10; AFB: 162 +/- 16 ms). CONCLUSION: These findings show that the residual quote of acetate of the BD bath formulation affects the expression of NOS 2 and the duration of AP in cardiac cells. This might cause the cardiac contractile impairment in unstable patients during BD treatment...|$|E
40|$|High {{speed in}} waves, {{necessary}} in for instance rescue or military operations, often result in severe loading {{on both the}} craft and the crew. To maximize {{the performance of the}} high-speed craft (HSC) system that the craft and crew constitute, balance between these loads is essential. There should be <b>no</b> <b>overload</b> or underuse of crew, craft or equipment. For small high-speed craft systems, man is often the weakest link. The human exposure to vibration and shock results in injuries and other adverse health effects, which increase the risks for non-safe operations and performance degradation of the crew and craft system. To achieve a system in balance, the human acceleration exposure must be considered early in ship design. It must also be considered in duty planning and in design and selection of vibration mitigation systems. The thesis presents a simulation-based method for prediction and evaluation of the acceleration exposure of the crew on small HSC. A numerical seat model, validated with experimental full-scale data, is used to determine the crew's acceleration exposure. The input to the model is the boat acceleration expressed in the time domain (simulated or measured), the total mass of the seated human, and seat specific parameters such as mass, spring stiffness and damping coefficients and the seat's longitudinal position in the craft. The model generates seat response time series that are evaluated using available methods for evaluation of whole-body vibration (ISO 2631 - 1 & ISO 2631 - 5) and statistical methods for calculation of extreme values. The presented simulation scheme enables evaluation of human exposure to vibration and shock at an early stage in the design process. It can also be used as a tool in duty planning, requirements specification or for design of appropriate vibration mitigation systems. Further studies is proposed within three areas: investigation of the actual operational profiles of HSC, further development of seat models and investigation of the prevailing injuries and health problems among the crew of HSC.

Participaram deste estudo 20 voluntárias com média de idade de 20, 4 (2, 7), IMC 21, 4 (2, 1) e número do calçado 36, 3 (1, 2). Segundo os resultados observados, quanto maior a altura do salto utilizado, maior é também o percentual de peso aplicado sobre antepés e menor é o percentual de peso aplicado sobre os retropés. Na altura de salto de 1, 70 cm, a média obtida do percentual de peso aplicado em antepés não diferiu da média encontrada por Cavanagh (1987). Concluiu-se, então, que com altura de salto de 1, 70 cm não ocorre sobrecarga na região plantar de antepés. Na análise da angulação da coluna lombar, encontrou-se que o aumento da altura do salto está associado ao aumento da lordose lombar, de forma que os valores da angulação lombar mostraram-se diferentes e menores com o aumento da altura do salto.

40|$|The sigma-delta {{modulator}} is {{a popular}} signal amplitude quantization error (or noise) shaper used in oversampling analogue-to-digital and digital-to-analogue converter systems. The shaping of the noise frequency spectrum is performed by feeding back the quantization errors through a time delay element filter and feedback loop in the circuit, and {{by the addition of}} a possible stochastic dither signal at the quantizer. The aim in audio systems is to limit audible noise and distortions in the reconverted analogue signal. The formulation of the sigma-delta modulator as a discrete dynamical system provides a useful framework for the mathematical analysis of such a complex nonlinear system, as well as a unifying basis from which to consider other systems, from pseudorandom number generators to stochastic resonance processes, that yield equivalent formulations. The study of chaos and other complementary aspects of internal dynamical behaviour in previous research has left important issues unresolved. Advancement of this study is naturally facilitated by the dynamical systems approach. In this thesis, the general order feedback/feedforward sigma-delta modulator with multi-bit quantizer (<b>no</b> <b>overload)</b> and general input, is modelled and studied mathematically as a dynamical system. This study employs pertinent topological methods and relationships, which follow centrally from the symmetry of the circle map interpretation of the error state space dynamcis. The main approach taken is to reduce the nonlinear system into local or special case linear systems. Systems of sufficient structure are shown to often possess structured random, or random-like behaviour. An adaptation of Devaney's definition of chaos is applied to the model, and an extensive investigation of the conditions under which the associated chaos conditions hold or do not hold is carried out. This seeks, in part, to address the unresolved research issues. Chaos is shown to hold if all zeros of the noise transfer function lie outside the unit circle of radius two, provided the input is either periodic or persistently random (mod delta). When the filter satisfies a certain continuity condition, the conditions for chaos are extended, and more clear cut classifications emerge. Other specific chaos classifications are established. A study of the statistical properties of the error in dithered quantizers and sigma-delta modulators is pursued using the same state space model. A general treatment of the steady state error probability distribution is introduced, and results for predicting uniform steady state errors under various conditions are found. The uniformity results are applied to RPDF dithered systems to give conditions for a steady state error variance of delta squared over six. Numerical simulations support predictions of the analysis for the first-order case with constant input. An analysis of conditions on the model to obtain bounded internal stability or instability is conducted.

This is a myth, as shown in Fig. 1 there is <b>no</b> information <b>overload.</b> Instead we are suffering from a data overload. The confusion between data and information is not readily apparent and requires further explanation. Unorganized data are voluminous but of very little value. Over the past 15 years, industry and commerce have made significant efforts to rearrange this unorganized data into purposeful data, utilizing various kinds of database management systems. However, even in this organized form, we are still dealing with data and not information...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} expansion planning (TEP) {{has long}} term effects on system performance. The effects are irreversible. The conventional optimization techniques have convergence problems for large system and heuristic methods reported {{so far are}} not holistic in nature. This paper proposes a two level approach. At first level, the usual static solution using linear approach is proposed. The objective is to minimize the cost along with overloads. The isolated nodes are handled by ZBUS formulation as described. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) {{is used as a}} heuristic approach to arrive at results. The plans are shortlisted with <b>no</b> <b>overloads</b> and least cost. The performance is tested for high rank contingencies and appropriate system strengthening is suggested. At second level, further strengthening of the network on short term basis is done with due consideration to reactive power balance in the grid. The reactive power support has to be incorporated since the AC model with reactive power limits can impose convergence problems. To overcome this, Reactive Power Compensation (RPC) enhanced FDLF module with integrated reactive power planning based on set of heuristics is implemented. The TEP plans need to be evaluated for reactive power balance. This is accomplished by evaluating voltage stability margin index (VSMI). It identifies weaker lines prone to reactive power imbalance. The TEP plan reinforces grid to improve the weaker section. The proposed methodology is applied to IEEE 46 -bus test system and results are discussed. © IEE...|$|R
40|$|Road {{conditions}} in Sub-Saharan Africa are typically poor, {{and only a}} subset of the newly constructed or rehabilitated roads reach their design life. Truck overloading generally causes this rapid deterioration. In Africa, there are few success stories on the imposition of axle-load limits. This study examines the existing regulations on the Douala-N'Djamena international road, which is the main transport corridor in Central Africa and the backbone for internal transport in Cameroon. It benefits from the detailed existing weighing data recorded since 1998 in the corridor's 10 weighing stations. This vast amount of traffic data, together with available information on road structure and deterioration over time, has been used to conduct an accurate calculation of load equivalency factors. The HDM 4 model has been applied to three scenarios between 2000 and 2015 : (1) no axle-load control, (2) the real situation and (3) <b>no</b> <b>overloading</b> tolerance. Results show that axle-load regulations have been reasonably well applied in Cameroon and have contributed to maintaining the corridor in fair condition. In {{spite of the fact that}} significant traffic increases are presently counterbalancing the damage avoided by axle-load limits, benefits provided by axle-load control have been substantial: in the period of 2000 – 2015, every € invested or spent on axle-load control has generated more than € 20 of savings in road user costs and in road maintenance and rehabilitation expenditure, which represents, in absolute terms, more than € 500 million.
