[...] James Marsh of Twitch Film praised the film, writing, [...] "Ip Man 2 looks fantastic {{and does a}} grand job of evoking the period authentically, lending the film a much-appreciated sense of dramatic gravitas." [...] Joy Fang, a critic for online news portal AsiaOne wrote, [...] "While <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a movie as the first one, which focuses on heartbreaking and intense issues arising from the Japanese occupation in China, this film evokes Chinese pride with its strong cultural roots."

[...] Amir Hafizi of The Malay Mail praised Sammo Hung's martial arts choreography: [...] "With fluid movements intricate interplay between contrasting martial styles and gorgeous sequences, kung fu fans will definitely get their eye-balls' worth here as this time around, the introduction of Western boxing into the mix makes for some interesting choreography."

2500|$|For {{independent}} bookmakers, Dragna {{would use}} extortion to collect money from their operations. While most mobsters simply threatened harm {{on a business}} for not paying tribute to their organization (protection racket), Dragna’s family {{came up with a}} more sophisticated course of action. Dragna would send in men to threaten businesses, then the owners would pay Dragna for protection (unaware that these were Dragna's own men). Dragna wasn't however, able to control 100% of independent gambling rackets. Along with Dragna avoiding the spotlight and public life, he often was given the reputation as a weak ruler. According to Mickey Cohen, Dragna was very powerful and very well respected, but did not put things together the way the East Coast bosses preferred. Although there was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a pool of Italians to recruit on the West Coast like there was back East, the L.A. family worked around this by accepting members from across the country, such as Johnny Roselli from Chicago, Nick Licata from Detroit, and Aladena [...] "Jimmy the Weasel" [...] Fratianno and Dominic Brooklier from Cleveland. Armed with top hitman Frank Bompensiero and Jimmy Fratianno (who committed over 30 murders on the orders of their superiors), Dragna muscled his way into controlling territory stretching throughout California and Southern Nevada. The Dragna family also had connections within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, who were more corrupt than the city police (LAPD). Although not having a big hand in labor union rackets, the Dragna crime family did infiltrate some unions in the laundromat and dress importing business.|$|E
