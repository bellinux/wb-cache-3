5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1913, Stojanović {{commenced}} {{the final year of}} his secondary education. <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> was visited that year by a group of activists of Young Bosnia who were university students in Prague, Vienna, and Switzerland. They held a series of lectures for the members of the association, explaining their views on the current political situation, and promoting the unity of South Slavic peoples in their struggle to liberate themselves from Austria-Hungary. These lectures influenced Stojanović to adopt a Yugoslavist stance. At the beginning of 1914, Ilić and Stojanović became, respectively, the president and the vice-president of <b>National</b> <b>Unity,</b> which numbered 34 members, including four Muslims and four Croats. At that time, <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> {{was one of the most}} active groups of Young Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the different ethnic groups of the Dutch East Indies– modern day Indonesia– began to feel a sense of <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> as eventually formulated in the 1928 Youth Pledge. These native groups founded political parties to further their goals and represent their political ideologies, including the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian National Party.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} World War II, the {{advancing}} Soviet Red Army pushed out the Nazi German forces from occupied Poland. In February 1945, the Yalta Conference sanctioned {{the formation of a}} provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. Joseph Stalin, the leader of the Soviet Union, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled Provisional Government of <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> was formed in Warsaw by ignoring the Polish government-in-exile based in London since 1940.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In their attempts to represent the emperor as a figure of <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} conspirators {{brought to}} power the 17-year-old King Peter II Karađorđević, whom they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a government of <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> was formed with Simović as prime minister and Vladko Maček and Slobodan Jovanović as his vice-premiers. The coup led directly to the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|While militarily Habré {{was only}} partly {{successful}} {{in his attempt}} to evict the Libyans from the Tibesti (the Libyans would fully leave the region in March, when a series of defeats in the north-east had made the area untenable), the campaign was a great strategic breakthrough for the FANT, as it transformed a civil war into a national war against a foreign invader, stimulating a sense of <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> that had never been seen before in Chad.|$|E
5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his voice would be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E

5|$|An {{international}} peace conference {{was held in}} Kano in Nigeria, in which Chad's bordering states participated along with Malloum, Habré, and Goukouni. The Kano Accord was signed on 16 March by all those present, and Malloum resigned, replaced by a Council of State under the chairmanship of Goukouni. This {{was a result of}} Nigerian and French pressures on Goukouni and Habré to share power; the French in particular saw this as part of their strategy to cut all ties between Goukouni and Gaddafi. A few weeks later, the same factions formed the Transitional Government of <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (GUNT), kept together to a considerable extent by the common desire to see Libya out of Chad.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of <b>National</b> <b>Unity</b> (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|Following {{continued}} turmoil {{between the}} centre-right parties, {{there was even}} an independent petition in 1926 gaining some momentum that proposed for Nansen to head a centre-right <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> government on a balanced budget program, an idea he did not reject. He was the headline speaker at the single largest Fatherland League rally with 15,000 attendees in Tønsberg in 1928. In 1929 he went on his final tour for the League on the ship Stella Polaris, holding speeches from Bergen to Hammerfest.|$|E

5|$|His {{popularity}} among the citizenry had never waned, and support {{continued to be}} evident, even {{on the eve of}} his overthrow and throughout his exile. He was seen as a hero, a model citizen, a caring monarch, and the source of <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> and well-being. Following his death, political wrangling prevented the return of his remains to Brazil. Continued efforts to repatriate the bodies of the Emperor and his wife dragged on for decades. The disputes were resolved and this was finally accomplished in 1920 with much fanfare. Over the decades, PedroII gradually grew within Brazil to represent the archetypical benevolent, self-effacing and effective ruler concerned only for the national welfare.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Grant was {{unsuccessful}} in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination {{for a third}} term. Facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote his memoirs, which {{proved to be a}} major critical and financial success. His death in 1885 prompted an outpouring in support of <b>national</b> <b>unity.</b> Historical assessments of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. His popular reputation focuses on his drinking, which historians agree did not adversely affect his military campaigns. Early historical evaluations were mostly negative about Grant's presidency. Scholars continue to rank his presidency below the average, but modern appreciation for his support for civil rights has helped improve his standing.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{government}} detailed its national sport objectives. These objectives included promoting youth activity {{in order to}} improve quality of life, encourage young people to participate in national celebrations, develop and organize local sport, and foster a sense of competition and <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> in the sporting community across the village, national and international sphere. While not specifically mentioning netball, it did acknowledge the importance of the sport in terms of international prestige. One of the strategies to help meet those objectives was to strengthen national sporting bodies like the netball association. This worked; by 2009, there were more than 1,000 players registered with the Cook Islands Netball Association.|$|E

Nasisten was the organ of the group. The group used a swastika as its symbol. The group merged into the National Socialist Bloc later the same year.|$|R
5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the Bangui Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E
5|$|In the February election, ZANU-PF secured 63% of the {{national}} vote, gaining 57 of the 80 parliamentary seats allocated for black parties and providing them with an absolute majority. ZAPU had gained 20 seats, and UANC had three. Mugabe was elected MP for the Salisbury constituency of Highfield. Attempting to calm panic and prevent white flight, Mugabe appeared on television and called for <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> stability, and law and order, insisting that the pensions of white civil servants would be guaranteed and that private property would be protected.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under federal laws against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> and mobilization of the military.|$|E

She called for a recount of votes {{in the presidential election}} (officially won by Mwai Kibaki, but disputed by the opposition) in her constituency, saying that both sides should feel the outcome was fair and that there were indications of fraud.|$|R
50|$|In October 1933, SNSP {{suffered}} {{yet another}} split as Furugård and the Party Staff confronted each other. Both declared each other {{expelled from the}} party.

The Party Staff regrouped as the Swedish <b>National</b> Socialist <b>Unity</b> Party. The Swedish <b>National</b> Socialist <b>Unity</b> Party would continue to publish Vår Kamp as their party organ.|$|R
