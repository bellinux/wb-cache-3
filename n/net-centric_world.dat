40|$|Today {{and without}} a doubt, {{we live in a}} <b>net-centric</b> <b>world</b> in which new {{information}} technologies arrive at lightning speed, allowing us to share information locally to globally faster than ever before. The bad guys are equally out there to eavesdrop on our data transactions over the insecure communication channels. Cryptography can be used to help us secure our data communication. In this study we describe a Java implementation of secure RSA cryptosystems using your cryptographic provider, Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE). We then illustrate the use of this implementation in a working prototype. We then explain the na√Øve procedure for implementation of RSA cryptosystems and signature algorithm followed by the real time Java implementation using Open Source Bouncy Castle JCE provider...|$|E
