40|$|In our {{hospital}} early <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is now {{the major}} cause of low serum calcium in the neonatal period. Over a 2 -year period, only 2 cases of hypocalcaemic convulsions were seen {{in a total of}} 8700 deliveries, though 51 infants had early <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia.</b> All sick low birth-weight infants should have daily serum calcium estimations carried out.

40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is common. The {{etiology}} {{is probably}} multifactorial. This retrospective case- series study evaluated {{early and late}} <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> in 796 neonates. 267 of neonates were hypocalcemic. We found significant statistical relationships between early and late onset hypocalcemia and asphyxia, (p= 0. 043, p= 0. 027), prematurity (p= 0. 004, p= 0. 040), cold seasons (late onset: p= 0. 010), diabetic mother (p= 0. 0392).

40|$|Background. Primary {{hyperparathyroidism}} (pHPT) {{in pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} event, but it poses a significant risk to mothers and fetuses. The optimal treatment strategy remains controversial. Methods. We present a consecutive series of twelve pregnant women with pHPT. Results. Twelve women were diagnosed with pHPT during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. Four of them presented no symptoms or mild symptoms. Four patients experienced serious complications, including hypercalcaemic crisis, acute pancreatitis, and eclampsia. Another four patients were identified postpartum {{as the result of}} <b>neonatal</b> convulsion with <b>hypocalcaemia.</b> Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) under cervical plexus block was successfully performed in 11 of them during pregnancy or postpartum. The serum levels of ionized calcium and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were much higher in patients with severe complications in this cohort than those in the group of patients with no symptoms or mild symptoms and patients who were diagnosed postpartum. Conclusions. MIP under cervical plexus block might be a safe and effective treatment for pregnant women with pHPT. Even though both conservative and surgical treatments are applicable for most mothers and fetuses with asymptomatic and mild hyperparathyroidism, serious complications may have catastrophic consequences for both...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases are}} {{reported}} of prolonged hypocalcaemia with tetany in infants born at term, whose mothers {{had been treated}} with phenytoin and phenobarbitone in high doses. Both infants presented with jitteriness and tetany {{in the first and}} second weeks of life, and in both the hypocalcaemia was resistant to therapy over a longer period. An effect on the fetal vitamin D metabolism by phenytoin and phenobarbitone, resulting in defective bone mineralization and <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Velocardiofacial {{syndrome}} and DiGeorge syndrome have not previously {{been associated with}} central nervous system degeneration. We report a 34 year old man who presented for neurological evaluation with cerebellar atrophy of unknown aetiology. On historical review, he had <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> an atrial septal defect, and a corrected cleft palate. His physical examination showed the characteristic facies of velocardiofacial syndrome as well as dysmetria and dysdiadocho-kinesia consistent with cerebellar degeneration. Molecular cytogenetic studies showed a deletion of 22 q 11. 2. This man is the first reported patient with the association of a neurodegenerative disorder and 22 q 11. 2 deletion syndrome...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 29 year old female with mild dysmorphic facial features, {{presenting}} with late onset symptomatic hypocalcaemia in adulthood. The presence of hypoparathyroidism {{in association with}} a history of transient <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and velopharyngeal incompetence during childhood, prompted chromosomal analysis for DiGeorge Syndrome. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis revealed a deletion of chromosome 22 q 11. 2. This case is unusual in that the patient remained asymptomatic apart from speech and language delay after {{the first few months of}} life and presented in adulthood without any associated immunological, cardiac or renal abnormalities. The diagnosis has important implications for health and family planning...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{child with}} an {{unbalanced}} trans-location resulting in monosomy for chromo-somes 22 (qi 1 -*pter) and 3 (p 25 -. pter) is de-scribed. Although no immunological dysfunction could be demonstrated, the abnormalities found {{are similar to}} those seen in the di George syndrome which has been associated with mono-somy for the same region of chromosome 22. The clinical features of di George syndrome (DGS) include <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> defective cellular immunity, absent parathyroid and thymus glands, atypical facial features, and cardiovascular anoma-lies. 1 2 More recent reports 3 suggest a greater variability of the syndrome than originally described and Lischner 4 advocated the name partial DGS t...|$|E
40|$|Maternal vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} risk factors for neonatal vitamin D deficiency followed by <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia.</b> The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between delayed <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and maternal vitamin D deficiency. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Target population of this study included all term and preterm neonates with delayed hypocalcaemia (after the first 72 hours of birth) admitted to Ali-Asghar Hospital. The sample size was 100 neonates included in the study. Demographic, clinical and paraclinical data including Ca, P, PTH and level of maternal and neonatal vitamin D were recorded according to patients records. 67 neonates (67 %) were term and 33 (33 %) were preterm neonates. The mean of serum calcium in neonates was 6. 49 ± 0. 68 mg/dL (in the range of 4. 3 - 7. 8 mg/dL). 85 % of neonates and 74 % of mothers had vitamin D deficiency. 100 % of neonates born to mothers with vitamin D deficiency were hypocalcaemia. A statistically significant difference was seen between the mean values of serum Ca (6. 67 in term vs. 6. 12 in preterm neonates) and vitamin D in term and preterm neonates was 16. 34 vs. 20. 18 (P= 0. 0001 and P= 0. 01 respectively). Also, a significant correlation was seen between maternal and neonatal level of vitamin D (P= 0. 0001, r= 0. 789). With regard to the socio-cultural status in Iran besides women's clothing style and nutritional deficiencies before and during pregnancy, health authorities and policy makers are responsible to focus their serious attention on hypocalcaemia and hypovitaminosis D in neonates...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} week of life serum calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, immunoreactive {{thyrocalcitonin}} hormone, and parathyroid hormone concentrations were determined daily in 36 preterm and 29 small for gestational age, full term, healthy infants. Preterm babies with early <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> had significantly higher concentrations of serum thyrocalcitonin hormone in the first four days of life than normocalcaemic preterm babies. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were similar in hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic infants. In contrast, in the full term group no significant differences were detected in thyrocalcitonin hormone and parathyroid hormone patterns between hypocalcaemic and normocalcaemic subjects. This suggests two different pathogeneses for early hypocalcaemia in low birthweight infants. Hyperthyrocalcitoninaemia seems to be the main determining factor in preterm infants, while a non-hormonal pathogenesis should be considered in full term infants who are small for gestational age...|$|E
40|$|Presentation {{characteristics}} were reviewed in 14 children from 12 families with malignant infantile osteopetrosis seen at two large referral centres for bone marrow transplantation. Children from six {{of these families}} presented initially with symptoms of hypocalcaemia. These comprised early or late neonatal convulsions in six cases (corrected serum calcium < 1. 5 mmol/l), and vomiting and irritability (serum calcium 1. 68 mmol/l) in another. One other related child had severe and persistent jittering episodes almost certainly attributable to hypocalcaemia. In seven of eight cases, these symptoms developed during the first 14 days of life. Although occasionally reported previously, malignant infantile osteopetrosis remains essentially unrecognised {{as a cause of}} <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> often resulting in diagnostic confusion and delay. This is important in the context of curative haemopoietic stem cell transplantation where preservation of sight may depend on early intervention. ...|$|E
40|$|Background 22 q 112 {{deletion}} syndrome (22 q 112 DS) is a rela-tively common yet under-recognized genetic syndrome {{that may}} present with endocrine features. We aimed {{to address the}} {{factors that contribute to}} the high prevalence of hypocalcaemia. Methods We investigated hypocalcaemia in a well-characterized sample of 138 adults with 22 q 112 DS (65 M, 73 F; mean age 342, SD 118, years) using laboratory studies and lifelong medi-cal records. Logistic regression modelling was used to identify features associated with lifetime prevalence of hypocalcaemia. Results Of the total sample, 111 (804 %) had a lifetime history of hypocalcaemia. Eleven (846 %) of 13 subjects with <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> had documented recurrence of hypocalcaemia. Lifetime history of hypocalcaemia was associated with lifetime prevalence of hypoparathyroidism (P < 00001) and hypothy-roidism (P = 004), as statistically independent factors. Hypo...|$|E
40|$|Oesophageal atresia (OA) is a {{congenital}} defect associated with additional malformations in 30 - 70 % of the cases. In particular, OA is {{a component of}} the VACTERL association. Since some major features of the VACTERL association, including conotruncal heart defect, radial aplasia, and anal atresia, have been found in patients with microdeletion 22 q 11. 2 (del(22 q 11. 2)), we have screened for del(22 q 11. 2) by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 15  syndromic patients with OA. Del(22 q 11. 2) was detected in one of them, presenting with OA, tetralogy of Fallot, anal atresia, <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> and subtle facial anomalies resembling those of velocardiofacial syndrome. The occurrence of del(22 q 11. 2) in our series of patients with OA is low (1 / 15), but this chromosomal anomaly should be included among causative factors of malformation complexes with OA. In addition, clinical variability of del(22 q 11. 2) syndrome is further corroborated with inclusion of OA in the list of the findings associated with the deletion.    Keywords: microdeletion 22 q 11; oesophageal atresia; VACTERL association; velocardiofacial syndrom...|$|E
40|$|Oral calcium {{supplements}} (80 mg/kg per 24 h) {{were given}} to 23 preterm infants, and the course of serum calcium, magnesium, immunoreactive calcitonin, and gastrin was compared with a control group of 23 matched infants. In the supplemented group, serum calcium concentrations remained at the baseline level (2. 31 mmol/l +/- 0. 18 SD) while a fall (from 2. 27 +/- 0. 18 to 1. 91 +/- 0. 24 mmol/l) was observed at 12 - 16 hours {{of age in the}} control group, with 4 values < 1. 75 mmol/l. There was no change in serum magnesium concentration in either group. The postnatal rise of serum immunoreactive calcitonin concentrations in the control group (from 171 +/- 135 to 493 +/- 273 pg/ml at 12 - 48 hours of age) was not found in the supplemented group. There was a negative correlation between serum calcium and immunoreactive calcitonin levels in the control group, but not in the supplemented group. There was no correlation between serum immunoreactive calcitonin and gastrin concentrations. These data show that oral calcium supplementation can prevent early <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> and suggest that this effect is achieved at least in part through a reduction of the postnatal rise of serum immunoreactive calcitonin...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} is a preventable health problem. Vitamin D deficiency among {{pregnant women}} is frequent in many populations over the world. Research indicates that adequate vitamin D intake in pregnancy is optimal for maternal, fetal and child health. Adverse health outcomes during pregnancy are preeclampsia; gestational diabetes mellitus and caesarean section. Consequences in newborns are low birth weight, neonatal rickets, {{a risk of}} <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia,</b> asthma and/or type 1 diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is the origin {{for a host of}} future perils for the child, especially effect on neurodevelopment and immune system. Some of this damage done by maternal Vitamin D deficiency gets evident after many years. Therefore, prevention of vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is essential. The currently recommended supplementation amount of vitamin D is not sufficient to maintain a value of 25 hydroxy vitamin D above 30 ng/ml, during pregnancy. Studies are underway to establish the recommended daily doses of vitamin D in pregnant women. Clearly, further investigation is required into the effects of vitamin D, of vitamin D supplementation, and of vitamin D analogs for improvement in human health generally and mothers and children specifically. This review discusses vitamin D metabolism, dietary requirements and recommendations and implications of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy and lactation...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D has {{historically}} been considered {{to play a role}} solely in bone and calcium metabolism. Human disease associations and basic physiological studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency is plausibly implicated in adverse health outcomes including mortality, malignancy, cardiovascular disease, immune functioning and glucose metabolism. There is considerable evidence that low maternal levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D are associated with adverse outcomes for both mother and fetus in pregnancy as well as the neonate and child. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy has been linked with a number of maternal problems including infertility, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes and an increased rate of caesarean section. Likewise, for the child, there is an association with small size, impaired growth and skeletal problems in infancy, <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and seizures, and an increased risk of HIV transmission. Other childhood disease associations include type 1 diabetes and effects on immune tolerance. The optimal concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D is unknown and compounded by difficulties in defining the normal range. Whilst there is suggestive physiological evidence to support a causal role for many of the associations, whether vitamin D deficiency is a marker of poor health or the underlying aetiological problem is unclear. Randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation with an appropriate assessment of a variety of health outcomes are required. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Partial or {{complete}} absence of the thymus (DiGeorge syndrome, III-IV pharyngeal pouch syndrome) {{is often associated with}} agenesis or hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands and, almost invariably, with cardiovascular malformations. The clinical and pathological findings in 10 cases proven at necropsy are presented. All patients presented with cardiac symptoms and signs in the first weeks of life and, with one exception, all died of a cardiac cause. Major cardiovascular malformations were found in all 10 cases. Four had, in association with a ventricular septal defect of the infundibular type, an interrupted aortic arch, which was left-sided in two and right-sided in two other cases. Four patients had truncus arteriosus type I, in two of them associated with a right-sided aortic arch. Two patients with tetralogy of Fallot had a right-sided aortic arch. Only two of the 10 had a normally developed left aortic arch. Aberrant subclavian arteries were found in five cases. From our observations and a survey of the previously published patients it appears that 90 per cent of the necropsy-proven cases of DiGeorge syndrome have cardiovascular malformations and that 95 per cent of these malformations can be classified as aortic arch anomalies, truncus arteriosus, or tetralogy of Fallot. Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia is often associated with complete or partial absence of the parathyroid glands and almost invariably with cardiovascular malformations. As both the thymus and parathyroid glands are derivatives of the same embryonic structures, this developmental anomaly has been called the III-IV pharyngeal pouch syndrome. ' 2 DiGeorge 3 described the clinical syndrome charac-terised by <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypocalcaemia</b> and defective thymus-dependent cellular immunity in infancy in which {{the most common cause of}} death is severe cardiac malformation usually involving the aortic arch or conotruncus. Our recent experience with 10 patients who died within the first year of life and came to necropsy indicates that this syndrome is not as rare as generally thought. This paper deals with the cardiovascular findings and reviews the published reports...|$|E
