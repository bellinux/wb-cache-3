500|$|The {{parliamentary}} election {{took place on}} 30 May 1999, just two months after Sargsyan's and Demirchyan's announcement about their decision to form an alliance.

[...] ODIHR's final report described the election as [...] "a step towards compliance with OSCE Commitments" [...] and claimed that, along with improvements to the electoral framework and the political environment, serious issues remained. The Council of Europe also suggested [...] "considerable improvement" [...] from the past elections. The <b>National</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Institute</b> report was more critical, saying it [...] "failed to meet international standards" [...] and that it proved to be the continuation of the flawed 1995 {{parliamentary election}}s, differing only in [...] "the methods and types of manipulation." ...|$|E
