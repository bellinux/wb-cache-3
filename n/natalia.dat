5|$|The {{birth of}} Nicholas's son Alexei in 1904 moved Michael back to second-in-line, but Alexei {{inherited}} the blood-clotting disorder haemophilia {{and was not}} expected to live. Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took <b>Natalia</b> Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. Nicholas sent Michael to Orel to avoid scandal but this did not deter Michael, who travelled frequently to see his mistress. After the couple's only child, George, was born in 1910, Michael brought <b>Natalia</b> to St. Petersburg where she was shunned by society. In 1912, Michael shocked Nicholas by marrying <b>Natalia</b> {{in the hope that}} he would be removed from the line of succession. Michael and <b>Natalia</b> left Russia to live in exile abroad in France, Switzerland and England.|$|E

5|$|The Perm {{authorities}} distributed a concocted {{cover story}} that Michael was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Chelyshev and Borunov were arrested. Shortly before his own arrest, Colonel Peter Znamerovsky, a former Imperial army officer also exiled to Perm, managed to send <b>Natalia</b> a brief telegram saying that Michael had disappeared. Znamerovsky, Chelyshev and Borunov were all {{killed by the}} Perm Bolsheviks. Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. In the ultimately forlorn hope that Michael would ally with Germany, the Germans arranged for <b>Natalia</b> and her daughter to escape to Kiev in German-controlled Ukraine. On {{the collapse of the}} Germans in November 1918, <b>Natalia</b> fled to the coast, and she and her daughter were evacuated by the British Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1918, Uritsky sent Michael and Johnson to Perm, a {{thousand}} miles to the east, {{on the order of}} the Council of the People's Commissars, which included both Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. The journey, by freight train in a coach without windows or heat, took eight days at an average speed of 5 miles per hour. At first, Michael was billeted in a hotel but two days after his arrival he was jailed by the local Soviet. <b>Natalia</b> lobbied the Commissars in Petrograd for his release and, on 9 April 1918, he was set at liberty within Perm. He moved into the best room in the best hotel in Perm, along with Johnson and two manservants, valet Vasily Chelyshev and former chauffeur Borunov. <b>Natalia</b> feared for George's safety, and in March 1918, she arranged for him to be smuggled out of Russia by his nanny with the help of Danish diplomats and the Putyatins.|$|E

Molotov and La Ley has won the most awards in the category, with two wins each. <b>Natalia</b> y La Forquetina, the short-lived band of Mexican singer-songwriter <b>Natalia</b> Lafourcade, is the only band led by a woman to be awarded. Spanish band Jarabe de Palo is the most nominated ensemble without a win, with three unsuccessful attempts.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Michael telegraphed the Tsar requesting permission to return to Russia {{to serve in the}} army, providing his wife and son could come too. Nicholas agreed and Michael travelled back to Saint Petersburg, via Newcastle, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Michael had already leased Paddockhurst in Sussex, an estate larger than Knebworth, and had planned to move there on the expiry of the Knebworth lease. He moved his furniture and furnishings there. The war was not expected to last long and the couple assumed they would be moving back to England at its conclusion. In the meantime, Michael offered its use to the British military. At Saint Petersburg, now named Petrograd, they moved into a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya street, Gatchina, that Michael had bought for <b>Natalia.</b> <b>Natalia</b> was not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces.|$|E

5|$|In May, <b>Natalia</b> {{was granted}} a travel permit to join Michael. Accompanied by family friends Prince Putyatin and Margaret Abakanovich, she arrived at Perm before the Orthodox Easter and they spent about a week together. Meanwhile, {{as part of the}} truce between the Bolsheviks and the Central Powers, prisoners-of-war from Austria–Hungary were being shipped out of Russia. Czech troops were strung out along the Trans-Siberian Railway on their way to Vladivostok, where they were due to take ship. The Czechs, though, were not going home to fight for the Austrian empire but to fight for a {{separate}} homeland independent of Austria. The Germans demanded that the Bolsheviks disarm the Czechs, who fought back, seized the railway, joined forces with Russians fighting against the Bolsheviks and advanced westwards toward Perm. With the approach of the Czechs, Michael and <b>Natalia</b> feared that she would become trapped there, possibly in a dangerous situation and so, on 18 May, she left unhappily. By early June, Michael was again ill with stomach trouble.|$|E
