5|$|After Curtis's death, the {{remaining}} members continued as <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> and achieved critical and commercial success. Although Joy Division's career spanned {{less than four}} years, the band continues to exert an influence {{on a variety of}} subsequent artists.|$|E
5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> also {{implemented}} the Dwifungsi ("Dual Function") policy enabled {{the military to}} have {{an active role in}} all levels of Indonesian government, economy, and society.|$|E
40|$|Despite current media {{reporting}} that assumes <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for durable goods (NDOG) are {{an indicator of}} future economic activity, the <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series does not improve forecasts of durable goods shipments. This result is true for both aggregate and industry-level measures of <b>new</b> <b>orders,</b> using several econometric techniques. <b>New</b> <b>orders</b> {{may have been a}} more useful measure of future shipments in the 1960 s than today. This failure may be caused by changes in manufacturing methods. In addition, the structure of the economy may have made <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> less relevant. Also, the <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series may suffer from measurement problems. Moreover, parameter uncertainty and instability may overwhelm any available information in the <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series. Analysts should consider reducing the emphasis placed on NDOG as a measure of future economic activity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper models {{industrial}} <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> across European Union (EU) {{countries for}} various breakdowns. A common modelling framework exploits soft (business opinion surveys) {{as well as}} hard data (industrial turnover). The estimates show for about 200 cases that the model determinants significantly help in explaining <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> monthly growth rates. An alternative estimation method, <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> estimated in terms of three-month on three-month growth rates, different model specifications and out-of-sample and real-time forecasting all show that the model results are robust. We present real-time outcomes of a European Central Bank (ECB) indicator on industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> at an aggregated euro area level. This indicator is largely based on national <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> data and on estimates yielded by the model for those countries that no longer report <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> at the national level. Finally, we demonstrate the leading content of the ECB indicator on industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for industrial production...|$|R
5000|$|Manufacturers' <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for {{consumer}} goods/materials — This component {{is considered a}} leading indicator because increases in <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> {{for consumer}} goods and materials usually mean positive changes in actual production. The <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> decrease inventory and contribute to unfilled orders, a precursor to future revenue.|$|R
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a <b>new</b> <b>order</b> antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of {{what appears to be}} an elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the <b>new</b> <b>order</b> may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>Order</b> {{was again}} struck {{down by the}} Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before {{proceeding}} to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the <b>new</b> <b>Order</b> in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E
5|$|Twelve other songs {{originally}} {{released in}} the 1980s have since sold one million units, eleven of them following the introduction of music downloads in 2004. The other song {{released in the}} 1980s to sell a million copies is Blue Monday by <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> which charted in several years during the 80s, but was not listed as a million seller until later.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers' <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for non-defense {{capital goods}} — As stated above, <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> lead the {{business}} cycle because increases in orders usually mean positive changes in actual production and perhaps rising demand.

5|$|Wolfenstein: The <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> is an action-adventure and first-person shooter {{video game}} played from a first-person perspective. To {{progress}} through the story, players battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, players must use a health pack to replenish the missing health.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein: The <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> was {{released}} to mostly positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 81 out of 100 based on 23 reviews for the Windows version, 79 out of 100 based on 18 reviews for the Xbox One version and 73 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version. Reviewers liked the game's concept, narrative and combat mechanics.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} operation {{plan for the}} invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in the <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{discontinuation}} of {{the official}} statistics on industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> by Eurostat in mid- 2012, this paper introduces the ECB indicator on euro area industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders,</b> which aims to fill the new statistical gaps for euro area total <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> {{as well as for}} various breakdowns. Despite the discontinuation of the data collection at European level, a large number of euro area countries are expected to continue with the data collection nationally. For those countries which have discontinued the collection of national data, model-estimates are used in calculating the ECB indicator on euro area industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders.</b> <b>New</b> <b>orders</b> are modelled across EU countries using 2 ̆ 01 csoft 2 ̆ 01 d data (business opinion surveys) as well as 2 ̆ 01 chard 2 ̆ 01 d data (industrial turnover) and applying a common modelling framework. The model determinants significantly explain the monthly growth rates in <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> across approximately 200 estimated equations. Various tests show that the estimates are robust. This paper demonstrates that, besides the leading information content of industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for euro area industrial production, the monitoring of the ECB indicator on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> is useful for cross-checking developments in industrial production in real time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe data of {{business}} and consumer surveys are often used for the prediction of the future changes of economics. But doubts that survey data are suitable for such prediction also exist. The objective {{of this research is}} to test how the survey data on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> corresponds to the real data of industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders.</b> An incentive to make such the research arises after the decision of European Commission to stop the collection of data on industrial <b>new</b> <b>orders.</b> The research showed that the survey data on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> weakly represents the real data of <b>new</b> <b>orders.</b> Moreover, the survey data on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> is not an appropriate measure for prediction of the future industrial production. It means that lots of managers participate in the survey irresponsible and don’t show the real situation or the questions that they must answer are not very clear for them...|$|R

5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The <b>New</b> <b>Order.</b> Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 the <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: The <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the developers to interest players in the story. They also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion.|$|E
40|$|In {{economic}} analysis the index on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for industry {{has become an}} important indicator because of its leading properties for forecasting other indicators as industrial production and industrial turnover. As a result the indicator on <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> has {{been included in the}} Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEIS) group by Eurostat. Nevertheless some analysis carried out by European central bank have shown contrasting results on the leading properties of <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for different group of industries (MIGS). In this paper we explore deeply this issues looking at the Italian microdata based on the monthly survey on turnover and <b>new</b> <b>orders.</b> Firstly we move at subsection level of economic activity to investigate the relationship between <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> and turnover. This exploratory part is based on a traditional time series approach. Considering the theory behind this approach we presume that the difficulties to make inferences about the leading characteristic of <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> using an aggregate approach can be overcome by panel data estimation. Panel data gathered on firms can reduce the bias introduced by aggregating data over firms. Moreover microdata can be useful to reduce the heterogeneity between different firms that can not be considered using a time series approach to study the relation between <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> and industrial turnover. The final part of the work will relate on the comparison between the micro and macro approach looking at {{the pros and cons of}} each approac...|$|R

5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Production of Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI, {{originally}} titled Sejarah Orde Baru (History of the <b>New</b> <b>Order),</b> {{took nearly}} two years, spending {{four months in}} pre-production and a year and half in filming. It cost Rp.800million, receiving funding from the government. Cinematography was handled by Hasan Basri, with music by Arifin's brother Embie C. Noer. Editing was done by Supandi. Parts of the film, particularly the final ten minutes, reused archival footage and newspaper clippings contemporaneous to the events.|$|E

5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling {{party of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, had won {{the largest number of}} seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It is only the third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Morris {{has said}} that even without Curtis's suicide, it was {{unlikely}} that Joy Division would have endured as they were.

Eventually renaming themselves <b>New</b> <b>Order,</b> the band was reborn as a three-piece with Sumner assuming vocal duties; the group later recruited Morris's girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to round out the line-up as keyboardist and second guitarist. Starting as a member of punk group The Inadequates, Gilbert had become friends with the band's members and had played guitar at a Joy Division performance when Curtis had been unable to play.|$|E
