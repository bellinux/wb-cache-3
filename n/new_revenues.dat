5|$|Government {{administration}} and bureaucracy was strengthened under Rainilaiarivony's leadership. In March 1876, Rainilaiarivony established eight cabinet ministries to manage foreign affairs, the interior, education, war, justice, commerce and industry, finance, and legislation. State envoys were installed throughout the island's provinces to manage administrative affairs, ensure {{the application of}} law, collect taxes and provide regular reports back to Antananarivo on the local state of affairs. The traditional method of tax collection through local administrators was expanded in the provinces, bringing in <b>new</b> <b>revenues,</b> most commonly {{in the form of}} locally produced goods such as woven mats, fish, or wood. Rainilaiarivony actively encouraged Merina settlement in the coastal provinces, but coastal peoples were not invited to participate in political administration of the territories they inhabited. Approximately one third of the island had no Merina presence and retained de facto independence from the authority of the crown, including parts of the western provinces of Ambongo and Menabe, and areas in the southern Bara, Tanala, Antandroy and Mahafaly lands.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he left a}} still greater {{legacy to}} the city of Glasgow. At some point between the years 1175 and 1178, Jocelin {{obtained}} from King William a grant of burghal status for the settlement of Glasgow, with a market every Thursday. The grant of a market was the first ever official grant of a weekly market to a burgh. Moreover, between 1189 and 1195, King William granted the burgh an annual fair, a fair still in existence today, increasing Glasgow's status as an important settlement. As well as <b>new</b> <b>revenues</b> for the bishop, the rights entailed by Glasgow's new burghal status and market privileges brought new people to the settlement, one of the first of whom was one Ranulf de Haddington, a former burghess of Haddington. The new settlement was laid out (probably {{under the influence of the}} burgh of Haddington) around Glasgow Cross, down the hill from the cathedral and old fort of Glasgow, but above the flood level of the River Clyde.|$|E

25|$|Malta {{first issued}} revenue stamps in 1899, when {{the island was}} a British colony. From that year to 1912, all revenue issues were postage stamps overprinted accordingly, with the {{overprinting}} being done either locally or by De La Rue in London. Postage stamps also became valid for fiscal use from 1912–13, so no <b>new</b> <b>revenues</b> were issued until 1925–30, when a series of key type stamps depicting King George V were issued. These exist unappropriated for use as general-duty revenues, or with additional inscriptions indicating a specific use (Applications, Contracts, Registers or Stocks & Shares). The only other revenues after this series were £1 stamps issued in 1941, 1948 and 1954. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until at least the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Starting with New Hampshire in 1963, {{numerous}} {{state governments}} began to operate lotteries and other gambling {{in order to}} raise money for government services, often promoting the programs by promising to earmark revenues to fund education, for instance. In 1987 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that federally recognized tribes could operate gaming facilities on reservations, as this was sovereign territory, and be [...] free from state regulation. As tribes began to develop gaming, starting with bingo, in 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA). It set the broad terms for Native American tribes to operate casinos, requiring that they do so only in states that had already authorized private gaming. Since then development of casino gaming {{has been one of the}} chief sources for many tribes of <b>new</b> <b>revenues.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{thesis that}} the [...] "rise of towns" [...] was {{indirectly}} {{responsible for the}} medieval flourishing of Europe has been accepted, {{at least in a}} circumscribed form, from the time of Henri Pirenne, a century ago. Commerce generated by and the economic privileges granted to merchant towns across northern Europe in the eleventh and twelfth centuries paid for, in <b>new</b> <b>revenues,</b> the increasing diversification of society and ensured that further growth would occur. What was of great importance for the future of Scotland was the creation by David of perhaps seven such jurisdictionally licensed communities at ancient royal centers and even at new sites, the latter mainly along his eastern seaboard. While this could not, at first, have amounted to much more than the nucleus of an immigrant merchant class making use of the established marketplace for the purpose of disposing of the purely local harvest, in both crop and chattels, {{there is a sense of}} profound expectation inherent in such foundations. Regional trade and international trade never lagged far behind the opening of the royal burgh to the world, and that most such burghs were kept in royal demesne meant that the king reserved the right to an excise on all transactions occurring within their bounds and to charge custom dues on those vessels taking berth in their harbours.|$|E

2500|$|In 60 BC, Pompey {{sponsored}} an agrarian bill {{proposed by}} the plebeian tribune Flavius that provided for distribution of public land. It included land that had been forfeited but not allotted by Lucius Cornelius Sulla when he distributed land to settle his veterans in 80 BC and holdings in Arretium (Arezzo) and Volaterrae (Volterra), both in Etruria. Land was to be purchased with the <b>new</b> <b>revenues</b> from the provinces {{for the next five}} years. The senate opposed the bill because it suspected that 'some novel power for Pompey was aimed at.' [...] With this belief that Pompey was seeking new power, the optimates opposed the bill. They were led by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, one of the two consuls for that year. He contested every point of the Flavius' bill and 'attacked him so persistently that the latter had him put in prison.' Metellus Celer wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus Celer had the wall cut through to let them in. When Pompey heard this he was afraid about the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus Celer did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free. The antics of Flavius alienated the people. As time went by they lost interest in the bill and by June the issue was 'completely cold.' Finally, a serious war in Gaul diverted attention for it. Pompey had managed to support the election of Lucius Afrianius, who had been one of his commanders in the war in the east, as the other consul. However, he was unfamiliar with political infighting. In Cassius Dio's words he [...] "understood how to dance better than to transact any business." [...] In the end, lacking the support of this consul, Pompey let the matter drop. Thus, the Pompeian camp proved inadequate to respond the obstructionism of the optimates.|$|E

60|$|Property in Great Britain is secure. It {{would be}} a great mistake to suppose that that {{security}} depends upon the House of Lords. If the security of property in a powerful nation like our own were dependent upon the action or inaction of 500 or 600 persons, that security would long ago have been swept away. The security of property depends upon its wide diffusion among great numbers and all classes of the population, and it becomes more secure year by year because it is gradually being more widely distributed. The vital processes of civilisation require, and the combined interests of millions guarantee, the security of property. A society in which property was insecure would speedily degenerate into barbarism; a society in which property was absolutely secure, irrespective of all conceptions of justice in regard to the manner of its acquisition, would degenerate, not to barbarism, but death. No one claims that a Government should from time to time, according to its conceptions of justice, attempt fundamentally to recast the bases on which property is erected. The process must be a gradual one; must be a social and a moral process, working steadily in the mind and {{in the body of the}} community; but we contend, when new burdens have to be apportioned, when <b>new</b> <b>revenues</b> have to be procured, when the necessary upkeep of the State requires further taxes to be imposed--we contend that, in distributing the new burdens, a Government should have regard first of all to ability to pay and, secondly, that they should have regard to some extent, and so far as is practicable, to the means and the process by which different forms of wealth have been acquired; and that they should make a sensible difference between wealth which is the fruit of productive enterprise and industry or of individual skill, and wealth which represents the capture by individuals of socially created values. We say that ought to be taken into consideration. We are taking it into consideration now by the difference we have made in the income-tax between earned and unearned incomes, by the difference we make between the taxation which is imposed upon a fortune which a man makes himself and the fortune which he obtains from a relative or a stranger. We are taking it into consideration in our tax on mining royalties, in our licence duties and in our taxes on the unearned increment in land. The State, we contend, has a special claim upon the monopoly value of the liquor licence, which the State itself has created, and which the State itself maintains from year to year by its sole authority. If that claim has not previously been made good, that is only because the liquor interest have had the power, by using one branch of the Legislature, to keep the nation out of its rights. All the more reason to make our claim good now.|$|E
