40|$|Almost {{all models}} of plant {{resource}} limitation {{are grounded in}} either {{one or both of}} two simple conceptual models: Liebig's Minimum Hypothesis (LMH), the idea that plants are limited by the resource in shortest supply, and the Multiple Limitation Hypothesis (MLH), the idea that plants should adjust to their environment so that all essential resources are equally limiting. Despite the differences in their predictions, experiments have so far failed to discriminate between them. In a simple factorial <b>nitrogen</b> and water <b>addition</b> experiment in a Minnesota grassland, we observed shifts in allocation that, as in previous studies, are not all explained by a single theory. We found that leaf biomass responded positively to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>additions</b> but did not respond to water additions. We found that fine-root biomass increased in response to water additions, but only at low nitrogen levels, and that fine-root biomass decreased in response to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>additions,</b> but only at high water levels. To understand these responses we built a physiologically based model of plant competition for water, nitrogen, and space to predict plant allocation to fine roots and leaves. Critically, we include in our model the inherent variability of soil moisture and treat light, water, and nitrogen as resources with distinct mechanistic roles. Experimental results showed that plants were nitrogen and water limited. The model explains the experimental results, under conditions of co-limitation, as follows. Foliage increases with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>additions</b> but not water additions because leaf construction is constrained by nitrogen uptake. When water is added, plants spend a larger fraction of the growing season limited by light (and effectively nitrogen) than by water. Thus, water additions cause fine-root biomass to increase because of the increased importance of nitrogen limitation. The response of fine-root biomass to water <b>additions</b> decreases with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>additions</b> because these <b>additions</b> reduce <b>nitrogen</b> limitation. In general, our results are explained by sequential resource limitation. The rate of carbon assimilation may be limited by a single resource at any one moment, but the identity of the limiting resource(s) changes throughout the growing season...|$|R

The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture (U.A.D.A.) suggests different amounts of <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> to soil depending on such factors as soil type, rice variety being grown, crop rotation, etc. For example, the U.A.D.A. recommends 150 lb.

50|$|Nutrient {{enrichment}} is {{a pervasive}} global threat to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2008, Verhoeven et al. 2006). In marine ecosystems, increased flow of nitrogen can trigger severe algal blooms, anoxic conditions, and widespread fisheries losses (Diaz & Rosenberg 2008). In salt marshes, an important interface ecosystem between land and sea, nutrient addition has been hypothesized {{to contribute to}} widespread creek die-offs (Deegan et al. 2012). To test this hypothesis, Linda Deegan and colleagues performed a nine-year study at one site in Massachusetts. The researchers found that tidal creek enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus led to decreased investment in belowground nutrient gathering roots and rhizomes, increased microbial decomposition of organic matter, and eventual creek collapse and salt marsh loss (Deegan et al. 2012). Similar studies in Connecticut, however, {{have been unable to}} replicate these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012). Other eutrophication studies performed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008).

In this study, we present a biogeochemical process model, CEVSA 2, and use this model to elucidate the key processes that may strongly influence the carbon budget response to anthropogenic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition.</b> The CEVSA 2 model has included the effect of nitrogen on photosynthesis, carbon allocation, soil organic matter decomposition, etc. Our simulations show <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> stimulates the photosynthesis, net carbon sequestration, carbon accumulation in vegetation and soil, by contrary, the low level of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> decreases the heterotrophical and total respiration.

40|$|Abstract Just as {{long-term}} nitrogen {{loading of}} grass-lands decreases plant species richness and increases plant biomass, {{we have found}} that nitrogen loading de-creases insect species richness and increases insect abun-dances. We sampled 54 plots that had been maintained at various rates of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> for 14 years. Total in-sect species richness and effective insect diversity, as well as herbivore and predator species richness, were significantly, negatively related to the rate of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition.</b> However, there was variation in trophic re-sponses to nitrogen. Detritivore species richness in-creased as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> increased, and parasitoids showed no response. Insect abundances, measured as the number of insects and insect biovolume (an estimate of biomass), were significantly, positively related to the rate of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition,</b> as were the abundances of herbi-vores and detritivores. Parasitoid abundance was nega-tively related to the rate of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition.</b> Changes in the insect community were correlated with changes in the plant community. As rates of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> in-creased, plant species richness decreased, plant produc-tivity and plant tissue nitrogen increased, and plant com-position shifted from C 4 to C 3 grass species. Along this gradient, total insect species richness and effective insect diversity were most strongly, positively correlated with plant species richness. Insect biovolume was negatively correlated with plant species richness. Responses of indi-vidual herbivores varied along the nitrogen gradient, but numbers of 13 of the 18 most abundant herbivores were positively correlated with their host plant biomass. Al-though insect communities did not respond as strongly as plant communities, insect species richness, abundance, and composition were impacted by <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition.</b> This study demonstrates that long-term nitrogen loading affects the entire food chain, simplifying both plant and insect communities...|$|E

Global change drivers such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition {{are expected to}} alter the terrestrial carbon cycle with likely consequences for RS and its components, autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic respiration (RH). Here we investigate the impacts of a 3 °C soil warming treatment and a 50 kg ha(- 1) y(- 1) <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> treatment on RS, RH and their respective seasonal temperature responses in an experimental tussock grassland. Average respiration in untreated soils was 0. 96 ± 0. 09 μmol m(- 2) s(- 1) {{over the course of}} the experiment. Soil warming and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>addition</b> increased RS by 41 % and 12 % respectively.
