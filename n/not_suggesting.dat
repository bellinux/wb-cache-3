500|$|On April3 a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} a very active hurricane season of 17named storms, ninehurricanes and fiveintense hurricanes. The increase in the forecast was attributed to the rapid dissipation of El Niño conditions. The team also forecast a neutral or weak-to-moderate La Niña and noted that sea surface temperatures were much higher than average. The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was increased to 74percent; the East Coast potential increased to 50percent, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability rose to 49percent. However, the team's report noted that while they predicted an active season, it was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that 2007 would be [...] "as active as the 2004 and 2005 seasons".|$|E
500|$|In 1959 Terry-Thomas {{published}} his first autobiography, Filling the Gap, named after his spot in Large as Life; {{he explained that}} [...] "everything that has been printed about me is lies. I'm <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> the writers were lying, I was". During the year he also appeared in two further instalments of the Boultings brothers' series of institutional satires, having appeared in the previous three. The first, {{in which he was}} joined again by Sellers, was Carlton-Browne of the F.O., in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne, a character he described as being [...] "rubble from the nostrils up", [...] "a certain type of Englishman, the Englishman who reads The Times and no other newspaper. A brolly carrier. A squash player. A bowler hat wearer. White collar, stiff, of course". Film writer Andrew Spicer thought that Terry-Thomas's role [...] "was the quintessential upper-class 'silly-ass', a sad relic of a vanished world". The film was initially chosen as Britain's entry for the 1959 Moscow International Film Festival until the Foreign Office petitioned the British Film Producers' Association for it to be withdrawn on the basis that the Russians might consider the film to accurately portray British diplomatic behaviour.|$|E
500|$|Since President Johnson {{had dropped}} out {{immediately}} prior to the Wisconsin Primary, McCarthy easily won {{although he did not}} face his new challenger, Robert Kennedy, who was ineligible for the ballot because he entered the race following the filing deadline. Polls suggested that McCarthy benefited the most from Johnson's withdrawal, reached 22 percent among the Democratic field, up eleven points, and two behind the still-undeclared Humphrey and fifteen behind Kennedy. He traveled to Pennsylvania later in the month, to prepare for the state's primary in late April. While there, he discussed North Korea's seizing of the USS Pueblo, stating that the United States should [...] "expect once [...] to pay ransom...if you have ships adjacent to countries that don't respect international law." [...] He clarified that he was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the ransom should be paid, and agreed that President Johnson's use of negotiation was correct. He then compared his record of service to Kennedy, articulating that his accomplishments on civil rights paralleled {{a longer period of time}} than the senator. On April 23, McCarthy won the Pennsylvania Primary, receiving more votes than Kennedy, whose name did not appear on the ballot but ran as a write-in candidate.|$|E

In addition, the original sale price of the pamphlet, 50 cents, was a high price for the time (adjusted for inflation, it is equivalent to $ today), and the author says he expects [...] "a wide circulation".|$|E
2500|$|He is {{sometimes}} misunderstood as having promoted the infinite monkey theorem in his 1928 book The Nature of the Physical World, {{with the phrase}} [...] "If an army of monkeys were strumming on typewriters, they might write all the books in the British Museum". It {{is clear from the}} context that Eddington is <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that the probability of this happening is worthy of serious consideration. On the contrary, it was a rhetorical illustration of the fact that below certain levels of probability, the term improbable is functionally equivalent to impossible.|$|E

2500|$|Arax {{later wrote}} on this: [...] "I almost had to revisit his website {{to make sure}} that the ADL was still in the {{business}} of fighting not only anti-Semitism, but [...] "bigotry and extremism", and [...] "securing justice and fair treatment to all." [...] When Arax pointed out that the genocide had been documented as a fact by many prominent historians, and that Congress recognizes all sorts of people's history, including resolutions commemorating the victims of the Holocaust, Foxman replied: [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that an Armenian Genocide is the same as the Holocaust, are you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|David Cameron, {{the then}} new Conservative prime minister, said the murders were a [...] "terrible shock". He said the {{decriminalisation}} of prostitution should be [...] "looked at again", {{but he also}} added that: [...] "I don't think we should jump to conclusions on this – {{there are all sorts}} of problems that decriminalisation would bring." [...] Later, aides close to Cameron strongly insisted he was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> prostitution should be legalised and was more concerned with addressing the social problems surrounding it such as encouraging agencies to work together to help women off the streets or to combat drug addiction. Cameron has also called for tougher action on kerb-crawling and drug abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{before the}} start of the final, a spectator threw a plastic beer bottle at the {{competitors}} in the starting blocks. Though the race was unaffected, he was arrested. The man, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, happened to be sitting next to Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, who promptly struck him with her hand on the back of his head after the toss. LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> vigilantism but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player". Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court. He was later found guilty.|$|E

2500|$|His 1889 article [...] "On Alternating Sounds", however, made a {{singular}} {{contribution to the}} methodology of both linguistics and cultural anthropology. It {{is a response to}} a paper presented in 1888 by Daniel Garrison Brinton, at the time a professor of American linguistics and archeology at the University of Pennsylvania. Brinton observed that in the spoken languages of many Native Americans, certain sounds regularly alternated. This is clearly not a function of individual accents; Brinton was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> that some individuals pronounced certain words differently from others. He was arguing that there were many words that, even when repeated by the same speaker, varied considerably in their vocalization. Using evolutionary theory, Brinton argued that this pervasive inconsistency was a sign of linguistic inferiority, and evidence that Native Americans were at a low stage in their evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Beckett {{was one of}} 36 Labour MPs to {{nominate}} Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate in the Labour leadership election of 2015. Later, during an interview with BBC Radio 4's World at One, after it became known {{he was in the}} lead among the candidates, Beckett was asked if she was [...] "a moron" [...] for nominating Corbyn. She replied: [...] "I am one of them". Furthermore, in January 2016, Beckett claimed that Labour would need an [...] "unexpected political miracle" [...] if it were to win under his leadership, and [...] criticised Corbyn for failing to win back the trust of the electorate on welfare reform and mass immigration, saying: [...] "I think we had the right policies towards immigration, but the simple thuggishness of the kind of Ukip and Conservative approach is easier to understand and we didn't overcome those communication difficulties ... We have to try and work on ways to overcome that – I'm <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> we've done it yet".|$|E

2500|$|On 4 October 2015 Golden Horn {{was one of}} {{seventeen}} horses to contest the 94th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. As {{he had not been}} among the original entries for the race, Oppenheimer had to pay a supplementary entry fee of €120,000. The draw for starting stalls saw Golden Horn allotted the fourteenth stall, on the wide outside of the field: Dettori commented [...] "I’d have loved a single-figure number but we’ll have to deal with what we’ve got. We will make a plan." [...] Gosden initially said [...] "We are used to a wide draw in the Arc as Taghrooda had one last year and spent most of her time on that bicycle track they have around the outside of the course at Longchamp. We expected a high draw and we got one." [...] He later explained that he was <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> any unfairness saying [...] "I was merely having a joke... I'm sorry if other people don't have a sense of humour". Golden Horn started the 9/2 third favourite behind Treve who was attempting to win the race for the third time and New Bay, the winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. Found and Free Eagle were again in opposition and the other runners included Flintshire, Erupt (Grand Prix de Paris) and Dolniya (Sheema Classic).|$|E
2500|$|The DSM-IV-TR {{states that}} acts of self-mutilation, impulsivity, and rapid changes in {{interpersonal}} relationships [...] "may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of borderline personality disorder". [...] Steven Lynn and colleagues {{have suggested that}} the significant overlap between BPD and DID may be a contributing factor to the development of therapy induced DID, in that the suggestion of hidden alters by therapists who propose a diagnosis of DID provides an explanation to patients for the behavioral instability, self-mutilation, unpredictable mood changes and actions they experience. In 1993 a group of researchers reviewed both DID and borderline personality disorder (BPD), concluding that DID was an epiphenomenon of BPD, with no tests or clinical description capable of distinguishing between the two. Their conclusions about the empirical proof of DID were echoed by a second group, who still believed the diagnosis existed, but while the knowledge to date did not justify DID as a separate diagnosis, it also did not disprove its existence. Reviews of medical records and psychological tests indicated that the majority of DID patients could be diagnosed with BPD instead, though about a third could <b>not,</b> <b>suggesting</b> that DID does exist but may be over-diagnosed. Between 50 and 66% of patients also meet the criteria for BPD, and nearly 75% of patients with BPD also meet the criteria for DID, with considerable overlap between the two conditions in terms of personality traits, cognitive and day-to-day functioning, and ratings by clinicians. [...] Both groups also report higher rates of physical and sexual abuse than the general population, and patients with BPD also score highly on measures of dissociation. [...] Even using strict diagnostic criteria, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish between dissociative disorders and BPD (as well as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia), though the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders may help.|$|E
