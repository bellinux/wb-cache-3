However, the destructiveness and complication of accurate sampling detected by these methods have to take into consideration. By contrast, RBS is certainly a better alternative for the composition and depth profiling due to its significant advantage and quantification for both the thin films and bulk materials [35, 36].|$|R

Our results demonstrated that analysis of orientation of the immobilized cytochrome b 5 is possible (ref 2 & 3) and help to optimize and develop our sensing layer. We also recently developed an innovative concept to identify directly « on the chip » (without any elution) the biomolecules retained by mass spectrometry. We first validated the concept on a simple model (monolayer of albumin) with sensitivity for MS identification less than 1 fmol/mm 2 (ref 1). We further continued by developing immunosensors to catch specifically, in complex biological fluids like sera, low concentrated biomarkers (lag 3 protein). Controlling the surface coverage and repartition of molecules by AFM, mass spectrometry “on the chip” allowed to identify without ambiguity both antibody and biomarker. Our objective is now to increase the throughput of analysis. For that, we are currently working on micro-arrays.
