It presented live cases relating to investigations and enquiries, disciplinary and administrative action decisions starting with hearing of charge and leading on to disposal of cases. The identity of the offenders, witnesses and those who dealt with the matter as well as units and formations had been concealed. The case studies compiled in the book <b>were</b> <b>intender</b> to help the commanders by drawing suitable lessons by way of an opportunity to carry out a critical analysis of actual and him situations. A review of the book in USI Journal hailed it as a “valuable contribution for proper understanding of the subject through live case studies.” ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper <b>is</b> <b>intender</b> to <b>be</b> {{a simple}} example {{illustrating}} {{some of the}} capabilities of Radial basis function by pruning with QLP decomposition. The applicability of the radial basis function (RBF) type function of artificial neural networks (ANNS) approach for re-estimate the Box, Traingle, Epanechnikov and Normal densities. We propose an application of QLP decomposition model to reduce to the class of RBF neural models for improving performance in contexts of density estimate. Has {{been found in the}} QLP that such a coupling leads to more precise extraction of the relevant information, even when using it in a heuristic way. This paper is concerned with reestimation these four densities estimated by pruning a Radial Basis Function network using pivoted QLP decomposition. For comparison all RBF type functions with the same Gaussian mixture model as the sample data is superimposed on the plot. This application tool can be used to identify the density estimate from empirical data where presents many type density estimative. The QLP methods proves efficient for reducing the network size by pruning hidden nodes, resulting is a parsimonious model which identify RBF type multiquadric to re-estimate kernel function Box and Normal distributions.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the reading ability of preschool children {{in the district of}} Kota Tinggi, Johor. Mixed mode design used to explore the children’s ability {{in order to have a}} comprehensive understanding. Two types of preschool namely the government and private preschool selected in the study. For each of the preschool, two children, their parents and their teachers whose teaching them in the school were selected as respondents. Reading Readiness Test was used to measure the level of the children reading ability whereas the follow up interview was conducted in order to explain quantitative data. Thus the qualitative data is use to explain the quantitative data. Research findings of the children’s reading ability for both types of preschool showed no significant differences. Interestingly the comments from parents and the teachers <b>were</b> <b>intender</b> with the reading ability. Both parents and teachers were practicing the same culture and providing a conducive environment to the children. In other words, the culture and the environment were practiced and provided for any kinds of children regardless of their ability and background. It implies that in order for the children to excel in their reading ability, appropriate environment and culture should be provided. Recommendations and suggestions is also discussed...|$|R
