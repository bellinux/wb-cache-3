Therefore, the recycled aggregate satisfies the absorption specification. Also, add different portions of recycled aggregate to the mixture will have different degrees of influences on the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength. They mix 0%, 35%, 50% and 65% of recycled aggregate into the mixture and found that as the percentage of recycled aggregate are added increases, the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength decreases. We couldn't indicate that the recycled aggregate is not good for using just by comparing these data with the <b>natural</b> <b>aggregate</b> properties. If we use 65% of recycled aggregate or above, each physical properties will drop greatly. However, if we limit the portion of recycled aggregate adds to concrete, it won't affect each property much.

The results indicated that it is feasible to produce high performance concrete with satisfactory properties by using recycled aggregates and supplementary cementing material.
