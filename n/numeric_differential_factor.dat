In this work, we show that for a fixed output difference of an S-box, {{it may not be}} pos-sible to distinguish the guessed keys that have a specific difference. We introduce these differences as <b>differential</b> <b>factors.</b> Existence of <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> can reduce the time complexity of differential attacks and as an example we show that the 10, 11, and 12 -round differential-linear attacks of Dunkelman et al. on Serpent can actually be performed with time complexities reduced by a factor of 4, 4, and 8, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Integrating {{knowledge}} of cellular and molecular physiology in biologically realistic models of neural activity {{is a crucial}} part of modern neuroscience. Existing state of the art computational neural modeling tools such as GENESIS and NEU-RON are constrained in their application by their large computational demands. In this paper, we present QRN, a semi-qualitative neural modeling ap-proach based on QSIM, which achieves accurate and efficient modeling of nerve cells at the molecular lev-el, and provides significant speedups over <b>numeric</b> <b>differential</b> equation models. Qualitative modeling is well suited to computational neuroscience because nerve cells are homeostatic, maintaining many cellu-lar parameters within {{a relatively small number of}} nearly discrete states. We introduce a simple weight scheme for resolving ambiguity in QRN, and demon-strate that QRN models closely match both neurobio-logical reality and the results of numeric models. We also present a simplified model, SQRN, that achieves the same results at even greater efficiency. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigate}} {{the factor structure}} of the Nowicki-Strickland locus of control scales for children. A major objective of the research was to provide empirical evidence that can help to reveal the multi-dimensionality (or uni-dimensionality) of locus of control. This is an important distinction because locus of control will be a superior predictor of behavior if it is multi-(as opposed to uni-) dimensional. Responses of 449 elementary school children, 388 junior high students, and 389 high school students to the Nowicki-Strickland scales were factor analyzed. Results indicated that there was a general factor (dealing with feelings of helplessness) across all ages. However, other factors were not nearly as general across ages. The <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> may also be sex related at different age leveii. It was hypothesized that the <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> may reveal important developmental tasks relevant at each age level. Results are discussed with regard to their implications for locus of control of scales in general, and differential scoring and creation of subtests to reflect these factors are suggested as logical next steps.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the knowledge of strategic factors that explain the competitive position reached by firms in their activity sector. We have used a survey carried out in 1999 on 287 executives that belong to the service sector in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. We have analysed the <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> that distinguish the strategic performance of competitive vis- "a-vis non-competitive firms, by jointly assessing the variables representative of the sector (five competitive forces defined by Porter) and variables of an internal feature. Finally, we have moved the level of analysis from the industry to the firm; specifically, we have focused on managerial capabilities due to the significant role played by managers in the strategic decision-making process. The use of cluster analysis to classify firms depending on their degree of competitiveness and the application of the See 5 induction algorithm of rules and decision trees to determine the <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> that distinguish competitive from non-competitive firms, provide a methodological framework for the most significant contributions of this work.

From Q-mode factor analy-sis of the data, eight significant factor groups for species have been noted explaining> 89 % of the variance. Among the species recorded, 16 species during post-monsoon season (Novem-ber) and 34 species during pre-monsoon season (May) form the <b>differential</b> <b>factor</b> groups providing maximum information for the distribution of the fauna. Fifteen stations are also grouped by R-mode analysis with five and four significant factor groups contributing about 85 % and 79 % of the variance in November and May respectively. Furthermore, the first two factor groups constitute stations mostly of the inner lagoon and they form the <b>differential</b> <b>factor</b> groups for both the seasons. The faunal assemblages obtained from the cross plot of the factor loadings of the first two factors for these seasons show that the outer channel (Assemblages I and II) is quite distinct from that of the inner lagoon (Assemblage III) of the lake and thus testifying to the presence of two biofacies: facies 1 (inner lagoon facies) domi-nated by Miliammina fusca, while facies 2 (outer channel facies) by Ammonia beccani (Linne).

40|$|The {{objective}} of research was {{a detailed analysis}} of the demography of the Corn Belt {{at the time of the}} latest available census. This necessitated a description of the spatial variation in demographic characteristics together with a consideration of the causative factors involved and the relationship between demographic features and other socio-economic phenomena in the distinctive agricultural economy of the Corn Belt. Despite the distinctiveness of the Corn Belt the area was shown to be in no sense a uniform demographic region. In all aspects of demography significant contrasts occurred spatially and these were shown to be related to numerous <b>differential</b> <b>factors</b> of which the most important were residence, cultural composition, age and sex, occupational characteristics and contrasts in the date and nature of the initial occupance. Of these the type of residence was found to be the most consistent <b>differential</b> <b>factor</b> in demographic characteristics. In addition, migration was shown to be a demographic constant in the evolution of the population of the Corn Belt and in particular was a vital factor in the development of the present complex pattern of distribution and density. The latter was shown to be a composite structure in which an irregular urban and suburban distribution was super imposed on a relatively uniform distribution of rural population composed of the agricultural labour force and rural service centres. The evolution of this composite pattern was related to the differential growth of urban and rural population and involved considerable redistribution by internal migration. The result has been a concentration of the majority of the population in urban centres in activities unrelated directly to the agricultural economy, while in the basic rural distribution rural depopulation was shown to have regional significance...|$|R
