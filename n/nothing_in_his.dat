5|$|Longstreet {{served with}} {{distinction}} in the Mexican–American War with the 8th U.S. Infantry. He fought under Zachary Taylor as a lieutenant in May 1846 in the battles of Palo Alto and Battle of Resaca de la Palma, while saying <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoirs {{about his personal}} role in the battles. He fought again with Taylor's army at the Battle of Monterrey in September 1846. He received brevet promotions to captain for Contreras and Churubusco and to major for Molino del Rey. In the Battle of Chapultepec on September 12, 1847, he {{was wounded in the}} thigh while charging up the hill with his regimental colors; falling, he handed the flag to his friend, Lt. George E. Pickett, who was able to reach the summit.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E
25|$|According to his manifesto, Rodger {{had saved}} $5,000 of pocket money, which {{was given to}} him by his parents and grandmothers, in order to {{purchase}} the weapons and supplies that he needed for the attacks. Gun law experts have said that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> known history that prevented him from making legal firearm purchases.|$|E
60|$|Prince Shan looked {{downwards}} at her, and {{she began}} to tremble again. There was <b>nothing</b> threatening <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes, <b>nothing</b> menacing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> expression. Nevertheless, she felt the chill of death.|$|R
60|$|He gave me no time {{to recover}} myself. He {{proceeded}} with {{what he had to}} say--speaking, mind, in the tone of a perfectly well-bred man; with <b>nothing</b> wild <b>in</b> <b>his</b> look, and <b>nothing</b> odd <b>in</b> <b>his</b> manner.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} these documents, there are no written {{accounts}} of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there {{ought to have been}} if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as {{a major player in the}} story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> extant writings that can confirm the story.|$|E
25|$|Robert Boyle (1627–1691) {{pioneered the}} {{scientific}} method in chemical investigations. He assumed <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data. Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, {{the position of the}} Sun and Moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant. This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton.|$|E
25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E

25|$|Kléber {{emerged as}} {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest generals of the French revolutionary epoch. Though he distrusted his powers and declined the responsibility of supreme command, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career to show that he would have been unequal to it. As a second-in-command no general of his time excelled him. His conduct of affairs in Egypt, {{at a time when the}} treasury was empty and the troops were discontented for want of pay, shows that his powers as an administrator were little – if at all – inferior to those he possessed as a general.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} White's style it is {{important}} note that while he spent almost {{all of his life}} from 1906 to 1925 living in New York City, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> photographs to indicate he ever lived there. There were no streets scenes or people in the city, no buildings, bridges, ships or automobiles. Unlike most of his photographer friends, he chose to ignore the very place he lived except for the access it gave him to promote his work and to teach others. Although he was pragmatic in his need to earn a living and advance his art, he remained true to his small town roots throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|The General being {{desirous of}} {{selecting}} a particular number of men, as a Guard for himself, and baggage, The Colonel, or commanding Officer, {{of each of}} the established Regiments, (the Artillery and Rifflemen excepted) will furnish him with four, that the number wanted may be chosen out of them. His Excellency depends upon the Colonels for good Men, such as they can recommend for their sobriety, honesty, and good behaviour; he wishes them to be from five feet, eight Inches high, to five feet, ten Inches; handsomely and well made, and as there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eyes more desirable, than Cleanliness in a Soldier, he desires that particular attention may be made, in the choice of such men, as are neat, and spruce. They are all to be at Head Quarters to morrow precisely at twelve, at noon, when the Number wanted will be fixed upon. The General neither wants men with uniforms, or arms, nor does he desire any man to be sent to him, that is not perfectly willing, and desirous, of being of this guard. They should be drill'd men.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, al-Husseini received a commission in the Ottoman Army as an artillery officer and {{was assigned to the}} Forty-Seventh Brigade stationed in and around the city of Izmir. In November 1916 he obtained a three-month disability leave from the army and returned to Jerusalem. He was recovering from an illness there when the city was captured by the British a year later. The British and Sherifian armies, for which some 500 Palestinian Arabs were estimated to have volunteered, completed their conquest of Ottoman-controlled Palestine and Syria in 1918. As a Sherifian officer, al-Husseini recruited men to serve in Faisal bin Al Hussein bin Ali El-Hashemi's army during the Arab Revolt, a task he undertook while employed as a recruiter by the British military administration in Jerusalem and Damascus. The post-war Palin Report noted that the English recruiting officer, Captain C. D. Brunton, found al-Husseini, with whom he cooperated, very pro-British, and that, via the diffusion of War Office pamphlets dropped from the air promising them peace and prosperity under British rule, 'the recruits (were) being given to understand that they were fighting in a national cause and to liberate their country from the Turks'. <b>Nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early career to this point suggests he had ambitions to serve in a religious office: his interests were those of an Arab nationalist.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Maltin was {{complimentary}} about [...] "Mecha-Streisand", {{and told}} Parker and Stone his children particularly enjoyed his portrayal in the episode.

500|$|President Jimmy Carter {{issued a}} {{statement}} that credited Presley with having [...] "permanently {{changed the face of}} American popular culture". Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted $18,000 to secretly photograph the corpse; the picture appeared {{on the cover of the}} National Enquirers biggest-selling issue ever. Alden struck a $105,000 deal with the Enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement. Presley left her <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> will.|$|E

500|$|... "White has {{the strange}} {{power to make}} natural historians of his readers, whether gardeners, historians or biologists", noting that this demands analysis. He observes further that [...] "White is {{straight}} out of Jane Austen. If {{it were not for}} his fame as a naturalist and writer, <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life would distinguish him from hundreds of country parsons in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Natural History of Selborne is an oddly unassuming masterpiece, its haphazard construction revealing the process by which White came to write it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reemphasizing his theme, Gladwell {{continuously}} reminds {{the reader}} that genius {{is not the only}} or even the most important thing when determining a person's success. Using an anecdote to illustrate his claim, he discusses the story of Christopher Langan, a man who ended up owning a horse farm in rural Missouri despite having an IQ of 195 (Gladwell claims that Einstein's was 150). Gladwell points out that Langan has not reached a high level of success because of the dysfunctional environment in which he grew up. With no one in Langan's life and <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> background to help him take advantage of his exceptional gifts, he had to find success by himself. [...] "No one—not rock stars, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses—ever makes it alone", writes Gladwell.|$|E
500|$|Mac {{is portrayed}} as near death at the {{beginning}} of the film, having woken up in a drunken stupor in a boundless, empty flatland with <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> possession, a shot that scholar Roy M. Anker said [...] "pointedly reflects the condition of his own soul". The dialogue in other scenes suggests the threat of mortality, including a moment when Mac has trouble singing due to his bad voice and says, [...] "Don't feel sorry for me, Rosa Lee, I'm not dead yet." [...] In several lasting shots, the vast sky dwarfs Mac, Rosa Lee and Sonny, starkly symbolizing their isolation, as well as the fragility of human existence. The fact that Mac sustains his newfound life with Rosa Lee and Sonny after his daughter's death, rather than reverting to his old pattern of alcoholism and abuse, is consistent with a recurring theme in Foote's works of characters overcoming tragedy and finding in it an opportunity for growth and maturation.|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Somerset, he was known for [...] " [...] a match with his {{cracking}} strokes in an hour." [...] Alan Gibson wrote: [...] "We hardly {{think of him as}} a stylist, and he was mostly a back-foot player, getting the greater number of his runs in the segments fanning out from point and square-leg. But he was enjoyable to watch, compact, tidy, combining powerful hitting with delicate placing. In the best Somerset tradition, he was always after the bowling, and in the best Australian tradition, he always relished a fight." [...] But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches: in an early innings for Somerset, he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey. [...] "The hook, he decided, was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method. Again and again he held the Somerset batting together. <b>Nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer." ...|$|E
500|$|Orci noted {{while the}} time travel story {{allowed them to}} alter some backstory {{elements}} such as Kirk's first encounter with the Romulans, they could not {{use it as a}} crutch to change everything and they tried to approach the film as a prequel as much as possible. Kirk's service on Farragut, a major backstory point to the original episode [...] "", was left out because it was deemed irrelevant to the story of Kirk meeting Spock, although Orci felt <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> script precluded it from the new film's backstory. There was a scene involving Kirk meeting Carol Marcus (who is revealed as the mother of his son in [...] ) as a child, but it was dropped because the film needed more time to introduce the core characters. Figuring out ways to get the crew together required some contrivances, which Orci and Kurtzman wanted to explain from old Spock as a way of the timeline mending itself, highlighting the theme of destiny. The line was difficult to write and was ultimately cut out.|$|E
2500|$|While {{letters from}} home {{reported}} his mother's efforts at economy, Whistler spent freely, sold little or <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{first year in}} Paris, and was in steady debt. To relieve the situation, he took to painting and selling copies he made at the Louvre and finally moved to cheaper quarters. As luck would have it, the arrival in Paris of George Lucas, another rich friend, helped stabilize Whistler's finances for a while. In spite of a financial respite, the winter of 1857 was a difficult one for Whistler. [...] His poor health, made worse by excessive smoking and drinking, laid him low.|$|E
