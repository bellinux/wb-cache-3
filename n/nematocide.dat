The metabolites produced by the fungal endophyte Fusarium oxysporum 162 when cultivated on rice media were isolated and their structures elucidated. Eleven compounds were obtained, of which six were isolated from a Fusarium spp. for the first time. The three most potent nematode-antagonistic compounds, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and gibepyrone D had LC 50 values of 104, 117 and 134 μg ml- 1, respectively, after 72 h. IAA is a well-known phytohormone that plays a role in triggering plant resistance, thus suggesting a dual activity, either directly, by killing or compromising nematodes, or indirectly, by inducing defence mechanisms against pathogens (nematodes) in plants.

40|$|The {{burrowing}} nematode of banana, Radopholus similis, is difficult, if not impossible, to control effectively. The lack of resistance in commercially acceptable cultivars and the perennial {{nature of the}} crop limit management options. Multiple-cycle treatment with systemic <b>nematocides</b> is presently the only effective tool available for reducing damage and sustaining yield. Most of these compounds are not toxic to the {{burrowing nematode}}, but only inhibit nematode activity for short periods of time. The repetitive application of non-fumigant <b>nematocides</b> {{has led to an}} increase in the rapidity of their biodegradation. From environmental, toxicological and consumer viewpoints, this type of pest management is unacceptable. Many {{attempts have been made to}} improve the situation with little or no impact to date.

Resistance has never been detected in commercial banana cultivars, and genetically modified cultivars are still unacceptable to a large number of banana consumers. Microbial-based strategies are considered to be a promising alternative approach to nematode management in banana. Progress can only be made if research and crop production systems are streamlined to support new management concepts. The following are discussed: 1) biological enhancement of planting material with fungal endophytes; 2) treatments with multiple nematode antagonists with diverse modes of action; 3) importance of induced systemic resistance in biological control systems; and 4) use of molecular tools to detect effective antagonists.

Unlocking the biology of these neglected pathogens using modern technologies will yield crucial and profound knowledge of their molecular biology, and could lead to new treatment and control strategies. Supported by studies in the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, some recent investigations have provided improved insights into selected protein phosphatases (PPs) of economically important parasitic nematodes (Strongylida).

For greater economy it can be diluted with as much as one part water to one part cassareep, without reducing any of its nematocidal properties. Four litres of this dilute mixture (i. e. two litres of cassareep mixed with two of water) applied from any simple watering-pail will treat one square metre of infested soil. The treatment is most effective when used on soil that has been prepared for plantng. The farmer must then wait 20 days before sowing or transplanhng because of the possible toxic effects of the cassareep on plantlets. Once the plants are established, cassareep can be applied between crop rows, after the alleys have been weeded.
