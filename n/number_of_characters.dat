5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{commencement}} of the first Gulf War, the second season's premiere was postponed one week. The season comprised 12 episodes, and concluded its initial airing on June 26, 1991.

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|Metzen was the Senior Vice President of Story and Franchise Development at Blizzard Entertainment and {{assisted}} the company's projects by providing voice talent for a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters,</b> {{as well as}} contributing to artistic character design.

5|$|Warriors have {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{but it has}} also been criticised for being confusing due to its large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters.</b> Critics have compared it to the Redwall series, though one reviewer commented that the series is less elegantly written. Although nominated for several awards, Warriors has yet to receive any major literary prizes. The series has reached the New York Times Bestseller List and has found popularity in many countries, including Trinidad, Germany and China.|$|E
5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> {{from earlier}} {{games in the}} {{franchise}} - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in Saints Row IV, many of whom take up the protagonist's Presidential administration.

A 13-episode anime series, D.Gray-Man Hallow, was produced by TMS Entertainment. It aired in Japan from July to September 2016 as a sequel to the first D.Gray-man anime series. Several items of merchandise have been produced, including two video games about the series.|$|E

5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included the ability for a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous games in the series but introduces new features such as a new control system and more levels in the upgrade system for weapons. It follows Ratchet and Clank's adventure through a fictional universe to defeat a robotic villain, Dr. Nefarious, who intends to destroy all organic life. Characters such as Dr. Nefarious and Sasha, a Cazar starship captain who helps Ratchet throughout the game, are introduced, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> return from the original Ratchet & Clank.|$|E
5|$|After Hergé had redrawn The Black Island for {{publication}} in the United Kingdom, his British publishers at that time, Methuen, suggested that alterations be made to Land of Black Gold before releasing it into the UK market. In the original versions Tintin arrived in British-occupied Palestine, where he was arrested by British police before being captured by the Zionist paramilitary organization Irgun, who mistake him for {{one of their own}} agents. In this revised version Tintin arrives in Khemed, where he is arrested by the Arab military police before being captured and taken to Bab El Ehr. The inclusion of forces from the British Palestinian Mandate and the Irgun were no longer seen as relevant and so were removed from the story. Background detail was changed accordingly, with Jewish shop fronts with Hebrew signage being removed. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> were also dropped, including the British officers Thorpe and Lieutenant Edwards. Whereas earlier versions had contained fictional Arabic script, for the 1971 version this was corrected to real Arabic.|$|E

Experimental results obtained by capturing network packets with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> matches, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pattern moves, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> comparisons as the main indicators. Experimental {{results show that the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> matches after and before improved is equal, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pattern moves decreased by about 13. 3 % after improved, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>character</b> comparisons decreased by about 15. 1 % after improved. This indicates that the improved algorithm improved the efficiency of pattern matching...|$|R
5|$|Bembo's {{technical}} production followed Monotype's {{standard method}} of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by American engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont and Fritz Steltzer, {{both of whom}} Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female {{and in many cases}} recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. From these drawings, Benton-pantographs were used to machine metal punches to stamp matrices. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters,</b> Tintin in Tibet differs from other {{stories in the}} series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include extrasensory perception, the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Tintin in Tibet was adapted for television, radio, documentary, theatre, and a video game, and {{has been the subject}} of a museum exhibition.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{identified}} several instances {{in the story}} that he argued linked to wider themes within the Adventures of Tintin. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia, and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen. Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy {{was that of the}} blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in King Ottokar's Sceptre as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to Jesus Christ and the Resurrection. McCarthy also opined that a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> in the book visually resembled Captain Haddock, a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, The Crab with the Golden Claws.|$|E

In a [...] "Subhuman" [...] mundane world, the characters have 25 - 50 points. In an [...] "Action-Adventure" [...] setting, characters get 50 - 70 points and so on.

5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team decided {{early on}} in the {{development}} process to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> present in the game, as well as to make Sonic the only playable character; this decision was taken to get more quality out of fewer characters. While it felt that these ideas combined with traditional Sonic gameplay was a good beginning, it also had to consider how to introduce newer gamers unfamiliar with the Sonic franchise to the series, and so the concept of the Werehog was born, in addition to exploring its own mythology and ideas for the story. Director Yoshihisa Hashimoto felt from the outset that there would be both praise and criticism, but hoped that long-term Sonic fans would understand and empathise with the ideas and direction the team had taken.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mortal Kombat {{game was}} released for arcade machines during October 1992, having since been ported to several console and home computer systems by Probe Software and released by Acclaim Entertainment. The sequel, Mortal Kombat II, was released for arcades in 1993, featuring an increased roster and improved graphics and gameplay, then ported to the numerous home systems in 1993-1995 by Probe Entertainment and Sculptured Software, released again by Acclaim; it was rereleased in 2007 for the PlayStation 3. Mortal Kombat 3 followed in 1995 in both arcade and home versions. MK3 got two updates which expanded the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> {{and other features}} from the game: Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, published that same year, and Mortal Kombat Trilogy the next year. The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, was released in 1997, marked the jump of the series to 3D rendered graphics instead of the series' previously staple digitized 2D graphics. Mortal Kombat 4 was ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Microsoft Windows. An update of MK4 titled Mortal Kombat Gold was released exclusively for the Dreamcast in 1999.|$|E
