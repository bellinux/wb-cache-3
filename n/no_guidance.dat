25|$|Test {{flights of}} XF-99 test {{vehicles}} began in September 1952 and continued through early 1955. The XF-99 tested only the liquid-fueled booster rocket, which would accelerate the missile to ramjet ignition speed. In February 1955, {{tests of the}} XF-99A propulsion test vehicles began. These included live ramjets, but still had <b>no</b> <b>guidance</b> system or warhead. The designation YF-99A had been reserved for the operational test vehicles. In August 1955, the USAF discontinued the use of aircraft-like type designators for missiles, and the XF-99A and YF-99A became XIM-99A and YIM-99A, respectively. Originally the USAF had allocated the designation IM-69, but this was changed (possibly at Boeing's request to keep number 99) to IM-99 in October 1955. In October 1957, the first YIM-99A production-representative prototype flew with full guidance, and succeeded to pass the target within destructive range. In late 1957, Boeing received the production contract for the IM-99A Bomarc A interceptor missile, and in September 1959, the first IM-99A squadron became operational.|$|E
500|$|Once it {{has been}} proven that {{modifications}} amounted to a [...] "treatment", that treatment must then be derogatory. Section 80(2)(b) of the 1988 Act provides that a treatment is derogatory if it constitutes a [...] "distortion" [...] or [...] "mutilation" [...] of the work, or otherwise damages the honour or reputation of the author. The Act gives <b>no</b> <b>guidance</b> as to what constitutes distortion or mutilation, and the courts have in some cases adopted the idea that these concepts should be {{considered part of the}} clause prohibiting damage to the author's honour or reputation, as in Confetti Records v Warner Music UK Ltd. This is because the alternative – simply looking at distortion and mutilation as individual concepts – could result in confusion due to the highly subjective nature of the words. Other judges have supported the interpretation that distortions and mutilations can be treated as individual concepts, and that treatments harming the author's reputation are only considered in that light if the treatment is not derogatory enough to constitute a distortion, as in Tidy v Trustees of the Natural History Museum.|$|E

Second, the Arizona Supreme Court had developed a body of law that defined the words [...] "heinous, cruel, or depraved." [...] Thus, there were legal standards available for trial judges to follow in imposing the death sentence.

2500|$|When {{she breaks}} with German {{practice}} and asks the judge at her trial [...] "What {{would you have}} done?" [...] about whether she should have left her job at Siemens and taken the guard position, her question indicates {{that she does not}} know that she could have acted differently, and her statement that there was [...] "no alternative" [...] claims a lack of moral responsibility. As a result of her shame at being illiterate, she has not only let the bulk of the crime be pinned on her, she has let those with a greater share of responsibility escape full accountability. Franklin writes that this is the moral center of the novel—that Hanna, as Michael puts it, chooses exposure as a criminal over exposure as an illiterate—and in Franklin's view the novel cannot recover from the weakness of this position. Franklin regards it not only as implausible, but the implication that Hanna chose the job and acted as she did because of her illiteracy appears intended to exonerate her. Her Nazism was accidental, and Franklin writes that Schlink offers <b>no</b> <b>guidance</b> about how to punish a brutality of convenience, rather than of ideology.|$|E
2500|$|The NJLA {{supported}} the American Library Association's position in challenging the 2001 Children's Internet Protection Act, which mandates public libraries install pornography filters on computers with Internet access {{in order for}} the libraries to receive federal funding. The Act was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in a 2003 decision. [...] "Obviously we feel it's a very difficult decision to implement. There's <b>no</b> <b>guidance</b> on how to implement it. There's a lot of confusion about what's going to happen and what requirements would have to be followed if federal funds were obtained," [...] said NJLA executive director Patricia Tumulty in a statement about the decision to The Star-Ledger. Tumulty said that the law would disproportionately affect libraries with less available funding. In 2002, the NJLA and corporate sponsor, the Verizon Foundation, started the nonprofit charity program New Jersey Reads to encourage literacy among the 2 million people in New Jersey who have trouble reading. New Jersey Reads was started with US$325,000 in funding from Verizon. In 2003, the NJLA organized a seminar for approximately 150 librarians, educating them on how to protect readers' privacy in light of the USA PATRIOT Act. [...] "We are grappling with this – we are a country at war and everyone wants to be patriotic, but they're forgetting the First Amendment," [...] said one librarian who attended the convention. The association organizes the One Book New Jersey [...] program, and chooses one book for each age group to promote literacy. In 2003, then-First Lady Dina Matos McGreevey was the spokeswoman for One Book New Jersey. One Book New Jersey was developed by the NJLA and the New Jersey State Library.|$|E
2500|$|Wagner's {{death in}} February 1883 was another deeply moving {{event in the}} life of the young composer. The song [...] "Zur Ruh, zur Ruh" [...] was {{composed}} shortly afterward and is considered to be the best of his early works; it is speculated that it was intended as an elegy for Wagner. Wolf often despaired of his own future in the ensuing years, in a world from which his idol had departed, leaving tremendous footsteps to follow and <b>no</b> <b>guidance</b> on how to do so. This left him often extremely temperamental, alienating friends and patrons, although his charm helped him retain them more than his actions merited. His songs had meanwhile caught the attention of Franz Liszt, whom he respected greatly, and who like Wolf's previous mentors advised him to pursue larger forms; advice he this time followed with the symphonic tone poem Penthesilea. His activities as a critic began to pick up. He was merciless in his criticism of the inferior works he saw taking over the musical atmosphere of the time; those of Anton Rubinstein he considered particularly odious. But he was as fervent in his support of Liszt, Schubert and Chopin, whose genius he recognized. Known as [...] "Wild Wolf" [...] for the intensity and expressive strength of his convictions, his vitriol made him some enemies. He composed little during this time, and what he did write he couldn't get performed; the Rosé Quartet (led by Vienna Philharmonic concertmaster Arnold Rosé) would not even look at his D minor Quartet after it was picked apart in a column, and the premiere of Penthesilea was met by the Vienna Philharmonic, when they tried it out under their celebrated conservative conductor Hans Richter, with nothing but derision for 'the man who had dared to criticize [...] "Meister Brahms,'" [...] as Richter himself caustically put it.|$|E
