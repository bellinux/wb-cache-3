The Cambodian {{economy grew}} by 5. 2 percent in 2003 compared with 5. 5 percent in 2002, led by continued growth in garments exports, a rebound in overall investments and an upward surge in agricultural production. The drop in {{foreign direct investment}} {{has been more than}} compensated by domestic private investment and higher consumption induced by higher public spending. Moreover, the weakness in the service sector receipts has been offset by continued strong growth in garments exports.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{economic}} crisis, i. e. the decrease in purchasing power in the Republic of Croatia, has been reflected negatively on the sales of new <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the maintenance plan of used <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A comparison {{of the results of}} technical inspections on vehicle roadworthiness has indicated a slight increase in unroadworthy vehicles, with a tendency for this to increase. Unroadworthiness and the average age of vehicles amounting to 12. 18 years prompt for thinking about road safety in the Republic of Croatia. This paper aims to establish the extent of the increase in vehicle unroadworthiness and the importance of its reduction in order to increase road safety. The Republic of Croatia has adopted the <b>National</b> <b>Road</b> Safety Program for 2011 - 2020, accepting thereby a task that will be difficult to accomplish without organising training on the importance of vehicle roadworthiness...|$|R
40|$|Ride {{comfort of}} <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{running on the}} ground has been {{extensively}} investigated {{as one of the}} main criteria in the design of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The information on the ride comfort of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> running on a long span cable-supported bridge under crosswind is, however, very limited. This paper presents an evaluation of ride comfort of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> running on a long span cable-stayed bridge under crosswind. The ride comfort criteria for <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> are briefly reviewed first. The principle of mathematical modeling and the equation of motion of a coupled road vehicle-bridge system under crosswind are then introduced. The framework proposed is finally applied to a group of high-sided <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> running on a real cable-stayed bridge under crosswind as a case study. Ride comfort of the high-sided <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> under various conditions of <b>road</b> roughness, <b>vehicle</b> speed, and crosswind speed is investigated for the vehicle running on either the ground or the cable-stayed bridge with and without crosswind. The results show that the crosswind influences the ride comfort of the vehicle in the lateral direction while the bridge motion affects the ride comfort of the vehicle in the vertical direction.

40|$|Several {{frameworks}} for the dynamic analysis of wind-vehicle-bridge systems {{were presented in}} the past decade to study the safety or ride comfort of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> as they pass through bridges under crosswinds. The wind loads on the vehicles were generally formed based on the aerodynamic parameters of the stationary vehicles on the ground, and the wind loads for the pure bridge decks without the effects of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> And very few studies were carried out to explore the dynamic effects of the aerodynamic interference between <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> and bridge decks, particularly for the moving <b>road</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In this study, the aerodynamic parameters for both the moving <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the deck considering the mutually-affected aerodynamic effects are formulized firstly. And the corresponding wind loads on the road vehicle-bridge system are obtained. Then a refined analytical framework of the WVB system incorporating the resultant wind loads, a driver model, and the road roughness in plane to fully consider the lateral motion of the <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> under crosswinds is proposed. It is shown that obvious lateral and yaw motions of the <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> occur. For the selected single <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> passing a long span bridge, slight effects are caused by the aerodynamic interference between the moving vehicle and deck on the dynamic responses of the system.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{taxation}} of ownership and operation of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Czech Republic. The result of study is the formulation of principles and functions that taxation of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> should meet, including the subsequent evaluation of the feasibility of the optimal structure of the proposed tax. The text identifies many requirements for taxes and tax system, and also functions which have to be fulfilled. These findings are applied to the taxation of <b>road</b> motor <b>vehicles.</b> We find out, during use of standard general methods of scientific work, that taxation of <b>road</b> motor <b>vehicles</b> must provide primarily a fiscal function of a tax in sense of selection of means for the renewal of environmental and other damage caused by operation of <b>road</b> motor <b>vehicles.</b> It is not suitable to prefer other principles primarily in terms of redistribution, stabilization, and other requirements during taxation of operation or ownership of <b>road</b> <b>vehicle.</b> It {{should also be noted}} that the model of the proposed tax includes several aspects that do not allow its implementation in optimal form. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to consider the introduction of at least the best possible alternative of constructed model of taxation of <b>road</b> motor <b>vehicles</b> in the Czech Republic. Beside objective theoretical reasons for the change of taxation of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles,</b> it is necessary to take account of efforts made by the institutions of the European Union within the meaning of environmental taxation of <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the European Union...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management and the Ministry of Environmental Affairs have {{initiated}} a sizeable {{research and development}} program to reduce road traffic noise.

40|$|Abstract—A Bond Graph {{model of}} a hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) powertrain test cell is proposed. The test cell consists of a motor/generator coupled to a HEV powertrain and powered by a bidirectional power converter. Programmable loading conditions, including positive and negative resistive and inertial loads of any magnitude are modeled, avoiding the use of mechanical inertial loads involved in conventional test cells. The dynamics and control equations of the test cell are derived directly from the Bond Graph models. The modeling and simulation results {{of the dynamics of}} the test cell are validated through experiments carried out on a scaled-down system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a safety analysis of high-sided <b>road</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{running on a}} long span cable-stayed bridge when the <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> enters a sharp-edged crosswind gust while the bridge is oscillating under fluctuating winds. <b>Road</b> <b>vehicle</b> accidents, including overturning, excessive sideslip, and exaggerated rotation, are defined first. The mathematical model and the equation of motion of coupled road vehicle-bridge systems under crosswind are then established, which include <b>road</b> surface roughness, <b>vehicle</b> suspension, and the sideslip of the vehicle tire relative to the bridge deck in the lateral direction. A case study using a real long cable-stayed bridge and a high-sided <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> is finally conducted, and an extensive computational work is performed to obtain a series of accident vehicle speed against mean crosswind speed, by which the decision {{on the threshold of}} mean wind speed above which the bridge should be closed to the <b>road</b> <b>vehicle</b> can be made. The obtained accident vehicle speeds are also compared with those for the same vehicles running on the ground. It is shown that the oscillation of the cable-stayed bridge will lower the accident vehicle speed when wind speed reaches a certain level. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
