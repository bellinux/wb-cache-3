50|$|Laterolog tools send an {{electric}} current from an electrode on the sonde {{directly into the}} formation. The return electrodes are located either on surface or on the sonde itself. Complex arrays of electrodes on the sonde (guard electrodes) focus the current into the formation and prevent current lines from fanning out or flowing directly to the return electrode through the borehole fluid. Most tools vary the voltage at the main electrode {{in order to maintain}} a constant current intensity. This voltage is therefore proportional to the resistivity of the formation. Because current must flow from the sonde to the formation, these tools only work with conductive borehole fluid. Actually, since the resistivity of the mud is measured in series with the resistivity of the formation, laterolog tools give best results when mud resistivity is low with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., in salty mud. Induction logs use {{an electric}} coil in the sonde to generate an alternating current loop in the formation by induction. This is the same physical principle as is used in electric transformers. The alternating current loop, in turn, induces a current in a receiving coil located elsewhere on the sonde. The amount of current in the receiving coil is proportional to the intensity of current loop, hence to the conductivity (reciprocal of resistivity) of the formation. Multiple transmitting and receiving coils are used to focus formation current loops both radially (depth of investigation) and axially (vertical resolution). Until the late 80’s, the workhorse of induction logging has been the 6FF40 sonde which is made up of six coils with a <b>nominal</b> <b>spacing</b> of 40 in. Since the 90’s all major logging companies use so-called array induction tools. These comprise a single transmitting coil and a large number of receiving coils. Radial and axial focusing is performed by software rather than by the physical layout of coils. Since the formation current flows in circular loops around the logging tool, mud resistivity is measured in parallel with formation resistivity. Induction tools therefore give best results when mud resistivity is high with respect to formation resistivity, i.e., fresh mud or non-conductive fluid. In oil-base mud, which is non conductive, induction logging is the only option available.|$|E

But in recent years, advances in space missions deserve a revisit of the issue. Though there exist a variety of advanced nonlinear filtering algorithms, most of them are prohibited for actual onboard implementation because of their overload computational complexity.

Moreover, a new strategy for sigma point construction is also developed to further increase the efficiency and numerical accuracy. Incorporating the presented framework and novel sigma points, we proposed a new, nonlinear attitude and rate estimator, namely, the Marginal Geometric Sigma Point Filter. The new algorithm is of the same precision as traditional unscented Kalman filters, while keeping a significantly lower computational complexity, even when compared to the reduced sigma point algorithms.

Because the satellite resides in the 705 km Earth Science Constellation, disposal strategies need to be considered to remove it from this densely populated operational orbit. Of critical importance was the need to examine the future potential risk to other satellite residents of the 705 km constellation due to an unexpected breakup event of the Terra satellite post-disposal. This study quantifies the comparative risk of debris impacts associated with the two leading candidate disposal orbits (701 km vs. 686 km) and characterizes the suitability of each orbit for the purpose of long-term spacecraft disposal. The increase in collision risk to any member of the 705 km Earth Science Constellation is very modest. The long-term, average, total risk (including the ambient background risk) due to a Terra breakup at a disposal of - 19 km (i. e., 686 km) relative to the 705 km constellation is 9. 7 10 (exp - 6) impacts/day versus 1. 0 10 (exp - 5) impacts/day for a disposal of only - 4 km (i. e., 701 km). For perspective, note that the <b>nominal</b> <b>space</b> background risk to the 705 km constellation is 9. 2 10 (exp - 6) impacts/day which implies a very modest increase in risk (approximately 3 % difference between the two cases) due to a Terra breakup in either disposal orbit...|$|R

We build upon recent notions that recognize the large disparity between relevant length scales involved in plastic flow processes around cracks in metals and on metal-ceramic interfaces. The lengths consist of (1) the Burgers vector, (2) the <b>nominal</b> dislocation <b>spacing,</b> (3) the elastic &quot;cell &quot; dimension, and (4) the overall plastic zone size. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of &quot;brittle &quot; crack growth {{in the presence of}} pre-existing, apparently mobile, dislocations, which has been observed in several material systems. A continuum elastic-plastic finite element model is utilized that assumes the presence of a dislocation-free strip of elastic material of height D surrounding a crack tip, from which dislocations are assumed not to emit. The parameter D is self-consistently chosen by identifying a maximum equivalent Mises stress in the plastic zone with that predicted by a phenomenological strength law of the type first used by Taylor and Orowan, in which strength varies inversely with <b>nominal</b> dislocation <b>spacing</b> or with cell size, either of which is identified as D in different interpretations of the model.

The differences in mechanical properties of K. montana silk compared with spider and silkworm silk are attributed to the distinction in amino acid composition ratio and internal morphology, and are likely to reflect the functions of the silks in these species.

We have fabricated and measured traveling-wave photomixer devices which have both embedded and surface electrodes - the <b>nominal</b> <b>spacing</b> between the electrodes was 2 micrometers.

The experimental data show a surprising difference in the behavior of ErAs:GaAs devices when the electrodes are embedded. A factor of two increase in RF radiation is observed for electric fields < 20 kV/cm. No such improvement was observed for the LTG-GaAs devices. We argue that the distinctive behavior of the two photoconductive materials is due to differences in the crystal structure - LTG-GaAs is isotropic, while ErAs:GaAs is uniaxial. We find that the carrier mobility in-plane (parallel) to the ErAs layers in the ErAs:GaAs superlattice is larger than orthogonal to these layers.

Here, we evaluated whether size or spacing limits letter recognition in people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who must use their peripheral vision. We measured the size threshold for recognizing lowercase letters presented alone, or flanked by two letters at various center-to-center nominal letter spacings (multiples of letter size) for 11 observers with AMD. For comparison, similar measurements were obtained at 5 ° and 10 ° eccentricity in the nasal and lower visual fields in three older adults with normal vision. Single-letter size thresholds were worse for observers with AMD than at comparable retinal locations in the normal periphery. For flanked letters, size threshold improved with larger <b>nominal</b> <b>spacing</b> up to the critical spacing, beyond which size threshold was unaffected by the flankers. Seven AMD observers had a nominal critical spacing between 1. 25 × and 1. 80 ×, values close {{to those in the}} normal fovea, suggesting that their letter recognition is size-limited; two had a nominal critical spacing of 3 – 4 ×, values close to those in the normal periphery, implying that their letter recognition is limited by spacing; and another two had a nominal critical spacing of ∼ 2. 3 ×, implying that their letter recognition is limited by both size and spacing.

Whereas bunches with the <b>nominal</b> <b>spacing</b> and transverse beam brightness were already available from the PS in 1999 [1], their length proved to be outside tolerance due to a debunching procedure plagued by microwave instabilities.

The entire process has recently been implemented successfully, and beams whose longitudinal characteristics are safely inside LHC specifications are now routinely available. Variants of the method also enable bunch trains with gaps of different lengths to be generated. These are of interest for the study and possible cure of electron cloud effects in both the SPS and LHC. The paper summarizes the beam dynamics issues that had to be addressed to produce beams with all the requisite qualities for the LHC. 1 THE LHC PROTON INJECTOR CHAIN 1. 1 Parameters of the LHC proton beams For LHC collider operation, three different proton beams are required: (i) the “initial ” or “commissioning” beam, permitting LHC physics during the first two years at a luminosity of 1033 cm- 2 s- 1; (ii) the “nominal ” beam for operating the LHC at 1034 cm- 2 s- 1; (iii) the “ultimate” beam, which is the foreseeable LHC performance limit at 2. 5 x 1034 cm- 2 s- 1.

40|$|Triple donor {{devices have}} the {{potential}} to exhibit adiabatic tunneling via the CTAP (Coherent Tunneling Adiabatic Passage) protocol which is a candidate transport mechanism for scalable quantum computing. We examine theoretically the statistics of dopant placement using counted ion implantation by employing an analytical treatment of CTAP transport properties under hydrogenic assumptions. We determine theoretical device yields for proof of concept devices for different implant energies. In particular, we determine a significant theoretical device yield (~ 80 %) for 14 keV phosphorus in silicon with <b>nominal</b> 20 nm <b>spacing.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ANTARES telescope, {{currently}} in construction, is aiming to detect high energy neutrinos. Data {{from the first}} line of the detector, which became operational recently, demonstrates that the <b>nominal</b> time and <b>space</b> resolutions are achieved. Various models predict the emission of high energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources such as Supernova Remnants, Microquasars, Active Galactic Nuclei and Gamma Ray Bursts. With the custom designed data acquisition system of this detector, in combination with the existing satellite alert systems, the ANTARES telescope has an increased sensitivity for neutrinos from Gamma Ray Bursts compared to conventional time independent sources...|$|R
40|$|Choked {{flow rate}} and {{pressure}} profile data were taken on sequential axially aligned inlets of the orifice and Borda type. The configuration consisted of {{from two to}} four inlets <b>spaced</b> at two <b>nominal</b> separation distances of 0. 7 and 30 diameters. At the <b>nominal</b> 30 diameter <b>spacing,</b> the reduced flow rate follows a simple empirical relation based on the reduced flow rate for a single inlet. At the nominal 0. 7 diameter spacing, fluid jetting was prevalent at low temperatures and flow rates {{were the same as}} for a single inlet. Previously announced in STAR as N 81 - 3039...|$|R
