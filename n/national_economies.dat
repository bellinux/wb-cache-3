5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of specific goods and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E

25|$|In this view, {{countries}} may develop unsustainable economic bubbles or otherwise mishandle their <b>national</b> <b>economies,</b> and foreign exchange speculators made the inevitable collapse happen sooner. A relatively quick collapse {{might even be}} preferable to continued economic mishandling, followed by an eventual, larger, collapse.

25|$|Controversy about {{currency}} speculators {{and their}} effect on currency devaluations and <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> recurs regularly. Economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that speculators ultimately are a stabilizing influence on the market, and that stabilizing speculation performs the important function of providing a market for hedgers and transferring risk from those people who don't wish to bear it, to those who do. Other economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.|$|E

25|$|The new {{economic}} system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike <b>national</b> <b>economies,</b> however, {{the international economy}} lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but the architects of Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, {{they set up a}} system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|Wharton {{professor}} Simon Kuznets, {{who later}} won the Nobel Prize in Economics, created statistical data on national output, prices, investment, and capital stock, and also measured seasonability, cycles, and secular trends of these phenomena.

25|$|According {{to later}} analysis, the {{earliness}} with which a country left {{the gold standard}} reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, Great Britain and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression {{and the length of}} time of its recovery {{has been shown to be}} consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries. This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between <b>national</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|E

25|$|In general, {{development}} {{entails a}} modern infrastructure (both physical and institutional), and a {{move away from}} low value added sectors such as agriculture and natural resource extraction. Developed countries, in comparison, usually have economic systems based on continuous, self-sustaining {{economic growth in the}} tertiary sector of the economy and quaternary sector of the economy and high material standards of living. However, there are notable exceptions, as some countries considered developed have a significant component of primary industries in their <b>national</b> <b>economies,</b> e.g., Norway, Canada, Australia. The USA and Western Europe have a very important agricultural sector, and are major players in international agricultural markets. Also, natural resource extraction can be a very profitable industry (high value added), e.g., oil extraction.|$|E

The geographic boundaries of a market may vary considerably, for example the food market in a single building, {{the real estate market}} in a local city, the consumer market in an entire country, or the economy of an international trade bloc where the same rules apply throughout. Markets can also be worldwide, for example the global diamond trade. <b>National</b> <b>economies</b> can be classified, for example as developed markets or developing markets.|$|E
25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For <b>national</b> <b>economies,</b> he rejects the need to require the free flow of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the free flow of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{is the increasing}} economic interdependence of <b>national</b> <b>economies</b> across the world through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.

Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E
