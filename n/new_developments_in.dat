5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Mälzel {{took the}} Turk {{on a tour}} of the United Kingdom. There were several <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> the act, such as {{allowing}} the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E
5|$|The SR West Country and Battle of Britain classes, collectively {{known as}} Light Pacifics or informally as Spam Cans, are air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam {{locomotives}} {{designed for the}} Southern Railway by its Chief Mechanical Engineer Oliver Bulleid. Incorporating a number of <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> British steam locomotive technology, they were amongst the first British designs to use welding in the construction process, and to use steel fireboxes, which meant that components could be more easily constructed under wartime austerity and post-war economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes that cross subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks.

These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> technology and educational research.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers {{would find the}} depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew {{up a list of}} 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the most}} recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to <b>new</b> <b>developments</b> <b>in</b> clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E
