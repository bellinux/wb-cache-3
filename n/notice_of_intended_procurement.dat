40|$|Beryllium {{in various}} forms is widely used {{throughout}} the world in ceramics, aerospace and military applications, electronics, and sports equipment. Workplace exposure to beryllium is a growing industrial hygiene concern due to the potential for development of chronic beryllium disease (CBD), a lung condition with no known cure, in {{a small percentage of}} those exposed. There are workplace exposure limits for beryllium that have been in place for several decades. However, recent studies suggest that the current American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) may not be sufficiently protective for workers who are potentially exposed to airborne beryllium. Early in 2005, ACGIH issued a <b>Notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intended</b> Change (NIC) to the current TLV for beryllium which entails a 100 -fold reduction (from 2 to 0. 02 micrograms per cubic meter of sampled air). It is noted that ACGIH TLVs do not carry legal force in the manner that OSHA PELs or other federal regulations do. Nevertheless, OSHA plans a beryllium rulemaking in the near future, and a reduction in the PEL is anticipated. Also, if this change in the TLV for beryllium is adopted, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that at least some sampling and analysis activities will need to be modified to address airborne beryllium at the lower levels.

Her brother Lewis and {{sister-in-law}} Enid, her childhood friend, advised her to join them in Jersey, where the tax regime was more favourable.

She was involved in a seemingly minor traffic incident in London on 13 August 1960. She drove across a zebra crossing and a child ran into the side of her car, fell over and grazed his knee. Digby did not see any reason to report the incident but someone else clearly did.

40|$|Bulk sales {{legislation}} arose out of {{an attempt}} to protect the creditors of merchants who would sell their stock in trade and either squander or secrete the proceeds. Under the normal rules relating to fraudulent conveyances, the creditor could pursue the property transfixed if he could show that the transfer was made with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, and that the transferee had knowledge of the transferor 2 ̆ 7 s design. However, since a creditor would not be entitled to relief if the transferee was an innocent purchaser for an adequate consideration, and it generally would be difficult to prove that the transferee was aware of any fraudulent intent which the transferor might have had, the protection afforded by the ordinary doctrines concerning fraudulent conveyances or transfers was inadequate. Under bulk sales legislation, the creditor is normally allowed to treat certain transfers in bulk as void if the parties do not comply with the statutory requirements regardless of their intent or the fairness of the transaction. The statutory requirements, though varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, ordinarily include the preparation of an inventory of the assets to be transferred, the preparation of a list of creditors, and a requirement that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> transfer be sent to the creditors of the transferor prior to the completion of the transaction.
