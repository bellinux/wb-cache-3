40|$|The formal {{expression}} of pro positional attitudes, especially when nested (iterated), {{is an important}} problem for AI. An interesting first-order extensional logical system for such expression has been proposed by Creary. In this system concepts (and concepts of concepts, etc.) are made explicit. The system includes &quot;concept functions&quot;, which are special functions which act on and deliver concepts. We point out a difficulty with these functions. A alternative system is proposed, {{in which there is}} a conceptforming function corresponding roughly to complexconcept formers (especially the phrase &quot;the proposition that&quot;) implicit in English sentences. The resulting system has a more primitive and natural <b>notional</b> <b>base</b> than Creary's has. We avoid problems with quantification inside propositions which are the objects of propositional attitudes by recasting quantified expressions into variable-free form by means of certain functions (&quot;combinators&quot;). ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} is a pendulum based {{on the outcome of}} the 2010 federal election and changes since, including the redistributions of seats in South Australia and Victoria. It is a Mackerras Pendulum, invented by psephologist Malcolm Mackerras, which works by lining up all of the seats held in Parliament (71 Labor, 72 Coalition, 1 Green, 1 KAP and 5 independent) according to the percentage point margin on a two-candidate-preferred basis. The two-party result is also known as the swing required for the seat to change hands. Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties in an election, the number of seats that change hands can be predicted. Swings are never uniform, but in practice variations of swing among the Australian states usually tend to cancel each other out. Seats are arranged in safeness categories according to the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) classification of safeness. [...] "Safe" [...] seats require a swing of over 10 per cent to change, [...] "fairly safe" [...] seats require a swing of between 6 and 10 per cent, while [...] "marginal" [...] seats require a swing of less than 6 per cent. The swings for South Australian and Victorian seats are <b>notional,</b> <b>based</b> on calculations by the AEC.|$|R

50|$|Confederate Ireland {{was arguably}} the only {{sustained}} attempt at Catholic Irish self-government between 1558 and {{the foundation of}} Irish Free State in 1922. Its style of parliament {{was similar to the}} landed oligarchy Parliament of Ireland established by the Normans in 1297, but it was not based on a democratic vote. Given their large <b>notional</b> power <b>base,</b> the Confederates ultimately failed to manage and reorganise Ireland so as to defend the interests of Irish Catholics. The Irish Confederate Wars and the ensuing Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649-53) caused massive loss of life and ended with the confiscation of almost all Irish Catholic owned land in the 1650s, though much was re-granted in the 1660s. The end of the period cemented the English colonisation of Ireland in the so-called Cromwellian Settlement.|$|R

40|$|Potential terrorists/adversaries can exploit a {{wide range}} of {{airborne}} threats against civilian and military targets. Currently there is no effective, low-cost solution to robustly and reliably detect and identify low observable airborne vehicles such as small, low-flying aircraft or cruise missiles that might be carrying chemical, biological or even nuclear weapons in realistic environments. This paper describes the development of a forward-based fence that contains a multimodal mix of various low cost, low power, netted sensors including unsophisticated radar, acoustic and optical (Infrared and visible) cameras to detect, track and discriminate such threats. Candidate target (Cessna, Beech Craft, crop duster, and cruise missile) signature phenomenologies are studied in detail through either theoretical, numerical simulation or field experiment. Assessments for all three modalities (Radar, acoustic and IR) indicate reasonable detectability and detection range. A multi-modal kinematic tracker is employed to predict the location, the speed and the heading of the target. Results from a <b>notional,</b> template <b>based</b> classification approach reveal reasonable discrimination between different aircraft tested in the field experiments...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{based on}} K[subscript: a]-W band dual-wavelength Doppler spectra {{has been developed}} for the simultaneous retrieval of binned rain drop size distributions (DSD) and air state parameters like vertical wind and air broadening caused by turbulence and wind shear. The rationale underpinning the method consists in exploiting the peculiar features observed in Doppler spectra caused by the wavelength dependence of scattering and absorption properties. A <b>notional</b> study <b>based</b> on a large data set of DSDs measured by a two-dimensional video disdrometer demonstrates that the retrieval performs best for small/moderate air broadening spectral width and when mean volume diameters exceed at least 1 [*]mm. The retrieval is also limited to ranges below cloud base and where the signal-to-noise ratio of both radars exceed 10 [*]dB, which rules out regions affected by strong attenuation. Broadly speaking, it is applicable to rain rates comprised between roughly 1 and 30 [*]mm[*]h[superscript: − 1]. Preliminary retrieval for observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site shows very good agreement with independent reflectivity measurements from a 0. 915 [*]GHz wind profiler. The proposed methodology shows great potential in linking microphysics to dynamics in rainfall studies. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
40|$|Proposals {{for space}} {{exploration}} architectures {{have increased in}} complexity and scope. Constituent systems (e. g., rovers, habitats, in-situ resource utilization facilities, transfer vehicles, etc) must {{meet the needs of}} these architectures by performing in multiple operational environments and across multiple phases of the architecture 2 ̆ 7 s evolution. This thesis proposes an approach for using system-of-systems engineering principles in conjunction with system design methods (e. g., Multi-objective optimization, genetic algorithms, etc) to create system design options that perform effectively at both the system and system-of-systems levels, across multiple concepts of operations, and over multiple architectural phases. The framework is presented by way of an application problem that investigates the design of power systems within a power sharing architecture for use in a human Lunar Surface Exploration Campaign. A computer model has been developed that uses candidate power grid distribution solutions for a <b>notional</b> lunar <b>base.</b> The agent-based model utilizes virtual control agents to manage the interactions of various exploration and infrastructure agents. The philosophy behind the model is based both on lunar power supply strategies proposed in literature, {{as well as on the}} author 2 ̆ 7 s own approaches for power distribution strategies of future lunar bases. In addition to proposing a framework for system design, further implications of system-of-systems engineering principles are briefly explored, specifically as they relate to producing more robust cross-cultural system-of-systems architecture solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the development and testing of a model that can compare construction performance across time, space, and economic system. Labour and capital productivity measures {{as well as the}} multi-factor approach were evaluated. Capital productivity alone, as a 'pure' financial ratio, appears able to deal with the key problems posed by indexation, to deal with inflation for time-series comparisons, and fluctuating currency exchange rates, for international comparisons. The major flaws with traditional capital productivity measures, particularly the problems inherent in valuing the 'capital' employed in a given industry or sector, are discussed and the model is developed to meet the objections. The notion of capital productivity employed in the model, while in computational terms similar to the traditional approach, is different in philosophical terms. Thus instead of than attempting to 'value' the capital employed in the productive process, the cost of capital 'sunk' is valued making allowance for <b>notional</b> depreciation <b>based</b> on the balance of the different types of assets employed. The discount rate emerges by counterpoising the discounted value of anticipated future profits against the historic cost of investment sunk into the current stock of capital goods. There are problems specific to construction, in particular the incidence of off-site prefabrication and plant hire, which tend to make traditional capital productivity largely irrelevant to the construction process. An input-output framework is used to examine the productivity involved in the total building process as opposed to the on-site activities. In addition, the problems of incompatibility across economic systems manifested in such issues as differential rates of indirect taxation etc., is allowed for by adjusting the price levels from market prices to 'eigenprices' an input-output based approach. The resulting model is tested via an inter-industry time-series Case Study of the UK over the period 1948 to 1990 using six broad industrial groupings. The strengths and weaknesses of the approach are discussed {{in the light of the}} Case Study results...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{aerospace}} systems {{rely heavily}} on legacy platforms and their derivatives. Historical examples show that after a vehicle design is frozen and delivered to a customer, successive upgrades are often made to fulfill changing requirements. Current practices of adapting to emerging needs with derivative designs, retrofits, and upgrades are often reactive and ad-hoc, resulting in performance and cost penalties. Recent DoD acquisition policies have addressed this problem by establishing a general paradigm for design for lifelong evolution. However, {{there is a need}} for a unified, practical design approach that considers the lifetime evolution of an aircraft concept by incorporating future requirements and technologies. This research proposes a systematic approach with which the decision makers can evaluate the value and risk of a new aircraft development program, including potential derivative development opportunities. The proposed Evaluation of Lifelong Vehicle Evolution (EvoLVE) method is a two- or multi-stage representation of the aircraft design process that accommodates initial development phases as well as follow-on phases. One of the key elements of this method is the Stochastic Programming with Recourse (SPR) technique, which accounts for uncertainties associated with future requirements. The remedial approach of SPR in its two distinctive problem-solving steps is well suited to aircraft design problems where derivatives, retrofits, and upgrades have been used to fix designs that were once but no longer optimal. The solution approach of SPR is complemented by the Risk-Averse Strategy Selection (RASS) technique to gauge risk associated with vehicle evolution options. In the absence of a full description of the random space, a scenario-based approach captures the randomness with a few probable scenarios and reveals implications of different future events. Last, an interactive framework for decision-making support allows simultaneous navigation of the current and future design space with a greater degree of freedom. A cantilevered beam design problem was set up and solved using the SPR technique to showcase its application to an engineering design setting. The full EvoLVE method was conducted on a <b>notional</b> multi-role fighter <b>based</b> on the F/A- 18 Hornet. Ph. D.

40|$|M. Tech. (Architectural Technology) It is {{estimated}} that commercial buildings are responsible for 5. 4 % of worldwide Green House Gas (GHG) emissions through their construction and on-going operation. In developed countries this figure can go up to 30 %. The environmental control industry {{is one of the}} large consumers of this energy. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) contribute approximately 15 % of South Africa's current peak electrical demand consumption according to Eskom (the South African electricity utility). The purpose of this dissertation is to analyse and evaluate methods to reduce the energy consumption of the HVAC system in a commercial office building. This encompasses careful building design to reduce heat loads and promote the circulation of fresh air; the use of energy-efficient air-conditioning systems and the incorporation of materials and technology to reduce energy consumption. This will be based upon a case study of the new SANRAL (South African National Roads Agency Limited) head office building in Val-DeGrace, Pretoria. A deductive research approach will be followed. The as-designed Actual Building is modelled with the appropriate energy modelling software and its annual energy usage is obtained. A benchmark <b>based</b> <b>Notional</b> Building complying with SANS 204 : 2008 criteria of the same size, shape, location and operational schedules as the Actual Building is also modelled and its energy usage results compared to that of the Actual Building. This comparison will determine how energy efficient the Actual Building's HVAC system is compared to a conventional Notional Building. Quantitative data collection is performed by empirical measurement of the energy usage of the as-built Actual Building. The raw data (power usageofthe HVAC system) is measured by Schneider Electric PM 9 c™ power meters located in the HVAC distribution boards of the building. This raw data are collected by Schneider Electric's ION Enterprise' power management software which has a user friendly interface from where the data can be downloaded. The power management software is connected to an ANDOVEWM Building Management System (BMS). Due to commissioning procedures and the timeframe at hand for the completion of this dissertation measurements could only be taken over a 7 month period. Operational data were measured from July 2011 to March 2012 thus accounting for summer, winter and a seasonal changeover period. The modelled energy usage results of the as-designed Actual Building are compared to the measured energy usage data obtained from the as-built Actual Building. This comparison serves to evaluate the accuracy of the software model [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{theoretical}} approach developed by JUMELET [2010] {{to acquire a}} physical description of the notional permeability coefficient applied in the VAN DER MEER stability formulae [1988]. Van der Meer introduced this coefficient {{to ensure that the}} permeability of the structure is taken into account, however due to the empirical character of Van der Meer equations and because prior to Jumelet's research there was not an available physical description of the notional permeability factor, the determination of this factor was rather vague. Because {{of the fact that the}} stability relationship includes the P-coefficient, it has to be estimated somehow and, therefore, the research carried out by JUMELET [2010] is, to some extent, the starting point to achieve the required physical description of the notional permeability coefficient. To obtain this physical description, the volume-exchange model is introduced, in which the external and internal processes that take place within a breakwater are coupled. The external process is described by a wave run-up model while the internal process is described by the Forchheimer? equation for the water flow through a porous medium. According to JUMELET [2010], the notional permeability parameter P is highly related to the run-up reduction coefficient from the volume-exchange model, and thus Jumelet defines an expression for this coefficient by means of coupling the notional permeability factor with the volume-exchange model. Because of the simplicity of the notional permeability coefficient formula developed by JUMELET [2010], further research is required to analyze the actual correlation between the notional permeability factor and the so-called run-up reduction coefficient (obtained from the volume-exchange model). This study focuses on developing a general formula for the <b>notional</b> permeability coefficient <b>based</b> on JUMELET [2010] and analyzing the real influence of the hydraulic parameters and structural properties on the P-factor. As stated by JUMELET [2010], the permeability of the structure depends not only on the structural properties but also on the hydraulic parameters. In this way, a physical description of the notional permeability coefficient is given and can be applied in Van der Meer stability equations to design breakwaters. Moreover, a damage level analysis has been performed to compare the observed damage by VAN DER MEER [1988] with the estimated damage through the combined method of Jumelet's model, the generalized formula for the notional permeability coefficient and Van der Meer stability equations, which leads to introducing the combined method as a tool to determine the maintenance policies in breakwaters by taking into account the damage that waves causes on them.
