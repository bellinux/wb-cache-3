2500|$|In post-glacial times Northeastern Minnesota {{was covered}} by forest broken only by these {{interconnected}} lakes and wetlands.

[...] While copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>ores</b> have been mined, the principal metallic mineral is iron. [...] Three of Minnesota's four iron ranges are in the region, including the Mesabi Range, which has supplied over 90% of the state's historic output, including most of the natural ores pure enough to be fed directly into furnaces.
