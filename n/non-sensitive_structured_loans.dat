30|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{tentative}} cases of this approach. For example, in accordance with the requirements set by relevant government departments, the Poverty Alleviation Office, Fumeng Country, Fuxin City, through its Federation of Poverty Alleviation Funds Cooperatives, was authorized to allocate 4 million yuan national fiscal funds for poverty aid. In order to ensure the performance of this poverty alleviation fund, they decided to introduce a solution that can change the poverty alleviation approach from blood transfusion to hematopoiesis, so they choose to cooperate with YILONGDAI ([URL] After more than half year’s preparation and consultation, the Poverty Alleviation Office provides a list of identified poor households to the local Yilong Loan Centre, which uses it own risk assessment and controlling model, and would then screen and finally choose from the list. Both parties worked together through the whole process from the beginning to repayment. Each poor family selected would be eligible to get a <b>structured</b> <b>loan,</b> composed of fiscal fund from the Poverty Alleviation office (not more than 20, 000 yuan for 1  year at a rate of 7.2 %) and social capital from YILONGDAI ([URL] (not more than 60000 yuan for 1  year at a rate of 18 %). As of January 31, 2016, the Poverty Alleviation Office and YILONGDAI ([URL] have jointly credited 17 poor households with the <b>structured</b> <b>loans,</b> of which 340, 000 yuan fiscal fund was used. It is expected that a total of 4 million yuan of fiscal funds will be paid out in July.|$|R
30|$|Fourth, the {{interactive}} mechanism between fiscal poverty alleviation and internet financial poverty alleviation should be actively explored. Up to now, {{the government has}} actually inputted {{a large amount of}} money in poverty reduction. However, this money appeared to be a one-way flow in the form of one-time fiscal aid. In fact, it seems that government fund has been going alone in poverty alleviation. We suggest that fiscal funds for poverty aid be combined with Internet finance so as to further improve the performance of fiscal funds in poverty alleviation. For example, the fiscal fund for poverty alleviation {{can be used as a}} reserve fund, once the Internet financial fund bears a loss, it can be partly compensated from the reserve fund. It is also possible to form a <b>structured</b> <b>loan</b> with fiscal funds and Internet financial fund. In such a <b>structured</b> <b>loan,</b> fiscal fund can be defined as inferior. For example, in a loan portfolio worth of 1 million yuan, 800, 000 yuan is raised from Internet finance, and 200, 000 yuan is from the fiscal fund. When the repayment amount is less than 800, 000 yuan, it will be repaid back to investors of Internet finance. Only when the repayment amount is larger than 800, 000 and that and investors be fully repaid can the fiscal funds be recovered. In this way, fiscal fund can be made more effective in poverty alleviation; besides, it can attract and employ more social capital for the purpose of poverty alleviation.|$|R

40|$|The {{end of the}} 18 th {{century was}} one of the most {{innovative}} periods in the history of securitization. Public markets for mortgage-backed securities are among the most interesting developments of the period. In The Netherlands, a network of merchant investment bankers used sophisticated methods for <b>structuring</b> <b>loans</b> based on overseas properties as collateral. In 1793, the Holland Land Company issued two structured notes to purchase millions of acres in Western New York. In 1794, the purchase and development of property in the newly-designated capital city of Washington D. C. was financed by mortgage-backed bonds underwritten by Dutch merchants. These securities raise questions about why investors trusted in the value of overseas property as collateral, and whether the expected rates of return on the instruments were commensurate with their risk. In our analysis, we address these questions by exploring how the early mortgage-backed securities were based on earlier collateralized fixed income instruments in the Dutch market, as well as other 18 th century experiments with securitization and collateralization of land. We argue that these innovative securities resulted from an institutional framework that easily accommodated novel fixed income issues, and came on the heels of large gains to market speculation in American debt...|$|R
5000|$|Indonesian slang {{generally}} {{uses the}} same pronunciation as standard Indonesian, {{although there are many}} influences from regional dialects on certain aspects such as accent and grammatical <b>structure.</b> <b>Loan</b> words adopted from foreign languages (especially European) such as English or Dutch are often transliterated according to the modern Indonesian orthography. For example, 'please' is often written as plis. Another closely related phenomenon to arise in recent years is the formation of complex nouns or phrases created using a combination of English and Indonesian (slang) in the one sentence. A prime example of this is the phrase [...] "so what gitu loh!", meaning [...] "who cares?!" [...] or quite simply [...] "so what!" [...] with added emphasis from the phrase [...] "gitu loh". [...] "Gitu" [...] is an abbreviated form of the Indonesian word [...] "begitu" [...] meaning [...] "like that/ such as", while [...] "loh" [...] (also spelt lho) is a particle commonly used in slang or conversational Indonesian to show surprise or instigate a warning. In these cases of combined, interlingual phrases, the original spelling (and quite often the pronunciation) of the foreign word(s) are retained. Hence, the English component of the Indonesian slang phrase [...] "so what gitu loh!" [...] remains relatively unchanged as far as spelling and pronunciation are concerned.|$|R

We classify firms into three borrower access categories: private, unrated public, and rated public firms. Private firms have the least access, whereas rated public firms who have public debt and equity have the most. We find that borrower access influences corporate <b>loan</b> <b>structure</b> {{in ways that are}} largely consistent with expectations. First, borrower access influences loan maturity, with the rated public firms using corporate loans mainly for liquidity and short-term financing purposes. Second, greater access is associated with fewer individual loan facilities per lending package.

Fourth, there is a non-monotonic relation between the number of covenants and borrower access. Unrated public firms have the most covenants, while private and rated public firms have less. Fifth, we find that loans to unrated public firms have a higher probability of being secured than those to the other borrower types.

Finally, we find that economic conditions influence aggregate market <b>loan</b> <b>structure</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} borrower access...|$|R

We find that the <b>loan</b> <b>structure</b> is a quantitatively significant factor in a household’s housing finance decision. The model suggests that the mortgage structure preferred by a household is dependent on age and income and that loan products with low initial payments offer an alternative to mortgages with no downpayment. These effects are more important when inflation is low. The presence of inflation reduces the real value of the mortgage payment and the outstanding loan overtime reducing mobility.
