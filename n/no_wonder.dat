5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{apparent}} differences between morphological and molecularly defined trees, a combined analysis was undertaken which confirmed superorder Liliiflorae as monophyletic, provided that a few modifications were undertaken. These included the removal of two tribes of Melanthiaceae (Melanthiales) and the inclusion of three additional families (Cyclanthaceae, Pandanaceae and Velloziaceae) from other superorders. This newly and more narrowly redefined Lilianae/Liliiflorae contained three orders, Aparagales, Liliales and Dioscoreales (which now included the stemonoids). This analysis also allowed {{for the establishment of}} a single synapomorphy, although this time by the presence of an inferior ovary. Significantly, the authors noted that it was <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> the authors of angiosperm classifications had been exasperated by the Lilianae.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

60|$|We distressed {{ourselves}} {{very little}} about the astonishing echo the guide talked so much about.

25|$|Budan's theorem {{forms the}} basis for Vincent's theorem and Vincent's (exponential) method for the {{isolation}} of the real roots of polynomials. Therefore, there is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Vincent in both of his papers of 1834 and 1836 states Budan's theorem and contrasts it with the one by Fourier. Vincent was the last author in the 19th century to state Budan's theorem in its original form.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} such {{references}} that indicate that music {{was an integral}} part of the Greek perception of how their race had even come into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods.

It was only after the war turned out to last longer than expected that German interest in an alliance treaty rose, although by then the Finns had even less desire to bind themselves with a formal treaty. Germany tried several times to pressure the Finns by cutting food and arms deliveries, but the military importance of Finnish participation resulted in their resumption quite soon afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The Farm Maps {{also make}} clear {{why so many}} {{property}} owners were distraught about {{the coming of the}} grid, and why some of them tried to stop Randel and his crew from completing their work. The maps are replete with houses that are directly in the way of where streets were scheduled to run, and lots that would be bisected, trisected, or completely obliterated by the streets and avenues of the new grid. <b>No</b> <b>wonder</b> people fought back against the Commissioners' Plan, or set their dogs on Randel and his men.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
