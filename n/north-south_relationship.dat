40|$|North–South is {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} directions on a map but has more recently become a way of imagining global geopolitics by categorizing countries according to certain ‘northern’ or ‘southern’ traits. Northern countries (often referred to as the Global North) are typically assumed to be richer, more developed, and more powerful than those in the south (the Global South), which have become associated with underdevelopment and poverty. North–South also refers to {{the relationship between the two}} zones, with the Global North typically seen as dominating the Global South through exploitative trade relationships and through political control of powerful multilateral institutions. There are many problems with the North–South geographic imaginary, not least the recent rapid economic growth of many Southern economies, yet it remains a useful division for identifying inequalities and challenges within North–South relations.

40|$|CROSS-BORDER BODIES AND THE <b>NORTH-SOUTH</b> <b>RELATIONSHIP</b> : LAYING THE GROUNDWORK The new North-South {{institutions}} established {{under the}} Good Friday agreement {{need to be}} seen in both historical and contemporary political contexts. Their roots are as old as partition: efforts to overcome some of the more negative consequences of the division of Ireland date back to 1918, when the idea of a Council of Ireland was first raised, and found more concrete form in 1920 and 1973. The inclusion of an important set of North-South bodies in the Good Friday agreement arose from a need to respond to certain practical considerations, but was also intended to provide a balance to the devolved institutions within Northern Ireland and the strong British link. Notwithstanding difficulties in several other sensitive areas, the North-South bodies have managed to function in a positive atmosphere of cooperation between ministers from very different political backgrounds, and it is possible to be relatively optimistic about their future development. CROSS-BORDER BODIES AND THE <b>NORTH-SOUTH</b> <b>RELATIONSHIP</b> : IMPLEMENTING STRAND TWO The development of the new North-South institutions {{has been one of the}} more surprising success stories of the Good Friday agreement.

The analysis demonstrates that a bauxite cartel has the potential to gain large monopoly profits, but the evidence is against the long run profitability and stability of coffee and sugar cartels. The differences in the characteristics of the primary commodities differentiate the behaviour of cartels and the expected outcomes. Ultimately, the benefits of successful cartels will have to be measured by how the financial gains are used to transform internal structures, eliminate poverty, and promote social justice. As well as being useful for the study of primary commodity cartels in general, this analysis can also aid policy makers concerned with producer cartels...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{thirty years}} ago, Harold Proshansky argued that if {{environmental}} psychology was to survive, {{it needed to}} “strengthen itself as a social institution”. While we can find much {{evidence to suggest that}} environmental psychology has achieved this, in so doing it has tended to concentrate on changes to individual consumption behaviours and lifestyles, rather than focusing on the everyday lives and conditions which frame the actions of individuals and communities. People live, work, and act in cooperation with others and this cooperation is shaped by and shapes individual and collective identities and actions. One of the central places where people act collectively is the workplace. Two case studies are presented. The first employed backcasting scenarios to explore employees’ visions for an alternative, sustainable future and involved scenario development by creating visions for the future, defining strategic pathways to reach them, providing feedback on how policy measures would function in a simulated environment and asking participants to suggest corrections to their initial proposals and the model design. The second case study reports on an international study of the role of trade unions in contributing to environmentally sustainable production and curbing the damaging effects of climate change.

40|$|It {{has become}} fashionable {{to imagine the}} world in which we live as in {{constant}} mo-tion. While people have always been on the move, processes of globalization have led to a sharp increase in travel across the planet. At the roots of many physical as well as imagined travels to unknown destinations are historically laden and socio-culturally constructed fantasies, be it in the context of tourism or migration. The global mobility of people and ideas implies multiple, often conflicting, representa-tions of peoples and places and it questions several core values societies across the planet hold, by blurring traditional territorial, social and cultural boundaries, and creating hybrid forms. What are the contours of power, agency and subjectivity in imaginaries of global mobility and the intersecting social categories those visions both reify and dissolve? How are widely spread practices of mobility such as tour-ism and migration erasing existing boundaries while at the same time erecting new ones? Is human mobility more than the newest form of accumulating symbolic capital? Who are the so-called ‘immobile’ and how are they creating their own forms of ‘mobility’? Interdisciplinary studies of mobility provide an innovative means to grasp the complexity of globally circulating people and the imaginaries surrounding such movements. As a polymorphic concept, (im) mobility invites us to renew our theorizing and policy-making, especially regarding conventional themes such as culture, identity and <b>North-South</b> <b>relationships.</b> This paper presents some preliminary findings of an ongoing transnational research project that traces how prevalent imaginaries of tourism to and immigration from ‘the South’ (Africa, Asia and Latin America) are (dis) connected. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{development}} of oil palm cultivation feeds many social {{issues such as}} biodiversity, deforestation, food habits or ethical investments. How can this palm {{be viewed as a}} 'miracle plant' by both the agro-food industry in the North and farmers in the tropical zone, but a serious ecological threat by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) campaigning for the environment or rights of local indigenous peoples? In the present book the authors - a biologist and an agricultural economist- describe a global and complex tropical sector, for which the interests of the many different stakeholders are often antagonistic. Oil palm has become emblematic of recent changes in <b>North-South</b> <b>relationship</b> in agricultural development. Indeed, palm oil is produced and consumed in the South; its trade is driven by emerging countries, although the major part of its transformations is made in the North that still hosts the largest multinational agro industries. It is also in the North that the sector is challenged on ethical and environmental issues. Public controversy over palm oil is often opinionated and it is fed by definitive and sometimes exaggerated statements. Researchers are conveying a more nuanced speech, which is supported by scientific data and a shared field experience. Their work helps in building a more balanced view, moving attention to the South, the region of exclusive production and major consumption of palm oil. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

This paper addresses the relationship between competitiveness and environment by intertwining the global and local levels of analysis {{in the case of the}} US–Mexico border, for which there is a specific link between international trade, local development and <b>North–South</b> <b>relationship.</b> The rising level of environmental degradation in the border area is linked to the process of industrial development that the area has experienced during the past thirty years, but this impact may be more indirect than direct. The growing awareness of this degradation and the subsequent steps which have been taken, either at a public or a private level, have been fuelled by the institutional process of economic integration between the two countries, culminating in NAFTA. These steps have impacted the strategies of firms in the border area and provided an incentive to the development of an EGS sector. But the characterisation of the local industrial development reflects itself in the kind of response firms have given to this incentive. To sum up, globalisation is marked by specific patterns of concentration of economic activity which entail specific local dimension of {{environmental issues}}.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} Chinese resources for infrastructure contracts in Angola. China has engaged in this mechanism that trades African natural resources for Chinese infrastructure construction with several African countries. The main debate {{in the literature on}} Sino-African relations is between scholars who see China as a neo-colonialist' that reinforces a classic <b>north-south</b> <b>relationship</b> of exploitation, and those who see China as a different development partner, emphasizing South-South cooperation and mutual benefit. The resources for infrastructure contracts have been used to construct the argument that China's engagement in Africa is ultimately aimed at securing access to natural resources. To examine this assumption, I conducted a case study of Angola, the African country where the resources for infrastructure contracts has been most pronounced in scope and size. Due to challenges of data availability I complemented the secondary sources with primary sources from fieldwork conducted in Luanda, Angola. I also drew on evidence from comparable cases to shed light on the mechanism. I found that there are strong indicators suggesting that resources for infrastructure contracts are not mainly a mechanism to secure Chinese access to Angola's natural resources. Rather, it seemed like a mechanism to mitigate the risks of extending a loan to a country with poor credit. However, this tentative finding is not automatically transferable to other cases as country-specific differences uncovered in the study shows the limitations in generalizing Sino-African relations from one case...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the practices {{and experiences of}} two groups of Canadian volunteers who visited the organic fanning and "alternative development" project ofFinca la Flor (FLF) in central Costa Rica. Using both participant observation and in-depth interviews with volunteers and other people involved with FLF, I examine volunteers' understandings of their involvement with the fann. I argue that three discursive fonnations are instrumental in shaping this particular volunteering encounter. Specifically, interpretation of these Canadian volunteers' experiences inspires {{the argument that the}} emerging practice of international volunteering (or voluntourism) exists at the intersection of discourses of development, volunteering and tourism, all of which both reflect and maintain problematic <b>North-South</b> <b>relationships.</b> The analysis shows that in spite ofFLF's construction as an (alternative / sustainable) international-development project, and in spite of volunteers' initial conceptualization of their trip as "volunteering," volunteers tend to act and describe their time at FLF in ways that look more like tourism than like volunteer labor or international development. Likewise, although FLF claims to principally be focused on alternative development, and merely to open up this authentic development space to volunteers for their participation, the organization in both practice and discourse seems primarily to construct a tourist experience and cater to the needs of foreigners as tourists. Discourses of development and volunteering do infonn the practices offann personnel and volunteers at FLF, but they become subordinated to the more dominant discourse of tourism as the volunteers' and fann management's ideals of development and volunteering capitulate to become focused on satisfying volunteers' (perceived or "real") touristic desires. The FLF participants I studied may have entered the encounter as volunteers, but they departed the site having been tourists...|$|R
40|$|The {{educational}} exchange relationship between {{developed and developing}} (not accidentally non-Western) countries has always been characterized by imbalances and asymmetries. Accordingly, the traditional forms of <b>North-South</b> <b>relationships</b> have been between donors and recipients. International {{educational exchange}} between developed and developing countries needs to be located in a historical context of colonialism, and many constraints continue to pose barriers to genuine partnership. Today, neocolonialism is the relationship that developing countries have to deal with. The present international educational equation has certain institutional and intellectual 'centers' that give direction, provide models, produce research, and in general function as the pinnacles of the academic system. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum are universities that are peripheral in the sense that they copy development from abroad, produce little that is original, and are generally not at the frontiers of knowledge. Educational institutions located in developing countries are strongly dependent on the institutions located in the centers. Meanwhile, the contemporary academic world is becoming increasingly multipolarized. A critical mass of non-Western scholarship is emerging, and beginning to force a reconsideration of traditional concepts and theories. The latest work in research fields is done at many more centers of scholarship than before. China, a giant periphery, as some scholars describe it, is especially noticeable and should be treated seriously, with its massive investment on research and development. Based on long-standing observation of the Chinese higher education system, this article explores the maintenance of international links in Mainland Chinese universities, set in an international context. It ends with some critical comments and constructive suggestions, with particular regard to the genuine collaboration and reciprocity in international educational exchange between the best institutions in the developed countries and their Chinese peers. © 2014 M.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the international market in mediating North-South relations and analyzes how the market works in distributing the gains from trade. It is argued that the international market does not always provide an adequate engine of growth for the South if that region specializes in labor-intensive products. The South's export sector must be carefully balanced with other domestic sectors to avoid harming the economy as a whole. Any excessive expansion of labor-intensive exports or raw materials, even if accompanied by an expansion in international demand may affect domestic markets and the distribution of income in the South in ways that conflict with sustainable development. especially when this is measured in terms of the satisfaction of basic needs {{for the majority of the}} population. The conditions under which this may occur are quite general. They are consistent with perfect market behavior but require that important features of the <b>North-South</b> <b>relationship,</b> including differential characteristics of technologies and factor markets in the two regions. be introduced into the analysis.

The rapid {{economic}} advancement of emerging {{economies in the}} South has come to effect a change within {{the nature of the}} global South and within the traditional <b>North-South</b> <b>relationship</b> more broadly. One development representative of a change within the global South as a unit has been the emergence of smaller, ad hoc, issue specific South-South groupings comprising the exclusive membership of emerging economies. While rooted in a common historic agenda of enabling a more equitable distribution of power for the South with the North, such new groupings have been increasingly independent and detached {{from the rest of the}} developing world. As such, they represent the ambitions of its members to garner more economic and political power within international politics. The BASIC grouping consisting of Brazil, South Africa, India and China represents an example, formed at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen as a bloc opposition against the suggested implementation of binding emissions reduction obligations for emerging economies as part of the global South. BASIC argued that this was primarily an issue of equity, departing from the “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities” between developed and developing states as agreed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992. While ostensibly arguing on behalf of the broader South, the formation of the BASIC grouping represents a detachment from the rest of the developing world, inspired in large by the growing economic and political ambitions of emerging economies. Inspired by the vestiges of a North - South relationship rooted in inequity and marginalisation, the formation of BASIC signifies a new direction of multilateralism that has come to define the changing nature of the global South, enabled by its increasingly powerful members...|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} gas emissions at home or abroad has become the dilemma within contemporary climate change policy, touching upon various concepts such as cost-effectiveness, environmental effectiveness, equity, and sustainable development, and challenging the <b>North-South</b> <b>relationship</b> in itself. Although Annex I Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are legally obligated, through the supplementarity requirement, to meet their Kyoto emission reduction targets {{to a certain extent}} through ‘domestic actions’, most Parties prefer to make use of flexibility mechanisms arguing that actions to reduce emissions should be taken where it is cheapest {{given the fact that the}} effect on the atmosphere will be the same. This research paper explores the limits to flexibility and elucidates the understanding of the supplementarity requirement in the Articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol. While the flexibility mechanisms allow Annex I Parties to earn and trade emission allowances through projects implemented either in other developed countries or in developing countries and which they can use towards meeting their commitments, the supplementarity requirement in the articles was adopted to safeguard concerns as to the integrity of the international climate regime. Even though the objective the supplementarity requirement is clear, the practical implications of the requirement have been subject to a long debate particularly due to the lack of a quantified definition of the requirement. As the Kyoto Protocol only mentions that use of the flexibility mechanisms ‘shall be supplemental to domestic actions’ for the purposes of meeting the Kyoto reduction commitments, Kyoto Parties have disagreed on the amount of actions to be taken at home. This research paper attempts to provide an effective and justifiable interpretation of the supplementarity requirement which would be acceptable to both industrialized and developing countries taking into account cost-, and environmental effectiveness as well as equity considerations...|$|E
40|$|Global {{citizenship}} education (GCE) was developed with an objective to equip students with values, knowledge, skills, and action plans to address complexities and challenges associated with globalization. Service learning trips for students between global north and global south countries 1 have become one {{important part of}} educating youth to become global citizens, to prepare them to live in harmony with people of diverse cultures and ethnicities by learning about them and the challenges they face. GCE that deals with service learning overseas, however, has been critiqued for prioritizing the needs, interests, and perspectives of global northerners, as well as focusing on morality. We suggest here that this focus on morality can re-enforce global power imbalances, when global {{citizenship education}} fails to acknowledge and de-construct inequalities in <b>North-South</b> <b>relationships.</b> Thus we seek to identify or elaborate an alternative model to help students of diverse cultures find common ground and relate {{to one another in}} a just way. This paper reimagines a global citizen as an autonomous, political subject, thus shifting the focus from the moral to the political. We draw on ideas of justice propagated by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice and Fairness as Justice: A Restatement. The three principles we consider for re-constructing global citizenship education are: elimination of self-interest from moral choices; respect for diversity of views, legitimate conflict of interests and right to decide; and acceptance of persons as autonomous individuals. The paper begins with a description of GCE for service learning that details some of its problematic aspects. After that, it discusses Rawls’s ideas and maps three principles that can help us re-consider GCE education. Each principle has implications for GCE discussed here, though each also poses new challenges to teachers and students. Thus the paper ends addressing the following questions: What kind of “citizen” is it that we want to become global and work to better the world? How is moral different from political and why is it important? How can this new model be built, if at all, and how can it affect students, their picture of the world, and actions for social justice?postprin...|$|R
40|$|Después de breve reseña histórica que informa sobre los sorprendentes avances de la genética a partir del descubrimiento de la estructura {{helicoidal}} del DNA, el artículo centra su atención en el nacimiento de los estudios genómicos en los Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, las causas y condiciones que los motivaron, hasta desembocar en el multinacional Proyecto Genoma Humano. Sin olvidar la estatura científica de tal empresa, se intenta una mirada desde la perspectiva de las relaciones Norte-Sur, remitiéndonos de modo más incisivo a los aspectos éticos más controvertidos del PGH. Argumentamos que en las sociedades del Sur debemos ocuparnos en jerarquizar los principales problemas bioéticos que nos aquejan y que están aún muy distantes de los que se "encargan" al PGH. Referimos que las sociedades del Sur deben insertar en su agenda, proyecciones en Ciencia, Tecnología y Sociedad, entre las que el PGH no califica como una prioridad autóctona, aún cuando no descalificamos en su esencia tales megaproyectos, originados en los centros y circuitos propios de la ciencia del Norte Alter brief historical {{review that}} informs on the surprising advances of the genetics {{starting from the}} discovery of the spiral structure of the DNA, the article centres its attention in the birth of the genetic studies in the United Status of America, the causes and conditions that motivated them, intil ending in the I multinacional Human Genome Project without forgetting the scientific stature of such Project. It is attempted a llok {{from the perspective of the}} <b>North-South</b> <b>relationships,</b> remiting us of the more incisive way to the most controversial ethical aspects of the HPG. We argue that in the societies of the South we shoujd be in charge of organizing hierchically the main bioethical problems that we suffer and they are even very distant of those that are in charge of the HGP. We refer that the societies of the South should insert in their calendar, projections in science, technology and society among those that the HGP does not qualify like an autochthonous priority, even when we do not disquilify in its essence such megaprojects originated in the centers and circuits characteristics of the science of the Nort...|$|R
40|$|This chapter aims {{to examine}} the <b>north-south</b> European <b>relationship</b> through {{contemporary}} travel writing, especially that which depicts the Italian South. Italy and the Mediterranean have ‘always’ been the objective of Northern travellers. In the past, the European South {{was a sort of}} inner Orient, against which Northern European identity could perceive itself as a modern and, therefore superior world. Terms like “change”, “innovation”, “progress” on one hand, and “immobility”, “tradition” and “backwardness” on the other, have effortlessly been attributed to the two geo-cultural spaces. However, I would employ the term Meridionism (M. Pfister, L. Cazzato) rather than Orientalism (E. Said). If Orientalism was born as a cultural tool for the implementation of European colonialism, Meridionism was born as a cultural tool for the foundation of modern European identity. The present essay first tries to reflect on the relationship between travel writing and cultural identity followed by an examination of some travelogues written {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century by acclaimed English travel writers; specifically Charles Lister, Henry Vollan Morton and Patience Gray. I will attempt to reconstruct a multi-focalised perspective on ‘reality’, in order to observe the extent to which Meridionism is still working as a discursive tool for the negotiation of present cultural identity within Europe...|$|R
