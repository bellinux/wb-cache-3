5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state.</b> India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, the Indian {{economy was}} the world's sixth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by {{purchasing}} power parity. Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India {{became one of}} the fastest-growing major economies and is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare. A <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state</b> and regional power, it has the third largest standing army in the world and ranks fifth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal republic governed under a parliamentary system and consists of 29 states and 7 union territories. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society and is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{nuclear warheads}} were {{produced}} from 1968 and thermonuclear warheads from 1974. It is also thought that Chinese warheads {{have been successfully}} miniaturised from 2200kg to 700kg {{through the use of}} designs obtained by espionage from the United States. The current number of weapons is unknown owing to strict secrecy, but it is thought that up to 2000 warheads may have been produced, though far fewer may be available for use. China is the only <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state</b> to have guaranteed the non-first use of nuclear weapons.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom is a {{developed}} country {{and has the}} world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest economy by purchasing power parity. The UK is considered to have a high-income economy and is categorised as very high in the Human Development Index, ranking 16th in the world. It was the world's first industrialised country and the world's foremost power during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The UK remains a great power with considerable economic, cultural, military, scientific and political influence internationally. It is a recognised <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state</b> and is seventh in military expenditure in the world. The UK has been a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council since its first session in 1946. It has been a leading member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), since 1973. However, on 23 June 2016, a national referendum on the UK's membership of the EU resulted in a decision to leave, and its exit from the EU is currently being negotiated. The UK {{is also a member}} of the Commonwealth of Nations, the Council of Europe, the G7 finance ministers, the G7 forum, the G20, NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the World Trade Organization (WTO).|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after declaring {{itself a}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state,</b> Pakistan had been humiliated diplomatically and militarily. Faced with the {{possibility}} of international isolation, the already fragile Pakistan economy was weakened further. The morale of Pakistan forces after the withdrawal declined as many units of the Northern Light Infantry suffered heavy casualties. The government refused to accept the dead bodies of many officers, an issue that provoked outrage and protests in the Northern Areas. Pakistan initially did not acknowledge many of its casualties, but Sharif later said that over 4,000 Pakistani troops were killed in the operation. Responding to this, Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf said, [...] "It hurts me when an ex-premier undermines his own forces", and claimed that Indian casualties were more than that of Pakistan. The legacy of Kargil war still continues to be debated on Pakistan's news channels and television political correspondents, which Musharraf repeatedly appeared to justified the causes and preludes of the Kargil war.|$|E

On 24 March 2014 Sharif attended 2014 Nuclear Security Summit, addressing the conference he claimed that Pakistan attaches highest importance to nuclear security because it is directly linked to our national security. Pakistan is a responsible <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state.</b> We pursue a policy of nuclear restraint, as well as credible minimum deterrence. On 11 November 2014, Sharif visited Berlin where he met with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, according to Deutsche Welle, during the meeting Sharif argued a case for more German investment particularly in the energy sector, but Merkel expressed wariness over the security situation in Pakistan.|$|E

50|$|The PTBT {{has been}} seen as a step towards the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which {{directly}} made reference to the PTBT. Under the NPT, non-nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>states</b> were prohibited from possessing, manufacturing, and acquiring <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> or other <b>nuclear</b> explosive devices. All signatories, including <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>states,</b> were committed to the goal of total nuclear disarmament. However, India, Pakistan, and Israel have declined to sign the NPT on grounds that such a treaty is fundamentally discriminatory as it places limitations on states that do not have <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> while making no efforts to curb weapons development by declared <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{disarmament}} section, for {{the first}} time, a world free of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> was articulated as the goal of nuclear disarmament.

Efforts to include a timeline for a negotiated <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> convention failed, but the disarmament action plan included a timeline whereby the <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>states</b> should report on their disarmament activities at the 2014 NPT Preparatory Committee meeting. They were also encouraged to develop a standard reporting form as a confidence building measure.|$|R

50|$|As of April 2012, {{there were}} thirty-one {{countries}} that have civil nuclear power plants, of which nine have nuclear weapons, and almost every <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>state</b> began producing weapons first instead of commercial nuclear power plants.

One critique of the NPT is that it is discriminatory in recognizing as <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>states</b> only those countries that tested <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> before 1968 and requiring all other states joining the treaty to forswear <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
