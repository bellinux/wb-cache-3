5|$|Right <b>now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{currently}} {{pursuing a}} long arch series for cable. We wondered, {{should we do}} a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
25|$|Several of Milne's children's poems {{were set}} to music by the {{composer}} Harold Fraser-Simson. His poems have been parodied many times, including with the books When We Were Rather Older and <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Sixty. The 1963 film The King's Breakfast was based on Milne's poem of the same name.|$|E

25|$|The first {{collection}} of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and {{this was followed by}} The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in <b>Now</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.|$|E
25|$|We {{have made}} {{extraordinary}} progress {{the last couple}} of weeks and have come too far to walk away <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> fully committed and prepared to work around the clock if that's what it takes to reach a final agreement. We are at a point where deals get done as long as both parties share a desire to cross the finish line together. There just isn't much left to resolve.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here and <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E

25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that we get in this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
25|$|Jaquino and Marzelline {{are alone}} in Rocco's house. Jaquino asks Marzelline when she {{will agree to}} marry him, but {{she says that she}} will never marry him now that she has fallen in love with Fidelio, unaware that Fidelio is {{actually}} Leonore in disguise (Jetzt, Schätzchen, jetzt sind wir allein—"Now, darling, <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> alone"). Jaquino leaves, and Marzelline expresses her desire to become Fidelio's wife (O wär ich schon mit dir vereint—"If only I were already united with thee"). Rocco enters, looking for Fidelio, who then enters carrying a heavy load of newly-repaired chains. Rocco compliments Fidelio, and misinterprets her modest reply as hidden attraction to his daughter. Marzelline, Fidelio, Rocco, and Jaquino sing a quartet about the love Marzelline has for Fidelio (Mir ist so wunderbar—"A wondrous feeling fills me", also known as the Canon Quartet).|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until it happens to give n balls.|$|E

60|$|On we sped {{through the}} twilight, the two splendid horses we bestrode had got their wind by this, and were {{sweeping}} {{along with a}} wide steady stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile. Down the side of slopes we galloped, across wide vales that stretched {{to the foot of}} far-off hills. Nearer and nearer grew the blue hills; <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> travelling up their steeps, and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> over and passing towards others that sprang up like visions in the far, faint distance beyond.|$|R
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than it ever was before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost deposit. He explained that he was standing because [...] "if we don't face this <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to have some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren what we were doing when the global fascist state was installed. 'I was watching EastEnders, dear' will not be good enough." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{last letter}} from Ross is dated 4 April 1916. He reports: [...] "there's lots of {{fighting}} {{where we are}} at present, and just <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in the German trenches, so have a busy time... I'd {{like to see you}} all again..." [...] For the next two days, the Canadian front line was under almost continuous bombardment. The 27th Battalion fared particularly badly, and on the night of 5–6 April, the 29th began relieving them, slowed down by the mud, extra equipment and a congestion of troops.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scientists}} now {{consider that the}} effects of global dimming have masked the effect of global warming to some extent and that resolving global dimming may therefore lead to increases in predictions of future temperature rise. According to Beate Liepert, [...] "We lived in a global warming plus a global dimming world and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking out global dimming. So we end up with the global warming world, which will be much worse than we thought it will be, much hotter." [...] The magnitude of this masking effect is one of the central problems in climate change with significant implications for future climate changes and policy responses to global warming.|$|E
500|$|By 2005, Cathay Pacific owned 18 {{percent of}} the airline, with its parent, Swire Pacific owned 7.71 percent; China National Aviation Holding owned 43 percent and CITIC Pacific owned 28.5 percent. A Hong Kong {{newspaper}} reported that Swire Pacific was in advanced negotiations that would see Cathay Pacific taking over Dragonair. This was dismissed outright by Tony Tyler, then {{chief operating officer of}} Cathay Pacific who said [...] "We have no plans to change that structure right <b>now...</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> happy with the structure of the shareholding in Dragonair at the moment. [...] " [...] Peter Hilton, transport analyst at CSFB, said Tyler's remarks were a [...] "cut and dried" [...] dismissal of the takeover talk.|$|E

500|$|As {{the band}} entered 2016, Cain felt {{the future for}} the group was bright: [...] "We're not done yet. I think we got more music in us," [...] he told Substream Magazine in January 2016. Two months later the band {{announced}} their break-up with a statement that read in part, [...] "We {{have no idea what}} the future holds, but for <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> done." [...] The band embarked on the So Long, Farewell Tour across North America between May and September 2016 with original drummer Tony Thaxton returning. They performed their final, sold-out show at the Metro in Chicago on September 18, 2016. The group performed 36 songs — some dating back to their 2000 EP, Back to the Beat — while both Thaxton and Rivera sat in on drums.|$|E
500|$|Wayne Scholes, {{owner of}} the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League) has stated that his {{organisation}} doesn't have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled {{out the possibility of}} joining the EIHL in the future, saying that “We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Gladstone, who {{had left}} the Liberal {{leadership}} and retired from public life, was appalled by reports of atrocities in Bulgaria, and in August 1876, penned a hastily written pamphlet arguing that the Turks should be deprived of Bulgaria {{because of what they}} had done there. [...] He sent a copy to Disraeli, who called it [...] "vindictive and ill-written... of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest". Gladstone's pamphlet became an immense best-seller and rallied the Liberals to urge that the Ottoman Empire should no longer be a British ally. Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, [...] "Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe. [...] <b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy." [...] In spite of this, Disraeli's policy favoured Constantinople and the territorial integrity of its empire.|$|E
