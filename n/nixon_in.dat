5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1948.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis was {{urged to}} run again for Congress against <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1948 by Stephen Zetterberg, who, when Voorhis {{declined}} (in part due to health reasons), himself ran in the Democratic primary.

5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} Declaration on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the Declaration was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the Declaration was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. {{had been}} aware of the PAVN/Viet Cong sanctuaries in Cambodia since 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson had chosen not to attack them due to {{possible}} international repercussions and his belief that Sihanouk could be convinced to alter his policies. Johnson did, however, authorize the reconnaissance teams of the highly classified Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (SOG) to enter Cambodia and gather intelligence on the Base Areas in 1967. The election of Richard M. <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1968 and the introduction of his policies of gradual U.S. withdrawal from South Vietnam and the Vietnamization of the conflict there, changed everything.|$|E
5|$|Born in New York City {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, she {{graduated}} from Stanford University. After her first two marriages ended in divorce, she married noted businessman Walter Annenberg, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1969 under President Richard <b>Nixon.</b> <b>In</b> her role as the ambassador's wife, Leonore directed a major renovation of the ambassador's official residence. The Annenbergs contributed to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign and upon his inauguration, Leonore was named Chief of Protocol, placing her in charge of advising the president, vice president, and Secretary of State on matters relating to diplomatic protocol.|$|E
5|$|During her {{postgraduate}} study, Rodham {{served as}} staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded Children's Defense Fund in Cambridge, Massachusetts, {{and as a}} consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.

Under the guidance of Chief Counsel John Doar and senior member Bernard W. Nussbaum, Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment. The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> August 1974.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the election, Goldwater {{returned}} to the Senate and was re-elected twice. He became an influential member of the party's conservative wing, serving {{as chairman of the}} Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Armed Services. He supported the presidential candidacy and eventual presidency of Richard Nixon; however, he was critical of Nixon's attempt to control prices and wages. Initially, Goldwater defended <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> light of the Watergate scandal until August 5, 1974, when he withdrew his support. Nixon resigned from office four days later.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{followed}} this {{up with an}} address to the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand replied that he had Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as vice president, Hand voted for Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the scholar-turned-bureaucrat Guo Moruo {{laid out}} the first modern {{proposal}} to repair the Great Wall. Five years later, the renovated Badaling became the first section to be {{opened to the public}} since the establishment of the PRC. The Badaling Great Wall has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the Great Wall.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, Richard Nixon, the United States Republican Party nominee, won {{the presidential}} election, {{defeating}} Democrat Hubert Humphrey by seven-tenths {{of a percent}} of the popular vote. Nixon appointed H. R. Haldeman as his Chief of Staff; this position granted Haldeman a relatively large degree of control over the activities of the presidential administration. Haldeman had first worked for <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1956, during Nixon's successful bid for the vice-presidency under Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. Nixon visited the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E
5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} Nixon was doing the best he could.

In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E

5|$|The free silver {{movement}} {{reached its}} height with the 1896 campaign of former Nebraska representative William Jennings Bryan, {{who won the}} Democratic nomination for president after his Cross of Gold speech, which decried the gold standard, electrified the 1896 Democratic National Convention. Bryan was defeated in the election by former Ohio governor William McKinley, and in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, placing that standard into law. The gold standard was departed from for many purposes by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal administration, and completely ended by President Richard <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1971.|$|E
5|$|With the {{election}} of President Richard M. <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1968 and {{the announcement of the}} new American policy of Vietnamization in 1969, America's relations with Cambodia began to change. The goal of the U.S. was now to buy time for their South Vietnamese allies (and to cover their own withdrawal). On 11 May 1969 Sihanouk welcomed a return to full diplomatic relations with the U.S. On 18 March Nixon, already anticipating this development, ordered the bombing of the Cambodian sanctuaries by B-52s.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of <b>Nixon.</b> <b>In</b> presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E
