5|$|If an {{interval}} {{of the real}} numbers is partitioned into two <b>non-empty</b> parts L, R, such that every element of L is (strictly) less than every element of R, then either L contains a largest element or R contains a smallest element, but not both.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{namespace}} name {{could match}} the syntax of any <b>non-empty</b> URI reference, but {{the use of}} relative URI references was deprecated by the W3C. A separate W3C specification for namespaces in XML 1.1 permits internationalized resource identifier (IRI) references to {{serve as the basis for}} namespace names in addition to URI references.|$|E
5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every <b>non-empty</b> subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a <b>non-empty</b> setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is {{contained}} in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|The {{generalized}} Euclidean algorithm {{requires a}} Euclidean function, i.e., a mapping f from R into {{the set of}} nonnegative integers such that, for any two nonzero elements a and b in R, there exist q and r in R such that a = qb + r and f(r) < f(b). An example of this mapping is the norm function used to order the Gaussian integers above. The function f can be {{the magnitude of the}} number, or the degree of a polynomial. The basic principle is that each step of the algorithm reduces f inexorably; hence, if f can be reduced only a finite number of times, the algorithm must stop in a finite number of steps. This principle relies heavily on the natural well-ordering of the non-negative integers; roughly speaking, this requires that every <b>non-empty</b> set of non-negative integers has a smallest member.|$|E
25|$|In an {{analogous}} fashion, every <b>non-empty</b> open {{subset of the}} complex plane {{can be viewed as}} a Riemann surface in a natural way. More generally, every <b>non-empty</b> open subset of a Riemann surface is a Riemann surface.|$|E

25|$|Lebesgue {{measure is}} {{strictly}} positive on <b>non-empty</b> open sets, and so its support {{is the whole}} of Rn.|$|E
25|$|Any two bounded subsets of the Euclidean {{plane with}} <b>non-empty</b> {{interiors}} are equidecomposable {{with respect to}} the area-preserving affine maps.|$|E
25|$|For any <b>non-empty</b> {{binary tree}} with n0 leaf nodes and n2 nodes of degree 2, n0 = n2 + 1.|$|E
25|$|Being well ordered ("any <b>non-empty</b> subset has {{a minimal}} element") {{is not a}} first-order property; the usual {{definition}} involves quantifying over all subsets.|$|E
25|$|Let the <b>non-empty</b> set S be a {{counter-example}} to the axiom of regularity; that is, {{every element}} of S has a <b>non-empty</b> intersection with S. We define a binary relation R on S by , which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, {{there is some}} sequence (an) in S satisfying anRan+1 for all n in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such S exists.|$|E
25|$|For any set A {{there is}} a {{function}} f such that for any <b>non-empty</b> subset B of A, f(B) lies in B.|$|E
25|$|Zorn's lemma: Every <b>non-empty</b> {{partially}} {{ordered set}} in which every chain (i.e., totally ordered subset) has an upper bound contains at least one maximal element.|$|E
25|$|The Hosoya {{index is}} the number of <b>non-empty</b> {{matchings}} plus one; it is used in computational chemistry and mathematical chemistry investigations for organic compounds.|$|E
25|$|If {{the above}} {{requirement}} is lessened to require only <b>non-empty</b> meet and joins {{to be in}} L, the sublattice M is called a closed sublattice of M.|$|E
25|$|The {{order is}} Dedekind-complete; that is: every <b>non-empty</b> subset S of ℝ with an upper bound in ℝ has a {{least upper bound}} (also called supremum) in ℝ.|$|E
25|$|Because of this fact, theorems {{that hold}} for any algebraically closed field, apply to C. For example, any <b>non-empty</b> complex square matrix {{has at least}} one (complex) eigenvalue.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a set}} A {{such that}} for all {{functions}} f (on the set of <b>non-empty</b> subsets of A), there is a B such that f(B) does not lie in B.|$|E
25|$|The Hausdorff {{distance}} dH {{turns the}} set K(M) of all <b>non-empty</b> compact subsets of M into a metric space. One {{can show that}} K(M) is complete if M is complete.|$|E
25|$|Given any set X of {{pairwise}} disjoint <b>non-empty</b> sets, {{there exists}} {{at least one}} set C that contains exactly one element in common {{with each of the}} sets in X.|$|E
25|$|A difunctional {{relation}} {{can then}} be equivalently characterized as a relation R such that wherever x1R and x2R have a <b>non-empty</b> intersection, then these two sets coincide; formally x1R ∩ x2R ≠ ∅ implies x1R = x2R.|$|E
25|$|Sets {{of natural}} numbers, of pairs of natural numbers (or even of n-tuples of natural numbers) that have Diophantine {{definitions}} are called Diophantine sets. In these terms, Hilbert's tenth problem asks {{whether a particular}} Diophantine set is <b>non-empty.</b>|$|E
25|$|The graph is {{connected}} by the edges in T. This {{can be expressed}} logically as the statement that, for every <b>non-empty</b> proper subset of the graph's vertices, there exists an edge in T with exactly one endpoint in the given subset.|$|E
25|$|A convex cone C in a finite-dimensional real {{inner product}} space V is a convex set {{invariant}} under multiplication by positive scalars. It spans the subspace C – C {{and the largest}} subspace it contains is C ∩ (−C). It spans the whole space {{if and only if}} it contains a basis. Since the convex hull of the basis is a polytope with <b>non-empty</b> interior, this happens if and only if C has <b>non-empty</b> interior. The interior in this case is also a convex cone. Moreover, an open convex cone coincides with the interior of its closure, since any interior point in the closure must lie in the interior of some polytope in the original cone. A convex cone is said to be proper if its closure, also a cone, contains no subspaces.|$|E
25|$|On {{a compact}} Hausdorff space {{the support of}} a non-zero measure is always <b>non-empty,</b> but may have measure 0. An example of this is given by adding the first {{uncountable}} ordinal Ω to the previous example: the support of the measure is the single point Ω, which has measure 0.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} is surjective (onto) if every possible image is mapped to {{by at least}} one argument. In other words, every element in the codomain has <b>non-empty</b> preimage. Equivalently, a {{function is}} surjective if its image is equal to its codomain. A surjective function is a surjection. The formal definition is the following.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{this shows}} {{that there is no}} smooth {{retraction}} from any <b>non-empty</b> smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes's theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form ω generates the de Rham cohomology group H'n−1(∂B) used in the cohomology proof.|$|E
25|$|Subsets {{which are}} {{unbounded}} by themselves but bounded {{in the whole}} set; they have no maximum, but a supremum outside the subset; if the subset is <b>non-empty</b> this supremum is a limit point of the subset and hence also of the whole set; if the subset is empty this supremum is the minimum of the whole set.|$|E
25|$|The Hahn–Banach {{separation}} theorem {{states that}} two disjoint <b>non-empty</b> convex sets {{in a real}} Banach space, one of them open, can be separated by a closed affine hyperplane. The open convex set lies strictly {{on one side of}} the hyperplane, the second convex set lies on the other side but may touch the hyperplane.|$|E
25|$|Next, {{as long as}} S4 is <b>non-empty,</b> we pop v from S4 and delete v {{from the}} graph, pushing it onto Sd, along {{with a list of}} its {{neighbor}}s at this point in time. We check each former neighbor of v, pushing it onto S4 or S5 if it now meets the necessary conditions.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{presence}} of empty derivations, a LL(1) grammar can be equal to a SLR(1) or a LALR(1) grammar. If the LL(1) grammar has no empty derivations it is SLR(1) and if all symbols with empty derivations have <b>non-empty</b> derivations it is LALR(1). If symbols having only an empty derivation exist, the grammar {{may or may not be}} LALR(1).|$|E
