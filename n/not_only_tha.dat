P. U but also its essential complement The combination of the two enabled Europe to progress thanks to the flexibility of the system towards single market despite the difficulties encountered in the world or in individual countries It was however argued that the results achieved were still inadequate when compared with the proposal to build up in Europe modern eco nomic system Other methods were proposed the Coal and Steel Pool the Convertibility of the currencies Both these methods although capable of bringing about certain degree of progress would finally sacrifice the original aim and probably create wide economic disequilibria Criticism of the E. P. U Liberalisation of Trade method is directed either against the mechanism itself or the fact that only inadequate com plementary measures were taken In both cases the remedies are at hand If applied they would enable all the european countries to progress rapidly towards the proposed objective without creating unbearable disequilibria in the world in Europe or in the individual countries themselves Applying such remedies depends solely on the governments concerned taking poli tical decisionsJaoul Michel, Schloesing Olivier.

40|$|The {{androgen}} receptor (AR) requires coregulators for its optimal transactivation. Whether AR coregulators also need interacting proteins to modulate their function remains un-clear. Here we describe heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleo-protein (hnRNP) A 1 as an associated negative modulator for the AR coregulator ARA 54. hnRNP A 1 selectively suppressed ARA 54 -enhanced wild-type and mutant AR transactivation via interruption of AR-ARA 54 interaction and ARA 54 homodimerization. Stable transfection of hnRNP A 1 in the LNCaP cells suppressed AR-mediated cell {{growth and the}} ex-pression of prostate-specific antigen, and this suppressive ef-fect was abolished {{by the addition of}} ARA 54 -small interfering RNA.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the short and}} long run performance implications of managing earnings to exceed market expectations. In particular, we examine the performance differences between two groups of firms: (1) firms that marginally exceed consensus forecasts but manage earnings upwards and (2) firms that miss consensus forecasts but do not manage earnings. We choose these two groups because they maximize the likelihood that earnings management activities undertaken by the firm {{would be able to}} move the firm from missing the earnings benchmark to beating it. In comparing the performance of these two groups, we find that using accruals or cutting discretionary expenditures to beat expectations results in a short-term positive impact on stock price, but adversely affects the firm in the long-term. We also examine whether managers behave as if they are cognizant of this trade-off and take actions to capitalize on the short-term positive performance impact of beating expectations through earnings management. We find that firms that manage earnings to exceed analyst expectations have significantly greater equity issuances and insider selling in the following year when compared with <b>not</b> <b>only</b> firms <b>tha...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} for the last 5 years various interactive musical systems {{with the goal of}} assisting musical improvisation. One of these systems, the Continuator, is based on a question/ answering scheme in which each phrase played b a user is continued (or answered) by the system in the “same style”. The system has been experimented both with several Jazz musicians in the context of professional Jazz improvisation, and with children in the context of psychological experiments related to music education. These various experiments have led to a conceptualisation from a system design perspective coined IRMS, for Interactive Reflexive Musical Systems, i. e. systems in which a facet of the user’s musical personality is reflexively being exploited for creating musical interactions. Aims The aim of the project is now to leverage the ideas and results obtained in this first phase, and create a second phase of experiments, with a “spiral”model of collaboration in mind: from an educational viewpoint the goal is to exploit concretely these ideas to create better educational systems; from the system design viewpoint, the goal is design yet better IRMS systems {{based on the results of}} these experiments, in particular invent new interactive schemes (<b>not</b> <b>only</b> question/answer) <b>tha...</b>|$|R
