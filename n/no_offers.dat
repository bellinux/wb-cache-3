Despite advertising for a new lease of {{the building}} in circa 2013 whilst letting the property for a peppercorn rent, Enterprise Inns ultimately decided to sell the property as a freehold in March 2015. <b>No</b> <b>offers</b> to continue operating the building as a pub were received, although some offers were received from developers seeking to redevelop the property, perhaps due to the substantial refurbishment of the building that was required.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Philadelphia {{planned to}} trade or sell Lavender, {{even though he}} had earlier {{announced}} his retirement from the game. Philadelphia's asking price for his rights was $1,000, but they received <b>no</b> <b>offers.</b> Christy Mathewson, manager of the Reds, was reported to have had interest in Lavender, the pitcher's success against the Giants still fresh in Mathewson's mind. Though Philadelphia had a meeting with Cincinnati, Mathewson was unable to attend, and no trade discussions materialized. The San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League expressed interest in Lavender, but he stressed that he was retired and that he would only consider a trade to Atlanta of the Southern Association so that he could be near his farm in Montezuma. In 1922, it was reported that he signed with Atlanta after playing well for an independent team in Dawson, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were <b>no</b> <b>offers.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Robert Foehl {{died and}} Evelyn Foehl sold {{the hotel to}} Ramada, a hotel chain. The Ramada {{managers}} remodeled the hotel, stripping out and covering {{much of what they}} considered an outdated interior. The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho. Though it remained a fashionable location for a while, its original character was largely absent and it began to suffer from neglect and disrepair. It continued to host conferences and business meetings, such as the Natural Health, Aromatherapy and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000, and the Arizona LANBasher's League party in early 2001. Later that year, the hotel closed and was put on the market. Plans for its demolition were considered when <b>no</b> <b>offers</b> were made. To protect it, Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance, and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to place it on the Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past. To save it from demolition, business partners Scott Lyon and Bill Nassikas of Westroc Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $80M. Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003, two years after the hotel was closed for renovation.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1939, Ruth {{spoke on}} Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium {{as members of}} the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into {{premature}} retirement by ALS disease, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to Cooperstown, New York, for the formal opening of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Three years earlier, {{he was one of the}} first five players elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received <b>no</b> <b>offers.</b> During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of the yacht caused Heidemann financial problems, and in 1976 he agreed terms with Gruner + Jahr, Sterns parent company, to produce a book based on the conversations he was having with the former soldiers and SS men. When the book went unwritten—the material provided by the former SS officer was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication—Heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers {{to pay for the}} boat's upkeep. In June 1978 he advertised the boat for sale, asking 1.1million DMs; he received <b>no</b> <b>offers.</b> Mohnke recommended that Heidemann speak to Jakob Tiefenthaeler, a Nazi memorabilia collector and {{a former member of the}} SS. Tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy the yacht, but was happy to act as an agent; his endeavours did not produce a sale. Realising Heidemann's financial circumstances, Tiefenthaeler provided him with names of other collectors in the Stuttgart area. The journalist made a trip to the south of Germany and met Stiefel, who purchased some of Göring's effects.|$|E

500|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 campaign, manager Mark Stimson {{admitted}} he was undecided {{as to whether}} Julian or Simon Royce would start in the club's opening fixture of the season. Julian ultimately started in the club's 5–0 home win against Swindon Town {{on the first day}} of the season. After three straight defeats in the space of a week with Gillingham conceding seven goals, Julian was replaced by Royce ahead of the club's League Cup game against Blackburn Rovers. After the game, Julian only featured twice in the space of four months, both appearances coming in Football League Trophy fixtures. Julian handed in a transfer request in November 2009 as a result of a lack of first-team appearances. However, Gillingham received <b>no</b> <b>offers</b> for the player, with manager Mark Stimson saying [...] "I haven't had a phone call. He's been on the loan circuit for four to six weeks and I haven't had a call. You don't just say I'm on the transfer list and six teams come in for you". He remained at Gillingham, and after appearing in Gillingham's 2–1 away loss at Huddersfield Town in December 2009, Julian remained as a first choice goalkeeper until the end of the season. The club went the whole season without an away victory, and were relegated back to League Two on the final day of the season following a 3–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. Julian made 33 appearances during the 2009–10 season, keeping eight clean sheets.|$|E

Thiers returned to France, convinced that government would have to negotiate an end to the war. On his return to France, he headed to Paris. Chancellor Bismarck arranged for Thiers to pass through the German lines to meet with the French government within the city. When Thiers arrived in Paris on 31 October 1870, the situation was extremely tense. Felix Pyat, a radical socialist and a future leader of the Paris Commune, organized demonstrations against Thiers, whom he accused of threatening to sell France to the Germans, and threatened to have him hung. Favre urged Thiers to go to Versailles and negotiate with Bismarck. Thiers crossed the lines again and met Bismarck. The negotiations continued for four days; [...] Bismarck demanded only Alsace and a large payment. Thiers returned to Paris and urged Favre and the Government to accept the offer and end the war, but General Trochu and Favre were adamant that Paris could hold out and that France was still strong enough to win the war.|$|E
