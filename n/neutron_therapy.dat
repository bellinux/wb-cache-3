5|$|As it {{was easier}} to raise money for medical purposes, {{particularly}} cancer treatment, than for nuclear physics, Lawrence encouraged the use of the cyclotron for medical research. Working with his brother John and Israel Lyon Chaikoff from the University of California's Physiology Department, Lawrence supported research into the use of radioactive isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Phosphorus-32 was easily produced in the cyclotron, and John used it to cure a woman afflicted with polycythemia vera, a blood disease. John used phosphorus-32 created in the 37-inch cyclotron in 1938 in tests on mice with leukemia. He found that the radioactive phosphorus concentrated in the fast-growing cancer cells. This then led to clinical trials on human patients. A 1948 evaluation of the therapy showed that remissions occurred under certain circumstances. Lawrence also had hoped for the medical use of neutrons. The first cancer patient received <b>neutron</b> <b>therapy</b> from the 60-inch cyclotron on November 20. Chaikoff conducted trials on the use of radioactive isotopes as radioactive tracers to explore the mechanism of biochemical reactions.|$|E
50|$|Fast <b>neutron</b> <b>therapy</b> {{utilizes}} {{high energy}} neutrons typically between 50 and 70 MeV to treat cancer. Most fast <b>neutron</b> <b>therapy</b> beams {{are produced by}} reactors, cyclotrons (d+Be) and linear accelerators. <b>Neutron</b> <b>therapy</b> is currently available in Germany, Russia, South Africa and the United States. In the US three treatment centers operate in Seattle, Washington, Detroit, Michigan and Batavia, Illinois. The Detroit and Seattle centers use a cyclotron which produces a proton beam impinging upon a beryllium target; the Batavia center at Fermilab uses a proton linear accelerator.|$|E

In this study we have simulated a head phantom, suggested for construction in boron <b>neutron</b> capture <b>therapy</b> facilities, and calculated all relevant dose components inside of it using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX. A “generic” epithermal neutron beam with a broad neutron spectrum, similar to beams used for <b>neutron</b> capture <b>therapy</b> clinical trials, was used. The calculated distributions of all relevant dose components in brain tissue equivalent were compared with those in water. The results show that water is a suitable dosimetry material and that the simulated head phantom is a suitable design for producing accurate three-dimensional maps of dose components at enough points inside of the phantom for boron <b>neutron</b> capture <b>therapy</b> dosimetry measurements and the use of these dose maps in beam development and benchmarking of computer-based treatment codes...|$|R
