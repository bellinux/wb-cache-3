40|$|Abstract: Data {{are often}} {{replicated}} in distributed systems {{to protect them}} against site fail-ures and <b>networ</b> k malfunctions. When this is the case, an access policy must be chosen to insure that a consistent view of the data is always presented. Voting protocols guarantee consistency of replicated data {{in the presence of}} any scenar io involving non-Byzantine site failures and <b>networ</b> k par titions. While Static Majority Consensus Voting protocols use static quor ums, Dynamic Voting protocols, like Dynamic Voting and Lexicographic Dynamic Vot-ing, dynamically adjust quorums to changes in the status of the <b>networ</b> k of sites holding the copies. The availabilities of replicated data managed by these three protocols are compared using a simulation model with realistic parameters. Dynamic Voting is found to perfor m bet-ter than Majority Consensus Voting for all files having more than three copies while Lexico-graphic Dynamic Voting perfor ms much better than the two other protocols for all eleven configurations under study.
