5000|$|... == Stability == Through {{research}} {{carried out}} by Mary Karpen, Pieter De Haseth and Kenneth Neet, new findings in the partial stability in 310-helices were uncovered. The helices are most noticeably stabilized by an aspartate residue at the nonpolar N-terminus that interacts with the amide group at the helical <b>N-cap.</b> This electrostatic interaction stabilizes the peptide dipoles in a parallel orientation. Much like the contiguous helical hydrogen bonds that stabilize α-helices, high levels of aspartate are just as equally important in {{the survival of the}} 310-helix. High frequency of aspartate in both 310-helix and α-helices is indicative of its helix initiation, {{but at the same time}} suggests that it favors stabilization of the 310-helix by inhibiting the propagation of α-helices.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{electrostatic}} {{interactions in}} determining the stability of designed proteins was studied by constructing and analyzing a set of designed variants of the Drosophila engrailed homeodomain. Computational redesign of 29 surface positions results in a 25 -fold mutant with moderate stability, similar to the wild-type protein. Incorporating helix dipole and <b>N-capping</b> considerations into the design algorithm by restricting amino acid composition at the helix termini and <b>N-capping</b> positions yields a ninefold mutant of the initial design (a 23 -fold mutant of wild-type) that is over 3 kcal mol^(− 1) more stable than the protein resulting from the unbiased design. Four additional proteins were constructed and analyzed to isolate the effects of helix dipole and <b>N-capping</b> interactions in each helix. Based {{on the results of}} urea-denaturation experiments and calculations using the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann method, both classes of interaction are found to increase the stability of the designed proteins significantly. The simple electrostatic model used in the optimization of rotamers by iterative techniques (ORBIT) force-field, which is similar to the electrostatic models used in other protein design force-fields, is unable to predict the experimentally determined stabilities of the designed variants.

Like other cytosolic GSTs, PmGST B 1 - 1 possesses two local structural motifs, an <b>N-capping</b> box and a hydrophobic staple motif, both of which are located between amino acids 151 and 156. The <b>N-capping</b> box consists of a reciprocal hydrogen bonding interaction of Thr 152 with Asp 155, whereas the hydrophobic staple motif consists of a hydrophobic interaction between Phe 151 and Ala 156. By contrast with other GSTs, PmGST B 1 - 1 displays distinct hydrogen bond interactions in the <b>N-capping</b> box. In mammalian GSTs these structural elements are critical for protein folding and stability. To investigate the role played by these two motifs in a distantly related organism on the evolutionary scale, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate several mutants of both motifs in PmGST B 1 - 1. All mutants were efficiently overexpressed and purified, but they were quite unstable, although at different levels, indicating that protein folding was significantly destabilized. The analysis of the T 152 A and D 155 G variants indicated that the <b>N-capping</b> box motif {{plays an important role in}} the stability and correct folding of the enzyme. The analysis of F 151 A and A 156 G mutants revealed that the hydrophobic staple motif influences the structural maintenance of the protein and is implicated in the folding process of PmGST B 1 - 1.

Mutation at residues that interact with the <b>N-cap</b> did not reduce levels of fusion, except for substitutions made at residue I 173. For <b>N-cap</b> and I 173 mutants, the addition of chlorpromazine greatly promoted transfer of aqueous dye. Electrical capacitance measurements confirmed that fusion pores usually did not form for the I 173 mutants. Thus, neither <b>N-cap</b> formation nor interactions with segment 173 – 178 are needed for hemifusion, but are required for reliable formation and enlargement of the fusion pore.

Within the PAS superfamily, the N-terminal segment (<b>N-cap)</b> is poorly conserved {{and its role}} is not well understood. We investigated {{the role of the}} <b>N-cap</b> (residues 1 to 19) in the Aer PAS domain by missense and truncation mutagenesis. Aer-PAS <b>N-cap</b> truncations and an Aer-M 21 P substitution resulted in low cellular levels of the mutant proteins, suggesting that the N-terminal region was important for stabilizing the structure of the PAS domain. The junction of the <b>N-cap</b> and PAS core was critical for signaling in Aer. Mutations and truncations in the sequence encoding residues 15 to 21 introduced a range of phenotypes, including defects in FAD binding, constant tumbling motility, and an inverse response in which E. coli cells migrated away from oxygen concentrations to which they are normally attracted. The proximity of two <b>N-cap</b> regions in an Aer dimer was assessed in vivo by oxidatively cross-linking serial cysteine substitutions. Cross-linking of several cysteine replacements at 23 °C was attenuated at 10 °C, indicating contact was not at a stable dimer interface but required lateral mobility. We observed large multimers of Aer when we combined cross-linking of <b>N-cap</b> residues with a cysteine replacement that cross-links exclusively at the Aer dimer interface. This suggests that the PAS <b>N-cap</b> faces outwards in a dimer and that PAS-PAS contacts can occur between adjacent dimers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} dental caries is dynamic and continuous, with periods of de- and remineralization of the tooth {{structure}} occurring over time. When the remineralization potential {{is superior to}} demineralization, the caries process can be stopped and early caries lesions can recover. Moreover, the remineralization potential will be increased if active components are added to a dentifrice. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to re-evaluate the remineralizaton potential of a dentifrice containing nano-sized carbonated apatite using pH cycling, which simulates the oral environment. Artificial incipient caries was induced on bovine tooth specimens, which were treated with 4 dentifrices containing several concentrations of nano carbonated apatites with pH cycling. The remineralization effect was evaluated at each step by measuring the Vickers Hardness Number, and obtaining SEM and CLSM images of the enamel surface. The micro hardness of the enamel surface increased after the pH cycling treatment of the dentifrices. The dentifrice containing 5 % <b>n-CAPs</b> showed the highest level of remineralization followed by 0 %, 15 % and 30 %. One-way ANOVA indicated a significant difference in remineralization between the dentifrice containing 5 % and 30 % <b>n-CAPs.</b> SEM and CLSM also demonstrated observable differences in each step. From this study, the fluoride dentifrice containing 5 % <b>n-CAPs</b> was effective in remineralizing an artificial incipient caries lesion.

40|$|We have {{surveyed}} 393 N-termini of alpha-helices and 156 N-termini of 3 (10) -helices in 85 high resolution, non-homologous protein {{crystal structures}} for <b>N-cap</b> side-chain rotamer preferences, hydrogen bonding patterns, and solvent accessibilities. We find very strong rotamer preferences that {{are unique to}} <b>N-cap</b> sites. The following rules are generally observed for N-capping in alpha-helices: Thr and Ser <b>N-cap</b> side chains adopt the gauche - rotamer, hydrogen bond to the N 3 NH and have psi restricted to 164 +/- 8 degrees. Asp and Asn <b>N-cap</b> side chains either adopt the gauche - rotamer and hydrogen bond to the N 3 NH with psi = 172 +/- 10 degrees, or adopt the trans rotamer and hydrogen bond to both the N 2 and N 3 NH groups with psi = 1 - 7 +/- 19 degrees. With all other N-caps, the side chain {{is found in the}} gauche + rotamer so that the side chain does not interact unfavorably with the N-terminus by blocking solvation and psi is unrestricted. An i, i + 3 hydrogen bond from N 3 NH to the <b>N-cap</b> backbone C = O in more likely to form at the N-terminus when an unfavorable <b>N-cap</b> is present. In the 3 (10) -helix Asn and Asp remain favorable N-caps as they can hydrogen bond to the N 2 NH while in the trans rotamer; in contrast, Ser and Thr are disfavored as their preferred hydrogen bonding partner (N 3 NH) is inaccessible. This suggests that Ser is the optimum choice of <b>N-cap</b> when alpha-helix formation is to be encouraged while 3 (10) -helix formation discouraged. The strong energetic and structural preferences found for N-caps, which differ greatly from positions within helix interiors, suggest that N-caps should be treated explicitly in any consideration of helical structure in peptides or proteins...|$|E

Whether or not the N 3 residue is solvated on mutating the <b>N-cap</b> Thr/Ser to Ala or Gly appears {{to be related to}} the identities and the side-chain conformations of the N 2 and N 3 residues. When these two residues are alanines, as is in the pseudo-wild-type CI 2 (E 33 A/E 34 A), the main-chain NH at the N 3 position is exposed to the solvent and can be solvated. If the N 2 residue is an Asp or a Glu, it is more likely that the side-chain of these residues will form a surrogate <b>N-cap</b> with the amide NH at N 3 to compensate for the lost -OH group. In this case, no additional solvation will be observed. In general, Gly can be more stable than Ala at the <b>N-cap</b> because its small side-chain allows nearby polar groups to form hydrogen bonds with optimal geometry with solvent molecules or other polar groups...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel N-terminal alpha-helix local motif that involves three hydrophobic residues and a Pro residue (Pro-box motif). Database analysis shows that when Pro is the <b>N-cap</b> of an alpha-helix {{the distribution of}} amino acids in adjacent positions changes dramatically {{with respect to the}} average distribution in an alpha-helix, but not when Pro is at position N 1. <b>N-cap</b> Pro residues are usually associated to Ile and Leu, at position N', Val at position N 3 and a hydrophobic residue (h) at position N 4. The side chain of the <b>N-cap</b> Pro packs against Val, while the hydrophobic residues at positions N' and N 4 make favorable interactions. To analyze the role of this putative motif (sequence fingerprint hPXXhh), we have synthesized a series of peptides and analyzed them by circular dichroism (CD) and NMR. We find that this motif is formed in peptides, and that the accompanying hydrophobic interactions contribute up to 1. 2 kcal/mol to helix stability. The fact that some of the residues in this fingerprint are not good <b>N-cap</b> and helix formers results in a small overall stabilization of the alpha-helix with respect to other peptides having Gly as the <b>N-cap</b> and Ala at N 3 and N 4. This suggests that the Pro-box motif will not specially contribute to protein stability but to the specificity of its fold. In fact, 80 % of the sequences that contain the fingerprint sequence in the protein database are adopting the described structural motif, and in none of them is the helix extended to place Pro at the more favorable N 1 position...|$|E

II. Recent advances in solubilization of polyalanine and helix stabilization by end capping were combined to synthesize a series of highly helical, water-soluble polyalanine peptides permitting straightforward context-free investigation of this most common helix- forming [alpha]-amino acid. Three types of peptides incorporating this helical polyalanine region were made, each for a specific purpose: structure determination by NMR; fractional helicity measurement by amide NH to ND exchange in D₂ 0, observed by NMR; and CD analysis. CD spectra of these helical peptides were used to directly verify an equation used for peptide structural analysis. The helix-initiating N-terminal cap (Hel) used to create the highly helical polyalanines is a synthetically modified Pro-Pro dipeptide. Hel was developed in the Kemp group a decade ago, and peptides created with it have been extensively studied in this group. However, the 18 -step synthesis of Hel has hindered its use by others.

40|$|Student Number : 9306227 A - PhD thesis - School of Molecular and Cell Biology - Faculty of ScienceIt is well {{documented}} that N-capping motifs are stabilising local motifs for -helices. N-capping motifs have been identified within hGST A 1 - 1 at the N-terminal ends of -helix 9 and helix 6. The conservational role of these two motifs in protein stability, folding and function was investigated. -Helix 9 is a unique structural feature to class Alpha GSTs that is important for its catalytic functioning. This amphipathic helix is highly dynamic, where upon ligand binding at the active-site, the delocalised C-terminal region becomes immobilised to form a structured helix forming a “lid” over the active-site. The specific role of the Asp <b>N-cap</b> motif toward the stability and dynamics of helix 9 was determined by substituting the Asp- 209 for a Gly. ANS binding and urea-induced activity studies showed that by removing the <b>N-cap</b> motif of helix 9 in hGST A 1 - 1, the helix 9 is destabilised rendering a less hydrophobic binding site compared {{to that in the}} wild-type. The helical content of the peptide, corresponding to helix 9 in the C-terminal region of hGST A 1 - 1 (208 - 222), decreased significantly upon the removal of the <b>N-cap</b> motif. The explanation for the conservation of the Asp <b>N-cap</b> residue can be found in its stabilising role of the C-terminal region of class Alpha GSTs. This stabilising role was however less apparent in context of the protein compared to that in the peptide. Majority of the atomic contacts owing to the stability of helix 9 appear to be governed by non-local tertiary interactions rather than local interactions, such as the <b>N-cap</b> motif. These tertiary interactions are likely to include short and long range contacts between residues {{on the surface of the}} protein that are already known to contribute towards the stability of the C-terminal region. In this study, the ligand displacement-studies and the molecular docking results strongly suggest that 8 -aniline- 1 -napthalene sulfonate binds at the H-site in hGST A 1 - 1. The N-capping motif of helix 6 identified in class Alpha GSTs is located within the core of domain 2. This motif is a common feature found amongst almost all GST-like proteins and is thought to be the folding nucleation site (Stenberg et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000), 10421 - 10428). The <b>N-cap</b> (Ser- 154) and N 3 (Asp- 157) residues were each substituted with an Ala in hGST A 1 - 1 to investigate the role of this motif in the folding of hGST A 1 - 1. Both substitutions resulted in thermal sensitive mutants compared to that of the wild-type. The N 3 substitution (D 157 A) was however too disruptive, where the yields of this mutant were insufficient for any further studies to be carried out. For the <b>N-cap</b> mutant (S 154 A), the unfolding kinetic studies revealed a significantly destabilised core in domain 2 compared to that of the wild-type. The kinetic folding studies monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy, revealed that the <b>N-cap</b> motif contributes to the efficient folding and dimerisation of the subunits, and to a far lesser extent towards the final tight packing and reorganisation of tertiary interactions in hGST A 1 - 1. Since no changes in the burst-phase of S 154 A was evident compared to that of the wild-type, it seems unlikely that this motif is a folding nucleation site in hGST A 1 - 1. These results do not exclude the possibility that this motif contributes to the rapid formation secondary structure during the burst-phase of folding. Due to the highly conserved region surrounding helix 6, the role of this motif contributing to the stability of hGST A 1 - 1 could be a general feature for GSTs and GSTlike proteins. In this study, further insight into the mechanism of folding for hGST A 1 - 1 was gained. The hydrophobic core packing surrounding helix 6 occurred as a late folding event, that is during the final packing and reorganisation of tertiary interactions of the protein. The <b>N-cap</b> motif is an important structural feature for the fast folding of domain 2. This <b>N-cap</b> motif is a unique structural feature important for the efficient folding of the monomers, which is exclusive to its role in stabilising helix 6 in hGST A 1 - 1...|$|E
40|$|N 2 is {{the second}} {{position}} in the α-helix. All 20 amino acids {{were placed in the}} N 2 position of a synthetic helical peptide (CH 3 CO-[AXAAAAKAAAAKAAGY]-NH 2) and the helix content was measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy at 273 K. The dependence of peptide helicity on N 2 residue identity has been used to determine a free-energy scale by analysis with a modified Lifson-Roig helix-coil theory that includes a parameter for the N 2 energy (n 2). The rank order of ΔΔG(relative to Ala) is Glu−, Asp− > Ala > Glu 0, Leu, Val, Gln, Thr, Ile, Ser, Met, Asp 0, His 0, Arg, Cys, Lys, Phe > Asn, > Gly, His+, Pro, Tyr. The results correlate very well with N 2 propensities in proteins, moderately well with N 1 and helix interior preferences, and not at all with <b>N-cap</b> preferences. The strongest energetic effects result from interactions with the helix dipole, which favors negative charges at the helix N terminus. Hydrogen bonds to side chains at N 2, such as Gln, Ser, and Thr, are weak, despite occurring frequently in protein crystal structures, in contrast to the <b>N-cap</b> position. This is because <b>N-cap</b> hydrogen bonds are close to linear, whereas N 2 hydrogen bonds have poor geometry. These results can be used to modify protein stability rationally, help design helices, and improve prediction of helix location and stability...|$|E
50|$|Dissection of {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of the GPIbα N-terminal leucine rich repeat domain discloses {{the presence of a}} single disulfide bond between cysteine (Cys) residues Cys4 and Cys17 in the <b>N-capping</b> region, and two disulfide bonds (Cys209-Cys248 and Cys211-Cys264) in the C-capping region. Furthermore, there are seven tandem leucine rich repeats and their flanking sequences in the central parallel β-coil region. This parallel β-coil region is made up of three sided coils stacked in layers and contains two asparagine residues (Asn21 and Asn159), which serve as N-glycosylation sites. Following the leucine rich repeat domain is the acidic residue-rich sequence containing sulfated tyrosines, the highly O-glycosylated macroglycopeptide, a stalk region of about 40 to 50 residues, a single transmembrane sequence and finally a cytoplasmic tail containing 96 amino acid residues which includes serine residues such as Ser587, Ser590 and Ser609 that can be phosphorylated.|$|R
40|$|SummaryRepeat {{proteins}} {{are built}} of modules, {{each of which}} constitutes a structural motif. We have investigated whether fragments of a designed consensus armadillo repeat protein (ArmRP) recognize each other. We examined a split ArmRP consisting of an <b>N-capping</b> repeat (denoted Y), three internal repeats (M), and a C-capping repeat (A). We demonstrate that the C-terminal MA fragment adopts a fold similar to the corresponding part of the entire protein. In contrast, the N-terminal YM 2 fragment constitutes a molten globule. The two fragments form a 1 : 1 YM 2 :MA complex with a nanomolar dissociation constant essentially identical to the crystal structure of the continuous YM 3 A protein. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the complex is structurally stable over a 1  μs timescale and reveal the importance of hydrophobic contacts across the interface. We propose {{that the existence of}} a stable complex recapitulates possible intermediates in the early evolution of these repeat proteins...|$|R
40|$|CLIC 1 is an {{intracellular}} {{channel protein}} that either {{exists in a}} soluble state in the cytoplasm or is bound to the membrane. The mechanism by which CLIC 1 traverses the membrane is not currently known although {{it is likely to}} depend on oxidation and pH. The α 1 helix of CLIC 1, located in the putative transmembrane region, is proposed to span the membrane with the N-terminal end protruding into the extracellular matrix. Recent studies show that this helix contains an <b>N-capping</b> box residue (Ser 27), which will act as a lock on the α 1 helix (Stoychev et al., 2009). In order to find out the contribution of this residue to the stability of the protein, Ser 27 was replaced with proline, a helix breaker. A comparative study was conducted that focused on the characterisation of the mutant in terms of secondary and tertiary structure and determination of its conformational stability at equilibrium in comparison with the wild-type. The study was performed at both pH 7 and 5. 5 which takes into account the environment in the cytoplasm (pH 7) and at the membrane surface (pH 5. 5), respectively. The secondary structure of the mutant was found to be less helical as compared to the wild-type. In terms of tertiary structure, the unique tryptophan residue, Trp 35 was found to be more buried in the mutant compared to the wild-type. The wild-type does not have exposed hydrophobic patches and does not bind to 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS) in the native state at pH 7 and pH 5. 5. However, ANS binds to the mutant in the native state indicating that more hydrophobic patches in the protein are exposed to the solvent. At both values, the mutant displays much lower stability at both pH 7 and 5. 5 as compared to the wild-type. As a conclusion, {{it was found that the}} <b>N-capping</b> box residue, Ser 27, plays a significant role as a good helix initiating residue. Moreover, this residue has a significant effect in stabilising the α 1 helix and may play a role in the cooperativity between the N- and C-domains and thus in stabilising the whole protein...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{structural and}} thermodynamic features of disulfides within an alpha-helix, a non-redundant dataset comprising of 5025 polypeptide chains containing 2311 disulfides was examined. Thirty-five examples were found of intrahelical disulfides involving a CXXC motif between the <b>N-Cap</b> and third helical positions. GLY and PRO {{were the most}} common amino acids at positions 1 and 2, respectively. The <b>N-Cap</b> residue for disulfide bonded CXXC motifs had average values of (- 112 +/- 25. 2 degrees, 106 +/- 25. 4 degrees). To further explore conformational requirements for intrahelical disulfides, CYS pairs were introduced at positions N-Cap- 3; 1, 4; 7, 10 in two helices of an Escherichia coli thioredoxin mutant lacking its active site disulfide (nSS Trx). In both helices, disulfides formed spontaneously during purification only at positions N-Cap- 3. Mutant stabilities were characterized by chemical denaturation studies (in both oxidized and reduced states) and differential scanning calorimetry (oxidized state only). All oxidized as well as reduced mutants were destabilized relative to nSS Trx. All mutants were redox active, but showed decreased activity relative to wild-type thioredoxin. Such engineered disulfides {{can be used to}} probe helix start sites in proteins of unknown structure and to introduce redox activity into proteins. Conversely, a protein with CYS residues at positions <b>N-Cap</b> and 3 of an alpha-helix is likely to have redox activity...|$|E
40|$|Cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is {{a highly}} conserved and widely {{distributed}} protein that links the nutritional response signaling to cytoskeleton remodeling. In yeast, CAP is {{a component of the}} adenylyl cyclase complex and helps to activate the Ras-mediated catalytic cycle of the cyclase. While the N-terminal domain of CAP (NCAP) provides a binding site for adenylyl cyclase, the C-terminal domain (C-CAP) possesses actin binding activity. Our attempts to crystallize full-length recombinant CAP from Dictyostelium discoideum resulted in growth of orthorhombic crystals containing only the N-terminal domain (residues 42 - 227) due to auto-proteolytic cleavage. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with data at 2. 2 A͊resolution. The present crystal structure allows the characterization of a head-to-tail <b>N-CAP</b> dimer in the asymmetric unit and a crystallographic side-toside dimer. Comparison with previously published structures of <b>N-CAP</b> reveals variable modes of dimerization of this domain, but the presence of a common interface for the side-to-side dimer.

40|$|The helix {{propagation}} and <b>N-cap</b> propensities of {{the amino}} acids have been measured in alanine-based peptides in 40 volume percent trifluoroethanol (40 % TFE) {{to determine if}} this helix-stabilizing solvent uniformly affects all amino acids. The propensities in 40 % TFE are compared with revised values of the helix parameters of alanine-based peptides in water. Revision of the propensities in water {{is the result of}} redefining the capping statistical weights and evaluating the helix nucleation constant with N-capping explicitly included in the helix-coil model. The propagation propensities of all amino acids increase in 40 % TFE relative to water, but the increases are highly variable. In water, all beta-branched and beta-substituted amino acids are helix breakers. In 40 % TFE, the propagation propensities of the nonpolar amino acids increase greatly, leaving charged and neutral polar, beta-substituted amino acids as helix breakers. Glycine and proline are strong helix breakers in both solvents. Free energy differences for helix propagation (delta delta G) between alanine and other nonpolar amino acids are twice as large in water as predicted from side-chain conformational entropies, but delta delta G values in 40 % TFE are close to those predicted from side-chain entropies. This dependence of delta delta G on the solvent points to a specific role of water in determining the relative helix propensities of the nonpolar amino acids. The <b>N-cap</b> propensities converge toward a common value in 40 % TFE, suggesting that differential solvation by water contributes to the diversity of <b>N-cap</b> values shown by the amino acids...|$|E
40|$|Possible early {{events in}} protein folding may be studied by {{dissecting}} proteins into complementary fragments. Two fragments of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 [CI 2 -(20 - 59) and CI 2 -(60 - 83) ] associate {{to form a}} native-like structure in a second-order reaction that combines collision and rearrangement. The transition state of the reaction, analyzed by the protein engineering method on 17 mutants, is remarkably similar to that for the folding of the intact protein [...] a structure that resembles an expanded version of the folded structure with most interactions significantly weakened. The exception is that the N-terminal region of the single alpha-helix (the <b>N-capping</b> box) is completely formed in the transition state for association of the fragments, whereas it is reasonably well formed for the intact protein. Preliminary evidence on the structures of the individual fragments indicates that both are mainly nonnative, lacking native secondary structure and having regions of nonnative buried hydrophobic clusters. The association reaction does not result from the collision of a subpopulation of two fully native-like fragments but involves a considerable rearrangement of structure...|$|R
40|$|The Claisen {{rearrangement}} of chorismate to prephenate {{has become}} an important model system for developing understanding of enzymatic catalysis {{as well as for}} computational treatment of enzyme active sites. This thesis presents general methods for the computational design of enzyme active sites and applies these methods to the design of catalysts for the chorismate-prephenate rearrangement. The computational methods described allow the incorporation of transition-state structures and other small molecules into protein design calculations. These design procedures were tested through redesign of the active site of Escherichia coli chorismate mutase. The six predicted mutations were experimentally characterized and most maintained or increased the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To further investigate the context of the mutations predicted in the calculation and the tolerance of a natural enzyme to secondary active site mutations, extensive substitution experiments were performed. The effect of every amino acid in five active site hydrophobic positions and one <b>N-capping</b> position was evaluated. These experiments clarified some of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the computational modeling procedure. Finally, attempts to design a completely new enzyme for catalysis of the chorismate-prephenate rearrangement are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Full {{sequence}} design protein FSD- 1 is a designed protein {{based on}} the motif of zinc finger protein. In this work, its folding mecha-nism and thermal stability are investigated using the replica exchange molecular dynamics model with the water molecules being treated explicitly. The {{results show that the}} folding of the FSD- 1 is ini-tiated by the hydrophobic collapse, which is accom-panied with the formation of the C-terminal a-he-lix. Then the folding proceeds with the formation of the b-hairpin and the further package of the hydro-phobic core. Compared with the b-hairpin, the a-helix has much higher stability. It is also found that the <b>N-capping</b> motif adopted by the FSD- 1 con-tributes to the stability of the a-helix dramatically. The hydrophobic contacts made by the side chain of Tyr 3 in the native state are essential for the sta-bilization of the b-hairpin. It is also found that the folding of the N-terminal b-hairpin and the C-termi-nal a-helix exhibits weak cooperativity, which is consistent with the experimental data. Meanwhile, the folding pathway is compared between the FSD- 1 and the target zinc finger peptide, and the possi-ble role of the zinc ion on the folding pathway of zinc finger is proposed.
