500|$|The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago {{received}} Till's body. Upon arrival, Bradley {{insisted on}} viewing {{it to make}} a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying, [...] "There was just <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see." [...] Tens {{of thousands of people}} lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till's body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the final climb, the leading duo were joined by Jonathan Castroviejo (...) and Bartosz Huzarski (...) [...] Sky set a high pace in pursuit of the leading group, and with [...] to go, Chris Froome attacked, {{followed}} by Tejay van Garderen, and they soon passed the leaders. With [...] remaining, Froome attacked to win the stage by a margin of seventeen seconds. Van Garderen moved into the lead of the general classification, and although placing second in the stage, he was content, saying [...] "My tactic was just to mark Froome and when he went there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> follow him, but I'm very happy with the yellow jersey." ...|$|E
500|$|Metallica's {{performance}} at the ceremony, held in February 1989 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, {{marked the first time}} a heavy metal group had performed during the Grammy Awards. Metallica was expected to win the award, and members of Jethro Tull were told by their record label Chrysalis Records not to bother attending the ceremony because they [...] "weren't likely to win." [...] However, Jethro Tull won the award (recipients included members Ian Anderson, Martin Barre, and Dave Pegg), and when presenters Alice Cooper and Lita Ford announced the result, booing could be heard from the crowd. Anderson, who assumed that the band was being recognized for their twenty-year history, as opposed to a single album, later stated that he was [...] "lucky" [...] not to have attended the ceremony, as [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have accepted it under those circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{have been}} {{glad to see}} ye, however ye had come," [...] he said, and Vane fully {{believed}} him. [...] "For a' that, this is <b>no</b> the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have wished to welcome ye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't denied," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "that Mr. Compton had loaned me a pistol. As {{a matter}} of fact, I had {{forgotten}} all about it. I do not particularly recognize this one as the weapon he loaned me, though it is of the same type. There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> identify the particular weapon he handed me." ...|$|R
2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever play again {{a lot of the stuff}} I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|R
2500|$|While in Los Angeles, Abdul-Jabbar {{started doing}} yoga in 1976 {{to improve his}} flexibility, and was notable for his {{physical}} fitness regimen. He says, [...] "There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have played as long as I did without yoga." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bowles {{had been}} asked some years earlier to play Jerry Leadbetter, the husband of Keith's Margo, in The Good Life. Owing to prior commitments, Bowles turned down the role, but had he played Jerry, it is {{unlikely}} {{he would have been}} offered the part of Richard; as Bowles later said, [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have played Penelope Keith's screen husband in two separate sitcoms". However, in 1987 Bowles replaced Geoffrey Palmer as Keith's onscreen husband in the ITV sitcom Executive Stress.|$|E
2500|$|... "I did {{the pilot}} for Britain's Got Talent – which was {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Paul O'Grady's Got Talent. But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything. I can’t be a hypocrite and come in and do this. I had to bow out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "No reader {{should be}} {{surprised}} at finding this prefatory piece herein," [...] wrote Gygax in the first paragraph of this foreword. [...] "As the principle one to whom this book is dedicated, there was <b>no</b> conceivable <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> refuse writing a short introduction for it without seeming to be a total ingrate. I mention this merely {{to point out the}} clever tactics of the authors, for the same ingenuity is certainly applied to the contents of the work proper." [...] Skirmisher retained the same dedication and foreword in the revised, expanded and redesigned Experts v.3.5, which it released in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the release}} of Lennie Tristano, the usage of multitracking and tape speed was widely {{questioned}} and criticized on the songs [...] "Line Up", [...] "Turkish Mambo" [...] and [...] "East Thirty-Second". In the case of [...] "Turkish Mambo", Tristano played three separate and conflicting piano tracks, with left-hand rhythms of five, six and seven beats beneath right-hand improvisation. Tristano made specific reference to that song in defending his choice, stating that [...] "if I do multiple tapes, I don't feel I'm a phony thereby. Take [...] "The Turkish Mambo". There is <b>no</b> other <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the rhythms to go together the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> feel them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although he did {{not attend}} college, Sheen {{credited}} the Marianists at University of Dayton as {{a major influence on}} his public activism, as well as Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Sheen is known for his outspoken support of liberal political causes, such as opposition to United States military actions and a hazardous-waste incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio. Sheen has resisted calls to run for office, saying: [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be the president. You can't have a pacifist in the White House.... I'm an actor. This is what I do for a living." [...] Sheen is an honorary trustee of the Dayton International Peace Museum.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} from October 1976 with Sounds magazine, Clapton {{said that he}} was not a political person and that his rambling remarks that night were not appropriate. However, in a 2004 interview with Uncut, Clapton referred to Powell as [...] "outrageously brave". He complained that the UK was [...] "... inviting people in as cheap labour and then putting them in ghettos". In 2004, Clapton told {{an interview}}er for Scotland on Sunday, [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be a racist. It would make no sense". In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton called himself [...] "deliberately oblivious to it all" [...] and wrote, [...] "I had never really understood or been directly affected by racial conflict ... when I listened to music, I was disinterested in where the players came from or what colour their skin was. Interesting, then, that 10 years later, I would be labelled a racist." [...] In a December 2007 interview with Melvyn Bragg on The South Bank Show, Clapton reiterated his support for Enoch Powell and again denied that Powell's views were racist.|$|E
2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E

"Through {{the hole}} in the wall, which had been caused by the tearing away of some of the {{connection}} between the tower and main building, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> look down on the ground below, covered with masses of jagged stone; but there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> in which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get down. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not descend that perpendicular wall.

2500|$|In 1862, senior {{political}} {{figures in the}} Tokugawa shogunate created the post of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Kyoto Military Commissioner), {{for the purpose of}} recovering public order in the city, which was under the influence of Sonnō Jōi militants. The post of Kyoto Shugoshoku was one that changed much of the dynamic that had theretofore existed in the city. Previously, the holder of the Kyoto shoshidai (...) position had held the highest power there, supervising affairs in the Kyoto-Osaka area as the representative of the Shogun. However, the successive Shoshidai, as well as the city magistrates under their charge, were increasingly unable to secure and maintain the public order, so the post of Shugoshoku was superimposed on the existing structure. Where the Shoshidai and magistrates had been unable to secure through civil law, the Shugoshoku was to achieve through the use of military force. After much deliberation, the choice for the Shugoshoku post came down to two domains: Echizen and Aizu. Of the two, Echizen's Matsudaira Yoshinaga already held high Shogunal office as President of Political Affairs ( [...] ; seiji sōsai-shoku), so all attention was then turned to Matsudaira Katamori. As Katamori was ill, Aizu's senior Edo-based councilor Yokoyama Tsunenori was summoned to Edo Castle instead, and given word of the assignment. Katamori sent a retainer back with a request for being excused: [...] "As this is a shogunal order, we not only {{have no choice but to}} accept. Furthermore, our domain's founder Lord [...] Masayuki laid down a direct command to do so in our house code. However, our lord Katamori is still young, and our men are in the north and unfamiliar with conditions in the Capital. If we were to accept this assignment without question, and a one in ten thousand chance of disaster were to strike, we of the Aizu domain could not possibly do it all alone; the Shogun would have to get involved, as would all of Japan. We would like to consider this carefully." [...] However, the Bakufu would not listen to this refusal. Matsudaira Yoshinaga traveled personally to the Aizu residence, and confronted Katamori with harsh words invoking Aizu's distinguished past as Shogunate functionaries: [...] "If [...] Lord Masayuki were still alive, he would accept without a second thought!" [...] Rumors began to circulate that Katamori refused the assignment out of a desire for self-preservation, to which Katamori is said to have responded, [...] "If people start talking like this, it will shame our domain. There is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> explain this to the generations of Aizu lords who have gone before me. I have no choice but to accept." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{talk about}} Beatrice," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to tell you {{everything}} about her. I know that you will understand. We were brought up together in the same country place. We were both thrown upon the world about the same time. That was one thing, I suppose, which made us kindly disposed towards one another. We corresponded always. I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London. I lived--I can't tell you how--week by week, month by month. I ate coarse food, I was a hanger-on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me, fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries. I met no one of my own station--I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk--or tastes. I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself, no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows, no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with--and I wasn't always the gloomy sort of person I have become; in my younger days I loved companionship. And the women--my landlady's daughter, with dyed hair, a loud voice, slatternly in the morning, a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night! Who else? Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men? I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna. Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together. We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes. She was a teacher at the national school. The children weren't pleasant, their parents were worse. The drudgery was horrible, and there wasn't any escape for her. Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side. She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us. I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery. We talked endlessly of a way out. For me what was there? There was no one to rob--I wasn't clever enough. There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> earn money, honestly or dishonestly. And for her, buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries, where there was scarcely a person who hadn't the taint of the place upon them--what chance was there for her? There was nothing she could do, either. I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape. And we couldn't. So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we. We read poetry. We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes. It was a morbid, unhealthy existence, but I plodded along and so did she. Then her weekly letters became different. For the first time she wrote me with reserves. I took a day's vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened." ...|$|E

5000|$|The only {{musician}} of {{the first}} album line-up that {{did not participate in}} this album's recording was John McGeoch. McGeoch commented in an interview: [...] "One time I was in Spain with Siouxsie and the Banshees {{at the same time as}} Visage were recording the second album in London. Rusty Egan wanted me to put a guitar solo on something or other but I only had one day off and there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fly home on my one day off. Rusty is not a man to be put off by such things and he was actually trying to put together a satellite linkup from Madrid to London for this one guitar part. Not surprisingly it didn't come off but I was sorry not to have been as involved on The Anvil as I had been on the first album".|$|R
5000|$|Sandé {{attended}} school at Alford Academy, {{where her father}} was a teacher. She said, [...] "I hated to be ill and to miss a day because I was so hungry to learn.

Inevitably, throughout secondary school, it was part and parcel of my identity that I was Mr. Sandé's daughter. <b>No</b> <b>way</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> muck about or get into trouble, because it would've got back to him within minutes.

2500|$|Scarborough's most {{high-profile}} {{case was}} briefly representing Michael F. Griffin, {{the killer of}} doctor David Gunn, in 1993. He made several court appearances representing Griffin, before removing himself from the case, later saying: [...] "There was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> in hell <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sit in at a civil trial, let alone a capital trial", referring to the prospect of prosecutors seeking the death penalty against Griffin. Scarborough assisted Griffin in choosing other counsel from the many who offered their services, however, and helped shield the family from the media exposure, pro bono.|$|R
2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny. I feel that. I struggle because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. [...] "And there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever change {{the way that we}} started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|R
60|$|Her {{magnificent}} {{voice was}} now weak and uncertain. Her speech painfully hesitant. She {{who had been}} so strong, so brave, was now both easily frightened and readily confused.
