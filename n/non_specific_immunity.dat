This is in contrast to domesticated ostriches, who in captivity develop high concentration of immunoglobulin antibodies in their circulation, indicating an acquired immunological response. It is suggested that this immunological adaptability may allow this species to have a high success rate of survival in variable environmental settings.|$|E
40|$|In present era, {{infectious}} diseases are expanding like anything. To catch all the organisms (newly evolved, resistant strains, capsulated organisms etc) and {{to treat them}} accordingly is not become possible all the time. Prevention might be the right choice against such kind of diseases. Thus vaccination since its conceptualization {{remains one of the}} important pillars of preventive medicine. But even after enormous efforts, preventing all the diseases (which are produced by known organism) still remain out of reach. This fact catches up the eyes towards other methods of disease prevention described in traditional health care systems like ayurveda. Rasayana is one such measure to strengthen the general immunity (both innate and cell mediated), which makes body so strong that it can resist variety of infectious agents entering the body system. Hence rasayana improves <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> where as vaccination works on limited specific immunity.

40|$|Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have invaded a great {{proportion}} of {{the waters of the}} eastern part of North America. This mollusk may be a useful sentinel species for bioaccumulation of heavy metals and organic contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. The zebra mussel's capacity to bioaccumulate cadmium at environmentally relevant exposure and to sequester metals in metal-binding proteins, metallothioneins, was investigated. Elevated (relative to control) concentrations of Cd$ sp{ 2 +}$ were detected in Dreissena exposed to $ ge$ 2 $ mu$g Cd/liter suggesting that zebra mussels cannot regulate Cd$ sp{ 2 +}$ of trace exposure concentration. More than 85 % of the measured Cd$ sp{ 2 +}$ was bound to metallothioneins. Lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) was assessed as a model species for potential impacts of zebra mussels on higher trophic levels. The feasibility of incubating and rearing scaup in semi-natural conditions was evaluated. A series of biomarkers was assessed in 3 groups of scaup fed a contaminant-free diet or diets containing zebra mussels from the St-Lawrence River or Lake Erie. Lesser scaup proved to be a suitable species to raise in captivity providing daily water misting through out incubation and strict hygiene conditions during brooding. A hatching success of 89 % was achieved. Appropriate housing, feeding and bathing conditions yielded low (3 %) post-hatching mortality. Phagocytosis and respiratory burst activities of heterophils of scaup were suppressed after 6 weeks of feeding on zebra mussels, compared to the control group. These two heterophilic functions were negatively correlated with the incidence of pododermatitis (bacterial feet infection), suggesting a suppression of the <b>non</b> <b>specific</b> <b>immunity.</b> Increased liver/body mass ratio and decreased hepatic vitamin A (retinol and retinyl palmitate) concentrations were observed in scaups fed zebra mussels. Lipid accumulation and glycogen overload were found in the livers of scaups fed mussels from the St-Lawrence River and the Lake Erie groups, respectively. These immunological, biochemical and histopathological biomarkers show promise for monitoring "early" injury and may help in the understanding of health impairment of different species of waterfowl exposed to xenobiotics via contaminated food sources...|$|E
40|$|Newcastle disease (ND) {{is caused}} by avian paramyxovirus- 1 which belong to Avulavirus genus and Paramyxoviridae family. The birds have {{abnormalities}} in humoral (bursa fabricius) and cellular (thymus and spleen) lymphoid organs. Lesions decrease the immune system. Immune system consists of non-specific and specific immune systems. The main components of non-specific immunity are physical and chemical barrier (feather and skin or mucosa), phagocytic cells (macrophages and natural killer), protein complement and the mediator of inflammation and cytokines. Interferons (IFNs) belong {{to a group of}} cytokines that {{play a major role in}} the nonspecific or innate (natural) immunity. The virulent ND virus encodes protein of V gene can be suppressed IFN type I. This leads to non-specific immune system fail to respond to the virulent strains resulting in severe pathogenicity. The defense mechanism of the host is replaced by <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> (adaptive immunity) when natural immunity fails to overcome the infection. The specific immune system consists of humoral mediated immunity (HMI) and cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The cells of immune system that react specifically with the antigen are B lymphocytes producing the antibodies, T lymphocytes that regulate the synthesis of antibodies and T cells as effector or the direct cytotoxic cells. Both non-specific and <b>specific</b> <b>immunities</b> are complementary against the invasion of ND virus in the birds.

40|$|Background: Lyme disease, {{caused by}} Borrelia burgdorferi, {{is the most}} common tick-borne {{infection}} in the United States. Although humans can be infected by at least 16 different strains of B. burgdorferi, the overwhelming majority of infections are due to only four strains. It was recently demonstrated that patients who are treated for early Lyme disease develop <b>immunity</b> to the <b>specific</b> strain of B. burgdorferi that caused their infection. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the reduction in cases of Lyme disease in the United States that may occur as a result of type <b>specific</b> <b>immunity.</b> Methods: The analysis was performed based on three analytical models that assessed the effects of type <b>specific</b> <b>immunity.</b> Observational data on the frequency with which different B. burgdorferi strains cause human infection in culture-confirmed patients with an initial episode of erythema migrans diagnosed between 1991 and 2005 in the Northeastern United States were used in the analyses. Results: Assuming a reinfection rate of 3 % and a total incidence of Lyme disease per year of 300, 000, the estimated number of averted cases of Lyme disease per year ranges from 319 to 2378 depending on the duration of type <b>specific</b> <b>immunity</b> and the model used.
