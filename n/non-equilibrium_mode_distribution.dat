40|$|We {{review the}} recent {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} transport properties of spin-split superconductors under non-equilibrium conditions. Recent experiments and theories demonstrate a rich variety of transport phenomena occurring in devices based on such materials that suggest direct applications in thermoelectricity, low-dissipative spintronics, radiation detection and sensing. We discuss different experimental situations and present a complete theoretical framework based on the quantum kinetic equations. Within this framework we provide an accurate description of the non-equilibrium distribution of charge, spin and energy, which are the relevant <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>modes,</b> in different hybrid structures. We also review experiments on spin-split superconductors and show how transport measurements reveal {{the properties of the}} <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>modes</b> and their mutual coupling. We discuss in detail phenomena like spin injection and diffusion, relaxation of the different electronic degrees of freedom, very large thermoelectric effects and the non-equilibrium dynamics of spin-split superconductors.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a novel scene change detection method using complexity and edge direction based on intra prediction mode in H. 264 /AVC compressed video. When scene change occurs, {{there is less}} temporal correlation between consecutive frames. Therefore, most of macro-blocks are encoded in intra mode. Using this property, the proposed method calculates the percentage of intra mode blocks in each predictive frame {{in order to get}} candidates of scene change frames. To detect accurate scene change frames, we generate the Intra <b>Mode</b> <b>Distribution</b> Histogram (IMDH) representing edge directionality and image roughness. By similarity matching of consecutive two IMDHs, we decide scene change frames. The distance between two IMDHs is measured using χ 2 -statistic.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} methods for controlling the <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> in multimode optical fibres. The major contributions presented in this thesis are summarised below. Emerging standards for Gigabit Ethernet transmission over multimode optical fibre {{have led to a}} resurgence of interest in the precise control, and specification, of modal launch conditions. In particular, commercial LED and OTDR test equipment does not, in general, comply with these standards. There is therefore a need for mode control devices, which can ensure compliance with the standards. A novel device consisting of a point-load mode-scrambler in tandem with a mode-filter is described in this thesis. The device, which has been patented, may be tuned to achieve a wide range of <b>mode</b> <b>distributions</b> and has been implemented in a ruggedised package for field use. Various other techniques for mode control have been described in this work, including the use of Long Period Gratings and air-gap mode-filters. Some of the methods have been applied to other applications, such as speckle suppression and in sensor technology. A novel, self-referencing, sensor comprising two modal groups in the <b>Mode</b> Power <b>Distribution</b> has been designed and tested. The feasibility of a two-channel Mode Group Diversity Multiplexed system has been demonstrated over 985 m. A test apparatus for measuring <b>mode</b> <b>distribution</b> has been designed and constructed. The apparatus consists of a purpose-built video microscope, and comprehensive control and analysis software written in Visual Basic. The system may be fitted with a Silicon camera or an InGaAs camera, for measurement in the 850 nm and 130 nm transmission windows respectively. A limitation of the measurement method, when applied to well-filled fibres, has been identified and an improvement to the method has been proposed, based on modelled Laguerre Gauss field solutions.

40|$|Long {{metallic}} nanowires combine crucial {{factors for}} non-conservative current-driven atomic mo- tion. These systems have degenerate vibrational frequencies, clustered about a Kohn anomaly in the dispersion relation, that can couple under current to form <b>non-equilibrium</b> <b>modes</b> of motion growing exponentially in time. Such motion {{is made possible}} by non-conservative current-induced forces on atoms, and we refer to it generically as the waterwheel effect. Here the connection be- tween the waterwheel effect and the stimulated directional emission of phonons propagating along the electron flow is discussed in an intuitive manner. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics show that waterwheel modes self-regulate by reducing the current and by populating modes nearby in fre- quency, leading to a dynamical steady state in which non-conservative forces are counter-balanced by the electronic friction. The waterwheel effect can be described by an appropriate effective non- equilibrium dynamical response matrix. We show that the current-induced parts of this matrix in metallic systems are long-ranged, especially at low bias. This non-locality {{is essential for the}} characterisation of non-conservative atomic dynamics under current beyond the nanoscale. Comment: 15 pages 6 figure...|$|R
