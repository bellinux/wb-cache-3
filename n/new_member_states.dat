25|$|In 1999, Estonia {{experienced}} {{its worst}} year economically since it regained independence in 1991, {{largely because of}} the impact of the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

30|$|But does {{a mobile}} labor force really {{make much of}} a {{difference}} for a country’s economic prospects? Policymakers are aware of statistics showing the relative immobility of Europeans and are eager to know what they can do about it. The phased withdrawal of restrictions on the movement of people from the <b>newest</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the European Union has been an obvious obstacle that will disappear in time. Yet people from the <b>newer</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> still face explicit barriers to mobility within the European Union 19. Lessons from how different EU 15 members have managed this aspect of enlargement are still being absorbed, but evidence from movements since 2004 and in reaction to the crisis indicate that the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> that embraced newcomers from the <b>newest</b> <b>member</b> countries benefited.

Russia accounts for about two-thirds of these savings, with the remainder divided up roughly equally between the Ukraine and the EU's <b>New</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Emission savings include cuts in methane, HFC, and N2O emissions.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{immigrant}} workers mainly from <b>new</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe comprise a large {{component of the}} seasonal agricultural workforce, particularly {{in the south of}} the county where more labour-intensive crops such as small vegetables and cut flowers are typically grown. This seasonal influx of migrant labour occasionally causes tension between the migrant workforce and local people, in a county which is relatively unaccustomed to large-scale immigration. However, {{as a result of the}} current economic climate some food production facilities have closed down, this has caused some reduction in the levels of migrant workers. The large number of people from Portugal is still obvious in the town of Boston, and in Grantham the number of Polish workers is apparent.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to review}} the EU's {{constitutional}} framework, {{particularly in light of}} the accession of ten <b>new</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in 2004, was highlighted in a declaration annexed to the Treaty of Nice in 2001. The agreements at Nice had paved the way for further enlargement of the Union by reforming voting procedures. The Laeken declaration of December 2001 committed the EU to improving democracy, transparency and efficiency, and set out the process by which a constitution aiming to achieve these goals could be created. The European Convention was established, presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and was given the task of consulting as widely as possible across Europe with the aim of producing a first draft of the Constitution. The final text of the proposed Constitution was agreed upon at the summit meeting on 18–19 June 2004 under the presidency of Ireland.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the process of price {{convergence}} (beta and sigma convergence) in <b>new</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> towards the Euro area (EU- 12). The theoretical part of the paper consists of a brief overview of methods that are employed for analyses of the process of price convergence. Both main concepts - sigma and beta convergence are covered including various tests that are described in greater detail. The empirical part of the paper is focused on testing hypotheses of sigma and beta convergence using macroeconomic data (comparative price levels for GDP) for twelve <b>new</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in the period 1995 - 2008. Various econometrical methods (OLS, 2 SLS, and two dynamic methods) are utilised in order to deal with problems associated with this particular type of analyses. Our results show that both hypotheses (sigma and beta price convergence) do hold for the <b>new</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The estimated time to close a half of the remaining gap of comparative price levels towards the Euro area average for the group consisting of all <b>new</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (NMS 12) is estimated to be approximately 9. 6 years, for the group of more advanced countries (NMS 5) is approximately 7. 1 years. <b>new</b> EU <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> international comparisons, comparative price level, beta and sigma convergence...|$|R

25|$|The EU traces {{its origins}} from the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome. The {{original}} members of {{what came to}} be known as the European Communities, were the Inner Six; Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany. The Communities and its successors have grown in size by the accession of <b>new</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and in power by the addition of policy areas to its remit. While no member state has left the EU or its antecedent organisations, the United Kingdom enacted the result of a membership referendum in June 2016 and is currently negotiating its withdrawal. The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union in 1993 and introduced European citizenship. The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{as part of}} a European Union (EU) member state, Scottish farmers {{received}} £583 {{million in}} subsidy payments from the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Annual CAP payments are made to the UK, which then determines how much to allocate to each of the devolved administrations, including Scotland. In the last CAP agreement, farmers in the UK qualified for additional convergence payments because Scottish farmers receive a lower average single farm payment per hectare, mainly due to the mountainous terrain in Scotland. Supporters of independence therefore believed that an independent Scotland would receive greater agricultural subsidies than when part of the UK. Opponents of independence believed that Scottish farmers benefited because the UK was one of the larger EU member states and therefore had a greater say in CAP negotiations. They also questioned whether an independent Scotland would immediately receive full subsidy payments from the EU, as recent <b>new</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> had their subsidies phased in.|$|E
25|$|Citizens of the European Union, {{including}} those of the UK, have the right to live and work in any EU member state. The UK applied temporary restrictions to citizens of Romania and Bulgaria, which joined the EU in January 2007. Research conducted by the Migration Policy Institute for the Equality and Human Rights Commission suggests that, between May 2004 and September 2009, 1.5million workers migrated from the new EU member states to the UK, two-thirds of them Polish, but that many subsequently returned home, resulting in a net {{increase in the number of}} nationals of the <b>new</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in the UK of some 700,000 over that period. The late-2000s recession in the UK reduced the economic incentive for Poles to migrate to the UK, the migration becoming temporary and circular. In 2009, for the first time since enlargement, more nationals of the eight central and eastern European states that had joined the EU in 2004 left the UK than arrived. In 2011, citizens of the new EU member states made up 13% of the immigrants entering the country.|$|E

On 8 June 2010, the EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011.

25|$|Public {{opinion in}} EU {{countries}} generally opposes Turkish membership, though {{with varying degrees}} of intensity. The Eurobarometer September–October 2006 survey shows that 59% of EU-27 citizens are against Turkey joining the EU, while only about 28% are in favour. Nearly all citizens (about 9 in 10) expressed concerns about human rights as the leading cause. In the earlier March–May 2006 Eurobarometer, citizens from the <b>new</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were more in favour of Turkey joining (44% in favour) than the old EU-15 (38% in favour). At the time of the survey, the country whose population most strongly opposed Turkish membership was Austria (con: 81%), while Romania was most in favour of the accession (pro: 66%). On a wider political scope, the highest support comes from the Turkish Cypriot Community (pro: 67%) (which is not recognised as sovereign state and is de facto not EU territory and out of the European institutions). These communities are even more in favour of the accession than the Turkish populace itself (pro: 54%). Opposition in Denmark to Turkish membership was polled at 60% in October 2007, despite the Danish government's support for Turkey's EU bid.|$|E
