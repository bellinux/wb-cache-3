5|$|Though spokespeople for {{the team}} first denied any plans to sign Armstrong, Bruyneel commented two days later during the then-ongoing Vuelta a España that he had spoken to Armstrong about his return, and could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> him riding for any team but Astana. On September 24, Armstrong signed with Astana.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as the writers could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E
5|$|Considering the ICBM problem, {{the study}} {{went on to}} suggest that the system would have to be {{effective}} between 95 and 100% of the time in order to be worthwhile. They considered attacks against the RV while the missile was in the midcourse, just as it reached the highest point in its trajectory and was traveling at its slowest speed. Practical limitations eliminated this possibility, as it required the ABM to be launched {{at about the same time}} as the ICBM in order to meet in the middle, and they could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> a way to arrange this. Working at much shorter ranges, during the terminal phase, seemed the only possible solution.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Rama Rao's son {{and actor}} Nandamuri Balakrishna {{announced}} Nartanasala remake in 2004. Apart from directing the remake, Balakrishna played a dual {{role in the}} remakethose of Arjuna and Kichaka. Soundarya was signed to play Draupadi with Srihari, Sarath Babu, Uday Kiran and Asin cast in supporting roles. The remake's principal photography commenced on 1 March 2004. The remake was shelved later due {{to the death of}} Soundarya in an accident. In an interview with The Times of India in August 2014, Balakrishna said that he could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone other than Soundarya for the character and after her death, he called off the film with no intention to revive it.|$|E

Żurawski's company last contacted Urban between 15:00 and 16:00, when Urban {{reported that he had}} arrived a day early to the Berlin warehouse and that he had to wait there overnight to unload his truck the following morning. The last photo of Urban still alive was taken at a kebab shop near the ThyssenKrupp warehouse at about 14:00.|$|E

500|$|The drafter of the Malayan ISA was Hugh Hickling, a British lawyer, {{author and}} professor. In 1989, he commented that he [...] "could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> {{then that the}} time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities".

500|$|Caracciola {{first met}} Adolf Hitler, {{the leader of}} the Nazi Party, in 1931. Hitler had ordered a Mercedes-Benz 770, at that point Mercedes' most {{expensive}} car, but due to {{the amount of time spent}} upgrading the car in line with the Nazi leader's wishes, the delivery was late. To mollify Hitler's anger, Caracciola was dispatched by Mercedes to deliver the car to the Brown House in Munich. Caracciola drove Hitler and his niece Geli Raubal around Munich to demonstrate the car. He later wrote (after the fall of the Nazi Party) that he was not particularly awed by Hitler: [...] "I could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> that this man would have the requirements for taking over the government someday." ...|$|E
500|$|One critic theorized, [...] "...ather than {{end this}} Brazil-ian sci-fi dystopia with the {{equivalent}} of that film's shot of its lobotomized hero, which puts the lie to the immediately previous scene of his imagined liberation, Spielberg tries to pass off exactly the same ending but without the rimshot, {{just to see if}} the audience is paying attention." [...] Film scholars Nigel Morris and Jason P. Vest point to a line in the film as possible evidence of this. After Anderton is captured, Gideon tells him that, [...] "It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions. That your life flashes before your eyes. That all your dreams come true."*Vest. pg. 135 While Vest considers the blissful dream ending a possibility, he questions why Anderton did <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> his son as having returned.|$|E

500|$|Heisman {{recalled}} that, when Strupper {{first arrived}} from Riverside Military Academy, Heisman could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> Strupper {{playing on the}} football team: [...] "Too light for the line, I didn't see how he could play in the backfield, because he wouldn't {{be able to get}} the signals. He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear enough for him to call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E

[...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry to say that, in the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment".

500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. I put them in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E

500|$|Manson {{began his}} {{long-term}} collaboration with Austrian-Irish artist Gottfried Helnwein in May 2002, collaborating on several projects {{associated with the}} album. In addition to the album artwork, the pair created large-scale multi-media installation art pieces that {{would go on to}} be exhibited in various galleries throughout Europe and the United States. These were also displayed at the album's launch party at The Key Club in Los Angeles. They also worked together on the music video to lead single [...] "Mobscene" [...] (stylized as [...] "mOBSCENE"), as well as images which accompanied Manson's essay for The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Helnwein later expressed disappointment that the latter was not selected as the album cover. Many of the images found in the album artwork were inspired by illustrations found in Mel Gordon's 2000 book Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin. Concerned that Gordon might take issue with use of the book's material, Manson called Gordon, who said he could <b>not</b> <b>imagine</b> a greater compliment than a popular music album based on an academic book. The Golden Age of Grotesque was also the title of Manson's first art exhibition, which took place in September 2002 at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Center.|$|E
