50|$|Hypertensive {{kidney disease}} is a medical {{condition}} referring to damage to the kidney due to chronic high blood pressure. HN {{can be divided into}} two types: benign and malignant. Benign nephrosclerosis is common in individuals over the age of 60 where malignant nephrosclerosis is uncommon and affects 1-5% of individuals with high blood pressure, that have diastolic blood pressure passing 130 mm Hg. It should be distinguished from renovascular hypertension, which is a form of secondary hypertension. In addition, HN can be referred to as hypertensive nephrosclerosis, benign nephrosclerosis, and <b>nephroangiosclerosis.</b>|$|E

40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} enzyme gene I/D polymorphism in {{essential hypertension}} and <b>nephroangiosclerosis.</b> An insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) gene significantly influences circulating ACE levels and {{plays a role in}} the development of target organ damage, that is, left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension (EH), and microalbuminuria in diabetes mellitus. We have examined the role of the I/D polymorphism in essential hypertensive patients with renal involvement. The study was divided in two independent protocols. In protocol 1, we retrospectively analyzed the ACE genotypes in 37 essential hypertensive patients with a clinical and histopathological diagnosis of <b>nephroangiosclerosis.</b> In protocol 2, ACE genotypes as well as microalbuminuria and renal hemodynamic parameters were investigated in 75 patients with EH with normal renal function and a strong family history of hypertension. As control group, 75 healthy subjects with BP < 130 / 85 mm Hg and no family history of cardiovascular diseases were studied. The ACE variants were determined by PCR and the genotypes were classified as DD, DI and II. In protocol 1, patients with <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> displayed a significant difference in the genotype distribution (57 % DD, 27 % DI, 16 % II) when compared to the control population (25 % DD, 64 % DI, 11 % II; P < 0. 001). There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between hypertensive patients with normal renal function (protocol 2; 33 % DD, 59 % DI, 8 % II) and the control group. There were no differences in age, blood pressure, microalbuminuria and duration of the disease among the three genotypes in the EH group from protocol 2. Taken together, these findings suggest that the DD genotype of ACE is associated with histopathologic-proven kidney involvement in patients with EH and that this polymorphism could be a potential genetic marker in hypertensives at risk of renal complications...|$|E
40|$|To {{avoid the}} center effect and the {{possible}} hidden interactions of multicenter studies, {{the validity of the}} Cox Proportional Hazards Model for the analysis of a single-center kidney transplant program was tested, considering 287 renal transplants performed in a 10 -year period. The inclusion of type of donor and main immunosuppressive drug as covariates in the model did not violate the proportionality assumption of the Cox model. According to this method, the following covariates were significant in predicting graft survival: cyclosporine, type of donor, good human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A and HLA-B match (DR data were not considered), highest percentage of reactive antibodies against panel cells, and <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> as a primary renal disease. Cyclosporine did not significantly improve graft survival in living related donor transplants.

40|$|Renal biopsy is the {{definitive}} diagnostic test {{in patients with}} renal parenchymal disease. Renal biopsy registry is an important tool which can provide valuable data concerning early and correct epidemiological description and clinical correlations of renal diseases. Records of 326 adult renal biopsies performed at our hospital from January 1991 {{till the end of}} December 2006 were retrospectively examined. Overall, secondary glomerular diseases (SGD) were predominant (39. 9 %), followed by primary glomerular diseases (PGD) (30. 4 %), vascular diseases (13. 2 %) and TIN (6. 7 %). Total sclerosis of the kidney did not allow histopathological diagnosis in 5. 8 % of all biopsied kidneys. Focal and Segmental Glomerular Sclerosis (FSGS), IgA Nephropathy (IgAGN) and Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Glomerulopathy (MGN) were the most common PGD, altogether representing 75. 7 % of all PGD. FSGS was the most frequent (30. 3 %), followed by IgAGN (21. 2 %), MCD (19. 1 %) and MGN in 15. 1 %. Vasculitis, HIVAN, diabetic nephropathy and amyloidosis were the most common SGD, altogether representing 90 % of all SGD. Immune Mediated Glomerulonephritis (IMGN) were the most frequent (32. 3 %), followed by HIVAN (16. 9 %), diabetic nephropathy (14. 6 %) and amyloidosis (10 %). <b>Nephroangiosclerosis</b> (benign and malignant <b>nephroangiosclerosis)</b> was the most frequent vascular nephropathy responsible for 79 % of all vascular diseases. Thrombotic microangiopathy was seen in 9. 3 % and atherothrombotic disease in 7 % of all vascular diseases. Concerning tubular diseases, chronic TIN accounted for 63. 6 % of all tubular diseases, followed by light chain-cast nephropathy (22. 7 %) and acute TIN (13. 6 %). Because of lack of material, 3. 4 % of all biopsies could not be analyzed. These data demonstrate that the distribution of biopsy-proved renal diseases in a Belgian population of the Brussels area is strongly influenced by the indications of renal biopsy. Harmonization of these indications might reflect with more accuracy the actual incidence of different nephropathies in a given population.

40|$|Background/Aims: Hypertensive <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> is {{associated}} with progressive increase of intrarenal vascular resistance. In addition to blood pressure, other factors can contribute to hypertensive renal damage including a prothrombotic state. We investigated the relationship between hemostatic markers and intrarenal vascular resistance in hypertension. Methods: In 115 untreated, nondiabetic, hypertensive subjects free of cardiovascular complications and advanced renal function impairment, we measured 24 -hour creatinine clearance (GFR) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE), fasting plasma glucose, HOMA-index, and plasma levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, homocysteine, and lipoprotein(a). In all patients, measurement of intrarenal resistance was obtained by renal Doppler ultrasound with calculation of the renal resistance index (RI). Results: Patients in the highest tertile of RI were older and had greater body mass index, pulse pressure, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels and lower GFR than patients in the lowest RI tertile. RI was directly correlated with age, pulse pressure, HOMA-index, UAE, D-dimer, and inversely with GFR. On multivariate analysis, RRI was independently associated with age, GFR, and plasma D-dimer.

We prospectively followed 60 Caucasian patients diagnosed with idiopathic membranous nephropathy for at least 2 years or until primary outcome (≥ 50 % permanent decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate or death). Glomerular and tubulointerstitial morphometric variables at the time of renal biopsy were analyzed with respect to this outcome. Univariate analysis revealed that significant negative prognostic factors for this outcome were higher cholesterol and smaller albumin concentrations, higher creatinine and maximal 24 -h proteinuria, higher grade of <b>nephroangiosclerosis,</b> higher glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerulopathy index, higher interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy percentage and higher injury score. In multivariate analysis, only the maximal 24 -h proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy percentage were independent predictors of this outcome.

The aim of this study was to report on the relative frequency of nephropathies according to gender, age at time of biopsy, clinical presentation and renal function, based on the histologic diagnosis during the years 1996 to 2000. Methods. We evaluated data relating to 14607 renal biopsies, provided by 128 renal units in Italy. Data entry was performed by using the Internet-based database directly (URL [URL] Clinical presentation was defined as urinary abnormalities (UA), nephrotic syndrome (NS), acute nephritic syndrome (ANS).

40|$|Peritoneal {{dialysis}} is {{the method}} of treatment of terminal-stage chronic kidney failure. Nowadays, this method is complementary to haemodialysis. It {{is based on the}} principles of the diffusion of solutes and ultrafiltration of fluids across the peritoneal membrane, which acts as a filter. The dialysate is introduced into the peritoneum via the previously positioned peritoneal catheter. The peritoneal dialysis is carried out on daily basis, at home by the patient, and the ”exchange” is repeated 4 - 5 times during the 24 hours. The first steps in peritoneal dialysis at the Department for Haemodialysis of the Clinical Centre of Vojvodina date back to 1973. Until 1992, the patients were subjected to this program only sporadically. Since 1998 the peritoneal dialysis method has been performed at the Clinic for Nephrology and Clinical Immunology. In the period 1998 - 2008 ninety nine peritoneal catheters were placed. Chronic glomerulonephritis, <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> and diabetes were identified as the most common causes of chronic renal failure. Two methods of catheter placement were applied: the standard open surgery method (majority of patients) and laparoscopy. Most of the patients were subjected to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, whereas four patients received automatic dialysis. Transplantation was performed in 10 patients, i. e. cadaveric transplantation and living-related donor transplantation, each in 5 patients.

40|$|Mammalian {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) {{is the core}} {{component}} of two complexes, mTORC 1 and mTORC 2. mTORC 1 is inhibited by rapamycin and analogues. mTORC 2 is impeded only in some cell types by prolonged exposure to these compounds. mTOR activation is linked to tubular cell proliferation in animal models and human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). mTOR inhibitors impede cell proliferation and cyst growth in polycystic kidney disease (PKD) models. After renal transplantation, two small retrospective studies suggested that mTOR was more effective than calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppression in limiting kidney and/or liver enlargement. By inhibiting vascular remodeling, angiogenesis, and fibrogenesis, mTOR inhibitors may attenuate <b>nephroangiosclerosis,</b> cyst growth, and interstitial fibrosis. Thus, they may benefit ADPKD at multiple levels. However, mTOR inhibition is not without risks and side effects, mostly dose-dependent. Under certain conditions, mTOR inhibition interferes with adaptive increases in renal proliferation necessary for recovery from injury. They restrict Akt activation, nitric oxide synthesis, and endothelial cell survival (downstream from mTORC 2) and potentially increase the risk for glomerular and peritubular capillary loss, vasospasm, and hypertension. They impair podocyte integrity pathways and may predispose to glomerular injury. Administration of mTOR inhibitors is discontinued because of side effects in up to 40 % of transplant recipients. Currently, treatment with mTOR inhibitors should not be recommended to treat ADPKD. Results of ongoing studies must be awaited and patients informed accordingly. If effective, lower dosages than those used to prevent rejection would minimize side effects. Combination therapy with other effective drugs could improve tolerability and results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Notch 3 {{receptor}} {{participates in}} the development and maturation of vessels. Mutations of Notch 3 in humans are associated with defective regulation of cerebral blood flow. To investigate the role of Notch 3 in the regulation of renal hemodynamics, we used mice lacking expression of the Notch 3 gene (Notch 3 / mice). Bolus injections of norepinephrine and angiotensin II increased renal vascular resistance and decreased renal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner in wild-type mice. In sharp contrast, renal vascular resistance of Notch 3 / mice varied little after boluses of norepinephrine and angiotensin II. Inversely, bradykinin and prostacyclin relaxed renal vasculature in wild-type mice. Both vasodilators had a negligible effect on renal vascular resistance of Notch 3 / mice. Afferent arterioles freshly isolated from Notch 3 / mice displayed decreased thickness of vascular wall compared with wild-type mice and showed a deficient contractile response to angiotensin II. To examine the physiopathological consequences of the above-described deficiency, hypertension was induced by continuous infusion of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II gradually increased blood pressure in both strains, but this increase was lesser in the Notch 3 / mice. Despite this blunted systemic effect, Notch 3 / mice displayed high mortality rates (65 %) attributed to heart failure. In the kidney, the surviving Notch 3 / mice showed focal structural alterations characteristic of <b>nephroangiosclerosis.</b> These data show that Notch 3 is necessary for the adaptive response of the renal vasculature to vasoactive systems.

BackgroundThere {{are not enough}} large epidemiologic population-based studies of biopsy-proven nephropathies with detailed clinicopathologic correlations. MethodsThe Glomerulonephritis Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology has obtained data from 9378 cases with native biopsy-proven renal diseases and well-known clinical syndrome between 1994 and 2001, investigating clinicopathologic correlations. Patients were divided in three groups according to age: children (65 years). ResultsThe most common clinical syndrome at any age is nephrotic syndrome (35. 5 %), followed by asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (25. 9 %), acute renal failure (12. 9 %), chronic renal failure (12. 1 %), nephritic syndrome (4. 5 %), macroscopic haematuria (4. 5 %), and arterial hypertension (3. 0 %). A male predominance is observed at any age (3 : 2). The frequencies of histologic findings are statistically different in all syndromes according to age. Minimal change disease is the most frequent finding in children with nephrotic syndrome (39. 5 %), whereas in adults and elderly, membranous nephropathy is the most prevalent (24. 2 % and 28. 0 %, respectively). Ig A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most frequent glomerulonephritis in patients with asymptomatic urinary abnormalities at any age.

40|$|Ischemic renal diseases: New {{insights}} into old entities. Vascular nephropathies are a steadily increasing cause of end-stage renal failure. Arterionephrosclerosis and arteriolonephrosclerosis are common {{features in the}} hypertensive patient. This {{is especially true for}} blacks of African descent, in whom hypertension and nephrovasculopathies are a major cause of renal insufficiency. That primary hypertension leads to renal vascular lesions, glomerular obsolescence and interstitial fibrosis has long been established. It should not, however, obscure the fact that renal vascular lesions can be observed in animal models as well as in some humans, especially young blacks, in the absence of, or anticipating the onset of hypertension. This leads to considering the hypothesis that <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> might stem from a genetic defect in the renal vascular bed and that this defect is strongly associated with the hypertensive trait. Atherosclerotic renal disease is a major, potentially treatable cause of chronic renal failure, especially in whites. It leads to renal atrophy, but the ischemic kidney retains a vigorous potential for tubular cell regeneration, which pleads for early recognition and treatment. Recent data suggest that renal ischemia, be it due to renal artery stenosis or to cholesterol crystal embolism, ranks among the multiple causes of secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Irrespective of its initial mechanism, ischemia induces renal fibrosis, the pathophysiology of which is centered on increased generation of angiotensin II. Finally, renal vascular lesions are commonly observed in the course of various nephropathies, {{even in the absence of}} hypertension, and the relationship between these lesions and the unfavorable prognosis of glomerulopathies, especially primary focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous glomerulopathy and IgA glomerulonephritis, remains to be elucidated.

Since 2006, 20 patients (p) underwent CCRTx using allografts from the same donor. The inclusion criteria were: RF with CrCl ≤ 40 mil/min or dialysis requirement in CTx candidates. All p received Thymoglobulin and immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Median follow up: 46 months (7 - 96). Results: Mean age: 58 ± 7 years, 85 % were male. Mean Creatinine (Cr) : 3, 1 ± 2, 5 mg/dl and ClCr 27, 5 + 10 mil/min. Three p required dialysis during the pre-transplantation phase and 4 p were under chronic dialysis.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} {{measurements of}} {{renal blood flow}} as a marker of disease severity in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease. βBackgroundAutosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal cyst growth, early development of hypertension, and late occurrence of renal insufficiency. Despite evidence {{for the importance of}} <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> in the progression of renal insufficiency in ADPKD, evaluation of renal blood flow (RBF) as a surrogate marker of disease severity has received little attention. MethodsFlow phantoms and repeat RBF measurements assessed accuracy and reproducibility. One hundred twenty-seven ADPKD subjects with creatinine clearances > 70 mL/min underwent measurements of RBF, total, and cyst renal volumes, and % cyst volumes by magnetic resonance (MR) and of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal vascular resistance (RVR) was calculated. MR blood flow sequences utilized a two-dimensional cine phase-contrast breath-hold pulse sequence perpendicular to the renal arteries. Flow rates were calculated utilizing FLOW software. Volumetric analysis was performed using stereology and region-based thresholding. ResultsExcellent accuracy and intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility were demonstrated. Anatomic (total kidney volume, total cyst volume, and % cyst volume), hemodynamic (RBF and RVR), and functional (GFR) parameters were strongly correlated. Left polycystic kidneys were larger and had more severe disease. Regression analysis showed that age, diagnosis of hypertension, anatomic parameters and hemodynamic parameters were significant predictors of GFR. Multiple linear regression analysis identified age and hemodynamic parameters only as separate predictors of GFR. Anatomic, hemodynamic, and functional parameters discriminated between normotensive and hypertensive subjects despite antihypertensive treatments. ConclusionRenal hemodynamic parameters measured by MR correlate with anatomic and functional indices of disease severity, are the strongest predictors of renal function, and deserve further consideration as an outcome measure in clinical trials to guide therapy in ADPKD...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Marginal organs not {{suitable}} for single kidney transplantation are considered for double kidney transplantation (DKT). Herein we have reviewed short and long-term outcomes of DKT over a 7 -year experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and 2007, 80 DKT were performed in the transplant centers of Bologna, Parma, and Modena, Italy. Recipient mean age was 61 +/- 5 years. The main indications were glomerular nephropathy (n= 33) and hypertensive <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> (n= 14). Mean HLA A, B, and DR mismatches were 3. 1 +/- 1. 2. Donor mean age was 69 +/- 8 years and mean creatinine clearance was 75 +/- 27 mL/min. Almost all kidneys were perfused with Celsior solution. Mean cold ischemia time was 17 +/- 4 hours and mean warm ischemia time was 41 +/- 17 minutes. Mean biopsy score was 4. 4. Immunosuppression was based on tacrolimus (n= 52) or cyclosporine (n= 26). RESULTS: Fifty (62. 5 %) patients displayed good postoperative renal function. Thirty (37. 5 %) experienced acute tubular necrosis and required postoperative dialysis treatment; 8 acute rejections occurred. Urinary complications were 13. 7 % with 8 / 11 requiring surgical revision. There were 6 surgical reexplorations: intestinal perforation (n= 2), bleeding (n= 3), and lymphocele (n= 1). Two patients lost both grafts due to vascular and infectious complications at 7 or 58 days after transplantation. Two patients underwent intraoperative transplantectomy due to massive vascular thrombosis. Four (5 %) patients underwent transplantectomy of a single graft due to vascular complications (n= 2), bleeding (n= 1), or infectious complications (n= 1). Graft and patient survivals were 95 % and 100 % versus 93 % and 97 % at 3 versus 36 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: DKT is a safe approach for organ shortage. The score {{used in this study}} is useful to determine whether a kidney should be refused or accepted...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{prevalence}} and color Doppler sonographic characteristics of perforating vessels-small arteries and veins connecting the intrarenal vasculature with the capsular plexus-in healthy subjects, in hypertensive patients, and in patients with renal failure due to hypertensive <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> or ischemic nephropathy. Fifteen healthy subjects 24 - 34 years old, 15 healthy subjects 68 - 80 years old, 25 hypertensive patients, 25 patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure (15 mild, 10 severe), and 12 patients with hypertension and chronic renal failure and acute renal insufficiency due to ischemic nephropathy underwent color Doppler sonography of both kidneys. The few perforating arteries in healthy and hypertensive patients had various resistance indices and flow toward the capsule. Perforating veins in these patients were much more common than perforating arteries. Perforating arteries with a lower mean resistance index than the mean interlobar resistance index and flow toward the capsule were detected in 76 % of kidneys in the patients with mild chronic renal failure and in 20 % of those in patients with severe chronic renal failure. Only a few perforating veins were seen in patients with chronic renal failure. In 64 % of the kidneys with renal artery stenosis detected in the patients with chronic renal failure complicated by acute renal insufficiency, there were perforating arteries with flow toward the kidney and a mean resistance index higher than the mean interlobar resistance index. Perforating vessels are recognizable using color Doppler sonography both in healthy subjects and in patients with renal failure. The prevalence and flow characteristics of perforating vessels differ between healthy subjects, patients with mild and with severe chronic renal failure, and patients with chronic renal failure complicated by acute renal insufficiency caused by renal artery stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Background. Studies {{about the}} {{prevalence}} of renal and particularly glomerular diseases in Brazil are still scarce. Methods. We evaluated retrospectively the reports of 9, 617 renal biopsies, analyzed by the same pathologist, from January 1993 to December 2007. Results. the 9, 617 renal biopsies performed in subjects of all ages in native kidneys. 4, 619 were primary glomerulopathies (GN), the most frequent was focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, 24. 6 %), followed by membranous nephropathy (MN, 20. 7 %), IgA nephropathy (IgAN, 20. 1 %), minimal change disease (MCD, 15. 5 %), mesangioproliferative non IgAN (nonIgAN, 5. 2 %), diffuse proliferative GN (DPGN, 4. 7 %) and membranoproliferative GN (MPGN, 4. 2 %). Lupus nephritis was responsible for most cases which etiology was determined, i. e., 950 out of 2, 046 cases (45. 5 %), followed by post infectious GN (18. 9 %), diabetic nephropathy (8. 5 %), benign and malignant <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> (7. 3 %), haemolytic-uraemic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (HUS/TTP), amyloidosis (4. 8 %) and vasculitis (4. 7 %). There was a predominance of secondary GN in the North, mostly due to lupus nephritis (LN); FSGS was very common in Northeast (27. 7 %), Central (26. 9 %) and Southeast regions (24. 1 %); IgAN was most frequent in South (22. 8 %) and MN in North (29. 6 %); the total prevalence of MPGN was low, and its regional distribution has not changed along the years. Conclusion. FSGS was the most frequent primary glomerular disease, followed closely by MN and IgAN. the predominance of FSGS is in accordance with recent studies {{all over the world}} that revealed its frequency is increasing. Lupus nephritis predominated among secondary GN in most regions, a finding observed in other studies.

40|$|Identification of {{the profile}} of glomerular disease in a {{particular}} geographical region is of fundamental academic, clinical and epidemiological importance. It helps in the recognition of specific risk factors and subsequent planning for adequate prevention. In the present study, 1234 consecutive renal biopsies referred to the nephropathology team of Cairo University over two years were retrospectively analyzed. The main indications for biopsy included nephrotic syndrome, persistent sub-nephrotic proteinuria, recurrent hematuria, suspected secondary hypertension, lupus nephritis and acute and chronic renal failure of undetermined etiology. Proliferative forms of glomerulonephritis [GN] (32. 1 &#x 0025;) and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis [FSGS] were the most prevalent lesions among patients with the nephrotic syndrome (22. 6 &#x 0025;). In subjects with sub-nephrotic proteinuria, FSGS was the principal lesion followed by proliferative lesions. Although all forms of GN were encountered in those presenting with recurrent hematuria, mesangioproliferative GN and FSGS were significantly more frequent. IgA glomerular deposits were detected in 9. 8 &#x 0025; of all GNs and 15 &#x 0025; of those presenting with hematuria. One half of the biopsies obtained {{for the assessment of}} suspected secondary hypertension showed only changes compatible with the effect of hypertension per se, i. e. <b>nephroangiosclerosis.</b> On the other hand, a parenchymal renal lesion was found in 52. 9 &#x 0025; of biopsies. The common glomerular pathologies in patients with lupus nephritis were Classes III and IV. Among patients with chronic renal failure, the predominant lesion was chronic interstitial nephritis (32. 6 &#x 0025;). An acute interstitial inflammatory element was also detected in 8. 4 &#x 0025; of cases. About one third of the biopsies obtained for acute renal failure showed acute tubular (11 &#x 0025;) or cortical (13. 2 &#x 0025;) necrosis. Another third showed vasculitis (17. 6 &#x 0025;) or acute interstitial nephritis (14. 3 &#x 0025;), and the remaining showed chronic lesions in which the rapid deterioration was probably functional...|$|E
40|$|The Italian {{experience}} of the national registry of renal biopsies. BackgroundAlthough several registries collecting data of patients with kidney diseases exist, {{there are only a}} few registries which specifically collect data relating to renal biopsy; one such registry is the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies (IRRB). The aim of this study was to report on the relative frequency of nephropathies according to gender, age at time of biopsy, clinical presentation and renal function, based on the histologic diagnosis during the years 1996 to 2000. MethodsWe evaluated data relating to 14607 renal biopsies, provided by 128 renal units in Italy. Data entry was performed by using the Internet-based database directly (URL [URL] Clinical presentation was defined as urinary abnormalities (UA), nephrotic syndrome (NS), acute nephritic syndrome (ANS). Renal diseases were divided in four major categories: (1) primary glomerulonephritides (GN); (2) secondary GN; (3) tubulointerstitial nephropathies (TIN); and (4) vascular nephropathies (VN). ResultsPrimary GN, TIN, and VN were more frequent in males compared to females while secondary GN was more frequent in females. Diseases whose frequency was higher in males were IgA nephropathy (IgAN), benign <b>nephroangiosclerosis</b> (BNA), and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A significantly higher frequency of immune-mediated secondary GN, as well as primary GN, including minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and mesangiocapillary GN (MCGN), was shown in females. Primary and secondary GN, TIN, and VN were more frequent in the range 15 to 65 years of age. At the time of biopsy 77 % of primary GN and 61 % of secondary GN presented with normal renal function. Acute renal failure (ACR) was more present in TIN (52 %), while chronic renal failure (CRF) was more frequent in VN (47 %). ConclusionWe believe collection of data relating to renal biopsies in a national registry is a useful tool for nephrologists in that it meets one of the current challenges facing the clinical research enterprise. The availability of these data will allow epidemiologic studies in health care to answer the several open questions in both prevention and treatment of renal diseases...|$|E
