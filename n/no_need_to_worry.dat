25|$|Soviet {{officials}} organised their wartime deportation policy largely along ethnic lines. As {{a response}} to the German invasion, Soviet citizens of German descent in border regions were targeted for deportation to the rear where Soviet authorities had <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> of their conspiring with the enemy. Such dubious ethnically-derived logic was not reserved for Germans. Many Finns were also forcibly relocated {{in the first year of}} the war simply for their heritage, though they were mainly sent to remote areas in the northern rear, such as Siberia, rather than Central Asia. A large portion of the German deportees, however, were sent to Kazakhstan. The remobilisation of relocated human resources into the labour force was pivotal to Soviet wartime production policy, and to that end many able-bodied deportees were conscripted into a “labour army” with military style discipline.|$|E
500|$|Besides the {{handling}} of punishments and rewards, the court made other efforts to reestablish order in the capital region. Nonessential taxes were suspended. Nobles of the imperial clan patrolled {{the gates of the}} imperial city while rebels were still at large. Some residents in Beijing abused the order that they alert authorities of remaining culprits of the coup in order to label personal enemies as [...] "rebels" [...] to take their property. To discourage this, the emperor had several dozen of these looters beaten and paraded through the streets as criminals. In an edict of August 9, the Emperor reassured loyal Mongol officers of Baoding that Mongol participation in Cao's rebellion did not mean persecution for them. In October, Mi Duo-duo-lai, commander of Baoding and veteran Mongol officer who fought against Esen Tayisi's 1449 invasion, was ordered to stay put in Baoding, a gesture by the emperor that there was <b>no</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about loss of authority.|$|E

[...] Chris Richards, writing in The Washington Post, dissented from the approval: [...] "As the five traded couplets, it was tough to imagine a future Justin Timberlake, Ricky Martin or Bobby Brown emerging from the pack.

[...] Brandle commended the show for being [...] "all slick, clean fun". Erica Futterman (Rolling Stone) wrote in a title for the concert at the Beacon Theatre in New York, [...] "U.K. boy band relies on vocal prowess and charisma to keep fan base loyal."

Lau opined, [...] "It's easy to get lost in inherent appeal of their perfectly coiffed dos and almost-too-put-together preppy style but somewhere {{in the midst of all}} the love-struck squeals of teenage girls are guys who can actually sing and, to a certain extent, entertain."

General Wilhelm Stemmermann, the commander of XI Corps, was placed in command of the forces in the pocket. These forces were designated Gruppe Stemmermann. The 5th SS Panzer Division, with some 11,400 personnel, had 30 operational Panzer III/IV tanks and assault guns left, and six more in repair. The division further had 47 artillery pieces, of which 12 were self-propelled guns.|$|E

50|$|This {{offers several}} advantages. Computer programmers <b>no</b> longer <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> {{about where the}} memory is {{physically}} stored or whether the user's computer will have enough memory. It also allows multiple types of memory to be used. For example, some memory {{can be stored in}} physical RAM chips while other memory is stored on a hard drive (e.g. in a swapfile), functioning {{as an extension of the}} cache hierarchy. This drastically increases the amount of memory available to programs. The operating system will place actively used memory in physical RAM, which is much faster than hard disks. When the amount of RAM is not sufficient to run all the current programs, it can result in a situation where the computer spends more time moving memory from RAM to disk and back than it does accomplishing tasks; this is known as thrashing.|$|R

This system {{has been added to}} the O 2 object oriented database system, and is fully functional.

The rules are then used to maintain the corresponding set of constraints, for all applications that use the database, and which <b>no</b> longer <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about integrity control. We extend previous work on constraint maintenance in two ways: our system {{can be used as a}} constraint maintenance layer on top of object-oriented, relational and nested relational databases; in the case of object-oriented systems, we provide constraint support not only in the case of object composition, but also consider inheritance and methods...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} {{in the area of}} hardware verification is to devise methods that can handle circuits of practical size. This paper intends to show how the applicability of combinational circuit verification tools based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) can be greatly improved. The introduction of dynamic variable ordering techniques already makes these tools more robust; a designer <b>no</b> longer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about a good initial variable order. In addition, we present a novel approach combining BDDs with a technique that exploits structural similarities of the circuits under comparison. We explain how these similarities can be detected and put to effective use in the verification process. Benchmark results show that the proposed method significantly extends the range of circuits that can be verified using BDDs. 1 Introduction The times when researchers in the CAD field could sit in their ivory tower thinking up neat solutions for theoretical problems belong to the past.

40|$|Although the United States has {{maintained}} a one-China policy since 1972, U. S. actions have upheld de facto Taiwan sovereignty {{in the face of}} Chinese threats of forceful reunification. This seemingly contradictory American stance has focused Chinese attention on the Taiwan issue and the U. S. role in perpetuating it. The growing economic interdependence between Taiwan and the mainland make peaceful reunification a plausible exigency. If China <b>no</b> longer <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about this historical thorn in its paw, it is logical it would divert its attention and energies elsewhere. This thesis examines the current state of economic, socio-political, and military considerations between the United States and the People's Republic of China to infer the likelihood of either cooperation or contention between the two nations in a post-reunification era. The thesis argues that endemic suspicion and competition between China and the United States make moot the possible amelioration in relations a PRC-ROC reunification might present. The thesis concludes that American policy should be tailored to address the Chinese challenge in a post-unification world...|$|R
