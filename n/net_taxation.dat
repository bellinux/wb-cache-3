The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize <b>net</b> <b>taxation.</b> Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to intermediate goods, but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E

In particular we study the quantitative effect that each sector’s productivity gain has on household welfare (real disposable income and equivalent variation), on the consumption price indices and factor relative prices, on real production (GDP) and on the government’s net income (<b>net</b> <b>taxation</b> revenues of social transfers to households). The analytical approach consists of a computable general equilibrium model, in which we assume perfect competition and cleared markets, including factor markets. All the parameters and exogenous variables of the model are calibrated by means of two social accounting matrices, one for each region under study. The results allow us to identify those sectors with {{the greatest impact on}} consumer welfare as the key sectors in the regional economies.

40|$|Pro-urban bias {{in policy}} {{is often seen}} as a common {{phenomenon}} in the developing world. Empirical reality though is much more varied. Many governments actively support agricultural producers and rural citizens, even at early stages of development. In addition, the binary distinction between urban and rural bias in policy aggregates over important sub-national variation in the distributive impact of government policies. This dissertation extends the research frontier by analyzing the political roots underlying spatial bias in policy using new theoretical and empirical approaches. First, this dissertation develops a theory that identifies conditions under which politicians will institute pro-urban or pro-rural policies, by considering {{the threat of a}} rural insurgency. Second, I argue that elections in rural majority societies can empower citizens in the rural periphery. Competitive elections and high rural turnout induce governments to supply favorable policies to the rural sector as a whole and salient regions in particular. To test the effect of the threat of rural violence, I use new cross-national data on <b>net</b> <b>taxation</b> in the agricultural sector. Data on fiscal transfers and the sub-national effects of agricultural pricing policies in Indonesian districts provide additional evidence for the first hypothesis. To test the effect of elections on urban bias, I exploit a natural experiment from the Indonesian context.

From policy analysis matrix in-line with private/financial profit, social/economic profit and policy divergences/transfers various protection coefficients such as NPCO, NPCI, EPC and PC and competiveness coefficients such as DRC, SCB, SNRL and PNRL were derived to measure the level of protection and comparative advantage in the rice sector of Bangladesh. The results of the policy transfer and protection coefficients (NPCO,NPCI, EPC and PCO criteria) shows that rice production in Bangladesh is subsidized for inputs (NPCI< 1) and taxed for the product/output (NPCO< 1). The net effect of output taxation and input subsidy resulted in a <b>net</b> <b>taxation</b> on value added (EPC< 1) for policy goal of self sufficiency. On the efficiency ground, the estimated economic profitability criteria and competitiveness indicators (DRC, SCB, PNRL and SNRL) demonstrate that Bangladesh has comparative advantage in domestic rice production for import substitution and its opposite under export parity situation. Thus the results are consistent with the intuition of the simple Heckscher-Ohlin model because rice has a higher labor/land ration than other crops. The sensitivity analysis shows the sensitiveness of rice production competitiveness towards technological improvement, climate change and change in international and national price of input and output under import parity condition.

40|$|The {{paper has}} {{analyzed}} reforms in food trade. It {{has determined that}} {{with the growth of}} per capita income, taken transformations shift the focus from <b>net</b> <b>taxation</b> to subsidization. Low-income countries tend to impose relatively high taxes on farmers who produce export products, considering them as the most important source of budget replenishment, while developed countries seek to provide farmers with large subsidies. These differences often cause political misunderstanding, which is not to the benefit of poor population both in domestic and international markets. The aim of the conducted research was to analyse the trends and regularities in the development of global food trade and to define the mechanisms of its regulation in current conditions. The research employs a complex approach that requires, with a single object of study, certain distribution of functions in its researching, systemization of results, which allows to reveal the nature and causes of the food problem. Generalization of facts and relationships is carried out by means of interpretation of methods: dialectical and structural, as well as historical and logical. The study has made it possible to define that state regulation includes a system of institutions and mechanisms relating to general rules of state involvement in the reproduction process, and it is not "purposeful administrative and economic influence" for achieving goals. This, in conditions of market relations development, is the system of indicative methods which enable achieving global state goals. It is necessary to differentiate between state regulation and state support. They relate as the general and the particular in a certain situation. At the same time state support as a form of state regulation is aimed at creating institutional and organizational environment for the reformation of property relations, formation of social and industrial infrastructure, creation of conditions for the stabilization of the reproductive process.

40|$|Prior to December of 1991, Ukraine was a {{republic}} of the Soviet Union, where agricultural production and development was controlled and administered through a centrally planned economy. Ukraine {{has since become}} independent and has expressed an interest and desire to move toward a market-oriented economy. Historically, {{they have had a}} comparative advantage in agricultural production due to land endowments of chernozemic (black humus) soils, a temperate climate, and adequate rainfall. Such conditions are typically well suited to the production of various commodities. However, although yields of these commodities were high in Ukraine [...] as compared to other Former Soviet Union (FSU) republics [...] productivity was well below the standards achieved in the Western world. Since improved production opportunities exist in Ukraine, several countries have taken a keen interest in the growth possibilities in this republic. Should Ukraine remove distortions and create a market environment to stimulate production and trade, then there is the potential for Ukraine to become an active participant in the world trade of agricultural commodities. The model employed in determining whether Ukraine has approached a free market environment, was a comparison of financial and economic prices - where financial prices are the actual prices producers receive for the sale of agricultural outputs and economic prices are the prices producers receive in a free market. A free market is one without distortions. In economic terms, distortions refer to taxes or subsidies that artificially decrease or increase the price of a commodity. If Ukraine operated in a free market environment, financial prices would equal economic prices. However, where distortions exist, through subsidies and taxation, then the price that producers actually receive, the financial price, will not equal the economic price. Two hypotheses will be tested to validate indicate if Ukraine is making the transition to an open market economy. They are as follows: Hypothesis One: that Ukraine has a comparative advantage in the production of oilseeds relative to cereal production; and Hypothesis Two: that Ukraine has a comparative advantage in the production of pulse crops relative to cereal production. Following this, three ratio calculations are used to measure the government's efficiency to create an environment for an open agricultural economy. These ratios include: the Nominal Protection Coefficient, Effective Rate of Protection, and Producer Subsidy Equivalent which are used to calculate the efficiency of government policy and evaluate the direct benefit to producers of protectionist government. The results of the analysis revealed the following. In 1989, financial and economic prices diverged significantly from one another. This result is to be expected, since in 1989, agriculture operated under a command economy. By 1993, however, these numbers converged such that financial prices did not equal economic prices. In addition, in 1993, although cereals, oilseeds, and pulse crops were profitable, economic budgets indicated a comparative advantage in the production of pulse crops and winter wheat. For this reason, hypothesis two could not be rejected. Failure to reject the hypothesis indicates market distortions inhibit the production of the commodity with a comparative advantage. Though oilseed production provided positive returns in 1993, it did not retain a comparative advantage over most cereals and thus, hypothesis one needed to be rejected. Rejecting the hypothesis indicates market distortions are not evident or do not inhibit the production of the commodity with a comparative advantage. The financial and economic analysis also revealed that winter and spring wheat were both financially and economically feasible to produce in 1993. Due to the subsidization of cereals and <b>net</b> <b>taxation</b> of oilseeds and pulse crops, production patterns appeared to be altered by, producers to their financial benefit. In addition, the analysis revealed that in 1993, Ukraine had a greater social benefit to produce wheat and pulse crops other commodities reviewed. When the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) subsidy was removed from winter and spring wheat in 1989 and 1993, the profitability of wheat production became more evident. The net margin per hectare for both commodities increased significantly by 1993. This result indicated that wheat crops were the most profitable commodities to produce. The collective farms were maximizing profit, within a certain level of risk. Through market distortions, such as connecting the accessibility of inputs to state output orders, collective farms tended to choose production patterns within these constraints. Thus, producers did not choose a cropping pattern based solely on productivity or profitability, but they also considered the probability of stability (risk level). The ratio efficiency analysis for 1993 indicated that the government discouraged the production of oilseeds and pulse crops, even though there was a positive net margin without the distortions of taxes and subsidies. A variety of taxes and subsidies tended to discourage the production of profitable commodities in a risk neutral environment. The result, therefore, was to alter the production pattern in an open market, risk neutral environment. Finally, a qualitative overview of macro and micro business environment factors supported the notion that political, legal, financial, and economic conditions were unstable and although progress is being made {{in the development of a}} market economy, market transparency has not apparently occurred to support an economy which exemplifies the characteristics of a properly functioning open, risk neutral economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of wealth inequality in many EU countries has spurred interest in wealth taxation. While taxes on wealth {{for a long}} time have played only a marginal role in the public finance and taxation literature, in the more recent literature a variety of arguments are brought forward in favour of (higher) wealth taxation. Most of these arguments directly or indirectly refer to the potential of wealth taxes to contribute to various dimensions of sustainability, in particular to economic, social, and/or institutional/cultural sustainability. Tax competition has led to an almost complete disappearance of recurrent taxes on personal or corporate net wealth in Europe. EU-wide implementation of a net wealth tax based on harmonised tax provisions may serve as a first step in a longer-term oriented move of the stepwise expansion of net wealth taxes on a global scale. By dealing with non- and under-reporting in the Household and Consumption Survey (HFCS) data set provided by the European Central Bank, we are able to estimate the wealth distribution within 20 EU Member States. Applying a progressive household-based tax schedule with a tax rate of 1 % for net wealth above € 1 million and 1. 5 % for net wealth above € 5 million on these adjusted wealth distributions yields potential tax revenues of € 156 billion, taking into account the behavioural responses of individuals triggered by <b>net</b> wealth <b>taxation.</b>  Given the positive sustainability properties of a net wealth tax with regard to economic efficiency and social inclusion, a European net wealth tax offers itself as an interesting candidate for sustainability-oriented tax-based own resources to finance the EU budget...|$|R
40|$|Individual {{aspects of}} social capital {{have been shown to}} have {{significant}} associations with health outcomes. However, research has seldom tested different elements {{of social capital}} simultaneously, whilst also adjusting for other well-known health determinants over time. This longitudinal individual-level study investigates how temporal changes in social capital, together with changes in material conditions and other health determinants affect associations with self-rated health over a six year period. We use data from the British Household Panel Survey, a randomly selected cohort which is considered representative of the United Kingdom's population, with the same individuals (N= 9303) providing responses to identical questions in 1999 and 2005. Four measures of social capital were used: interpersonal trust, social participation, civic participation and informal social networks. Material conditions were measured by total income (both individual and weighted household income), <b>net</b> of <b>taxation.</b> Other health determinants included age, gender, smoking, marital status and social class. After the baseline sample was stratified by health status, associations were examined between changes in health status and changes in all other considered variables. Simultaneous adjustment revealed that inability to trust demonstrated a significant association with deteriorating self-rated health, whereas increased levels of social participation were significantly associated with improved health status over time. Low levels of household and individual income also demonstrated significant associations with deteriorating self-rated health. In conclusion, it seems that interpersonal trust and social participation, considered valid indicators of social capital, appear to be independent predictors of self-rated health, even after adjusting for other well-known health determinants. Understandably, how trust and social participation influence health outcomes may help resolve the debate surrounding the role of social capital within the field of public health...|$|R

And also, and probably more important, meta-analysis permits to show which aspects of the modelling, data and econometric techniques are important, or not, for the estimates.|$|R

It is considered whether it is possible to maintain strong automatic stabilizers without jeopardizing incentives via the design of the social safety net (workfare) or business cycle-dependent unemployment insurance. The criticism that automatic stabilizers may prolong downturns is also considered. Finally, it is discussed to what extent {{aggregate demand}} management policy can stabilize labour markets and, in particular, whether it is well targeted towards marginalized groups.

40|$|The {{challenge}} to the tax system to expand both the revenue base and progressively bring into the net larger number of taxpayers remains as daunting as ever. The object is not to ignore the generally beneficial impact of deregulation and tax friendly measures in providing a more conducive environment for tax compliance. Nor can it be suggested that tax reform be rolled back. But equally the reports of tax evasion, and poor compliance from particular sectors highlights the tax administrators belief/experience that certain sectors are more evasion prone often inviting the honorific of ‘Traditional Evaders’. The long term tax policy of the Government should essentially centre on expanding the tax base inter alia by limiting and rationalising the exemption provisions and factoring the changing sector profile of the GDP growth in the tax base. Considering the growth rate being witnessed {{in the economy and}} the resultant spurt in both corporate and individual incomes, the Committee feel that the number of tax assessees should be much higher possibly five times the existing number. The Committee, therefore, urge upon the Government to bring a larger {{number of people in the}} assessee base. The Committee hope that the objective of eliminating the deficits as envisaged under the FRBM Act would be put back on track by reclaiming the ground lost in reducing the fiscal deficit due to pressing of the ‘pause’ button. The Committee note that various exemptions and concessions extended under the Tax Laws are to serve a number of social and economic objectives. They, however, feel that prolonged continuance of such exemptions may turn detrimental to the economy as they deplete considerable portion of tax base, which, in their opinion is badly needed to be strengthened in order to meet the developmental objectives. So far as indirect taxes are concerned the Committee agree that exemptions are necessary but prolonging the exemptions indirectly encourage incompetence and makes domestic industry shy away from competition and growth. Further, they erode a major part of the revenue base. The Committee feel that with the rapid globalization and opening of the economy, the country and its industry should be better prepared to stand on their own without any substantial fiscal assistance from the Government. The unanimous view expressed before the Committee is that the time has come to bring all the services barring the basic and essential ones in the tax net. The Committee, therefore, reiterate their earlier recommendation that all the services, barring the essential or basic ones, should be brought under the tax net in one go. tax, tax evasion, tax revenue, income tax,service tax, indirect tax, direct tax, tax reform, tax base, fiscal assistance, tax <b>net,</b> Economics, <b>Taxation...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{modernization}} of domestic enterprises {{is a prerequisite}} for the integration of Ukraine into the European Union, first of all it concerns food industry enterprises, because they have the greatest potential for access to European markets with their own products. Accelerated modernization will provide an opportunity to improve the quality and safety of domestic food products and bring them closer to world standards. The methods and methodology of economic and statistical analysis remain the focus of the scholars. The analysis of trends, directions of development, and results of activities creates a basis for the adoption of quality management decisions, both at the strategic and operational levels. The study of the modernization process is impossible without the use of methods of economic and statistical analysis for a general evaluation of its state and efficiency. The paper proposes the relative indicators of asset value dynamics, residual value of fixed assets, volumes of sales, financial results before <b>taxation,</b> <b>net</b> profit for a generalizing assessment of the modernization process. It is substantiated that the modernization process is effective if the growth rate of asset value is greater than one unit, the growth rate of the residual value of fixed assets increases the growth rate of assets, the growth rate of sales of products is greater than the growth rate of residual value of fixed assets, the rate of growth of financial results before taxation is higher than the pace, the growth of sales volume, the growth rate of net profit is higher than the growth rate of the financial result before taxation. Using the Spirmeno coefficient, the authors obtained following results: the modernization process was most effective in 2011 – 2012, the modernization processes in food industry sharply slowed down during 2013 – 2015, but due to the already formed potential, they continue confirming the integral indices of the state and efficiency of modernization in 2014 – 2015. Further research is related to the research and analysis of modernization processes at the level of individual enterprises in order to expend successful experience and prevent negative outcomes...|$|R

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This thesis aims at {{analysing}} {{some aspects}} of Venture Capital (VC) and high-tech entrepreneurship. The focus is both at the macroeconomic level, comparing venture capital from an international {{point of view and}} Technology-Based Small Firms (TBSF) at company and founder’s level in Belgium. The approach is mainly empirical. This work is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on venture capital. First of all, we test the impact of VC on productivity. We then identify the determinants of VC and we test their impact on the relative level of VC for a panel of countries. The second part concerns the technology-based small firms in Belgium. The objective is twofold. It first aims at creating a database on Belgian TBSF to better understand the importance of entrepreneurship. In order to do this, a national survey was developed and the statistical results were analysed. Secondly, it provides an analysis of the role of universities in the employment performance of TBSF. A broad summary of each chapter is presented below. PART 1 : VENTURE CAPITAL The Economic Impact of Venture Capital The objective of this chapter is to perform an evaluation of the macroeconomic impact of venture capital. The main assumption is that VC can be considered as being similar in several respects to business R&D performed by large firms. We test whether VC contributes to economic growth through two main channels. The first one is innovation, characterized by the introduction of new products, processes or services on the market. The second one is the development of an absorptive capacity. These hypotheses are tested quantitatively with a production function model for a panel data set of 16 OECD countries from 1990 to 2001. The results show that the accumulation of VC is a significant factor contributing directly to Multi-Factor Productivity (MFP) growth. The social rate of return to VC is significantly higher than the social rate of return to business or public R&D. VC has also an indirect impact on MFP {{in the sense that it}} improves the output elasticity of R&D. An increased VC intensity makes it easier to absorb the knowledge generated by universities and firms, and therefore improves aggregate economic performance. Technological Opportunity, Entrepreneurial Environment and Venture Capital Development The objective of this chapter is to identify the main determinants of venture capital. We develop a theoretical model where three main types of factors affect the demand and supply of VC: macroeconomic conditions, technological opportunity, and the entrepreneurial environment. The model is evaluated with a panel dataset of 16 OECD countries over the period 1990 - 2000. The estimates show that VC intensity is pro-cyclical - it reacts positively and significantly to GDP growth. Interest rates affect the VC intensity mainly because the entrepreneurs create a demand for this type of funding. Indicators of technological opportunity such as the stock of knowledge and the number of triadic patents affect positively and significantly the relative level of VC. Labour market rigidities reduce the impact of the GDP growth rate and of the stock of knowledge, whereas a minimum level of entrepreneurship is required in order to have a positive effect of the available stock of knowledge on VC intensity. PART 2 : TECHNOLOGY-BASED SMALL FIRMS Survey in Belgium The first purpose of this chapter is to present the existing literature on the performance of companies. In order to get a quantitative insight into the entrepreneurial growth process, an original survey of TBSF in Belgium was launched in 2002. The second purpose is to describe the methodology of our national TBSF survey. This survey has two main merits. The first one lies in the quality of the information. Indeed, most of national and international surveys have been developed at firm-level. There exist only a few surveys at founder-level. In the TBSF database, information both at firm and at entrepreneur-level will be found. The second merit is about the subject covered. TBSF survey tackles the financing of firms (availability of public funds, role of venture capitalists, availability of business angels,…), the framework conditions (e. g. the quality and availability of infrastructures and communication channels, the level of academic and public research, the patenting process,…) and, finally, the socio-cultural factors associated with the entrepreneurs and their environment (e. g. level of education, their parents’education, gender,…). Statistical Evidence The main characteristics of companies in our sample are that employment and profits <b>net</b> of <b>taxation</b> do not follow the same trend. Indeed, employment may decrease while results after taxes may stay constant. Only a few companies enjoy a growth in both employment and results after taxes between 1998 and 2003. On the financing front, our findings suggest that internal finance in the form of personal funds, as well as the funds of family and friends are the primary source of capital to start-up a high-tech company in Belgium. Entrepreneurs rely on their own personal savings in 84 percent of the cases. Commercial bank loans are the secondary source of finance. This part of external financing (debt-finance) exceeds the combined angel funds and venture capital funds (equity-finance). On the entrepreneur front, the preliminary results show that 80 percent of entrepreneurs in this study have a university degree while 42 percent hold postgraduate degrees (i. e. master’s, and doctorate). In term of research activities, 88 percent of the entrepreneurs holding a Ph. D. or a post-doctorate collaborate with Belgian higher education institutes. Moreover, more than 90 percent of these entrepreneurs are working in a university spin-off. The Contribution of Universities to Employment Growth The objective of this chapter is to test whether universities play a role amongst the determinants of employment growth in Belgian TBSF. The empirical model is based on our original survey of 87 Belgian TBSF. The results suggest that both academic spin-offs and TBSF created on the basis of an idea originating from business R&D activities are associated with an above than average growth in employees. As most ‘high-tech’ entrepreneurs are at least graduated from universities, there is no significant impact of the level of education. Nevertheless, these results must be taken with caution, as they are highly sensitive to the presence of outliers. Young high-tech firms are by definition highly volatile, and might be therefore difficult to understand. CONCLUSION In this last chapter, recommendations for policy-makers are drawn from the results of the thesis. The possible interventions of governments are classified according to whether they influence the demand or the supply of entrepreneurship and/or VC. We present some possible actions such as direct intervention in the VC funds, interventions of public sector through labour market rigidities, pension system, patent and research policy, level of entrepreneurial activities, bankruptcy legislation, entrepreneurial education, development of university spin-offs, and creation of a national database of TBSF.
