Mid-June, Riis Cycling A/S {{announced that}} Saxo Bank had entered a three-year contract as name sponsor, with immediate effect, so the team entered the 2008 Tour de France as Team CSC Saxo Bank. Carlos Sastre, having taken a lead of about two minutes on the final climb of L'Alpe D'Huez, won the Tour, and the team took the team classification.|$|E
5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} {{was much better}} understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, {{who had been the}} engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, to carry out a survey. The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, it {{was decided}} that the new technologically {{advanced}} car would <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler's 3.3L pushrod V6. The 3.3L engine's 60° block was bored out to 3.5L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5L V6.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian National Rail Administration {{is working}} on {{plans to build a}} new {{high-speed}} railway line through Østfold as part of the InterCity Triangle project. The new line to Sarpsborg is scheduled for completion by 2026, while it is scheduled to reach Halden by 2030. As the existing lines are presumed to be kept, the railway will <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> bridge over Sarpefossen with three tracks. At the same time National Road 118 is being considered expanded to four lanes. Several alternative crossings of Glomma than at Sarpefossen have been considered, but in 2014 the municipal council went forward with an extension of the existing crossing. As there is limited space, the new road and railway right-of-ways are being planned together. An alternative is to build the road as a ring road crossing from Hafslundøy to Opsund.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to switch over, the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely to <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1942 {{it was clear that}} the Mikulin OKB lacked the {{resources}} to fix the problems with the AM-37 and that the TIS would <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> engine, but the OKB's resources were fully utilized on the I-185 and ITP programs and the TIS program was put on hold. Work did not resume on the TIS until the second half of 1943, after the I-185 had been canceled, and the Mikulin AM-39 engine was selected. A new prototype was built, internally called the [...] "MA", with a completely revised armament. Two ShVAK cannon replaced the nose ShKAS machine guns and a UBT machine gun in a VUB-1 mount replaced the dorsal ShKAS, while the ventral machine gun was removed entirely. Two [...] Shpitalny Sh-37 or [...] 111P cannon replaced the wing root guns. The intended AM-39s were unavailable and therefore two Mikulin AM-38Fs were used as a temporary expedient. The engine radiators were moved from the nacelles into the wings. They were fed by inlets in the leading edge and outlets on the undersurface of the wing.|$|E

500|$|In the 2006–07 Serie A campaign, Kaladze {{scored a}} goal against Sampdoria {{which turned out}} to be his only goal of the season. Milan {{finished}} in fourth place with an eight-point deduction relating to the previous season's scandal. Kaladze won his second Champions League title on 23 May 2007 after Milan beat Liverpool 2–1 in the final; he came on as a 79th-minute substitute in that match. He later picked up the FIFA Club World Cup in December that year where Milan beat Boca Juniors 4–2 in the final, though Kaladze was one of two players to be sent off in that match. He had established himself as a first-team regular in the 2007–08 season, making 32 appearances, but had only featured sparingly in the 2008–09 season due to a knee ligament injury sustained in a UEFA Cup match against Zürich. Kaladze's performance in the 15 February 2009 Milan derby was described as a [...] "horror show" [...] on the Channel 4 website which started a dispute over an alleged smear campaign between Kaladze and the Georgian newspaper Lelo, who used the quote, [...] "Milan really does <b>need</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> centre-back after Kakha Kaladze’s horror show in the derby." [...] Milan finished third in the league that season, ten points behind Serie A champions Inter Milan; Kaladze believed this was caused by the many injuries suffered by the Milan squad.|$|E

[...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts. I believe you change laws". Without policy change, she felt [...] "we'll be back here in 10 years having the same conversation." [...] In June 2015, Clinton used the phrase [...] "all lives matter" [...] in a speech about the opportunities of young people of color, prompting backlash that she may misunderstand the message of [...] "Black Lives Matter" ...|$|E
