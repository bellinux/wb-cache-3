500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is <b>no</b> <b>talk</b> of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. You can give as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E

2500|$|In his closing, Leibowitz called Wright's {{argument}} {{an appeal}} to regional bigotry, claiming talk about Communists was just to [...] "befuddle" [...] the jury.

2500|$|Evan Wolfson, who, in 1996, ran the National Freedom to Marry Coalition, {{while an}} {{attorney}} at Lambda Legal, has also criticized {{the suggestion that}} DOMA was stopping something worse: [...] "That's complete nonsense. [...] There was no conversation about something 'worse' until eight years later. [...] There was <b>no</b> <b>talk</b> of a constitutional amendment, and no one even thought it was possible—and, of course, it turned out it wasn't really possible to happen. [...] So, {{the idea that people}} were swallowing DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment is really just historic revisionism and not true.

2500|$|On 17 November {{reports of}} a {{potential}} deal to place a [...] "compromise peacekeeping force" [...] in Darfur were announced, but would later {{appear to have been}} rejected by Sudan.

Sudan's Foreign Minister Lam Akol stated that [...] "there should be <b>no</b> <b>talk</b> about a mixed force" [...] and that the UN's role should be restricted to technical support. Also on 18 November, the AU reported that Sudanese military and Sudanese-backed militias had launched a ground and air operation in the region that resulted in about 70 civilian deaths. The AU stated that this [...] "was a flagrant violation of security agreements".|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 2014, Rolling Stone {{reported}} that the Celebrity Skin line-up of the band had reunited (with Patty Schemel in lieu of Samantha Maloney). Rolling Stone erroneously reported Love's upcoming solo single, [...] "Wedding Day" [...] to be a product of this reunion. Shortly after, Love curtailed her statement, saying: [...] "We may have made out but there is <b>no</b> <b>talk</b> of marriage. It's very frail, nothing might happen, and now the band are all flipping out on me." [...] On May 1, {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork, Love discussed the possibility of a reunion, and also stated it had been [...] "a mistake" [...] releasing Nobody's Daughter as a Hole record in 2010. [...] "Eric was right—I kind of cheapened the name, even though I'm legally allowed to use it. I should save [...] "Hole" [...] for the lineup everybody wants to see and had the balls to put Nobody's Daughter under my own name." [...] Love further discussed the possibility of reuniting the band, saying: No one's been dormant. Patty teaches drumming and drums in three indie bands. Melissa has her metal-nerd thing going on—her dream is to play Castle Donington with Dokken. Eric hasn't flipped—I jammed with him, he's still doing his Thurston -crazy tunings, still corresponding with Kevin Shields. We all get along great. There are bands who reunite and hate each others' guts.|$|E
