5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies.

The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or <b>not,</b> <b>but</b> only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could <b>not</b> <b>but</b> be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

Hideki protests that it would <b>not,</b> <b>but</b> Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose {{that the time has}} come to destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya.

She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E
5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} {{an experiment in}} which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei {{proposed an}} experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or <b>not,</b> <b>but</b> concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do <b>not,</b> <b>but</b> no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given {{the high costs of}} reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to be}} linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too.

5000|$|Return to normalcy, {{a return}} to the way of life before World War I, was United States presidential {{candidate}} Warren G. Harding's campaign promise in the election of 1920. Although detractors believed that the word was a neologism as well as a malapropism, coined by Harding (as opposed to the more accepted term normality), there was contemporaneous discussion and evidence found that normalcy had been listed in dictionaries as far back as 1857. Harding's promise was to return the United States prewar mentality, without the thought of war tainting the minds of the American people. To sum up his points, he stated:"America's present need is <b>not</b> heroics, <b>but</b> healing; <b>not</b> nostrums, <b>but</b> normalcy; <b>not</b> revolution, <b>but</b> restoration; <b>not</b> agitation, <b>but</b> adjustment; <b>not</b> surgery, <b>but</b> serenity; <b>not</b> the dramatic, <b>but</b> the dispassionate; <b>not</b> experiment, <b>but</b> equipoise; <b>not</b> submergence in internationality, but sustainment in triumphant nationality." ...|$|R
