25|$|There exist several {{archives}} and museums {{devoted to the}} preservation of historical perfumes, namely the Osmothèque, which stocks over 3,000 perfumes from the past two millennia in their original formulations. All scents in their collection are preserved in <b>non-actinic</b> <b>glass</b> flasks flushed with argon gas, stored in thermally insulated compartments maintained at 12°C (53.6°F) in a large vault.|$|E
40|$|Each of the {{preparations}} described here was obtained and evaluated {{at the request}} of a WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. Unless otherwise stated, a standard procedure was used to distribute the material into individual ampoules. The procedure was as follows. Upon receipt by the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), London, materials were stored temporarily in the dark at a temperature of - 10 °C or lower, and protected from moisture. At a convenient time they were brought back to room temperature, mixed, and distributed into individual neutral glass ampoules so that each ampoule contained 50 - 100 mg of powder. If it was known that the material was light-sensitive <b>non-actinic</b> <b>glass</b> ampoules were used. After exhaustive drying in vacuum over phosphorus(V) oxide, the ampoules were either constricted (up to 1963) or fitted with capillary leak plugs, dried for a further period under the same conditions, filled with dry nitrogen, and sealed by fusion of the glass. The total drying period varied from 8 to 38 days according {{to the nature of the}} material. After they had been tested for leaks, the ampoules were stored in the dark at - 20 °C...|$|E
