5|$|In figure skating, {{relaxation}} of the amateurism rules led to several former stars returning. The ladies' singles {{has resulted in}} the as-yet highest United States Winter Olympic television viewership, thanks to Tonya Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly hiring Shane Stant to club fellow female figure skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> in the knee. The ladies' singles was won by Ukraine's Oksana Baiul, while the men's singles was won by Russia's Alexei Urmanov, the ice dancing was won by Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov and the pair skating was won by Russians Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.|$|E
5|$|Storhamar Ishall is {{the regular}} {{training}} venue for Storhamar IL's figure skating group. Between them, the two venues have hosted the Norwegian Figure Skating Championships three times: Storhamar Ishall in 1983, and the Olympic Amphitheatre in 2005 and 2011. In October 1993, the Olympic Amphitheatre hosted Piruetten 1993, a pre-Olympic figure skating event. Although featuring {{stars such as}} <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> it only attracted 150 spectators. The venue has hosted the ISU Junior Grand Prix in 1999–2000 and 2000–01 and the World Junior Figure Skating Championships in 2002.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nancy</b> Ann <b>Kerrigan</b> (born October 13, 1969) is an American former figure skater. She won bronze {{medals at}} the 1991 World Championships and 1992 Winter Olympics, {{and a silver}} medal at the 1992 World Championships, before {{becoming}} the 1993 US National Champion.|$|R
5000|$|The Kerrigan {{family was}} of modest means. Kerrigan's father {{sometimes}} worked three jobs to fund her skating career; he also drove the ice resurfacer {{at the local}} rink in exchange for <b>Nancy's</b> lessons. [...] <b>Kerrigan</b> was coached by Theresa Martin until she was 16, then began working with Evy and Mary Scotvold. after a brief period with Denise Morrissey. The Scotvolds remained her coaches {{through the rest of}} her competitive career.|$|R
25|$|Brown {{followed}} with another satire, Attack of the 5 Ft. 2 Women, which lampooned {{the violence of}} ice skater Tonya Harding toward rival <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> {{as well as that}} of widely publicized castrator Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
25|$|Harding was {{a member}} of the U.S. ice skating team at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Amid {{controversy}} before and during the Games, she finished in eighth place, far behind Oksana Baiul (gold) and <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> (silver).|$|E
25|$|Tonya Maxene Harding (born November 12, 1970) is {{a former}} American figure skater. She is the 1991 U.S. {{champion}} and 1991 World Championship silver medallist. Harding was also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion. In 1994 she was banned for life from the U.S. Figure Skating Association after pleading guilty to hindering the prosecution following the attack on fellow skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Yegorova {{dominated}} women's cross-country skiing, taking {{five and}} four medals, respectively. A crowd of over 100,000 saw Italy beat Norway by 0.4 seconds on the men's 4 x 10 km relay. Vreni Schneider won {{a complete set}} of medals in Alpine skiing, while Norway took a medal sweep in the men's combined. <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> had, before the games, been clubbed by Tonya Harding's associate, but managed to take silver in ladies' singles. Johann Olav Koss won three speed skating events, while 13-year-old Kim Yoon-Mi became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medalist. Sweden beat Canada in a dramatic penalty shootout in the ice hockey final. With 11 gold medals, Russia won the most events, while with 26, Norway collected the most medals overall.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Kwan {{finished}} second to Tonya Harding at the U.S. Championships, which ordinarily would have placed {{her on the}} U.S. team to the 1994 Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway. That place was instead given to 1993 national champion <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> who had been sidelined by an assault and battery (eventually connected to Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly) after a practice session at those championships. The 13-year-old Kwan went to Norway as an alternate but did not compete. Kerrigan and Harding both dropped out of eligible competition before the 1994 World Championships. Because of this (and teammate Nicole Bobek not making out of the qualifying round), Kwan had the sole responsibility to ensure two entries for the U.S. at the 1994 World Championships by placing in the top ten. Kwan had an unusual mistake in the short program and placed eleventh in {{that portion of the}} competition, but skated a strong freestyle program and finished eighth overall.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 1994, Harding's main team {{competitor}} <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> {{was attacked}} by assailant Shane Stant after a practice session at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard, Shawn Eckhardt, hired Stant to break Kerrigan's right leg {{so that she would}} be unable to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. After failing to find Kerrigan at her training rink in Massachusetts, Stant followed her to Detroit. When she stepped off the ice after a practice session at Cobo Arena and walked behind a nearby curtain into a corridor, Stant struck her on the thigh a few inches above the knee with an ASP telescopic baton. Her leg was only bruised, not broken, but the injury forced her to withdraw from the national championship. Harding won that event, and she and Kerrigan were both selected for the 1994 Olympic team. Harding finished eighth in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan, by then fully recovered from the injury, won the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul from Ukraine.|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} song's verses each {{told the story}} of three abnormal children, each verse of [...] "Headline News" [...] tells the story of three famous tabloid stories of 1993 and 1994: Singapore caning American delinquent Michael Fay, figure skater Tonya Harding's then-boyfriend attacking her rival <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> and Lorena Bobbitt severing her husband's penis with a knife. In the last verse, Yankovic substitutes the term [...] "penis" [...] with euphemisms like [...] "wiener" [...] and [...] "Mr. Happy". Yankovic later joked that he [...] "wanted to write a song about these people because [...] think they're getting quite enough media attention", a reference to the stories' over-saturation in the news.|$|E
500|$|Bart and Milhouse buy {{an issue}} of Mad magazine. Bart also puts a Mad iron-on reading [...] "Down with Homework" [...] {{on one of his}} T-shirts, which causes {{controversy}} at school. Milhouse is shocked to see the new school uniforms, and his jaw drops, a [...] "Woody Allen-esque" [...] type of joke. The final bowling scene is similar to the final golfing scene in the 1980 film Caddyshack. Homer references the song [...] "Mr. Roboto" [...] by Styx. Moe's unsuccessful attempt to sideline Mr. Burns by hitting his leg with a crowbar is done in a similar manner to Shane Stant's attempt in 1994 to sideline figure skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> by physical assault.|$|E
500|$|Recording for {{the song}} itself started on July 27, 1994, at Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California. Backing Yankovic were Jon [...] "Bermuda" [...] Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, Jim West on guitar, and Kim Bullard on keyboards. Lisa Popeil {{provides}} the female backup vocals, {{as well as the}} scream of <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan.</b> The song also features various idiosyncratic elements to increase the humor. The song features manualist Mike Kieffer, who produces the flatulence-esque sound effects heard {{near the end of the}} song. Additionally, the ending features a chorus of kazoos, and Yankovic plays a short riff of the song on his trademark instrument, the accordion. Yankovic himself produced the session. Due to the vocal part of the original being in such a low register, Yankovic had to record the parody's vocal tracks early in the morning, when his voice was naturally lower.|$|E
500|$|In 1986 the IOC {{had voted}} to {{separate}} the Summer and Winter Games {{and place them in}} alternating even-numbered years. This change became effective for the 1994 Games, held in Lillehammer, Norway, which became the first Winter Olympics to be held separately from the Summer Games. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made their Olympic debuts. The women's figure skating competition drew media attention when American skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> was injured on 6 January 1994, in an assault planned by the ex-husband of opponent Tonya Harding. Both skaters competed in the Games, but the gold medal was won by Oksana Baiul. She became Ukraine's first Olympic champion. [...] Johann Olav Koss of Norway won three gold medals, coming first in all of the distance speed skating events. Russia won the most gold medals with 11 overall, closely followed by Norway with 10. Juan Antonio Samaranch described Lillehammer as the best Olympic Winter Games ever in his closing ceremony speech.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Kerrigan {{was created by}} Blizzard Entertainment's Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with her physical appearance designed by Metzen. Kerrigan was not originally {{intended to be a}} major character, and was only meant to appear on a single level. Initially based around the character Tanya Adams in the , Kerrigan was named after <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> who at the time was involved in a feud with Tonya Harding. However, Kerrigan's character grew on the developers, who decided to give a far greater role to the throw-away character. Kerrigan's self-proclaimed title is the [...] "Queen of Blades", which is gradually introduced to other characters {{to the point where it}} is synonymous with her. Chris Metzen has explained that it was meant to be an honorific title; a blade is a weapon designed to rip enemies to pieces, making the title fitting for Kerrigan, who evolved to be the greatest agent of the Zerg Overmind.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter Don King is featured prominently in [...] "Damien" [...] as Satan's promoter. Parker {{said he and}} Stone decided to spoof King only because [...] "it's just sort of who annoyed us that week. It's so random ... {{there is no point}} to who we're ripping on. It's definitely nothing personal." [...] <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> the Olympic figure skater attacked on orders of fellow skater Tonya Harding at the 1994 Winter Olympics, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the gold medal until Kyle reminds him she won the silver; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, [...] "You know, someone once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" [...] Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, [...] [...] "Damien" [...] also includes a reference to singer Nancy Sinatra, the daughter of legendary crooner Frank Sinatra. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the baroque period, {{goes on to say that}} [...] "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kerrigan, {{brother of}} figure skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan,</b> was {{serving in the}} 101st Airborne Division at the time, and was {{originally}} intended {{to be on the}} flight. [...] He did not board the flight, but 248 members of his unit including his two best friends were on the flight and died. [...] The trauma of losing so many people close to him was said to have caused Kerrigan to suffer from post traumatic stress disorder and have been a significant factor in causing him later legal problems.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{short time}} from 1993 to 1995, Rather co-anchored the evening news with Connie Chung. Chung had {{previously}} been a Washington correspondent for CBS News and anchored short news updates on the West Coast. On joining the CBS Evening News, however, she worked to report [...] "pop news" [...] stories that did not fit the style of broadcast. In one incident, she was on an airplane interviewing Tonya Harding {{who was accused of}} being behind the plot to injure fellow Olympic ice skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan.</b> Chung ultimately left the network, and Rather went back to doing the newscast alone.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2000–2001 season, Kwan {{began working}} with famed {{designer}} (and former figure skater) Vera Wang, who would design most of her competition and exhibition costumes for the next 6 years. [...] Kwan was only the second figure skater Wang designed for, following <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan.</b> [...] At that year's national championships, Kwan again won the title, receiving first-place ordinals from all 9 judges in both the short program and free skate. At the 2001 World Championships, Kwan was second behind Slutskaya in the short program. Kwan won the title with her [...] "Song of the Black Swan" [...] free skate, executing 7 triples, including a triple toe loop/triple toe loop combination.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 January, Tonya Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly conspired with Shane Stant to club fellow {{female figure}} skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> in the knee. Both Harding and Kerrigan were {{selected}} for the Olympic team. After Harding admitted to helping {{to cover up the}} attack, the United States Olympic Committee initiated proceedings to remove her from the Olympic team, but Harding retained her place after threatening legal action. [...] In the ladies' singles, Ukraine's Oksana Baiul won ahead of Kerrigan and Chen Lu, with Harding finishing eighth. In the men's singles, Russia's Alexei Urmanov won ahead of Canada's Elvis Stojko and France's Philippe Candeloro. Relaxation of the amateurism rules led to several former stars returning, such as ice dancing 1984 Champions Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who took a bronze behind Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov, and Maya Usova and Alexander Zhulin. In pair skating, the Russians also took a double, with Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov winning ahead of Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Figure Skating selects {{the athletes}} and {{officials}} {{that represent the}} United States at international figure skating competitions (Team USA). These competitions include the ISU Junior Grand Prix, Four Continents Figure Skating Championships, the ISU Grand Prix, the World Synchronized Skating Championships, the World Figure Skating Championships, and the Olympic Games. [...] Although the participants for Worlds and the Olympics are most often the top placers at US Nationals, {{there have been several}} times when other skaters have been selected due to injuries preventing them from competing at Nationals; <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan</b> being selected for the 1994 Olympics over 2nd-place finisher Michelle Kwan is one example. [...] Most recently 2014 4th-place finisher Ashley Wagner was selected over 3rd place Mirai Nagasu ostensibly because of Wagner's more consistent international record; however because of Wagner's many endorsement contracts her selection has raised concerns about the fairness of the process (since U.S. Championships are not used as a straightforward Olympic trials).|$|E
2500|$|Chief Sportswriter Simon Barnes of British {{newspaper}} The Times sparked {{debate over}} the incident when he labelled it [...] "the worst single piece of cheating {{in the history of}} sport" [...] primarily because of its [...] "potentially lethal consequences" [...] to Piquet, the other drivers, marshals and spectators. Supporting Barnes, The Times motor racing correspondent Edward Gorman cited the alleged top level pre-conceived elements of conspiracy that sought to sacrifice one team member to benefit another to put the incident on a par with controversies such as Ben Johnson, horse doping and illegal keels used in the America's Cup. Gorman then postulated that this incident was worse than those because Briatore and Symonds set in motion [...] "an event of violent destruction, the consequences of which they could neither predict nor control." [...] Matthew Syed countered that while the incident was premeditated, [...] "unspeakably unethical" [...] and dangerous, it was not nearly as reckless as the East German athletics doping scandal and other instances of long-term doping. Syed also argued that the Renault team would not have been expecting injuries to result from the crash, in contrast to incidents such as the assault on ice skater <b>Nancy</b> <b>Kerrigan.</b>|$|E
