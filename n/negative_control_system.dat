40|$|We {{have studied}} the genetic {{properties}} and developmental effects of several mutations, in eight different loci, which alter the specification of embryonic segments. All of the changes {{are related to the}} transformations caused by mutants of the bithorax complex. Several properties: the interactions of these mutants with different mutants of the bithorax complex, the interactions between themselves, the effect of changing dosages of their wildtype alleles and their response to ether induction of phenocopies permit one to distinguish between those mutations which affect activation of the bithorax genes in early embryogenesis and those which affect expression of the bithorax genes during development. This paper deals mainly with the Rg-bx locus and its interactions with other loci which affect segment specification. In particular two loci show genetic and developmental characteristics which seem to conform to those expected for a repressor coding gene (Polycomb) and for an inducer synthesizing gene (Rg-bx) active in a <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> of the genes in the bithorax complex.

40|$|Replication of IncFII {{plasmids}} {{is regulated}} through {{the expression of}} a gene, repA. The RepA protein is rate-limiting for initiation of replication. The main negative control is exerted by a countertranscript, CopA RNA, that binds to the complementary region of the RepA mRNA, thereby inhibiting the formation of the RepA protein. The target region for CopA RNA, CopT, is located upstream of the RepA coding region. An open reading frame for a putative 7 k protein overlaps the CopT sequence. Here we show by using lacZ fusions that the 7 k gene is expressed. We constructed a translation start mutation in order to abolish formation of the 7 k protein. This resulted in a 10 -fold decrease in repA expression. The 7 k protein produced in trans did not reverse this effect, so the 7 k protein per se does not control expression of repA. However, translation of the 7 k coding sequence must influence CopA/CopT RNA recognition, since ribosomes will transiently disrupt the target hairpin. We propose here a novel mechanism that affects the level of gene expression: the 7 k region of the RepA mRNA is a leader sequence that is involved in expression of the downstream gene; translation of the 7 k region competes with a <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> involving RNA-RNA interaction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Semen armeniacae amarum (SAA) is a Chinese {{traditional}} medicine and {{has long been}} used to control acute lower respiratory tract infection and asthma, {{as a result of}} its expectorant and antiasthmatic activities. However, its mutagenicity in vitro and in vivo has not yet been reported. The Ames test for mutagenicity is used worldwide. The histidine contained in biological samples can induce histidine-deficient cells to replicate, which results in more his + colonies than in <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> cells, therefore false-positive results may be obtained. So, it becomes a prerequisite to exclude the effects of any residual histidine from samples when they are assayed for their mutagenicity. Chinese traditional herbs, such as SAA, are histidine-containing biological sample, need modified Ames tests to assay their in vitro mutagenicity. Methods The mutagenicity of SAA was evaluated by the standard and two modified Ames tests. The first modification used the plate incorporation test same as standard Ames teat, but with new <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> in which different amounts of histidine corresponding to different concentrations of SAA was incorporated. When the number of his + revertants in SAA experiments was compared with that in new <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> the effect of histidine contained in SAA could be eliminated. The second modification used a liquid suspension test similar to the standard Ames test, except with histidine-rich instead of histidine-limited medium. The aim of this change was to conceal the effect of histidine contained in SAA on the final counting of his + revertants, and therefore to exclude false-positive results of SAA in the Ames test. Furthermore, the effect of SAA on chromosomal aberration in mammalian bone marrow cells was tested. Results The standard Ames test showed a positive result for mutagenicity of SAA. In contrast, a negative response was obtained with the modified plate incorporation and modified suspension Ames tests. Moreover, no apparent chromosomal aberrations were observed in mammalian bone marrow cells treated with SAA. Conclusion The standard Ames test was not suitable for evaluating the mutagenicity of SAA, because false-positive result could be resulted by the histidine content in SAA. However, the two modified Ames tests were suitable, because the experimental results proved that the effect of histidine in SAA and therefore the false-positive result were effectively excluded in these two modified Ames tests. This conclusion needs more experimental data to support in the future. Moreover, the experimental results illustrated that SAA had no mutagenicity in vitro and in vivo. This was in agreement with the clinical safety of SAA long-term used in China. </p...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that fluid {{mechanical}} forces directly impact endothelial signaling pathways. But while this general observation is clear, less apparent are the underlying mechanisms that initiate these critical signaling processes. This is because fluid mechanical forces can offer a direct mechanical input to possible mechanotransducers as well as alter critical mass transport characteristics (i. e., concentration gradients) of a host of chemical stimuli present in the blood stream. However, it has recently been accepted that mechanotransduction (direct mechanical force input), and not mass transfer, is the fundamental mechanism for many hemodynamic force-modulated endothelial signaling pathways and their downstream gene products. This conclusion has been largely based, indirectly, on accepted criteria that correlate signaling behavior and shear rate and shear stress, relative to changes in viscosity. However, in this work, we investigate the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> for these criteria. Here we computationally and experimentally subject mass-transfer limited systems, independent of mechanotransduction, to the purported criteria. The results showed that the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> (mass-transfer limited <b>system)</b> produced the same trends that have been used to identify mechanotransduction-dominant systems.

Though important for understanding behavior, avoidance goals have received less attention than approach goals. In this paper, we present a dynamic, formal model that provides a framework for describing and predicting the dynamics of avoidance goal regulation. We conduct a series of simulations to examine the dynamic pattern of behavior that emerges from the model when an avoidance goal is pursued in isolation and when an approach goal is also present. Two versions of the model were examined. In the first, the avoidance goal is regulated by a positive feedback loop. In the second, the avoidance goal is regulated by a negative feedback loop. We find that the positive feedback model produces a pattern of runaway behavior, even in a scenario where an approach goal is also present. By contrast, the negative feedback loop model produces a stable pattern of behavior that is more consistent with existing theory. The findings provide an important step toward theoretical parsimony by demonstrating that avoidance goal regulation, like approach goal regulation, can be understood using a <b>negative</b> feedback <b>control</b> <b>system</b> framework.

40|$|While {{a variety}} of {{in-vitro}} models have been employed to investigate the response of load-bearing tissues to hydrostatic pressure, long-term studies are limited {{by the need to}} provide for adequate gas exchange during pressurization. Applying compression in vitro may alter the equilibrium of the system and thereby disrupt the gas exchange kinetics. To address this, several sophisticated compression chamber designs have been developed. However, these systems are limited in the magnitude of pressure that can be applied and may require frequent media changes, thereby eliminating critical autocrine and paracrine signaling factors.

40|$|AbstractDeployment of the gene-regulatory network (GRN) {{responsible}} for skeletogenesis in the embryo {{of the sea}} urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus is restricted to the large micromere lineage by a double negative regulatory gate. The gate consists of a GRN subcircuit composed of the pmar 1 and hesC genes, which encode repressors and are wired in tandem, plus a set of target regulatory genes under hesC control. The skeletogenic cell state is specified initially by micromere-specific expression of these regulatory genes, viz. alx 1, ets 1, tbrain and tel, plus the gene encoding the Notch ligand Delta. Here we use a recently developed high throughput methodology for experimental cis-regulatory analysis to elucidate the genomic regulatory <b>system</b> <b>controlling</b> alx 1 expression in time and embryonic space. The results entirely confirm the double <b>negative</b> gate <b>control</b> <b>system</b> at the cis-regulatory level, including definition of the functional HesC target sites, and add the crucial new information that the drivers of alx 1 expression are initially Ets 1, and then Alx 1 itself plus Ets 1. Cis-regulatory analysis demonstrates that these inputs quantitatively account for the magnitude of alx 1 expression. Furthermore, the Alx 1 gene product not only performs an auto-regulatory role, promoting a fast rise in alx 1 expression, but also, when at high levels, it behaves as an auto-repressor. A synthetic experiment indicates that this behavior is probably due to dimerization. In summary, the results we report provide the sequence level basis for control of alx 1 spatial expression by the double negative gate GRN architecture, and explain the rising, then falling temporal expression profile of the alx 1 gene {{in terms of its}} auto-regulatory genetic wiring...|$|R
