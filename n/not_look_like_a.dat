5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, {{but they did not}} pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed that he did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> military man, they felt he had the quality {{they were looking for}} in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{flaws in}} his genetic make-up Kaine does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} human, his skin {{covered with a}} web-like mass of disfiguring scars. The costume that Kaine typically wears has been said to slow the degeneration process in his body. However it was recently suggested in Spider-Island: Deadly Foes that Kaine has a regeneration factor.|$|R
500|$|Waters {{accepted}} his invitation to be a guest star instantly, stating {{that if it}} was good enough for the actress Elizabeth Taylor, who appeared in the season four episodes [...] "Lisa's First Word" [...] and [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled", it was good enough for him. He joked, however, about a negative reaction if his character would be made to look like fitness personality Richard Simmons. John's design was based largely on Waters' own appearance; for animation reasons, Waters moustache was changed from straight to curvy, so that it did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mistake. As thanks for his performance, the show's staff sent Waters an animation cel from the episode, which he now has hanging in his office.|$|E
500|$|Square Enix {{had changed}} its mind, {{and no longer}} liked the Nordic style of this {{spin-off}} game, so a last-minute style change was attempted. [...] The game {{had been such a}} well-guarded secret, and had been through so many changes, that most employees did not know they had been working on a Final Fantasy game until very late in development. Grin attempted to change the art style to fit more with traditional Final Fantasy games, but still did not receive any positive feedback. In response, Grin sent Square Enix an image of one of the latter's own games, Final Fantasy XII, and were told that it does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> game in Final Fantasys style. Following that exchange, Grin {{came to the conclusion that}} there was no longer any way to satisfy the publisher.|$|E
500|$|On 28 January 1943 Purchase {{contacted}} Montagu {{with the}} news he had located a suitable body, probably that of Glyndwr Michael, a tramp who died from eating rat poison that contained phosphorus. Purchase informed Montagu and Cholmondeley that {{the small amount of}} poison in the system would not be identified in a body that {{was supposed to have been}} floating in the sea for several days. When Montagu commented that the under-nourished corpse did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fit field officer, Purchase informed him that [...] "he does not have to look like an officer – only a staff officer", more used to office work. Purchase agreed to keep the body in the mortuary refrigerator at a temperature of [...] – any colder and the flesh would freeze, which would be obvious after the body defrosted. He warned Montagu and Cholmondeley that the body had to be used within the following three months, after which it would have decomposed past the point of usefulness.|$|E
60|$|As we {{sat there}} the Awkward Man passed by, with his gun over his {{shoulder}} and his dog at his side. He did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> awkward man, there {{in the heart of the}} maple woods. He strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed.|$|R

60|$|But the {{certificate}} {{was in good}} order, and Armand, covered in coal-dust, with the perspiration streaming down his face, did certainly <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aristocrat in disguise. It was never very difficult to enter the great city; if one wished to put one's head in the lion's mouth, one was welcome to do so; the difficulty came when the lion thought fit to close his jaws.|$|R
500|$|Khanna {{made her}} screen debut {{opposite}} Bobby Deol in Rajkumar Santoshi's romance Barsaat (1995). She was cast by Dharmendra {{and before the}} film's release Khanna signed for two more projects. It performed well {{at the box office}} and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year, and she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance. The following year she played lead roles in Raj Kanwar's action film Jaan and Lawrence D'Souza's romance Dil Tera Diwana opposite Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan respectively. K.N. Vijiyan of the New Straits Times wrote that [...] "Khanna does <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> typical Hindi actress". While reviewing Dil Tera Diwana, Vijiyan wrote about Khanna: [...] "Unlike her previous movies, she looks really good in all her scenes and she can act well." [...] In 1997, two films featuring her; Uff! Yeh Mohabbat and Itihaas were released. Both of these films were poor box office performers. Her only release in 1998 was Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai, which featured her as Salman Khan's love interest.|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{appeared}} in the 2009 romantic comedy film The Proposal, starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in the lead roles. Åkerman played a supporting role as Gertrude, the ex-girlfriend of Reynolds' character. Although the film received mixed reviews, it went on to gross $317 million worldwide. Also in 2009, Åkerman starred in the comedy film Couples Retreat, opposite Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn. The film follows four couples as they travel to a tropical island resort for couples therapy. Åkerman played Ronnie, the wife of Vaughn's character. She enjoyed playing a mother {{for the first time}} and tried to make her character as truthful as possible, which included dyeing her hair brown to <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "blonde bombshell". The film premiered in theatres in October 2009 and grossed $34 million in its opening weekend in the United States, entering number one at the box office, and totalled $171 million worldwide. Reception for the film was mainly negative, although Åkerman's performance was met with more positive reactions.|$|E

To get a visual sense of what makes this song musically stunning, watch how Belinda sic Butcher's singing face montages to wildly cavorting guitar and bass frets and is interspersed with the subdued playing of the band." ...|$|R

Stephen mentions that he has something of Howard’s in his apartment (referring to the gun), and Howard says he won’t be needing it. Stephen saunters off to greet the new day.|$|R

With that news, Italy manager Roberto Donadoni then called up Fiorentina centre-back Alessandro Gamberini as his official replacement. Alessandro Del Piero captained the team in his place. Cannavaro added that he would stay with the squad to offer support. This would have been Cannavaro's third Euro tournament.|$|E

Meanwhile, a poll for The Independent by BMG Research, suggested that working class voters were more likely to consider Corbyn [...] "incompetent" [...] than those from the middle class, and a higher proportion thought he was [...] "out of touch" [...] also. Martin Kettle of The Guardian [...] wrote that [...] "many Labour MPs, even some who face defeat, want an early election" [...] to prove decisively that Corbyn's Labour is unelectable as a government.
