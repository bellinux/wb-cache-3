40|$|Abstract Background Road traffic {{injuries}} (RTIs) are a {{major public}} health problem, requiring concerted efforts both for their prevention and a reduction of their consequences. Timely arrival of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) at the crash scene followed by speedy victim transportation by trained personnel may reduce the RTIs' consequences. The first 60 minutes after injury occurrence - {{referred to as the}} "golden hour"- are vital for the saving of lives. The present study was designed to estimate the average of various time intervals occurring during the pre-hospital care process and to examine the differences between these time intervals as regards RTIs on urban and <b>interurban</b> <b>roads.</b> Method A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed and various time intervals in relation to pre-hospital care of RTIs identified in the ambulance dispatch centre in Urmia, Iran from 20 March 2005 to 20 March 2007. All cases which resulted in ambulance dispatches were reviewed and those that had complete data on time intervals were analyzed. Results In total, the cases of 2027 RTI victims were analysed. Of these, 61. 5 % of the subjects were injured in city areas. The mean response time for city locations was 5. 0 minutes, compared with 10. 6 minutes for <b>interurban</b> <b>road</b> locations. The mean on-scene time on the <b>interurban</b> <b>roads</b> was longer than on city roads (9. 2 vs. 6. 1 minutes, p Conclusion The response, transport and total time intervals among EMS responding to RTI incidents were longer for <b>interurban</b> <b>roads,</b> compared to the city areas. More research should take place on needs-to and access-for EMS on city and <b>interurban</b> <b>roads.</b> The notification interval seems to be a hidden part of the post-crash events and indirectly affects the "golden hour" for victim management {{and it needs to be}} measured through the establishment of the surveillance systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the magnitude and}} characteristics of crashes and drivers involved in head-on crashes on two-way <b>interurban</b> <b>roads</b> in Spain between 2007 and 2012, and to identify the factors associated with the likelihood of head-on crashes on these roads compared {{with other types of}} crash. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the National Crash Register. The dependent variables were head-on crashes with injury (yes/no) and drivers involved in head-on crashes (yes/no). Factors associated with head-on crashes and with being a driver involved in a head-on crash versus other types of crash were studied using a multivariate robust Poisson regression model to estimate proportion ratios (PR) and confidence intervals (95 % CI). Results: There were 9, 192 head-on crashes on two-way Spanish <b>interurban</b> <b>roads.</b> A total of 15, 412 men and 3, 862 women drivers were involved. Compared with other types of crash, head-on collisions were more likely on roads 7 m or more wide, on road sections with curves, narrowings or drop changes, on wet or snowy surfaces, and in twilight conditions. Transgressions committed by drivers involved in head-on crashes were driving in the opposite direction and incorrectly overtaking another vehicle. Factors associated with a lower probability of head-on crashes were the existence of medians (PR =  0. 57; 95 %CI: 0. 48 - 0. 68) and a paved shoulder of less than 1. 5 meters (PR =  0. 81; 95 %CI: 0. 77 - 0. 86) or from 1. 5 to 2. 45 meters (PR =  0. 90; 95 %CI: 0. 84 - 0. 96). Conclusions: This study allowed the characterization of crashes and drivers involved in head-on crashes on two-way <b>interurban</b> <b>roads.</b> The lower probability observed on roads with median strips point to these measures as an effective way to reduce these collision...|$|R
40|$|Like all EU countries, Spain should {{design and}} promote {{a fair and}} {{homogeneous}} generalized road pricing scheme. Tolls should vary according to infrastructure damage, degree of congestion, risk of accident, and environmental nuisances. An initial study (Spanish road pricing model project: META) of interurban transport pricing {{has been carried out}} at national level, considering the valuation of the internal and external costs to define efficient road pricing schemes of different type of roads and appropriate price levels in different <b>interurban</b> <b>road</b> contexts, shifting from a toll for financing infrastructure construction to a toll for recovering social costs. The META project has developed an easy-to-apply pricing methodology, based on a bottom-up approach. The main variable is the AADT -daily flow- applied to accurately estimate generalized road transport costs for each kind of vehicles and each type of road. Based on the current Spanish road network, the META model estimates all social costs: internal costs (fuel, vehicle maintenance, labor, insurance and tax) and external costs (infrastructure, congestion, accident and environmental nuisances). Computed for the 13, 156 Km of interurban highways network, the model calculates the costs for each vehicle type (Car, HGV, LGV and bus) and for each road network section following the <b>interurban</b> <b>road</b> characteristics (AADT, capacity and traffic composition for each section of highway network). The two main results of META model for costs in terms of policy implications suggest to moderate the construction of new <b>interurban</b> <b>road</b> infrastructures in Spain and to analyze congestion before to built new metropolitan roads. If we decide for a road pricing scheme based on the environmental, accident and infrastructure costs, because of the reduced number of the congestion situation, we can use the average external costs that are very similar to the marginal external costs...|$|R
