5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be {{successful}}, {{not because of}} you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal}} with so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} {{steadily}} escalating development {{costs of the}} vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling {{some of his own}} shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A £12 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which £8.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle – his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen – Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Warwick in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

25|$|Lohmann {{did come}} back to England in 1901 to manage the second South African touring team (and the first whose matches were {{recognised}} as first-class). However, his health was clearly <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to recover completely, and even after returning to Cape Town {{with the onset of}} autumn in England, Lohmann's condition only became more critical. On 1 December 1901, the tuberculosis he had fought against for nine years finally claimed his life at age 36.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Marshall {{tries to}} get Lily to let Scooter know she is <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be with him, but she is immobilized by Scooter's cute puppy-dog eyes. Marshall uses Barney's teacup pig (in a cute blanket) to train Lily to resist Scooter. Eventually, it works, and the two head down to the cafeteria, but even though Lily is able to tell Scooter it will never happen, Marshall himself can't resist Scooter's charm, telling him to wait until Marshall is dead.|$|E

25|$|Lancashire Lightning eased to a {{comfortable}} win against Northamptonshire Steelbacks to go {{third in the}} table, two points behind leaders Middlesex Crusaders. Northamptonshire won the toss and batted, but 215 for 7 was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be enough on a fine Old Trafford pitch, where Lancashire's Mal Loye smashed 94 not out with ten fours and three sixes. There were good news for England fans as well - Test all-rounder Andrew Flintoff bowled 9 overs for Lancashire without complain from his recently operated ankle, taking the wicket of England prospect Bilal Shafayat in the process.|$|E
25|$|Public {{comments}} made by Phil Anselmo following the shooting suggested that he had considered reuniting with the band prior to Darrell's death. However, {{one year after the}} murder Vinnie stated in an interview that this reunion was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen. Comments about a potential one-off reunion concert often resurface periodically, with Zakk Wylde often being suggested as the stand-in replacement for Darrell. Vinnie, however, has been strictly resistant to the idea. Despite several overtures towards reconciliation by Anselmo towards Paul, the two men remain all but permanently estranged.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} Test, England made a tortuous 133 in 115 four-ball overs, with George 'Joey' Palmer taking 7 for 68. By close of {{play on the}} first day, Australia were in the driving seat at 86 for 1. Whilst England {{recovered}} to dismiss them for 197 and then made 232 themselves, they were <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to stop Australia getting the 169 runs they needed to win. The third Test was even more one-sided. England got 188. Then Australia made 262, with Percy McDonnell making 147, Alec Bannerman 70, and no other batsman scoring more than 7! England again collapsed to 134, and Australia won by 6 wickets.|$|E

25|$|In early 2011, Vinnie Paz {{announced}} on his Facebook page that In Death Reborn {{is due to}} be released in 2012, however the date was pushed back and almost seemed like it was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be released. Early in 2012, Houston underground MC Zilla and Connecticut's Blacastan were added to the group. Both artists have made names for themselves with their features and album releases in 2012. In Death Reborn was eventually released on April 22, 2014. The album featured members Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Blacastan, Block McCloud, Celph Titled, Demoz, Des Devious, Doap Nixon, Esoteric, Lawrence Arnell, King Magnetic, King Syze, OuterSpace, Reef the Lost Cauze and Zilla. Their fifth studio album, Heavy Lies the Crown was released on October 21, 2014.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection {{was the best way to}} explain evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley <b>never</b> <b>going</b> quite so far as to say he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|National League {{starting}} pitcher Brad Penny {{set the tone}} for the evening, striking out Ichiro Suzuki, Derek Jeter, and David Ortiz to start the game. His fastball had uncharacteristic speed, <b>never</b> <b>going</b> below 96 miles per hour, and – aside from a lone curveball – was the only pitch he threw in the first inning. American League pitcher Kenny Rogers wasn't as overpowering as Penny, but still escaped the first relatively unscathed. The AL would get to Penny in the second as Vladimir Guerrero hit an opposite-field solo home run that just cleared the right field fence, giving the AL a 1–0 lead. The NL would respond in the bottom of the inning with David Wright hitting his own solo home run to left field, tying the game at 1–1.|$|E

Behind forwards Johnny Rainford, George Francis and Jim Towers in the pecking order, Caven's {{career with}} the Bees <b>never</b> got <b>going,</b> making just seven appearances and scoring one goal before departing Griffin Park {{at the end of}} the 1958-59 season.|$|R
25|$|On the Eastern Front, the Cavalry Division {{was mostly}} {{deployed}} in the south. It saw little fighting, as the German army did not use cavalry frequently, and division was kept mainly in reserve. Richthofen’s brigade served near Pinsk in 1916, and the division would spend late 1915 to January 1917 on defensive duties in the Pripet Marshes. Richthofen was given command of the horse depot of the Brigade {{in the autumn of}} 1916 and was promoted to Squadron Commander, with 160 men under his command. This was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to garner him the level of fame his cousins, Lothar and Manfred, were now achieving in the Luftstreitkräfte (Imperial Air Service), and they personally encouraged him to transfer to the air service, which he finally did in June 1917.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a more even affair. It was held at Westpac Stadium, Wellington, on 24 January. New Zealand batted first and scored well in the early stages, but lost wickets at vital times, much of the damage being done by bowlers Andrew Bichel and Lance Klusener. Only Nathan Astle was able to produce a large score, {{finishing}} on 109. New Zealand were all out for 256, a respectable score, but less {{than they would have}} wanted on what was a good batting pitch. The total was <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to be enough, however, especially after Matthew Elliott and Nick Knight got the World XI off to a flying start. Elliott was particularly belligerent, his 57 runs including three sixes. Although the World XI lost several wickets, their batting continued at a fast pace, and they reached the required target in the 48th over for the loss of seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|Kershaw {{can be seen}} {{presenting}} {{at public}} university film forums. Kershaw has contributed his experiences with acting and drama to public universities. While performing in the theater he's known to become emotional and challenge the audience. Kershaw addressed the country of El Salvador on national news across 7 million homes bringing together congressional leaders and administration officials in hopes to furnish clean water to communities. On December 30, 2014 Kershaw hung water paintings on corners of rural villages and W.U. Caribbean Magazine claimed an immediate impact on rural communities and they stated Kershaw's energy spread and his light shined bright on the world water crisis. The Caribbean's Drive Time Radio Show publicized Kershaw's clean water campaign and recorded him speaking out against the lack of sanitation in rural communities and he said, “If everybody stops {{going to the bathroom}} right now then we can save lives, but that’s <b>never</b> <b>going</b> to happen.” Kershaw was called 'He No Faking Jamaican' for his activism in the Caribbean.|$|E
