The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> constructed before 1936.|$|E

The burial dates to the Late Classic. Associated offerings included an inverted ceramic vessel, a flint projectile point, a grey obsidian prismatic blade, a shell disk, two perforated ceramic disks and various other pieces of worked flint. Some of these items may actually be rubbish dumped on top of the burial, with only the inverted vessel being a definite offering associated with the human remains.

Architect Philip Hooker's Federal style design is the city's oldest public building, and the less altered of his two intact <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> in the city. In the 1820s, Joseph Henry co-discovered electrical inductance in experiments conducted in the building, a discovery that was important to the later development of the telegraph and, by extension, the modern telecommunications of the Information Age. A statue of him by John Flanagan was placed out front to commemorate his accomplishment. T.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} undertakings create {{cost savings}} and public benefits. These cost savings provide owners/managers {{with opportunities to}} earn a return on their investments. Benefits include lower electricity congestion, lower emissions, and potentially lower prices. However, there are many cases in which viable projects are known but not pursued. This research seeks to asses the role of capital markets in driving investment into <b>non-residential</b> <b>building</b> energy efficiency. Research Questions: 	What are the demand-side and supply-side measures that could save the most energy at the least cost? 	What are the impediments to investment in these measures? 	What are potential solutions, particularly in terms of financial instruments, products, and structures? Methodology:	 	Secondary research 	In-depth interviews 	Conferences / trade shows Findings: Investment in <b>non-residential</b> <b>building</b> energy efficiency is taking place {{but not to the}} extent possible. When projects do attract customer attention, access to capital is a significant issue, not least because of the difficulty in collateralizing EE equipment, and most ESCOs’ lack of credit ratings. Utilities are looking to establish authoritative and lucrative positions, driven by new regulation. Capital markets financiers can seize this opportunity to leverage utilities and government partners to devise financing structures that can reallocate risk and return and drive investment into <b>non-residential</b> <b>building</b> energy efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Other notable architects to have {{practiced in}} Kilmacolm include Sir John James Burnet whose {{works in the}} village include the Kidston Hall and the major late 19th-century {{renovation}} of Finlaystone House and James Austen Laird, who worked on numerous homes in the village. Also of significance are the former orphans' homes at Quarrier's Village, {{many of which are}} listed. The homes were designed individually according to the wishes of donors, mainly by Glasgow architect Robert A. Bryden. As previously mentioned, Bryden was also responsible for a number of the <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> in Quarrier's Village including Mount Zion Church, Elise Hospital and what became Bridge of Weir Hospital, the latter two having been converted into a home for the elderly and a residential development respectively.|$|E
25|$|Between 2008 and 2013, {{researchers}} from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA were working {{together in the}} joint research program “Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings” {{under the umbrella of}} International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar Heating and Cooling Program (SHC) Task 40 / Energy in Buildings and Communities (EBC, formerly ECBCS) Annex 52 in order to bring the Net ZEB concept to market viability. The joint international research and demonstration activities are divided in subtasks. The objective is to develop a common understanding, a harmonized international applicable definition framework (Subtask A, see definitions methodology “Net Zero Energy Building” above), design process tools (Subtask B), advanced building design and technology solutions and industry guidelines for Net ZEBs (Subtask C). The scope encompasses new and existing residential and <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> located within the climatic zones of the participating countries.|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low ventilation rate, an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E

500|$|The use {{of carbon}} {{monoxide}} detectors has been standardized in many areas. In the USA, NFPA 720-2009, the carbon monoxide detector guidelines published by the National Fire Protection Association, mandates the placement {{of carbon monoxide}} detectors/alarms on every level of the residence, including the basement, in addition to outside sleeping areas. In new homes, AC-powered detectors must have battery backup and be interconnected to ensure early warning of occupants at all levels. NFPA 720-2009 is the first national carbon monoxide standard to address devices in <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings.</b> These guidelines, which now pertain to schools, healthcare centers, nursing homes and other <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings,</b> include three main points: ...|$|E

[...] The first hospital in England catering for mental illness was established {{in a house in}} Roundhill Crescent in 1905. Brighton's first Jewish cemetery, although a short distance outside Round Hill according to Brighton & Hove City Council's definition, has been associated with the suburb throughout its near 200-year history. The London Road viaduct, a distinctive, sweeping piece of railway architecture, forms the northern boundary of the area and [...] "a literal gateway" [...] between outer and inner suburbia. All of these buildings have been listed by English Heritage for their architectural and historical importance, and the core of Round Hill, around Roundhill Crescent, is one of 34 conservation areas in the city. [...] Round Hill's steep slopes and road layout encouraged the introduction of another feature which gives the area its character: the [...] "cat's-creep" [...] staircase. The area has good tree cover, and increasingly heavy traffic along the three main roads which run through the area.|$|E
500|$|The Corporation also {{provided}} <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> on the cleared land. The Circus Street Municipal Market, {{on a wide}} street built behind Scutt's Royal Circus riding school, opened in January 1937 {{and became one of}} Brighton's main markets. A former chapel and many terraced houses had stood on the site, whose redevelopment cost £75,000 (£ in [...] ). A fish market, moved from a site near the beach, was added in 1960. The building closed in 2005 and has been empty since then, apart from its use as a temporary exhibition centre during the 2009 Brighton Festival—when sculptor Anish Kapoor showed a new work there. Two clinics, specialising in chest complaints and child welfare, opened {{on the north side of}} Sussex Street, opposite the market, in 1936 and 1938 respectively. The chest clinic closed in 1989. The lower part of Sussex Street was renamed Morley Street at this time. Brighton Corporation compulsorily purchased Carlton Place in about 1955 and demolished the houses and former riding school in favour of new housing. John Street became the site of two important civic buildings in the mid-1960s: Brighton's central police station was opened in 1965, followed by the new county court building two years later.|$|E
30|$|In Table  1 {{it can be}} {{observed}} that construction waste is the main contributing waste type (61 %), to the aggregated Services sector. Examining the disaggregated data from Table A 3, Appendix A, it can {{be observed}} that within the aggregated Services sector, the ten sectors that have the largest direct and total multipliers—Residential building repair and maintenance (# 243), Residential building construction (# 244), <b>Non-residential</b> <b>building</b> construction (# 245), <b>Non-residential</b> <b>building</b> repair and maintenance (# 246), Non-building construction (# 248), Non-building repair (# 249), Industrial machinery repairs (# 253), Business machines and equipment repairing and services (# 254), Wholesale repair and servicing (# 255), and Retail repair and service (# 257)—all principally produce construction waste. Other waste (8 %) and Food waste (7 %) are {{the second and third}} largest type of waste to contribute to the aggregated Service sectors waste footprint. The disparity between Construction waste and all other waste types within the aggregated service sector is due to the C&D waste stream (which is exclusively these sectors) consisting of primarily construction-based waste.|$|R

The demand to use wood and wood-based products for applications in both residential and <b>non-residential</b> <b>building</b> construction has been increasing over recent years. However, due to the inherent flammability of such products, they often contribute to unwanted fires, resulting in numerous injuries and fatalities. The use of wood is, therefore, limited by various safety requirements and regulations pertaining to its flammability and spread of fire characteristics.|$|R

2500|$|Brick {{buildings}} are common throughout the area. [...] Pale gault brick {{is characteristic of}} some mid-19th-century residential developments, such as the area around Grand Avenue in Hove and the Valley Gardens area of Brighton (both conservation areas). [...] Later in that century, smooth red brickwork became more common. [...] Yellowish stock bricks were popular in the 19th century for <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> and walls which were not readily visible. [...] Different coloured bricks, such as brown and grey-blue, were often used in quoins and dressings on walls made of flint or red bricks. The layout of brickwork [...] "has {{a significant effect on}} a building's appearance"; the Flemish bond pattern is encountered most frequently in the city. On Victorian and Edwardian houses, brick chimney-stacks often served a decorative as well as a functional purpose, and were sometimes tall and ornate: examples include the Queen Anne-style houses at 8–11 Grand Avenue, Hove (1900–03, by Amos Faulkner).|$|E
