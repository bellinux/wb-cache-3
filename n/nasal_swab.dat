The connections of Gun Runner arranged to enter the horse in the inaugural running of the $12 million Pegasus World Cup on January 28 in what would have been his seasonal debut, but Gulfstream Park officials refused to allow him to ship to the track despite a negative blood test as the horse had not been tested for the virus through a <b>nasal</b> <b>swab.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The current {{diagnosis}} for EHV-1 is PCR, polymerase chain reaction, which copies the DNA so {{one can see}} if a {{virus is}} in the DNA segment. PCR can detect the viral load in the DNA, telling if the horse is very infected or below detection levels. To get samples for PCR a veterinarian may {{want to have an}} uncoagulated blood sample and also a <b>nasal</b> <b>swab.</b> There are a few downfalls of PCR one being that it is very time consuming and takes a while to get back samples and results and the other downfall is how the results are interpreted. Horses can have a latent virus but not show clinical signs and be called clinically normal, except the PCR results will give positive test result when it’s not so straightforward [...] The one other downfall of PCR is that there is not standardized protocols between the laboratories. Treatment for EHV-1 is limited at the time and there isn’t one definitive treatment that is guaranteed to work. The treatments now include intravenous fluids, I.V’s, or anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{isolation}} of Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is credited to Rolf Michel and Barbel Hauroder-Philippczyk in Berlin in 1994. Using a <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> from volunteers, {{they were able}} to isolate coccoid-shaped bacteria that were present among other naturally-produced organisms. Although at least ten subsequent attempts at reisolation were tried, P. acanthamoebae was not isolated again until 1997 when the researchers Rudolf Amann, Nina Springer, and Wolfgang Ludwig isolated it with a strain of Acanthamoeba species. This sample was transferred to a non-nutrient agar plate and the parasitized trophozoite of the Acanthamoeba species multiplied. A trophozoite is an active stage in the Acanthamoeba species life cycle in which the protozoan grows and feeds. [...] The researchers were able to isolate the infected trophozoites by this method only once, as subsequent tries were unsuccessful. The researchers then took small aliquots of the organism and filtered it to ensure the sample was pure. After running these samples through a centrifuge, a machine with a rapid rotating inner container, the samples were used to directly amplify the 16S rRNA gene to form a nearly full-length rRNA sequence by Polymerase Chain Reaction. The ribosomal DNA was sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit of Pharmacia. [...] After analyzing the genome and confirming 86% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to members of the genus Chlamydia, they proposed Parachlamydia acanthamoebae be classified under the order of Chlamydiales.|$|E

The samples included clotted blood for serum, <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs,</b> and fresh and formalin-fixed ear notches. The tests were as follows: titration of infectious virus in serum and nasal swabs; antigen-capture (AC) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or ACE, on serum, <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs,</b> and fresh ear notches; gel-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of serum, <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs,</b> and fresh ear notches; immunohistochemical (IHC) testing of formalin-fixed ear notches; and serologic testing for BVDV antibodies in serum. Of the 12 animals starting the study, 3 died with mucosal disease. The ACE and IHC tests on ear notches had positive results throughout the study, as did the ACE and PCR tests on serum. There was detectable virus in <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs</b> from all the cattle throughout the study {{except for a few}} samples that were toxic to cell cultures. The serum had a virus titer ≥ log 10 1. 60 in all samples from all the cattle except for 3 collections from 1 animal. Although there were several equivocal results, the PCR test most often had positive results. The BVDV antibodies were due to vaccination or exposure to heterologous strains and did not appear to interfere with any BVDV test. These findings illustrate that PI cattle may be identified by several tests, but differentiation of PI cattle from cattle with acute BVDV infection requires additional testing, especially of blood samples and <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs</b> positive on initial testing. Also, calves PI with BVDV are continual shedders of infectious virus, as shown by the infectivity of <b>nasal</b> <b>swabs</b> over the 11 -mo study...|$|R

The identity of each matched pair was confirmed biochemically and serologically. The similarity of the isolates obtained from a <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> and from a transtracheal swab was compared by using ribotyping and antibiotic susceptibility analyses. Although the calves were sampled only once with a nasal and a transtracheal swab, when both samples were bacteriologically positive the <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> identified the same bacterial species as the transtracheal swab 96 % of the time. The <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> isolate was genetically identical to the transtracheal isolate in 70 % of the matched pairs. Six different ribotypes were observed for the P. haemolytica isolates, while only one ribotype was observed for {{the limited number of}} P. multocida isolates. Of the six P. haemolytica ribotypes, two ribotypes predominated. All the paired isolates displayed similar susceptibility to ceftiofur, erythromycin, tilmicosin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and florfenicol, with some minor variations for ampicillin and spectinomycin.

40|$|Studies of Staphylococcus aureus nasal {{carriage}} have distinguished three carriage patterns: persistent, intermittent, and noncarriage. The {{criteria used}} to identify these carriage patterns have been inconsistent. In 1988 the S. aureus nasal carrier index, i. e., the proportion of <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> specimen cultures yielding S. aureus, was determined for 91 staff members of various departments of a large university hospital by obtaining weekly <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> specimens for culture over a 12 -week period. Thirty-three (36 %) persons had carrier indices of 0. 80 or higher, 15 (17 %) had indices between 0. 1 and 0. 7, and 43 (47 %) had indices of zero. In 1995, 17 individuals with carrier indices of 0. 80 or higher in 1988 were available for reexamination. For 12 (71 %) of these individuals, S. aureus was again isolated from a single <b>nasal</b> <b>swab,</b> i. e., from each individual with a 1988 carrier index of 1. 0 but from only half of those with indices below 1. 0. Genotyping (by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) of all S. aureus strains showed that strains isolated from only three individuals, all with 1988 carrier indices of 1. 0, in 1988 and 1995 showed genetic similarity.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of equine influenza H 3 N 8 in a riding school is described retrospectively {{with emphasis on}} diagnosis and putative vaccine failure. In March 1995 an {{outbreak of}} equine influenza occurred among 11 horses in a riding school, where most horses had received basic primary immunizations and several booster vaccinations against influenza. Six of the 11 diseased horses had received their last booster vaccination within 5 months of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the influenza infection spread rapidly and clinical manifestations were prominent with frequent, harsh, dry coughing often accompanied by high fever. Nasal swabs were taken from 11 diseased horses. Influenza A virus of the equine H 3 N 8 (equi- 2) subtype was isolated from five <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts. Stored <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts were also retrospectively investigated in two different enzyme immunoassays designed to detect the type-specific conserved nucleoprotein of influenza A viruses, and in a single-tube reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using a set of primers based on highly conserved regions of the matrix gene of influenza A viruses. Five <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts were found positive in a DAS-ELISA and seven in the Directigen® Flu A (DFA) assay, respectively. Two <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts from which virus was isolated did not give a positive result in the DAS-ELISA, and one of these also did not give a positive result in the DFA assay. Nine <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts were found positive by RT-PCR. Moreover, all virus isolation and/or ELISA positive <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts were confirmed by RT-PCR. Three <b>nasal</b> <b>swab</b> extracts were negative by virus isolation, PCR and ELISA. A significant rise in HI titre against influenza A/eq/Miami/ 63 (H 3 N 8) virus was detected in seven of the nine paired sera available. In acute phase serum samples from 10 horses, SRH antibody levels varied widely. However, some horses with high, or at least putatively clinically protective SRH antibody levels, showed clinical signs and infection was confirmed. Antigenic analysis of two isolates showed that A/eq/Holland/ 1 / 95 (H 3 N 8) and A/eq/Holland/ 2 / 95 (H 3 N 8) cluster with the UK isolate Osgodsby/ 92, the Swedish isolate Borlänge/ 91 and some other European isolates, with H/ 2 / 95 identical in reactivity to Borlänge/ 91 and H/ 1 / 95 more similar in reactivity to Osgodsby/ 92 than H/ 2 / 95. Nucleotide and deduced amino-acid sequences showed large differences of both isolates as compared with Miami/ 63, Fontainebleau/ 79 and Kentucky/ 81, the influenza A H 3 N 8 subtype strains incorporated in the vaccines used in this riding school.

40|$|Low nasal {{carriage}} of drug-resistant bacteria among {{medical students}} in Vienna Niedrige nasale Besiedlung mit resistenten Bakterien bei Medizinstudenten in Wien Background: Multi-drug resistant bacteria are increasing and remain {{a major public}} health challenge worldwide. In {{order to understand the}} potential role of medical students as a reservoir for circulating pathogenic bacteria and their transmission, we analysed the nasal colonisation among 86 clinically exposed medical students of the Medical University of Vienna, which is integrated into General Hospital of Vienna. Methods: <b>Nasal</b> <b>swabs</b> obtained from 79 students were eligible for further analysis. <b>Nasal</b> <b>swabs</b> were analysed for Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria with special emphasis on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus...|$|R
