5|$|Legend of Mana was {{directed}} by Mana series creator Koichi Ishii, who had worked on the three previous games in the series. Many of the other developers were <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series, including producer Akitoshi Kawazu, the director and producer of many games in Square's SaGa series, and designer Akihiko Matsui, {{who had been the}} director for Chrono Trigger. The game's character designs and illustrations were done by Shinichi Kameoka, who was also <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series. Retro Gamer, in 2011, stated that although Ishii kept the game tied to previous titles in the series by reusing gameplay elements, Kawazu had a heavy influence on the gameplay design of the game.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise of the march and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva, a cadet who, {{contrary}} to Lasky's beliefs, {{is a full}} supporter of {{the war against the}} insurrectionists. Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence. She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack. Popplewell was <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience.|$|E

5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E

Producer Koji Igarashi, who had led the production teams for previous Castlevania titles, led Aria of Sorrow's development as well. Michiru Yamane also returned to compose the music for the game alongside Takashi Yoshida and Soshiro Hokkai. Director Junichi Murakami was <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Castlevania series.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{building}} had not officially opened, Comcast office workers began moving in early December 2007, ahead of the scheduled completion in March 2008. The Comcast Center officially opened on June 6, 2008. A study sponsored by Comcast and Liberty Property Trust said {{the construction of the}} Comcast Center created 17,200 jobs and generated US$2 billion of economic activity for Pennsylvania. Despite opposition by other building owners to construction of the Comcast Center, by the time most space in the Comcast Center had been leased vacancy rates in Center City offices were falling and rents were rising. Even HRPT Properties Trust had leased 70 percent of the space Comcast vacated by 2007. The predictions by opponents did not occur mainly because Comcast ended up leasing 89 percent of the building and the offices for the Comcast Center's second largest tenant, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, were <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E

5|$|Final Destination 3 {{received}} a mixed response; some critics {{felt that the}} film was formulaic and did not bring anything <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise while others praised it for being enjoyable and offering its audience what it wishes to see. Attention was given especially to death scenes involving a tanning bed and a nail gun respectively; these were favorably received, as was Winstead's performance. The film was a financial success and, {{at the time of}} its release, the highest-grossing installment in the franchise. The film was followed by two sequels—The Final Destination and Final Destination 5—released in 2009 and 2011, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{relaunch}} of Star Trek in 2009 {{with a new}} cast playing those roles seen in The Original Series, {{there was}} commentary online {{about the lack of}} female characters and whether Rand might be appearing in future installments. While the sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was in production, Rand was one of five characters who was stated not to be appearing in the film by writer Roberto Orci. But there was still speculation {{at the time of the}} broadcast of the first trailer about who Alice Eve was portraying in the film. The options given by Tor.com was that it was either Janice Rand or Carol Marcus. Daily Variety reported that she was cast as someone <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise, but she was actually cast as Marcus.|$|E

5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book Our Search for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E
5|$|In the game's campaign, {{which can}} be played alone or cooperatively, players {{assume the role of}} Noble Six, a supersoldier engaged in combat with an alien {{collective}} known as the Covenant. The Covenant come in eight distinct varieties with different ranks and classes for each type; for example, Elites are the leaders of a group, while Grunts are less intelligent and only dangerous in large groups. The player is equipped with a recharging energy shield that absorbs damage from weapons, fire and impacts. When the energy shield is depleted, the player loses health. When the player's health reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health is replenished using health packs scattered throughout Reachs levels. The campaign's encounters with enemies are typically large, open spaces with weapons caches, cover from enemy fire and strategic vantage points. <b>New</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Halo series are dogfight sequences set in space.|$|E
5|$|In {{the race}} for city commissioners, each party nominates two {{candidates}} and the top three are elected. The office was a county office, a holdover from the time before consolidation of the townships in Philadelphia County into one city. The most important of the remaining duties of the commissioners in Philadelphia was {{the conduct of the}} city's elections; they also had responsibility for regulating weights and measures. As in the other races, the Democrats triumphed, electing both Maurice S. Osser and Thomas P. McHenry. McHenry was an incumbent who had served as commissioner since 1945, while Osser was <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office, having previously worked as a lawyer and {{as the leader of the}} 16th ward. The Republican spot on the county commission went to Walter I. Davidson, a sales executive.|$|E

5|$|Israel competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. It was the nation's sixteenth {{appearance}} at the Summer Olympics. The Olympic Committee of Israel confirmed a team of 47 athletes, 22 men and 25 women, to compete across 17 sports at the Games. It was the nation's largest ever delegation sent to the Olympics, breaking its previous record of 43 athletes set in 2008. Among the sports represented by its athletes, Israel marked its Olympic debut in golf (<b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2016 Games), mountain biking, and triathlon, {{as well as its}} return to road cycling, taekwondo, weightlifting, and wrestling after long years of absence.

5|$|Jay and Mark Briscoe {{made their}} debuts for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) at Delaware Invasion on January 20, 2001, being {{brought in to}} job {{as part of a}} three-on-one {{handicap}} match against Trent Acid. At the inaugural Best of the Best event, a show somewhat atypical of CZW in that it is a tournament spotlighting athletic junior heavyweight wrestling as opposed to violent hardcore matches, the two advanced past the first round in a three-way match with Nick Mondo where the stipulation was whoever took the fall would be eliminated. They were then matched against each other in the second round, with Jay winning and advancing further. This match was seen by fans as the best of the tournament, and seen in retrospect as having been responsible in large part for helping launch the brothers' careers, as they were <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> independent circuit and very young at the time.|$|E
5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players. However, he disliked the repetition which dragged down their replay value. Hurley found it easy for players to become confused in the game's early stages, since the objectives are unclear. Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity. Chris Carter of Destructoid wrote that the game brought nothing <b>new</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genre, and its quests and features were too similar to typical Ubisoft open-world design.|$|E
