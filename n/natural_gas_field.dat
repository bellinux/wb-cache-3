Important manufacturers include Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and South West Aluminum, Asia's largest aluminum plant. Manufacturing industries are supported by abundant natural resources including large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves amount to approximately 4.8 billion tonnes, while Chuandong <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Field</b> is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270 billion m³ - more than 1/5 of China's total.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield Moors is {{the site}} of a {{depleted}} onshore <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>field</b> located at a depth of 1450 feet (440 metres) below Hatfield Moor. The field was discovered in 1981 and contained about 8.5 billion cubic feet (241 million cubic metres) of gas in two formations Hatfield Moors and Hatfield West. Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc. As the field became depleted plans were made by ScottishPower in 1998 to develop the field for the storage of gas. These facilities became operational in February 2000. Edinburgh Oil and Gas have a 25-year agreement with ScottishPower giving them exclusive rights to inject, store and withdraw gas.|$|E

25|$|A {{natural gas}} {{processing}} facility was formerly located in Pickering.

It {{is located at}} a depth of 5,700ft (1,740m) in Middle Magnesian Limestone. The gas is about 94% methane, 3% inert gas with traces of hydrogen sulphide. Recoverable reserves were initially estimated to be 250billion cubic feet (7billionm3). In an agreement between the Gas Council and Home Oil/Gas Council Exploration provision was to have been made to use the Lockton gas field for the seasonal storage of natural gas.|$|E

500|$|The Larrys Creek {{watershed}} has two {{deposits of}} low volatile bituminous coal along Roaring Run and a small, deep <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>field.</b> A potentially large source {{of natural gas}} is the Marcellus Shale, which lies [...] below the surface here and stretches from New York through Pennsylvania to Ohio and West Virginia. Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian era range from 168 to 516trillion cubic feet (4.76 to 14.6trillionm3), with at least 10 percent considered recoverable. In November 2007, drilling within the Larrys Creek watershed started in Mifflin Township, just west of Salladasburg, with a [...] deep well. A second well was drilled in Mifflin Township in December 2007, and by February 2008 every well drilled in Lycoming County was producing natural gas. The Marcellus Shale requires special techniques to fracture the rock and release the gas, including pumping sand and water into the well, and, in some cases, horizontal drilling.|$|E

2500|$|The Cleveland plant failed on October 20, 1944 {{when the}} {{cylindrical}} tank ruptured spilling thousands {{of gallons of}} LNG over the plant and nearby neighborhood. The gas evaporated and caught fire, which caused 130 fatalities. The fire delayed further implementation of LNG facilities for several years. However, over the next 15 years new research on low-temperature alloys, and better insulation materials, {{set the stage for}} a revival of the industry. It restarted in 1959 when a U.S. World War II Liberty ship, the Methane Pioneer, converted to carry LNG, made a delivery of LNG from the U.S. Gulf coast to energy starved Great Britain. In June 1964, the world's first purpose-built LNG carrier, the [...] "Methane Princess" [...] entered service. Soon after that a large <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>field</b> was discovered in Algeria. International trade in LNG quickly followed as LNG was shipped to France and Great Britain from the Algerian fields. One more important attribute of LNG had now been exploited. Once natural gas was liquefied it could not only be stored more easily, but it could be transported. Thus energy could now be shipped over the oceans via LNG the same way it was shipped by oil.|$|E

Chuandong <b>Natural</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Field</b> is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270billion m3 – more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.|$|E
