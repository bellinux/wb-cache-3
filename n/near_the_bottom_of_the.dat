He was entirely on his own; no Australian support staff were in attendance, even though the AOF officially sanctioned Kennedy's entry.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built.

5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geyser {{rise to a}} point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise {{to the top of the}} column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final standings, exceeded expectations, {{with the latter}} eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be more exciting than any traditional sporting match he had ever seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved {{the same level of}} respect of traditional sports.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, Bruce {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension. A run of poor form left Hull <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table going into {{the final game of}} the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand any chance of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Bouchard's arrival to the Montreal Canadiens the club had not won the {{championship}} for 10 years and attendance at the Forum was very low, often less than 3,000 a game, and {{there was talk of}} folding the franchise. A few years earlier, in 1935, Canadien owners had seriously considered an offer to sell the team to be moved to Cleveland. After finishing last or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league for several years, apathy of the fans was matched by the players themselves who had accepted losing as way of hockey life. In his first training camp, he showcased his physical play by body-checking players, including veterans, with abandon. When the season started other teams discovered that with Bouchard in the lineup they could no longer push Canadien players around. Bouchard's presence reinvigorated the Canadiens and he is credited with playing an important part in keeping the franchise from leaving Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screen {{may result in a}} jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Grays Athletic in 2002 and remained in charge until 2006 {{when he took}} over as manager of Stevenage Borough. He led Grays to victory in the Final of the FA Trophy in 2005 and 2006, and repeated the feat with Stevenage in 2007. In November 2007, he became manager of a Football League team for the first time {{when he took over}} at one of his former clubs, Gillingham, but he was unable to prevent the club's relegation from League One {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season. He led Gillingham back into League One the following season via the League Two play-off Final, but his contract was terminated after the team were relegated back to League Two the following season. On 1 June 2010, Stimson {{was appointed}} as the new manager of League Two club Barnet, but he was sacked on New Year's Day 2011 with the club <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. He later had a spell as manager with Conference club Kettering Town.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{moved to}} play for Horsforth Hall Park in 1924, where his batting became more {{productive}} than his bowling. By 1926, when he scored a total of 488runs and took 62wickets to win the Yorkshire Council League prize for best junior bowler, his all-round potential secured a second trial at Yorkshire. Receiving coaching from Hirst, Verity played several matches for the Yorkshire Colts. He was given little bowling to do, suggesting that he was chosen more for his batting at this stage, and was <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team's bowling averages. Yorkshire did not allocate him to a local club, their practice towards promising cricketers at the time. Hirst was nevertheless impressed by Verity and recommended him to Accrington Cricket Club, a team in the Lancashire League looking for a professional cricketer. After a trial, Verity signed a contract in September 1926.|$|E
5|$|York {{appointed}} former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness in February 1975, and {{he helped}} them stay in the Second Division in 1974–75. However, York faced successive relegations under McGuinness, when finishing 21st in 1975–76 {{and bottom of the}} Third Division in 1976–77. He was dismissed in October 1977, with York 22nd in the Fourth Division, and was succeeded by former Charlton Athletic player Charlie Wright in November. He could not prevent a re-election bid after 1977–78, before leading York to 10th place the following season. Wright was dismissed in March 1980 with the team <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table, and under caretaker manager Barry Lyons York finished 17th in 1979–80. He was appointed permanently in May 1980, and York finished bottom of the table in his first full season in charge. York continued to struggle and Lyons was dismissed in December 1981; Kevin Randall and Barry Swallow each had spells in caretaker charge, before York finished 17th in 1981–82.|$|E

5|$|A {{surge in}} {{offensive}} production from Giordano and fellow defencemen T. J. Brodie and Dennis Wideman {{resulted in the}} Flames {{being one of the}} NHL's biggest surprises early in the 2014–15 season. Predicted to finish <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standings before the season, the Flames instead began December with one of the best records in the league, in large part due to the play of Giordano, who led all NHL defencemen with 25 points, four better than Brodie. His plus-minus of +14 ranked him second in the league. The NHL recognized Giordano's early season play by naming him its First Star of the month of November. He was subsequently named as the Flames' representative at the 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Giordano played his 500th career game on February 2, 2015, in a victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He set a personal best by scoring his 48th point of the season in a 3–1 win over the New Jersey Devils on February 25, but also suffered an injury in the game. The Flames announced one week later that he required surgery for a completely torn biceps tendon; the estimated recovery time of four to five months meant that his season was over.|$|E
5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm {{in the first half of}} the actinide series.|$|E
5|$|As the 2011–12 season began, many hockey {{writers and}} {{commentators}} {{were convinced that}} the Senators would finish at or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHL standings. In the midst of rebuilding, the Ottawa lineup contained many rookies and inexperienced players. The team struggled out of the gate, losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row. In December 2011, the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for David Rundblad and a draft pick. The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All-Star Game. For {{the first time in}} Senators' history, the All-Star Game was held in Ottawa, and it was considered a great success. Five Senators were voted in or named to the event, including Daniel Alfredsson, who was named captain of one team. The team continued its playoff push after the break. After starting goalie Craig Anderson injured his hand in a kitchen accident at home, the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues. While Anderson recovered, the team continued its solid play. On April 1, 2012, the Senators defeated the New York Islanders 5–1, officially ensuring a playoff position. The team finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, drawing a first round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers. Ultimately, Ottawa lost the series in seven games.|$|E
