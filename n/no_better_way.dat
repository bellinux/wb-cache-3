As it happened, in the fulness of time our {{distinguished}} apostles of Efficiency came into supreme power, with {{a share in the}} finest field for efficient diplomacy and an armed struggle, that could have been imagined. Unhappily they broke down, or thought they had (1915), and could discover <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> out of their scrape than to seek deliverance (not without a trace of arbitrary proscription) from the opposing party that counted Liberalism, old or new, for dangerous and deluding moonshine.|$|E
500|$|In The Guardian, Nicholas Lezard {{praised the}} idea behind the concert: [...] "One can imagine <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to get {{children}} interested in classical music than by plonking them {{down in front of}} an orchestra belting out music from Doctor Who." [...] Lezard noted that the non-Doctor Who music [...] "was received with baffled tolerance"; he said that the BBC Philharmonic played [...] "Montagues and Capulets" [...] "crisply and excitingly", but felt that [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] "tends to sound a little underpowered unless played by two orchestras at once". Lezard called Gold's work [...] "a little derivative" [...] but [...] "perfectly suited to the task"; however, he complained that Gold's orchestration of the Doctor Who theme [...] "drowned" [...] Delia Derbyshire's original arrangement. He wrote that [...] "the hundred-strong choir and soloist Melanie Pappenheim performed flawlessly," [...] and also praised the technical execution of the complex programme.|$|E
500|$|While Mr. Eko {{was created}} as a more passive character, the idea changed when the {{producers}} first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: [...] "once they saw me on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't {{going to be just}} a passive priest". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named [...] "Emeka", and later [...] "Omecca", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to [...] "Eko", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding [...] "Mr." [...] in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was [...] "the silliest thing in the world", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there [...] "was something really cool about it". The character first appeared in [...] "Adrift", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to [...] "knock those three guys out". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt [...] "there's <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to make an entrance". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje.|$|E

[...] Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, there is <b>no</b> <b>better</b> <b>way</b> to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.|$|E

Review made for the course of "Mexican Bibliography" at the Undergraduate Program in Library Science at the School of Philosophy and Letters, Nuevo Leon Autonomous University, Mexico, the lecturer of the course was Ms. Maria del Rosario Banda Martinez.

Although this is not either a comprehensive review, since as long as I carried out the review it became more difficult to include all the works cited by its author; not to mention the footnotes which I did not consider any.

The European Union proposed the idea to UEFA as a way of recognising the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which was signed on 25 March 1957 and laid the foundations for a united Europe and the European Union itself. A football match was chosen as the showpiece event as the way football brings people of all different nationalities together was viewed as a symbolic representation of how Europe was brought together politically. José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said, [...] "The best of European football will be on show in Manchester next March to mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Union.

His views evolved from a strict English Quaker missionary’s view to a more multicultural approach. One of his biographers wrote that he was [...] "a man large of body and mind". He summarised his own evolution as follows: [...] "By processes too numerous and diverse even to summarize, I have reached a position which may be stated {{in a general way}} somewhat like this: [...] "I believe that God's best for another may be so different from my experience and way of living as to be actually impossible for me. I recognize a change to have taken place in myself, from a certain assumption that mine was really the <b>better</b> <b>way,</b> to a very complete recognition that there is <b>no</b> one <b>better</b> <b>way</b> and that God needs all kinds of people and ways of living through which to manifest Himself in the World. This has seemed to carry with it two conclusions which greatly affect conduct. One is that I really find myself wanting to learn from people whom I previously would have regarded as fit objects for my 'missionary zeal'. To discover another way in which God is operating - along lines it may be distasteful or dangerous to me - is {{a large part of the}} fun of living. The second direction in which conduct is influenced is the deliberate attempt to share the life and interests of others who are not in my circle ... for in such sharing I can most deeply understand the other's life and through that reach, maybe, fresh truths about God." ...|$|R
