40|$|Subthalamic nucleus neurons exhibit reverse spike {{frequency}} adaptation. This occurs only at firing {{rates of}} 20 - 50 spikes/sec and higher. Over this same frequency range, {{there is an}} increase in the steady state frequency/intensity (F/I) curve’s slope (the secondary range). Specific blockade of HVA calcium currents reduced the F/I curve slope and reverse adaptation. Blockade of calcium-dependent potassium current enhanced secondary range firing. A simple model that exhibited these properties used spike-triggered conductances similar to those in subthalamic neurons. It showed: 1. <b>Non-accumulating</b> spike afterhyperpolarizations produce positively accelerating F/I curves and spike frequency adaptation that is complete after the second spike. 2. Combinations of accumulating after-currents result in a linear F/I curve, whose slope depends upon the relative contributions of inward and outward currents. Spike frequency adaptation can be gradual. 3. With both accumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> after-currents, primary and secondary ranges will be present in the F/I curve. The slope of the primary range is determined by the <b>non-accumulating</b> conductance; the accumulating conductances govern the secondary range. The transition is determined by the relative strengths of accumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> currents...|$|E
40|$|The cerrado's flora {{comprises}} aluminum-(Al) accumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> plants, which coexist on acidic and Al-rich soils {{with low}} fertility. Despite their existence, the ecological importance or biological strategies of these functional {{groups have been}} little explored. We evaluated the leaf flushing patterns of both groups throughout a year; leaf concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Al, total flavonoids and polyphenols; {{as well as the}} specific leaf area (SLA) on young and mature leaves within and between the groups. In Al-accumulating plants, leaf flushed throughout the year, mainly in May and September; for <b>non-accumulating</b> plants, leaf flushing peaked at the dry-wet seasons transition. However, these behaviors could not be associated with strategies for building up concentrations of defense compounds in leaves of any functional groups. Al-accumulating plants showed low leaf nutrient concentrations, while <b>non-accumulating</b> plants accumulated more macronutrients and produced leaves with high SLA since the juvenile leaf phase. This demonstrates that the increase in SLA is slower in Al-accumulating plants that are likely to achieve SLA values comparable {{to the rest of the}} plant community only in the wet season, when sunlight capture is important for the growth of new branches...|$|E

Adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas carry activating mutations in exon 3 of the β-catenin gene, which results in a distinct pattern of nuclear β-catenin accumulation in up to 95 % of respective tumour specimens. To better characterise the impact of nuclear β-catenin aggregation in these neoplasms, we systematically examined epithelial differentiation and cell cycle-associated molecules in accumulating compared to <b>non-accumulating</b> tumour cell clusters using a cohort of 65 adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas. Monoclonal antibodies directed against cytokeratins 5 / 6 (CK 5 / 6) were utilised to differentiate squamous from simple epithelium, the latter being identified by immunoreactivity for cytokeratins 8 and 18 (CK 8 /CK 18). Intriguingly, nuclear β-catenin accumulation in whorl-like tumour cell clusters was always associated with a distinct CK 8 and CK 18 immunoreactivity, whereas surrounding <b>non-accumulating</b> tumour cells showed exclusively squamous differentiation indicated by CK 5 / 6 expression. In addition, a low proliferation activity combined with an increased expression of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1, a key control protein of the cell cycle, was observed in β-catenin accumulating cells.

40|$|Metal hyperaccumulation, {{in which}} plants store {{exceptional}} concentrations of metals in their shoots, {{is an unusual}} trait whose evolutionary and ecological significance has prompted extensive debate. Hyperaccumulation plants are usually found on metalliferous soils, {{and it has been}} proposed that hyperaccumulation provides a defense against herbivores and pathogens, an idea termed the 'elemental defense' hypothesis. We have investigated this hypothesis using the crucifer Thlaspi caerulescens, a hyperaccumulator of zinc, nickel, and cadmium, and the baterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm). Using leaf innoculation assays, we have shown that hyperaccumulation of any of the three metals inhibits growth of Psm in planta. Metal concentrations in the bulk leaf and in the apoplast, through which the pathogen invades the leaf, were shown to be sufficient to account for the defensive effect by comparison with in vitro dose-response curves. Further, mutants of Psm with increased and decreased zinc tolerance created by transposon insertion had either enhanced or reduced ability, respectively, to grow in high-zinc plants, indicating that the metal affects the pathogen directly. Finally, we have shown that bacteria naturally colonizing T. caerulescens leaves at the site of a former lead-zinc mine have high zinc tolerance compared with bacteria isolated from <b>non-accumulating</b> plants, suggesting local adaptation to high metal. These results demonstrate that the disease resistance observed in metal-exposed T. caerulescens can be attributed to a direct effect of metal hyperaccumulation, which may thus be functionally analogous to the resistance conferred by antimicrobial metabolites in <b>non-accumulating</b> plants...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to empirically examine the aviation-led growth {{hypothesis}} for the Czech Republic by testing causality between aviation and economic growth. We resort to econometric tests such as unit root tests and test of cointegration purposed by Johansen (1988). Fully Modified OLS, Dynamic OLS and Conical Cointegration Regression are used to estimate the cointegration equation for time span of 42 years from 1970 to 2012. Empirical results reveal the existence of cointegration between aviation demand and economic growth. Graphic methods such as Cholesky impulse response function (both accumulated and <b>non-accumulated)</b> and variance decomposition have also been applied to render the analysis rigorous. The positive contribution of aviation demand to economic growth is similar in all three estimation techniques of cointegration equation. Finally, Granger causality test is also applied to find the direction of causal relationship. Findings help in lime-lighting the importance of aviation industry in economic growth for a developing country like the Czech Republic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cryptographic {{accumulators}} {{allow to}} accumulate a finite set of val-ues {{into a single}} succinct accumulator. For every accumulated value, one can efficiently compute a witness, which certifies its membership in the accumu-lator. However, it is computationally infeasible to find a witness for any <b>non-accumulated</b> value. Since their introduction, various accumulator schemes for numerous practical applications and with different features have been proposed. Unfortunately, to date there is no unifying model capturing all existing features. Such a model can {{turn out to be}} valuable as it allows to use accumulators in a black-box fashion. To this end, we propose a unified formal model for (randomized) cryptographic accumulators which covers static and dynamic accumulators, their universal fea-tures and includes the notions of undeniability and indistinguishability. Addi-tionally, we provide an exhaustive classification of all existing schemes. In doing so, it turns out that most accumulators are distinguishable. Fortunately, a sim-ple, light-weight generic transformation allows to make many existing dynamic accumulator schemes indistinguishable. As this transformation, however, comes at the cost of reduced collision freeness, we additionally propose the first indistin-guishable scheme that does not suffer from this shortcoming. Finally, we employ our unified model for presenting a black-box construction of commitments from indistinguishable accumulators as well as a black-box construction of indistin-guishable, undeniable universal accumulators from zero-knowledge sets. Latter yields the first universal accumulator construction that provides indistinguisha-bility. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{manipulator}} {{is based}} on serial design that has the advantages of large workspace and simple analysis, but suffers from many drawbacks such as low payload, low acceleration, low speed, high inertial, and accumulated error. The other kind of manipulators {{is based on}} parallel mechanisms which {{are expected to have}} those supplementary features: high payload, high acceleration, high speed, high rigidity (stiffness), low inertial, and <b>non-accumulated</b> error. These have potential to find important applications in areas like machining and automation in the semiconductor and electronic assembly industry. However, the analysis of the parallel manipulator is complicated {{because of the presence of}} constraints, and various singularities. As a result, so far, the available parallel platforms are not very popular and, indeed, have failed to outperform their serial counterparts impressively. To solve the problems, in this research, we address several fundamental issues in the design and analysis of parallel manipulators. We use standard notions from differential geometry to study various spaces and the mapping involved. A general mathematical framework is established. We clarify concepts of singularities, study their effects to stiffness, dynamics and control, and propose methods to characterize and overcome thern. We study and compare various dynamics formulations for parallel manipulators. Control algorithms for serial manipulators are successfully extended to parallel manipulators. For verification and comparisons, we apply our theory to a number of practical platforms in our lab for prototyping and experiments. In the setting of Riemannian Geometry, we propose the Generalized Newton's Law, which unifies different dynamics formulations for parallel manipulators. The control problem is naturally decomposed into the trajectory and constraint force control problems. Algorithms for both trajectory and constraint force control are devised. Finally we extend and apply the theory to the analysis of multifingered hand...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the automation of a fully electrochemical system for preconcentration, cleanup, separation and detection, comprising the hyphenation of {{a thin layer}} electrochemical flow cell with CE coupled with contactless conductivity detection (CE-C(4) D). Traces of heavy metal ions were extracted from the pulsed-flowing sample and accumulated on a glassy carbon working electrode by electroreduction for some minutes. Anodic stripping of the accumulated metals was synchronized with hydrodynamic injection into the capillary. The effect of {{the angle of the}} slant polished tip of the CE capillary and its orientation against the working electrode in the electrochemical preconcentration (EPC) flow cell and of the accumulation time were studied, aiming at maximum CE-C(4) D signal enhancement. After 6 min of EPC, enhancement factors close to 50 times were obtained for thallium, lead, cadmium and copper ions, and about 16 for zinc ions. Limits of detection below 25 nmol/L were estimated for all target analytes but zinc. A second separation dimension was added to the CE separation capabilities by staircase scanning of the potentiostatic deposition and/or stripping potentials of metal ions, as implemented with the EPC-CE-C(4) D flow system. A matrix exchange between the deposition and stripping steps, highly valuable for sample cleanup, can be straightforwardly programmed with the multi-pumping flow management system. The automated simultaneous determination of the traces of five accumulable heavy metals together with four <b>non-accumulated</b> alkaline and alkaline earth metals in a single run was demonstrated, to highlight the potentiality of the system.

The character is strongly present in nearly all members of the Memecylaceae and in most primitive taxa of the Melastomataceae, while <b>non-accumulating</b> taxa are widespread in the more derived tribes of the Melastomataceae. The variable distribution of Al accumulation in advanced clades of the latter family is probably associated with the tendency to herbaceousness, although it is unclear whether the more herbaceous representatives have developed more specialized Al-response mechanisms that may exclude high Al levels from the shoot. It is hypothesized that Al accumulation is symplesiomorphic for Melastomataceae and Memecylaceae, and that the feature characterizes the most primitive families in the Myrtales. Indeed, Al accumulation is also characteristic of Crpteroniaceae, Rhynchocalycaceae and Vochysiaceae.

The time concept becomes more important forhealth care management, since it is very sensitive in healt care services. In this direction, the aim of the planned study is that determine the attitude of the directors in the charge of hospitals. On theother hand study aimed to seek which variables affects the time management attitudes of hospital directors. The universe of the study consists of 135 managers that work in training and research hospitals in Izmir City. Not only asample group but entire universe is included by the study. The study reached 113 (83, 7 %) people of the 135 in the universe. Outof 22 managers have not included because of assignment, long term health report/being on holiday and rejecting to attend thestudy. There are seven training and research hospitals in the city. In study group, there are 27 managers (20 %) in Atatürk Trainingand Research Hospital, 27 managers (20 %) in Tepecik Training and Research Hospital, 21 managers (15 %) in Bozyaka Trainingand Research Hospital, 21 managers (15 %) in Dr. Suat Seren Chest Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and ResearchHospital, 19 managers (14 %) in Dr. Behçet Uz Pediatric Diseases and Surgery Training and Research Hospital, 12 managers (9 %) in Ege Gynecology and Maternity Training and Research Hospital, 9 managers (7 %) in Izmir Dentistry Training Hospitals. Theuniverse of study consists of 7 (5 %) head physician, 47 (35 %) vice-head physician, 7 (5 %) hospital director, 42 (31 %) vice-directorof hospital, 7 (5 %) head nurse and vice-head nurse, 25 (19 %). Question sheet method is used to gathering data for the study. The questions are formed in 2 main parts. In first main part ofthe question sheet, there are questions that identify the demographic characteristic of managers relating the age, gender, maritalstatus, educational status, job and length of employment. There are questions that determine the attitude and behavior about thetime management in the second main part. These question sheets include questions that determine the time management attitudesand they are developed by Britton and Tesser, translated to Turkish as “Time Management Questionnaire” by Alay andKoçak(2002). Question sheet is a scale for Turkey (Tektaş and Tektaş 2010; Başak et al. 2008). Time management question sheet includes 27 questions that consist of 3 sub-sections. First one includes 16 questions about long term and short term scheduling; secondone includes 7 questions about time attitudes, and the third one includes 4 questions about time spending. The questions thatdeveloped as attitude sentences evaluated by five parted Likert scale. SPSS 17. 0 package statistic program used for analysis. First of all, reliability analysis applied to time management questionsheet and cronbach’s alpha reliability ratio of 27 terms that in scale was found as 0, 81. Distributions, averages and standarddeviation calculations evaluated for identification of the study group. Some tests and analysis applied to determine which variableshave affects on attitude to time management: t-test for analytical univariate analysis, variance analysis for controlling themultivariate, correlation (Pearson) analysis for association were used statistically. Significance level of examined relation wasaccepted as p< 0. 05. The study reached 113 (83, 7 %) hospital managers of the 135 in the city. Fifty four (47, 8 %) of the managers are female; 59 (52. 2 %) of the managers are male. Five (4, 4 %) of the participants are head physician, 44 (38, 9 %) of the participants are viceheadphysician, 4 (3, 5 %) of the participants are hospital director, 34 (30, 1 %) of the universe are vice-director, 5 (4, 4 %) of theparticipants are head nurse and 21 (18, 6 %) of the participants are vice-head nurse. The values related with the time management attitude of hospital managers:were as follows; scheduling value was 3. 91 ± 0. 50,time attitude value was 3. 78 ± 0. 47 and time spending attitude value was 4. 04 ± 0. 69. These results showed that attitude, ofmanagers in the studied training and research hospitals, was positive about time management. The time spending, includingthequestions about wasting time, had the highest value. This result showed that hospital managers were more delicate about wastingtime. Gender of the participant was effective about time management (p< 0, 05). Almost half of the participants (47, 8 %) werefemale. Female managers had more score than male managers. This result showed that female hospital managers had morepositive attitude about wasting time than male ones. According to Erdem’s (1997) study that analyzes the time managementattitude and behavior of headphysician, vice-headphysician, hospital director, vice-director of hospital, head nurse and vice-headnurse; female managers manage the time better than male ones. The other research has a similar result that female students havemore positive attitude than male students about time management (Tektaş and Tektaş 2010 : 227). Results are similar with data ofboth of the researches. The results of study showed that education level of hospital managers was not effective on time management attitude. Samestudy (Örücü et al. 2007) states that knowledge, skill and experience; that are varied according to education level; can bedeterministic factors about efficient time management. Efficient time management levels vary according to education level. Differences among the studies can be explained with relatively long average length of employment (22. 84 ± 8. 6 years) of hospitalmanagers. At the same time, high education level of hospital managers and work experience in hospital before being manager iseffective on this differentiation. Results showed that there was no influence of the manager’s job on time management. The study made by Karagöz showsthat there is no difference between academic and executive jobs in terms of personal arrangement of efficient timemanagement. (Karagöz et al. 2010 : 104). This study also showed that {{there was no difference between}} the age of hospital managers and time management attitudes. The study showed that there was a relation between the age of pharmacists and attitude of time management. According to thatfinding, pharmacist over age of 45, use the time more efficient than 25 - 34 age group (Öncel et al. 2005 : 205). In this condition it isimportant and useful to zoom the our study findings. This study showed that the time management attitudes were positive andthe age average of the hospital managers was 45. 57 ± 8. 9. That age average was more than the average (25 - 34) that cause thedifferentiation in the other study. This situation can be explained as time management attitudes were similar in the same agegroups. There is no meaningful difference between managers teachers, that have more experience because of rising working timethanks to the time management attitudes, and the others (Kocabas and Erdem 2003 : 200). Also, there is no meaningful differenceamong the managers according to their seniority about time management (Yavuz and Sünbül 2004 : 377). Similarly, this studyshows that there is no difference between time management attitude and length of employment. This result can be explained asexperience of managers is not effective on time management attitudes. As a result; as other production factors, time is unique and valuable factor that is in the responsibility of hospital managers. There are two sides of importance for this factor in health services; hospitals and patients. The health managers, regarding thesensivity of health service against the time, should give more importance to time management that has a role for the success inlong term and broaden the manager’s horizon...|$|R

With {{the purpose}} of knowing the strategiesof tolerance of two phosphorus-accumulating species (Neea macrophylla and Cecropia palmate) and a <b>non-accumulating</b> species(Casearia arborea) to phosphorus-deficient soils, we characterized the rhizosphere of these species using a multivariate analysis andcorrelation matrices {{in relation to the}} concentrations of organic phosphorus, available phosphorus, soil organic carbon, organic carbonfrom microbial biomass, acid phosphatase enzyme activity, and root infection by mycorrhizal fungi. Materials and methods. Theresearch was carried out in the Igarapé-Açú town, state of Pará, Brazil in secondary forests with five years of regeneration, where theparameters above mentioned were monitored. Results. Results did not reveal significant differences between the species depending onthe characteristics of the soil next to the rhizospheres, suggesting homogeneous conditions. The enzymatic activity was slightly higherin the species with less potential in accumulating P (Casearia arborea) suggesting that efficiency in P use is not determined by theenzymatic activity. Conclusions. Neea macrophylla presented a slightly higher number of mycorrhizal root infections in comparisonto the other species, indicating that this could be a tolerance strategy in those environments, while in Cecropia palmata and Caseariaarborea it seems that enzymatic activity is the strategy employed...|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of {{polyhydroxybutyrate}} (PHB) {{seems to}} be a common metabolic strategy adopted by many bacteria to cope with cold environments. This work aimed at evaluating and understanding the cryoprotective effect of PHB. At first a monomer of PHB, 3 -hydroxybutyrate, was identified as a potent cryoprotectant capable of protecting model enzyme (lipase), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacterial cells (Cupriavidus necator) against the adverse effects of freezing-thawing cycles. Further, the viability of the frozen-thawed PHB accumulating strain of C. necator was compared to that of the PHB <b>non-accumulating</b> mutant. The presence of PHB granules in cells was revealed to be a significant advantage during freezing. This might be attributed to the higher intracellular level of 3 -hydroxybutyrate in PHB accumulating cells (due to the action of parallel PHB synthesis and degradation, the so-called PHB cycle), but the cryoprotective effect of PHB granules {{seems to be}} more complex. Since intracellular PHB granules retain highly flexible properties even at extremely low temperatures (observed by cryo-SEM), it can be expected that PHB granules protect cells against injury from extracellular ice. Finally, thermal analysis indicates that PHB-containing cells exhibit a higher rate of transmembrane water transport, which protects cells against the formation of intracellular ice which usually has fatal consequences...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I link surplus food with the {{politics}} of capitalist production and consumption in order to shed some useful light on the strange case of food not being food once it has been discarded but not thrown away. I develop an analysis of waste policy as a dimension of capitalist surplus management (after Sweezy, 1962) by reconfiguring Claus Offe’s (1984) essay on the state and social policy and construe waste policy as effecting a ‘lasting transformation’ of <b>non-accumulating</b> capital into accumulating capital. My intention {{is to provide a}} sketch of the labyrinthine semantic and political structures that are emerging around waste, in general, and waste food, in particular. I show that transforming waste food into capitalist surplus is a multi-layered and multi-stranded endeavour that is embedded in larger political, economic and cultural arrangements and cosmologies. The article explores the transformation of waste into surplus by exploring, first, waste as an imaginary construct; second, the strange case of discarded food not being discarded (and not being food, either); third, the convoluted cosmology of European waste policy; and, fourth, aspects of political sociology which help to reveal the status of waste as a source of capital accumulation. I conclude by proposing a sociological account of food waste that situates the critique of excess not in the ignorant, sordid voraciousness of individual citizens but in the structures and institutions of capitalist accumulation...|$|E
40|$|Mistletoes offer {{a unique}} model to study {{interactions}} among Al and nutrients in vascular plants, because they grow and reproduce on hosts with distinct Al uptake strategies. We investigated Al distribution and nutrient relations of mistletoes on Al-accumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> hosts. We hypothesised that mistletoes would exhibit similar leaf nutrient and Al concentrations as their host plants, but a strong compartmentalisation of Al when growing on Al-accumulators. We measured concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn in leaves and Al in leaves, seeds and branches of Phthirusa ovata and Psittacanthus robustus infecting Miconia albicans, an Al-accumulator, and Ph. ovata infecting Byrsonima verbascifolia, a non-Al-accumulator. High leaf concentrations of Al in Ph. ovata only occurred while parasitizing the Al-accumulating host; {{there was no}} accumulation in branches or seeds. In P. robustus, large concentrations of Al were found in leaves, branches and seeds. Mistletoe seed viability and leaf nutrient concentrations were not affected by Al accumulation. Passive uptake of Al, Ca, Mg, Mn and Cu in mistletoes was evidenced by significant correlations between mistletoes and host leaf concentrations, but not of N, P and K. Al was retranslocated to different plant organs in P. robustus, whereas it was mostly restricted to leaves in Ph. ovata. We suggest that Al might have some specific function in P. robustus, which only parasitizes Al-accumulator hosts, while the host generalist Ph. ovata {{can be considered a}} facultative Al-accumulator. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|For the {{successful}} {{development of a}} hyperaccumulating plant sufficient for use in phytoremediation strategies, {{a thorough understanding of}} the mechanism of hyperaccumulation is required. A proteomic survey of the response of plants to metal exposure is a step towards this understanding. The frd 3 - 3 metal accumulating mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana and its <b>non-accumulating</b> wildtype parental ecotype, Columbia, were grown hydroponically in growth chamber experiments and exposed to copper in the growth medium. The responses of the global and copper-targeted proteomes were examined both spatially and temporally. Exposure to copper caused a general increase in protein abundance, however, a prolonged exposure to copper that approached toxicity caused a decrease in protein abundance. The protein species differed between the roots of the two genotypes, with more defense- and stress-related proteins, and fewer transport and storage proteins identified in the mutant when compared to the wildtype. Proteomic evidence suggests that in the mutant the uptake and transport of copper ions to the aerial tissues is regulated. The protein expression patterns over time demonstrate a constitutive expression of defense- and stress-related proteins in the mutant, whereas the wildtype expression was one of induction. The constitutive expression of key defense proteins suggests a “state-of-readiness” for metal exposure in the mutant. The plant response to reactive oxygen species, as a consequence of copper exposure, is important in the overall metal accumulation mechanism. A suppression of the oxidative burst produced upon exposure to heavy metals is suggested by the proteomic evidence...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainability}} is often invoked but means very {{different things to}} different people and for different academic disciplines. For corporate economists, for example, it means sustained economic growth that will yield ongoing profits. For ecologists it involves the maintenance of natural systems—wetlands, forests, wilderness, air and water quality. For environmentalists it means using only renewable resources and generating low or <b>non-accumulating</b> levels of pollution (Pearce, Markandya and Barbier 1990). Many concerned with environmental economics have noted the intrinsic contradictions between the linear expansionism of neoliberal economics and long-term sustainability (e. g. Daly and Cobb 1989; Henderson 1991; O’Connor 1994). Maria Mies (1993, 252) argues that for countries of the global South to follow the development model of the industrial North there would need to be two more worlds: one for the necessary natural resources and the other for the waste. A more sustainable future for both the global North and South means rethinking current cultural and economic systems and priorities, and emphasizing ecologically sound production. Vandana Shiva (2005) calls this process “earth democracy”. It implies: • funding available for development that is culturally appropriate, economically viable and ecologically sound; • reduction of poor countries ’ foreign debt; • local control over transnational corporations; • valuing unpaid domestic and caring work, often the responsibility of women and a key aspect of sustaining home and community life; and • changing mainstream definitions of wealth that emphasize materialism and consumerism...|$|E
40|$|Metal hyperaccumulation is an {{uncommon}} but highly distinctive adaptation found in certain plants that can grow on metalliferous soils. Here we review {{what is known}} about evolution of metal hyperaccumulation in plants and describe a population-genetic analysis of the Alyssum serpyllifolium (Brassicaceae) species complex, which includes populations of nickel-hyperaccumulating as well as <b>non-accumulating</b> plants growing on serpentine (S) and non-serpentine (NS) soils, respectively. To test whether the S and NS populations belong to the same or separate closely related species, we analysed genetic variation within and between four S and four NS populations from across the Iberian peninsula. Based on microsatellites, genetic variation was similar in S and NS populations (average Ho = 0. 48). The populations were significantly differentiated from each other (overall FST = 0. 23), and the degree of differentiation between S and NS populations was similar to that within these two groups. However, high S versus NS differentiation was observed in DNA polymorphism of two genes putatively involved in adaptation to serpentine environments, IREG 1 and NRAMP 4, while no such differentiation was found in a gene (ASIL 1) not expected to play a specific role in ecological adaptation in A. serpyllifolium. These results indicate that S and NS populations belong to the same species and that nickel hyperaccumulation in A. serpyllifolium appears to represent a case of adaptation to growth on serpentine soils. Further functional and evolutionary genetic work in this system has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the evolution of metal hyperaccumulation in plants...|$|E
40|$|Certain species {{belonging}} to the Astragalus genus (Fabaceae) have the extraordinary ability to hyperaccumulate up to 0. 6 % of their shoot dry weight as selenium (Se). Given that the biochemical properties of Se parallel those of sulfur (S), we probed enzymes involved in Se/S metabolism in these plants and identified metabolic factors that influence their ability to hyperaccumulate Se. We demonstrate that Se hyperaccumulation in Astragalus species is linked with over production of S-methylcysteine (MeCys) Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys) through elevation of selenocysteine methyltransferase (SMT) activity, and we show that this unique enzyme is structurally and functionally related to enzymes that belong {{to the family of}} homocysteine methyltransferases. Furthermore, key S assimilatory enzymes ATP sulfurylase (APS) and APS reductase (APR) were found to be major contributors to selenate reduction in planta. However, total enzymatic capacities of these key enzymes are not altered in Se hyperaccumulators compared to non-accumulators. We conclude that Se hyperaccumulation in Astragalus is not driven by an overall increase in the total capacity of these Se/S assimilatory enzymes, but rather by an increased Se flux through the S/Se assimilatory pathway, generated by the SMT-dependent production of the sink metabolites MeCys or MeSeCys. Consistent with this model, the hyperaccumulator SMT enzyme was found to be localized in the chloroplast, the major organelle associated with S/Se reduction. ^ Intriguingly, both Se hyperaccumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> Astragalus species were found to produce an SMT-like enzyme. The primary structure of these SMT enzymes are very similar, however they do contain conserved amino acid residues {{that can be used to}} classify the SMTs from hyperaccumulator and non-accumulator species. Enzymatic analysis of both cell-free extracts and recombinant enzymes revealed that the SMT enzyme from the non-accumulators has a very low specific activity for methylating selenocysteine and cysteine, explaining their inability to synthesize either MeCys or MeSeCys. ...|$|E

To test for the general assumption of Al toxicity, Al, Ca, and Mg concentrations in precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, organic layer leachate, mineral soil solutions, stream water, and the leaves of 17 native tree species were analyzed. We calculated Al fluxes and modeled Al speciation in the litter leachate and mineral soil solutions. We assessed potential Al toxicity based on soil base saturation, Al concentrations, Ca:Al and Mg:Al molar ratios and Al speciation in soil solution as well as Al concentrations and Ca:Al and Mg:Al molar ratios in tree leaves. High Al fluxes in litterfall (8. 77 ± 1. 3 to 14. 2 ± 1. 9 kg ha− 1 yr− 1, mean ± SE) indicated a high Al circulation through the ecosystem. The fraction of exchangeable and potentially plant-available Al in mineral soils was high, being a likely reason for a low root length density in the mineral soil. However, Al concentrations in all solutions were consistently below critical values and Ca:Al molar and the Ca 2 +:Alinorganic molar ratios in the organic layer leachate and soil solutions were above 1, the suggested threshold for Al toxicity. Except for two Al-accumulating and one <b>non-accumulating</b> tree species, the Ca:Al molar ratios in tree leaves were above the Al toxicity threshold of 12. 5. Our results demonstrate high Al cycling through the vegetation {{partly because of the}} presence of some Al accumulator plants. However, there was little indication of an Al toxicity risk in soil and of acute Al toxicity in plants likely reflecting that tree species are well adapted to the environmental conditions at our study site and thus hardly prone to Al toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Heavy metal (HM) {{accumulator}} plants {{possess the}} ability to actively hyperaccumulate and detoxify exceptionally high concentrations of metals in their aboveground tissues, without exhibiting any apparent signs of toxicity. Despite nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator plants representing {{the largest percentage of}} known metal accumulator taxa (over 75 %), the underlying genetic and molecular basis of Ni accumulation remains unclear. A prominent difficulty in understanding Ni hyperaccumulation has been the severe lack of intraspecific variation in the trait. Hence, the study of a single species exhibiting a significant degree of variation is highly desirable. as it avoids the use of inter-species comparative studies mostly utilized to date. The Ni hyperaccumulator Senecio coronatus (Asteraceae) has been reported to contain a significant degree of phenotypic plasticity with respect to the amount accumulated and subsequent cellular distribution of Ni. This apparent intraspecific variation means that S. coronatus may represent a useful system in which to study Ni hyperaccumulation. No population genetics study has been carried out to date on this species, and the evolutionary relationships between hyper and non- accumulator populations were unknown. Here, results are presented from a genetic analysis of 15 naturally occurring S. coronatus populations. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and phylogenetic analysis (based on non-coding nuclear and plastid markers) suggest that Ni accumulation may have evolved twice within S. coronatus, as hyperaccumulator plants from site Kaapsehoop, cluster with <b>non-accumulating</b> serpentine populations and demonstrate distinct genetic differentiation from other accumulator populations. Four populations were selected for a preliminary comparative shoot proteome analysis by means of two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D SDS-PAGE) to identify proteins potentially involved in Ni hyperaccumulation. This analysis identiﬁed nine chloroplastic proteins involved in plant energy production and metabolism as overexpressed in hyperaccumulator plants from Agnus Mine and Kaapsehoop, compared to hypertolerant non-accumulator and non-serpentine plants from Galaxy Mine and Pullen Farm, respectively. However, no difference in photosynthetic efficiency, as determined by chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, was detected between these populations...|$|E
40|$|Understanding arsenic uptake {{mechanisms}} {{employed by}} the arsenic hyper-accumulator Pteris cretica is important to optimize its arsenic accumulation capability to further improve the treatment process for small-scale or point of use applications in the developing world. Since most of the approaches for arsenic control using Phytoremediation as a treatment technology that have been conducted using arsenate as arsenic source[26], {{the present study was}} carried using arsenite to determine the role of speciation in arsenic uptake by the hyper-accumulator Pteris cretica. It was determined that trivalent arsenic oxidation plays an important role on the overall arsenic uptake. When trivalent arsenic was added to the aerated solution, only about 50 % of the initial arsenite concentration was oxidized to arsenate regardless the exposure time. On the other hand, in the presence of Pteris ferns, arsenite is completely oxidized as it is being removed from the solution. In order to further elucidate the fate of arsenite in the presence of plant roots, experiments were conducted with Boston fern (Nephorlepis exaltata) a non hyper-accumulating fern that is sensitive to arsenic [35]. It was observed that the total concentration of arsenic in solution remains constant but arsenite is converted to arsenate. Given that these plant species do not have the ability to oxidize arsenite [24], our hypothesis is that the microbial community of the rhizosphere is responsible for arsenite oxidation as a symbiotic relationship with the plant, which has never been evaluated by other groups working with this technology. Studies in the presence of <b>non-accumulating</b> Boston fern were conducted to evaluate this hypothesis by adding an antibiotic cocktail to the arsenic solution together in an effort to suppress microbiological activity in the rhizosphere and a reduction in arsenite oxidation rates was observed. These results provide evidence of a symbiotic relationship between arsenic oxidizing microorganisms and arsenic hyper-accumulating plants, and suggest that the oxidation step is crucial on the arsenic uptake process when arsenic is present as arsenite...|$|E
40|$|Serpentine (ultramafic) soils display high {{concentrations}} of nickel (Ni). Nickel hyperaccumulators have evolved on such environments, developed physiological adaptations to metals (concentrations of Ni sometimes above 1 % in plant aerial biomass) {{and can be used}} for phytomining. Rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with Ni-hyperaccumulator plants differ from those of <b>non-accumulating</b> plants growing at the same site, and are also characterised by a higher number of Ni-tolerant bacteria. Alyssum murale, a Ni-hyperaccumulator, is commonly found on ultramafic soils around the Mediterranean. For a more efficient phytomining, we should characterize rhizosphere microorganisms of these plants, to find good indicators for the success of Ni extraction and to select interesting PGPR. However, most studies have focused on analyzing soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Alyssum murale can grow on non-ultramafic soils as well, with an altitudinal extension ranging from sea level to 2000 m. a. s. l. Among edaphic factors that could influence the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities, altitude and Ni bioavailability could be significant. Our objectives were to understand the specific changes in the structure of A. murale rhizosphere bacterial community that occur across two gradients: 1) elevation and 2) bioavailable Ni. We used pyrosequencing technique (454 -pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA gene) to characterize bacterial communities in soils from A. murale rhizosphere. On one hand we found a high proportion of Chloroflexi (greater than 50 %). Moreover, the higher the soil Ni contents, the more the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. On the contrary, the abundance of TM 7 decreased with increasing levels of bioavailable Ni. On the other hand, we screened Ni-resistant bacteria having 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate deaminase (ACCd) activity for developing primers targeting the acdS gene. Quantification of ACCd activity- which is known to stimulate the growth of A murale- directly from soil DNA extracted could be an appropriate tool to predict phytomining efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Metal hyperaccumulating plants {{accumulate}} exceptionally {{high concentrations}} of metal ions in their above ground tissues and are defined as containing 1000 μg/g dry mass Co, Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn or Ni. This is remarkable because plants typically only require small amounts of these metals for survival, such as 0. 004 μg/g Ni and 15 - 20 μg/g Zn. Scientific investigation has sought to understand the mechanisms underpinning hyperaccumulation in order to apply them in the phyto-technological processes of phytoremediation (removal of metal pollutants from the environment) and phytomining. However, {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms underlying Ni hyperaccumulation despite the fact that Ni hyperaccumulators account for almost three quarters of all known hyperaccumulating species. A comparative RNA-Seq experiment carried out on Ni accumulating and <b>non-accumulating</b> populations of the South African Ni hyperaccumulator Senecio coronatus (Asteraceae) identified a number of putative transport proteins that are constitutively upregulated in the hyperaccumulator plants. This MSc project focused on two of these, iron regulated 2 (ScIREG 2) and iron regulated transporter 1 (ScIRT 1), and aimed to validate the RNA-Seq derived nucleotide sequences, test for Ni transport activity and determine their sub-cellular localisation. Full-length ScIREG 2 and ScIRT 1 protein coding sequences were obtained using RT-PCR and conformed to the predicted sequences derived from the RNA-Seq data. Heterologous expression of ScIRT 1 in yeast consistently conferred an increased Ni resistance phenotype to yeast across a variety of experimental conditions, suggesting that this protein is capable of transporting Ni, and may function as a Ni export protein in yeast. In contrast, the results obtained from heterologous expression of ScIREG 2 were variable and thus inconclusive. An attempt was made to determine the subcellular localization of ScIRT 1 using transient expression of an ScIRT 1 -YFP fusion protein in onion cells. While inconclusive, a YFP signal was detected in these cells, and appeared to localise to the plasma membrane. The work conducted serves as a pilot study to optimize the experimental systems necessary to identify Ni transporters from S. coronatus. These experimental systems can now be applied to characterise the remaining transport proteins identified in the RNA-Seq analysis...|$|E
