30|$|The Gallium nitride (GaN) based mid-power (input current {{less than}} 350  mA and input power less than 0.8  W) mesa type light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) dominate the current LED lighting and backlighting applications because of their cost effectiveness as well as relatively high performance [1 – 3]. For those LEDs, various types of chip-level backside reflectors (BRs) with a reflectance as high as of 98  % {{have been developed for}} adding on their backside, with an aim of enhancing its light output. An enhancement of as high as of 50  % is reported [4 – 6]. Because of those results, the chip level BR is now often adopted as a part of mesa-LED chip structure. However, the reported enhancement measurements based on the <b>naked</b> <b>chip</b> [4, 5] might not be relevant to practical applications: Firstly, an enhancement from a <b>naked</b> <b>chip</b> does not necessarily lead to an equivalent enhancement for a packaged LED emitter. This is because light output of the LED emitter is strongly influenced by packaging materials and process [7, 8]. Secondly, not every BR achieves the highest reflectivity, but Au-based reflective layer has been typically used for low cost LED chips despite relatively lower reflectivity at the wavelength shorter than 550  nm. The introduction of BRs is also historically related to the conventional silver-based die attach adhesive (DAA) which is optically absorptive and thus a highly optically reflective BR can reduce the absorption of downward photoemission from the multiple quantum well (MQW). Over last few years, however, an optically clear DAA (CDAA) has been introduced, which can have significant impact on the role of BRs for mesa type LEDs [9].|$|E
40|$|Progress in CMOS {{technology}} and in fine pitch bump bonding has {{made possible the}} development of high granularity single photon counting detectors for X-ray imaging. This thesis studies the design and characterization of three pulse processing chips with 65536 square pixels of 55 µm x 55 µm designed in a commercial 0. 25 µm 6 -metal CMOS technology. The 3 chips share the same architecture and dimensions and are named Medipix 2, Mpix 2 MXR 20 and Timepix. The Medipix 2 chip is a pixel detector readout chip consisting of 256 x 256 identical elements, each working in single photon counting mode for positive or negative input charge signals. The preamplifier feedback provides compensation for detector leakage current on a pixel by pixel basis. Two identical pulse height discriminators are used to define an energy window. Every event falling inside the energy window is counted with a 13 bit pseudo-random counter. The counter logic, based in a shift register, also behaves as the input/output register for the pixel. Each cell also has an 8 -bit configuration register which allows masking, test-enabling and 3 -bit individual threshold adjust for each discriminator. The chip can be configured in serial mode and readout either serially or in parallel. Measurements show an electronic noise ~ 160 e- rms with a gain of ~ 9 mV/ke-. The threshold spread after equalization of ~ 120 e- rms brings the full chip minimum detectable charge to ~ 1100 e-. The analog static power consumption is ~ 8 µW per pixel with Vdda= 2. 2 V. The Mpix 2 MXR 20 is an upgraded version of the Medipix 2. The main changes in the pixel consist of: an improved tolerance to radiation, improved pixel to pixel threshold uniformity, and a 14 -bit counter with overflow control. The chip periphery includes new threshold DACs with smaller step size, improved linearity, and better temperature dependence. Timepix is an evolution of the Mpix 2 MXR 20 which provides independently in each pixel information of arrival time, time-over-threshold or event counting. Timepix uses as a time reference an external clock (Ref_Clk) up to 100 MHz which is distributed all over the pixel matrix during acquisition mode. The preamplifier is improved {{and there is a}} single discriminator with 4 -bit threshold adjustment {{in order to reduce the}} minimum detectable charge limit. Measurements show an electrical noise ~ 100 e- rms and a gain of ~ 16. 5 mV/ke-. The threshold spread after equalization of ~ 35 e- rms brings the full chip minimum detectable charge either to ~ 650 e- with a <b>naked</b> <b>chip</b> (i. e. gas detectors) or ~ 750 e- when bump-bonded to a detector. The pixel static power consumption is ~ 13. 5 µW per pixel with Vdda= 2. 2 V and Ref_Clk= 80 MHz. This family of chips have been used for a wide variety of applications. During these studies a number of limitations have come to light. Among those are limited energy resolution and surface area. Future developments, such as Medipix 3, will aim to address those limitations by carefully exploiting developments in microelectronics...|$|E
30|$|Hence, the {{objective}} of the present work is to investigate light output difference from a packaged LED emitter using a BR-free and BR-based chip as a function of packaging materials and processes, by using Monte Carlo simulations. Contrary to prior reports based on <b>naked</b> <b>chips,</b> it is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the light output of a packaged LED emitter with a BR-free chip can indeed be as high as that of the emitter using the same chip but with an added backside reflector when the optically clear DAA replacing conventional silver type DAA and a few other key packaging materials and processes are optimized.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present series of {{experimental}} results showing {{the vulnerability of}} tactile sensors called by name Piezoelectric Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (POSFETs) toward light and bare touch. In fact these sensors have customized transistors on exposed silicon substrate/well. The result shows that by using a <b>naked</b> sensor <b>chip</b> for sensing, as was done in past works can give errors in results. We have proposed a cover layer i. e., a non-transparent sheet of silicone rubber, to shield the sensor chip from noises due to light and bare touch...|$|R
5000|$|The {{challenge}} was a bucking bronco advertisement for the ever so cheesy [...] "Britains Next Top Model Hairspray" [...] {{in which they}} had to learn a script and bring some comedy to the challenge. Leanne was shocked once it was announced she had won {{and a lot of the}} girls (especially Lisa) were annoyed. Back at the house a split was caused as the more sensible girls (Martha, Lynzi, Lauren, Louise, Lisa, Stefanie and Catherine) stayed upstairs as the others led by Rachael made clothing out of kitchen utensils and rolled around <b>naked</b> in <b>chip</b> fat and mayonnaise.|$|R
60|$|The orderly {{stood on}} the edge of the bright clearing, where great trunks of trees, {{stripped}} and glistening, lay stretched like <b>naked,</b> brown-skinned bodies. <b>Chips</b> of wood littered the trampled floor, like splashed light, and the bases of the felled trees stood here and there, with their raw, level tops. Beyond was the brilliant, sunlit green of a beech.|$|R
30|$|A thin optical {{reflector}} {{is often}} {{introduced to the}} backside of the standard mesa type light emitting diode (LED) chip with the aim to enhance its light output. However, most of the reported light output enhancements because of backside reflector (BR) introduction might not be relevant. This is because the reported measurement is often from a <b>naked</b> LED <b>chip</b> instead of a packaged LED emitter, and those based on the packaged emitters employing conventional silver based die attach adhesive (DAA). The actual role of BR, {{which is expected to}} be greatly influenced by the packaging materials and processes, is investigated for the monotonic blue color and white LED emitters using Monte-Carlo simulations. Contrary to prior reports, it is demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the role of BR can be diminished when the optically transparent DAA is used and other key packaging materials and processes are optimized, i.e., the light output for a packaged emitter with a BR-free chip can be as high as that of the packaged emitter using the same chip but with an added BR.|$|R
