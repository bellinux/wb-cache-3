40|$|In this paper, the {{rheology}} {{of mineral}} oils and their unstable water emulsion were investigated. The oil samples were domestic crude oil UA, its fractions UA 1, UA 4 and blend semi-product UP 1, while {{the concentration of}} oil in water emulsions was {{in the range from}} 1 up to 30 %. The results were analyzed based on shear stress. The oil samples UA, UA 1 and UP 1 are Newtonian fluids, while UA 4 is pseudoplastic fluid. The samples UA and UA 4 show higher value of shear stress (83. 75 Pa, 297 Pa), then other two samples UA 1 and UP 1 (18. 41 Pa, 17. 52 Pa). Rheology of investigated oils due to its complex chemical composition should be analyzed as a simultaneous effect of all their components. Therefore, structural composition of the oils was determined, namely content of paraffins, naphthenes, aromatics and asphaltenes. All samples contain paraffins, naphthenes and aromatics but only oils UA and UA 4 contain asphaltenes as well. All investigated emulsions except 30 % EUA 4 are Newtonian fluids. The EUA 4 30 % emulsion shows pseudoplastic behaviour, and it is the only 30 % emulsion among investigated ones that achieves lower shear stress then its oil. The characteristics of oil samples that could have an influence on their properties and their emulsion rheology, were determined. These characteristics are: <b>neutralization</b> <b>number,</b> interfacial tension, dielectric constant, and emulsivity. Oil samples UA and UA 4 have significantly higher values of <b>neutralization</b> <b>number,</b> dielectric constants, and emulsivity. The sample UA has the lowest value of interface tension and the greatest emulsivity, indicating that this oil, among all investigated, has the highest preference for building emulsion. This could be the reason why 20 % and 30 % emulsions of the oil UA achieve the highest shear stress among all investigated emulsions...|$|E

40|$|The microphase {{structure}} of ionomers {{based on an}} amorphous, maleated ethylene-propylene copolymer was investigated by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and solid-state NMR experiments. It was shown that {{in this kind of}} ionomers grafted maleic anhydride, its salts with Zn 2 + and a fraction of EPM chain fragments form immobilized, ion-rich aggregates. Three types of EPM chain units with different mobility were detected in the ionomers and in the ionomer precursor, which can be attributed to chain units with low mobility forming aggregates surrounded by an interfacial layer, EPM network chains interconnecting these aggregates, and network imperfections such as dangling ends and chain loops. When the the degree of neutralization is increased, the average dimension of the immobilized aggregate remains almost constant, while the thickness of the interfacial layer with restricted mobility slightly increases. The size of the aggregates in MAn-g-EPM ionomers is significantly larger compared to other ionomers, and as a consequence, the number of acid groups within an aggregate is also larger. At 50 % <b>neutralization,</b> the <b>number</b> of aggregates suddenly decreases. The changes in some macroscopic properties, such as compression set and tensile properties, are related to the morphology of the ionomers as determined by SAXS and NMR.

The aim {{was to investigate the}} possibility of using response surface regression for the analysis and prediction of both the effluent oil concentration and critical velocity in broad ranges of flow rates, bed permeabilities, and nature of dispersed oil phase. The developed response surface equations for a constant bed permeability are a responsive statistical method with the calculated multiple R higher than 90 %. It was found that dispersed oil density, viscosity, <b>neutralization</b> <b>number,</b> and bed permeability influence significantly the oil removal efficiency of fiber bed coalescers. The region of highest critical velocity has been observed for a high viscosity and a high fiber bed permeability. The developed response surface models can be used to ensure high separation efficiency and improve coalescer performance when unexpected simultaneous changes in the bed permeability, hydrodynamic forces and dispersed oil properties take place.

40|$|Abstract Hydraulic fluids {{based on}} mineral oils have 83 % {{on the market}} today. The {{vegetable}} oils have only 2 %, but the prognosis for the year 2000 foresees that hydraulic fluids based on vegetable oils could reach about 8 % of shares on the market. On the other hand some industrialized and small countries, like Slovenia, have considered legislative measures to prevent environmental pollution and protection of the natural resources. The rapeseed oils can offer significant environmental advantages with respect to resource renewability, biodegradability and toxicity when compared to mineral oils. The laboratory test results for one vegetable and one mineral base hydraulic fluid are described in this paper. The results of their physical, chemical and mechanical properties have been obtained by the standard tests for hydraulic fluids. Through simulated real working parameters of dredger on a model laboratory hydraulic system, the behaviour of rapeseed and mineral hydraulic fluids has been studied. After the laboratory tests, the rapeseed base fluids testing was proceeded on the hydraulic system on the dredger in praxis. During these tests operating temperature, fluid pressure, <b>neutralization</b> <b>number</b> (TAN), viscosity, number of particles and water content were simultaneously analysed.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the {{separation}} of oil droplets from water by applying a stainless steel fiber bed. The separation efficiency was followed by monitoring the oil concentration of three mineral oils that have a wide range of viscosity from 10 to 170 mP s, as well as <b>neutralization</b> <b>number</b> from 0. 10 to 1. 70 mg KOH/l. The bed properties were varied by altering the bulk density of the filter material, which resulted in a change of bed permeability from 0. 7 Ч 10 - 9 to 5. 389 Ч 10 - 9 m 2 and bed porosity from 91 to 98 %. All experiments were conducted {{in a wide range of}} superficial velocity from 10 to 50 m/h. It can be concluded that high separation efficiency was achieved using stainless steel fibers, reaching values over 90 %. Low bed permeability is most favorable for work at the selected conditions for the separation. The operation of stainless steel fiber bed is very sensitive to changes in the properties of oils. For lower viscosity of oily contaminants, the required efficiency of separation is achieved at lower superficial velocity through the fibrous bed. This phenomenon can be considered as a serious drawback since the bed coalescers often have to separate oils of different quality over time.

40|$|Background: Studies {{in humans}} {{as well as}} in animal models suggest that interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) plays a crucial role in {{vascular}} pathologies. IL- 18 is a strong predictor of cardiovascular death in angina and is involved in atherotic plaque destabilization. Higher IL- 18 plasma levels are also associated with restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty performed in patients with acute myocardial infarction. We investigated the effective role of IL- 18 in neointima formation in a rat model of vascular injury, known as balloon angioplasty. Methods and Results: Endothelial denudation of the left carotid artery was performed by using a balloon embolectomy catheter. Increased expression of IL- 18 and IL- 18 Rα/β mRNA was detectable in carotid arteries from day 2 to 14 after angioplasty. The active form of IL- 18 was highly expressed in injured arteries. Strong immunoreactivity for IL- 18 was detected in the medial smooth muscle cells at day 2 and 7 after balloon injury and in proliferating/migrating smooth muscle cells in neointima at day 14. Moreover, serum concentrations of IL- 18 were significantly higher among rats subjected to vascular injury. Rats treatment with neutralizing rabbit anti-rat IL- 18 IgG significantly reduced by 27 % (P< 0. 01) neointima formation. In addition, IL- 18 <b>neutralization</b> reduced <b>number</b> of proliferating cells, inhibited IFN-γ, IL- 6, IL- 8 mRNA expression and nuclear factor-κB activation in injured arteries. Conclusions: These results identify {{for the first time a}} critical role for IL- 18 in neointima formation in a rat model of vascular injury and suggest a potential role for IL- 18 neutralization in reduction of neointima development and progression...|$|R

After a blot of shrimp hemocyte membrane proteins was overlaid with a recombinant WSSV envelope protein (rVP 28), the reactive bands on the blot were detected using anti-VP 28 antibody. Among three membrane-associated molecules identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, there was a 25 -kDa protein that bound to both rVP 28 and WSSV. Since it had a primary structure with high homology to the small GTP-binding protein Rab 7, we named it Penaeus monodon Rab 7 (PmRab 7). The full-length PmRab 7 cDNA was obtained, and results from a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay confirmed specific binding to rVP 28. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis revealed PmRab 7 expression in many tissues, and real-time PCR analysis revealed that expression was constitutive. Binding of PmRab 7 to rVP 28 or WSSV occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was inhibited by anti-Rab 7 antibody. In an in vivo <b>neutralization</b> assay, the <b>number</b> of dead shrimp after challenge with WSSV plus PmRab 7 (15 %) or WSSV plus anti-Rab 7 antibody (5 %) was significantly lower than after challenge with WSSV alone (95 %). In contrast to the WSSV-injected group, shrimp injected with WSSV plus PmRab 7 or WSSV plus anti-Rab 7 showed no WSSV-type histopathology. We conclude that PmRab 7 is involved in WSSV infection in shrimp. This is the first study to identify a shrimp protein that binds directly to a major viral envelope protein of WSSV...|$|R

Besides this suppresses sparking, arching and corona. Variation in transformer performance will ultimately affect on power supplying company’s revenue and consumers. Hence, to prevent the transformer failure, oil analysis is very essential and there are several methods to diagnose the health of the oil. Various tests like Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Electrical Diagnostics etc. can evaluate the transformer health but this method is very vast, dangerous during oil transaction and lengthy. Image processing based analysis is a quick software based analysis which inputs images of transformer oil, processes it based on suitable image processing techniques and determines the prominent characteristic features of transformer oil i. e. acidity, power factor, NN (<b>Neutralization</b> <b>Number),</b> dissipation factor etc. due to ageing color of transformer oil changes and also these factors also deteriorated.

40|$|Graduation date: 1952 In the mid 1930 's the Diesel engine, which {{formerly}} {{was used}} {{only as a}} large, low-speed machine, was developed into a smaller high-speed engine for use in trucks, busses, and tractors. Along with these changes in mechanical design came many problems, of which a major one was lubrication. Because ordinary mineral lubricating oils quickly deteriorate, certain chemical compounds were mixed with the oils to improve their performance. Introduction of the chemical additives to the Diesel engine lubricants met with considerable success and the practice was soon followed in spark-ignition engine lubrication. The additives used now include such chemical compounds as anti-oxidants, anti-corrosive agents, extreme pressure agents, viscosity index improvers, and pour point depressants. In addition to the compounds developed by petroleum and chemical companies, other commercial addition agents, which are sold in auto supply stores and service stations, have appeared with many and varied claims. Today {{there are many of}} these "patent medicine" mixtures on the market. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the stability of a representative group of these commercial addition agents in an internal combustion engine. A small single cylinder, water-cooled Lauson was used as the test engine. It was mounted on a test stand with a direct current generator and a control panel. The procedure followed in the tests was adapted from the Coordinating Research Council Handbook. It consisted of a standardized break-in period with a reference oil, and a test time of 36 -hours with an additive-reference oil mixture. The reference oil, of high rating, was procured from the Coordinating Research Council for the control in these tests. The oil or additive mixture, after the 36 -hour test period, was analyzed by the following ASTM tests: Gravity, viscosity at 100 F and 210 F, flash and fire points, water and sediment, <b>neutralization</b> <b>number,</b> precipitation number, and copper strip corrosion. Photomicrographs were taken to observe the extent of corrosion on copper-lead bearing sections, cut from a bearing whose composition was 65 per cent copper and 35 per cent lead. These specimens had been present in the sump during the test run. Two different oil temperatures were utilized to obtain extremes in operating conditions. One oil temperature was 212 F and the second at 110 F, with 25 ml of water added to the crankcase. The first value simulated long, hot weather, driving conditions and the second town driving with many starts and stops and low oil temperature. The results of the tests are summarized as follows: 1. The addition of water to the crankcase accelerated the deterioration of the additive-reference oil mixture. 2. There were definite tendencies in most additives to corrode the copper-lead bearing strips. 3. The additives did not prevent carbon deposits or sludge formation to any greater degree than the reference oil. 4.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes a number of polymorphic highly glycosylated virion glycoproteins (g), including the essential envelope glycoprotein, gN. We have tested the hypothesis that glycosylation of gN contributes to resistance of the virus to neutralizing antibodies. Recombinant viruses carrying deletions in serine/threonine rich sequences within the glycosylated surface domain of gN were constructed in the genetic background of HCMV strain AD 169. The deletions had no influence on the formation of the gM/gN complex and in vitro replication of the respective viruses compared to the parent virus. The gN-truncated viruses were significantly more susceptible to neutralization by a gN-specific monoclonal antibody and in addition by a number of gB- and gH-specific monoclonal antibodies. Sera from individuals previously infected with HCMV also more efficiently neutralized gN-truncated viruses. Immunization of mice with viruses that expressed the truncated forms of gN resulted in significantly higher serum neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous strain that was accompanied by increased antibody titers against known neutralizing epitopes on gB and gH. Importantly, neutralization activity of sera from animals immunized with gN-truncated virus did not exhibit enhanced neutralizing activity against the parental wild type virus carrying the fully glycosylated wild type gN. Our results indicate that the extensive glycosylation of gN could represent a potentially important mechanism by which HCMV <b>neutralization</b> by a <b>number</b> of different antibody reactivities can be inhibited...|$|R

Special attention should be paid to the occurrence of metal particles in oil and the tendency in the change of their number. The signs that point to changes in viscosity, oxidation increase and additive wear are also considered. The state of impurities in oil was discussed, with a particular focus on the number of particles, water content and metal impurities. It is inevitable to use an oil analysis programme in the case of motor oils, which provides several advantages: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of cost of vehicle maintenance. The paper also gives the results of the experimental research of physical- chemical characteristics of the motor oils sampled from the engines of Mercedes OM 345 vehicles in operational use. It was shown that there is a change in physical-chemical properties of lubrication oils. These changes are in a direct correlation with the state of all the elements of the tribomechanical motor system, i. e. with their functional characteristics. The conclusion based on the realized testing comes {{at the end of the}} paper. Introduction As a contact element of the tribomechanical system, lubricant is a carrier of information about the state of the whole system, from the aspect of tribological as well as other ageing processes. Therefore, an analysis of oils, based on a properly defined program, represents a very effective method for monitoring the state of technical systems, which ensures early warning signals of potential problems that could lead to failure and break down of technical systems. Using Oil Analysis programs for engine oils has several benefits: reduction of unscheduled vehicle downtime, improvement of vehicle reliability, help in organizing effectiveness of maintenance schedules, extension of engine life, optimization of oil change intervals and reduction of vehicle maintenance costs. Physico-chemical characteristics of lubricating oils Basic physico-chemical characteristics which determine the quality of oil are: a) physical characteristics: viscosity, density, flash point, cloud Point, pour point, volatillity, emulsibillity, deemulsibillity, foaming, air release, viscosity index, etc. b) chemical characteristics: <b>neutralization</b> <b>number</b> (TAN-total acid number), total base number (TBN), oxidation stabillity, chemical and thermal stabillity, corrodibillity, ash content and carbon residue, water content, compatibility, toxicity, etc. Diagnostics of the tribomechanical system of an internal combustion engine The diagnostics is based on the prediction (recognition) of damage and/or failure through characteristic diagnostic parameters. This allows prevention of delays and increases reliability, cost-effectiveness, and usage life. The diagnostics of the tribomechanical system can provide verification of the system condition, working capacity and functionality, and can point out the place, form and cause of a failure. The diagnostics is carried out through the detection of symptoms, determining the value of the characteristic parameters and their comparison with the limit values. If the engine assemblies are considered from the aspect of tribomechanical systems (e. g. piston-piston ring-cylinder, cam-valve lifter, bearing journal bearing) defined by tribological processes, it can be shown that the determination of the content of wear products, content of contaminants, state of lubricants and lubrication conditions have a significant influence on the implementation of maintenance of these systems. We should emphasize the importance of monitoring oil for lubrication of tribomechanical engine assemblies, which provides identification of potential causes and phenomena leading to damage and failure in the early stages of the functioning of the system. Prediction, i. e. detection of potential and/or current damage and failures in the system, checking the functionality of oil and determination of usage life are the main factors of the implementation of oil monitoring. Since mobile components of tribomechanical system engines are necessarily exposed to wear and contaminants and wear products deposit in the lubrication oil, it is necessary to monitor changes in fluid properties during exploitation, because the monitoring of lubricants is the key monitoring technique for maintenance as well as for achieving certain techno-economic effects. The analysis of the contents of different metals in lubricants is very important. Metal particles are abrasive and act as catalysts in the oxidation of oils. In motor oils, the origin of the particles may be from additives, wear, fuel, air and cooling liquid. Metals from additives can be Zn, Ca, Ba, or Mg and that indicates the change in additives. Metals originating from wear are: Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, Al, Mn, Ag, Sn, and they point to increased wear in these systems. Elements originating from cooling liquids are Na and B, and their increased content indicates the penetration of the cooling liquid into the lubricant. The increased content of Si or Ca, originating from the air, points to the air filter malfunctioning. Wear of the parts is the main cause of malfunctioning in the process of exploitation of mechanical components of vehicles. Wear is characterized by the change in shapes and dimensions of working parts. Friction leads to surface wear which causes the increase of clearance between moving joined parts and the change in their mutual relations, thus resulting further in deviations from required specifications of assemblies and vehicles in general. Diagnostic procedure for the condition of lubricants 1) Selection of a type of vehicles and vehicle parts from which oil samples will be taken. 2) Consideration of the mode of the system (vehicle assembly) operation, lubrication systems, exploitation conditions and its purpose, and an overview of the basic technical characteristics. 3) Analysis of the tribological processes in components of motor vehicles. 4) Analysis of the failure of functional components of vehicles (as tribomechanical systems) 5) Information about the condition of a vehicle assembly and oil during the analysis and monitoring Results of motor oil investigation during exploitation In this part of the paper, the results of the experimental testing of motor oils in the Laboratory for fuels and lubricants, VTI Belgrade, are presented. The physico-chemical characteristics of oils were examined in accordance with standard methods, shown in Table 3. The analysis was done on fresh (new) oils and oils used in vehicle engine assembles. Testing of used samples was carried out in accordance with common criteria defined by the quality of used oil. The values of allowable deviation limits of individual characteristics of oil depend on the type of oil, working conditions and internal recommendations of the manufacturer of lubricants and users. The limited values of oil characteristics which condition the change of the oil charge from the engine are given in Table 4. They represent the criteria for the oil charge change. Deviation of only one characteristic results in the change of the oil charge, regardless of the characteristic itself. The research was carried out on three vehicles (MERCEDES O 345 buses) with the Mercedes-Benz engine, OM 447 HLA type. This is a four-stroke engine with six in-line cylinders, turbo Diesel, liquid cooled and with combined lubrication, which meets Euro 2 emission standards related to exhaust gases. The research was conducted through periodic sampling of oil from the engines of the vehicles listed above. Apart from fresh oil ('zero' sample), samples were taken after 10. 000 km, 20. 000 km and 30. 000 km. After 30. 000 km oil charges were replaced in all three engines. During the oil sampling, the sampling sites were carefully chosen, taking care of actual oil usage, which enabled each sample to be a representative one. Each sample was taken from the living zone, i. e. zone closer to the elements in contact. The sampling of oil from the bottom of the motor housing (discharge outlet) was thus avoided, as the highest concentration of contaminants occurs there. This is achieved by simply modifying the outlet for oil, by extending it towards the active zone of oil within the housing with a tube of appropriate length. Special attention was also paid to the preservation of samples from contamination, both in the phase of sample taking and in the phase of manipulation, which is fully met by applying the prescribed procedures. A very high level of purity of all elements in the chain of the sampling systems was thus provided as well as the separation of samples in a way that does not perturb the integrity of their data on the state of the vehicle components from which the sampling was done. Conclusion On the basis of all the mentioned above, the following conclusions can be drawn: - motor oil VALVOLINE, API CF and ACEA E 4, of SAE 10 W- 40 gradation, analyzed during exploitation, achieves its primary function and meets the prescribed replacement interval of 30. 000 km in the EURO 2 engine category, which was found by the analysis of characteristic physico-chemical properties of oil and wear products (Fe and Cu) during exploitation; - the fall of viscosity is evident during the first 10. 000 km, and after this period, viscosity remains approximately constant until the end of the interval changes of the oil charge. Maximum viscosity fall during the exploitation of the oil from all three engines is significantly below the allowed limit of 20 %; - after 30. 000 km the TBN value has not exceeded the allowable limit for oil samples from all three engines; - the content of insoluble substances in the oil is negligible in comparison with the limit value, because there is no significant presence of oxidation products and mechanical impurities or insoluble substances such as coke, scale, dust, soot, particles originated from wear contact area of the engine tribomechanical systems and other mechanical impurities; - small decrease of the flash point values shows that there was no significant penetration of fuel into the system for lubrication; - content of iron and copper is significantly below the allowable limits for all three vehicles; - the appearance of water in the samples is not found, - after 30. 000 km, oil is replaced, following exactly the manufacturer's recommendation about the oil charge change...|$|E
