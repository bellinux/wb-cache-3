On the other hand, it makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> speak of the internal energy at a point, while when local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, it makes good sense to speak of the temperature at a point. Consequently, temperature can vary from point to point in a medium that is not in global thermodynamic equilibrium, but in which there is local thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that it makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, {{which in turn is}} why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E

25|$|Navajo was an {{attractive}} choice for code use because few {{people outside the}} Navajo had learned to speak the language. Virtually no books in Navajo had been published. Outside of the language, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards. It would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers could have worked together effectively. The Japanese {{had an opportunity to}} attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code talker, was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages made <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> him. When he reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.|$|E
25|$|Michel Callon's {{concept of}} framing {{provides}} a useful schema: each economic act or transaction occurs against, incorporates and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network relations are simultaneously bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed upon agents as they come to work in markets and are “formatted” as calculative agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that produced actors predisposed to exchange under certain sets of rules. Therefore, for Challon, market transactions can never be disembedded from social and geographic relations and there is <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> talking of degrees of embeddedness and disembeddeness. An emerging theme is the interrelationship, inter-penetrability and variations of concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-structuralist theorizing that draws on Michel Foucault and Actor Network Theory and stress relational aspects of person-hood, and dependence and integration into networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.|$|E
25|$|With The Rock {{defeating}} Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, Austin {{was set to}} face The Rock at WrestleMania. In {{the weeks}} leading up to WrestleMania, animosity grew between Austin and The Rock, stemming from Austin's wife, Debra, being assigned to be The Rock's manager by Mr. McMahon, but then relieved of that role after failing to prevent a brawl between Rock and Austin. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Austin faced The Rock for the second time and before the match began it was announced that the match had been made no disqualification. Midway during the match, Mr. McMahon made his way to ringside, then prevented The Rock from pinning Austin on two separate occasions and provided Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with. Austin then hit The Rock several times with the chair and pinned him to win the WWF Championship for the fifth time. After the match, Austin celebrated by shaking hands with Mr. McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis, even sharing a beer with him and turning heel for the first time since 1997. This decision has been highly criticised by many, including Austin himself, as Austin was such a top-level face that many agreed it made <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> turn him heel.|$|E

500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting {{to say one}} thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that it makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E

500|$|Once the {{inevitable}} punishment {{of the rebels}} had occurred, the Persians were {{in the mood for}} conciliation. Since these regions were now Persian territory again, it made <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> harm their economies further or to drive the people to further rebellions. Artaphernes thus set out to re-establish a workable relationship with his subjects. He summoned representatives from each Ionian city to Sardis, and told them that henceforth, rather than continually quarrelling and fighting between themselves, disputes would be resolved by arbitration, seemingly by a panel of judges. Furthermore, he re-surveyed the land of each city, and set their tribute level in proportion to its size. Artaphernes had also witnessed just how much the Ionians disliked tyrannies, and began to reconsider his position on the local governance of Ionia. The following year, Mardonius, another son-in-law of Darius, would travel to Ionia and abolish the tyrannies, replacing them with democracies. The peace established by Artaphernes would long be remembered as just and fair. Darius actively encouraged the Persian nobility of the area to participate in Greek religious practices, especially those dealing with Apollo. [...] Records from the period indicate that the Persian and Greek nobility began to intermarry, and the children of Persian nobles were given Greek names instead of Persian names. Darius' conciliatory policies were used as a type of propaganda campaign against the mainland Greeks, so that in 491 BC, when Darius sent heralds throughout Greece demanding submission (earth and water), initially most city-states accepted the offer, Athens and Sparta being the most prominent exceptions.|$|E

In contrast, most previous attempts to make robots run have used active, high bandwidth feedback control systems. We use a simplified monopod to give an understandable reason why self-stabilizing running should be possible. Physically realistic simulations running with one, two, or four legs demonstrate selfstabilizing running, as does a physical monopod robot. Introduction Running motions can be self-stabilizing. That is, with proper design the structure and motion of a robot can automatically cause it to recover from minor disturbances even if it cannot detect them. Many items in common use, such as tables, automobiles, and airplanes are stable about their standard operating conditions.
