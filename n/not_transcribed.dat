25|$|The Jak-STAT pathway is {{instrumental}} {{in the development of}} limbs, specifically in its ability to regulate bone growth through paracrine signaling of cytokines. However, mutations in this pathway have been implicated in severe forms of dwarfism: thanatophoric dysplasia (lethal) and achondroplasic dwarfism (viable). This is due to a mutation in a Fgf gene, causing a premature and constitutive activation of the Stat1 transcription factor. Chondrocyte cell division is prematurely terminated, resulting in lethal dwarfism. Rib and limb bone growth plate cells are <b>not</b> <b>transcribed.</b> Thus, the inability of the rib cage to expand prevents the newborn's breathing.|$|E
2500|$|In Ido, country names must {{conform to}} the language's orthography but {{otherwise}} are left unchanged: Europa, Peru, Amerika. City names are treated as foreign words (London), except when part of the name itself is a regular noun or adjective: Nov-York (Nov for nova, or [...] "new", but the place name York is not changed as in Esperanto [...] "Nov-Jorko"). This is not a hard and fast rule, however, and New York is also acceptable, similar to writing Köln {{for the city of}} Cologne in Germany. South Carolina becomes Sud-Karolina, much {{in the same way that}} a river called the [...] "Schwarz River" [...] is <b>not</b> <b>transcribed</b> as the [...] "Black River" [...] in English even though schwarz is the German word for black. However, less well-known place names are generally left alone, so a small town by the name of [...] "Battle River" [...] for example would be written the same way, and <b>not</b> <b>transcribed</b> as [...] "Batalio-rivero". This is because transcribing a little-known place name would make it nearly impossible to find in the original language.|$|E

2500|$|Tiriel survives in only {{a single}} {{manuscript}} copy, located in the British Museum. An eight-page document written in Blake's hand, the manuscript is inscribed [...] "Tiriel / MS. by Mr Blake". It is believed that up to page 8, line 4 ("Lead me to Har & Heva I am Tiriel King of the west"), the poem is a fair copy, transcribed from somewhere else, but at 8:4 the quantity of corrections and alterations increases, and the writing becomes scribbled and in a different ink {{to the rest of}} the poem. This difference has led Erdman to argue that the later part of the poem was <b>not</b> <b>transcribed,</b> but was worked out in the manuscript itself, and may have been rushed. Additionally, many of the handwritten corrections, emendations and deletions in the parts of the poem prior to 8:4 are in the same ink as the lines after 8:4, suggesting Blake went back over the manuscript and revised earlier parts of it when he returned to finish it.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of costimulation, T cells {{activated}} through their antigen receptor become unresponsive (anergic) and do <b>not</b> <b>transcribe</b> the gene encoding interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) when restimulated with antigen. Anergic alloantigen-specific human T cells contained phos-phorylated Cbl that coimmunoprecipitated with Fyn. The adapter protein CrkL was associated with both phosphorylated Cbl and the guanidine nucleotide–releasing factor C 3 G, which catalyzes guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange on Rap 1. Active Rap 1 (GTP-bound form) was present in anergic cells. Forced expression of low amounts of Rap 1 -GTP in Jurkat T cells recapitulated the anergic defect and blocked T cell antigen receptor (TCR) – and CD 28 -mediated IL- 2 gene transcription. Therefore, Rap 1 functions as a negative regulator of TCR-mediated IL- 2 gene transcription and {{may be responsible for}} the specific defect in IL- 2 production in T cell anergy. Ligation of TCR without costimulation re-sults in a state of long-term functional un-responsiveness termed anergy (1). Anergic T cells do <b>not</b> <b>transcribe</b> the IL- 2 gen...|$|R

As to Penini, he is radiant, and even I have been out walking twice, though a good deal weaker for the winter. More open air, and much more, is {{necessary}} to set me growing again, but I shall grow; and meantime I have been working, and am working, at so close a rate that if I lose a day I am lost, which is too close a rate, and makes one feel rather nervous. We see nobody till after four meantime. I have finished (<b>not</b> <b>transcribed)</b> the last book but one, and am now in the very last book, which must be finished with {{the last days of}} May.

I was looking miserable in February, and really could {{scarcely}} tumble across the room, and now I am up on my perch again--nay, even out of my cage door. The weather is divine. One feels in one's self why the trees are green. I go out, walk out, have recovered flesh and fire--my very hair curls differently. 'Is I, I?' I say with the metaphysicians. There's something vital about this Florence air, for, though much given to resurrection, I never made such a leap in my life before after illness. Robert and I need to run as well as leap. We have quantities of work to do, and small time to do it in. He is four hours a day engaged in dictating to a friend of ours who transcribes for him, and I am not even ready for transcription--have <b>not</b> <b>transcribed</b> a line of my six or seven thousand. We go to England, or at least to Paris, next month, but it can't be early. Oh, may we meet you! Our little Penini is radiant, and altogether we are all in good spirits. Which is a shame, you will say, considering the state of affairs at Sebastopol. Forgive me. I never, at worst, thought that the great tragedy of the world was going on there. It was tragic, but there are more chronic cruelties and deeper despairs--ay, and more exasperating wrongs. For the rest, we have the most atrocious system in Europe, and we mean to work it out. Oh, you will see. Your committees nibble on, and this and that poisonous berry is pulled off leisurely, while the bush to the root of it remains, and the children eat on unhindered on the other side. I had hoped that there was real feeling among politicians. But no; we are put off with a fast day. There, an end! I begin to think that nothing will do for England but a good revolution, and a 'besom of destruction' used dauntlessly. We are getting up our vainglories again, smoothing our peacock's plumes. We shall be as exemplary as ever by next winter, you will see.|$|E
