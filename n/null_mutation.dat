5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{required}} serpin, the protease that it normally would regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies. Consequently, simple deficiency of a serpin (e.g. a <b>null</b> <b>mutation)</b> can result in disease. Gene knockouts, particularly in mice, are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence.|$|E
5|$|In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a <b>null</b> <b>mutation,</b> making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma.|$|E
2500|$|CACNB4 is a {{gene that}} encodes the calcium channel β subunit protein. [...] {{subunits}} are important regulators of calcium channel current amplitude, voltage dependence, and also regulate channel trafficking. The β4 isoform encoded by CACNB4 is most prevalent in the cerebellum. In mice, a naturally occurring <b>null</b> <b>mutation</b> leads to the [...] "lethargic" [...] phenotype, {{which is similar to}} JME. There are at least two mutations in the β4 subunit associated with JME, C104F and R482X. When wild-type α1A and β4 subunits are expressed in oocytes they produce large Ba2+ currents that inactivate slowly. Incorporation of either of the mutant β4 subunit into channels instead of wild-type subunits produces currents that are larger by 30-40%. The R482X mutation also increases the rate of fast inactivation of the channel. Since these effects are subtle, it is believed that they are contributory rather than completely causative for JME.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a novel approach}} for the isolation of <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in a vital Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell housekeeping gene. Our experimental strategy required introduction of an expressible DNA clone encoding a recessive emetine-resistance allele of ribosomal protein S 14 into wild-type CHO cells. Transgene heterozygote (TGH) cell lines, which harbor multiple emetine-resistance S 14 transgenes, survive mutations that inactivate the CHO RPS 14 locus {{by virtue of the}} transgenes' biological function. <b>Null</b> <b>mutations</b> in RPS 14 yield TGH clones that display the transgene's drug-resistance phenotype. A large collection of emetine-resistant clones was isolated from one TGH cell line and shown to consist of three types of S 14 mutations: (1) nonsense <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in the RPS 14 protein coding sequence; (2) missense <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> that affect S 14 amino acid residues that have been conserved stringently during eukaryotic evolution; and (3) a recurrent missense mutation that results in a new, functional RPS 14 emetine-resistance allele...|$|R

Knockout or <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in SOD1 are highly detrimental to aerobic {{growth in the}} yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and result in a dramatic reduction in post-diauxic lifespan.

50|$|Although the {{homozygous}} Brn3a <b>null</b> <b>mutation</b> is lethal {{at birth}} in mice, Brn3a null heterozygotes have no known phenotype. i.e. the Brn3a <b>null</b> <b>mutation</b> is completely recessive. This {{can be explained}} by gene dosage compensation due to autoregulation, in which expression of the remaining copy of the Pou4f1 gene is increased in heterozygotes, leading to near-normal expression of its downstream targets. The combination of homozygote lethality and dosage compensation in heterozygotes may explain why POU4F1 mutations have not been identified in any human disease, whereas diseases are associated with several other members of the POU domain transcription factor class.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundAlpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT) {{deficiency}} is an autosomal-codominant disorder, {{caused by}} mutations in the SERPINA 1 gene on chromosome 14. Individuals {{affected by the}} most common mutations, SZ and ZZ, have serum AAT concentrations of 25 % and 15 % of normal levels, and present {{a higher risk of}} emphysema. Mutations causing total absence of serum AAT (<b>Null</b> <b>mutations)</b> were suggested to be associated with very early onset emphysema but their clinical phenotype is poorly known. HypothesisAbsence of AAT in <b>Null</b> <b>mutations</b> results in more severe emphysema as compared to ZZ and SZ. MethodsWe genotyped all known Dutch subjects (n= 12) with absent serum AAT, and compared their lung function values (FEV 1 and KCO) with those of individuals with ZZ and SZ genotype, matched for age and smoking history. ResultsAll subjects with absent serum AAT presented homozygous <b>Null</b> <b>mutations.</b> In three subjects, a new mutation in exon 2 of the SERPINA 1 gene was found. Subjects with <b>Null</b> <b>mutations</b> showed significantly lower lung function values than SZ and ZZ individuals (p= 0. 000 and 0. 001 for FEV 1 and KCO, respectively). In all groups, there was a positive correlation between serum AAT and lung function values (p= 0. 025 and 0. 014 for FEV 1 and KCO, respectively). ConclusionsSerum levels of AAT are correlated with the severity of pulmonary phenotype. Subjects with <b>Null</b> <b>mutations</b> should be considered a subgroup at particularly high risk of emphysema within AAT deficiency (AATD). Early detection of carriers of this genotype would be important for preventive and therapeutic interventions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA TGFβ signal {{transduction}} cascade controls body size and male tail morphogenesis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have analyzed {{the function of}} the sma- 3 Smad gene, one of three Smad genes that function in this pathway. <b>Null</b> <b>mutations</b> in sma- 3 are at least as severe as <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in the ligand and type I receptor genes, dbl- 1 and sma- 6, indicating that the other Smads do not function in the absence of SMA- 3. Furthermore, <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in sma- 3 do not cause defects in egg laying or in regulation of the developmentally arrested dauer larva stage, indicating no overlapping function with another C. elegans TGFβ signaling pathway. The sma- 3 gene is widely expressed at all developmental stages in hermaphrodites and males. The molecular lesions associated with eight sma- 3 alleles of varying severity have been determined.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of filaggrin <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> to predicting atopic dermatitis (AD) treatment response is not clear, nor have such mutations {{been studied in}} the Finnish population. This study tested the association of the 4 most prevalent European FLG <b>null</b> <b>mutations,</b> the 2 Finnish enriched FLG <b>null</b> <b>mutations,</b> the FLG 12 -repeat allele, and 50 additional epidermal barrier gene variants, with risk of AD, disease severity, clinical features, risk of other atopic diseases, age of onset, and treatment response in 501 patients with AD and 1710 controls. AD, early-onset AD, palmar hyperlinearity, and asthma showed significant associations with the combined FLG null genotype. Disease severity and treatment response were independent of patient FLG status. Carrier frequencies of R 501 X, 2282 del 4, and S 3247 X were notably lower in Finns compared with reported frequencies in other populations. This data confirms FLG mutations as risk factors for AD in Finns, but also, questions their feasibility as biomarkers in predicting treatment response...|$|R
40|$|During Bacillus subtilis sporulation, the {{transient}} engulfment defect of spoIIB strains {{is enhanced}} by spoVG <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> and suppressed by spoVS <b>null</b> <b>mutations.</b> These mutations have opposite effects on expression of the motility regulon, as the spoVG mutation reduces and the spoVS mutation increases σD-directed gene expression, cell separation, and autolysis. Elevating σD activity by eliminating the anti-σ factor FlgM also suppresses spoIIB spoVG, and both flgM and spoVS mutations cause continued expression of the σD regulon during sporulation. We propose that peptidoglycan hydrolases induced during motility can substitute for sporulation-specific hydrolases during engulfment. We find that sporulating cells are heterogeneous in their expression of the motility regulon, which could result in phenotypic variation between individual sporulating cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of simple repetitive DNA sequences (microsatellites) is a sensitive {{indicator of the}} ability of a cell to repair DNA mismatches. In a genetic screen for yeast mutants with elevated microsatellite instability, we identified strains containing point mutations in the yeast mismatch repair genes, MSH 2, MSH 3, MLH 1, and PMS 1. Some of these mutations conferred phenotypes significantly different from those of <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in these genes. One semidominant MSH 2 mutation was identified.

40|$|The Escherichia coli DsbA {{protein is}} the major {{oxidative}} catalyst in the periplasm. Dartigalongue et al. (EMBO J., 19, 5980 – 5988, 2000) reported that <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in the ompL gene of E. coli fully suppress all phenotypes associated with dsbA mutants, i. e. sensitivity to the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) and the antibiotic benzylpenicillin, lack of motility, reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and mucoidy. They showed that OmpL is a porin and hypothesized that ompL <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> exert their suppressive effect by preventing efflux of a putative oxidizing–reducing compound into the medium. We have repeated these experiments using two different ompL null alleles {{in at least three}} different E. coli K- 12 genetic backgrounds and have failed to reproduce any of the ompL suppressive effects noted above. Also, we show that, contrary to earlier results, ompL <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> alone do not result in partial DTT sensitivity or partial motility, nor do they appreciably affect bacterial growth rates or block propagation of the male-specific bacteriophage M 13. Thus, our findings clearly demonstrate that ompL plays no perceptible role in modulating redox potential in the periplasm of E. coli...|$|R

40|$|In Escherichia coli, {{transcription}} of the degP locus, which encodes a heat-shock-inducible periplasmic protease, {{is controlled}} by two parallel signal transduction systems that each monitor extracytoplasmic protein physiology. For example, the heat-shock-inducible sigma factor, ςE, controls degP transcription {{in response to the}} overproduction and folded state of various extracytoplasmic proteins. Similarly, the CpxA/R two-component signal transduction system increases degP transcription in response to the overproduction of a variety of extracytoplasmic proteins. Since degP transcription is attuned to the physiology of extracytoplasmic proteins, we were interested in identifying negative transcriptional regulators of degP. To this end, we screened for <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> that increased transcription from a strain containing a degP-lacZ reporter fusion. Through this approach, we identified <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> in the wecE, rmlAECA, and wecF loci that increase degP transcription. Interestingly, each of these loci is responsible for synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), a glycolipid situated on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. However, these <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> do not stimulate degP transcription by eliminating ECA biosynthesis. Rather, the wecE, rmlAECA, and wecF <b>null</b> <b>mutations</b> each impede the same step in ECA biosynthesis, and it is the accumulation of the ECA biosynthetic intermediate, lipid II, that causes the observed perturbations. For example, the lipid II-accumulating mutant strains each (i) confer upon E. coli a sensitivity to bile salts, (ii) confer a sensitivity to the synthesis of the outer membrane protein LamB, and (iii) stimulate both the Cpx pathway and ςE activity. These phenotypes suggest that the accumulation of lipid II perturbs the structure of the bacterial outer membrane. Furthermore, these results underscore the notion that although the Cpx and ςE systems function in parallel to regulate degP transcription, they can be simultaneously activated by the same perturbation...|$|R

50|$|In 10-20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade 3 (the highest histologic grade), {{mutations}} {{are found}} in a tumor suppressor gene, commonly p53 or PTEN. In 20% of endometrial hyperplasias and 50% of endometrioid cancers, PTEN suffers a loss-of-function mutation or a <b>null</b> <b>mutation,</b> making it less effective or completely ineffective.
