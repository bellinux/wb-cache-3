25|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> is a nitroaromatic {{hydantoin}} analog of flutamide, as seen {{in figure}} 5. <b>Nilutamide</b> is eliminated exclusively by metabolism, mainly by reduction of the aromatic nitro group. Although the hydrolysis {{of one of the}} carbonyl functions of the imidazolinedione was identified, it is much less susceptible to hepatic metabolism than the amide bond in hydroxuflutamide. This results in a longer half-life of <b>nilutamide</b> in humans of 2 days. Nevertheless, the nitro anion-free radical formed during nitro reduction could still be associated with hepatotoxicity in humans, especially when using relatively high dosage employed for androgen blockage. <b>Nilutamide</b> causes side-effects which limit its usage, such as pneumonitis and delayed adaption to darkness.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{bicalutamide}} was approved, and <b>nilutamide</b> {{followed a}} year later.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens are {{medications}} such as flutamide, <b>nilutamide,</b> bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and cyproterone acetate {{that directly}} block {{the actions of}} testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells.|$|E
25|$|Bicalutamide is an arylpropionamide analog, seen {{in figure}} 6. It has {{replaced}} flutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> as the first choice antiandrogen for prostate cancer treatment. Bicalutamide is not as hepatotoxic as flutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> and has a longer half-life, of 6 days in humans, that allows once a day administration at lower dosage. Bicalutamide shares the amide bond structure with flutamide. Even so, the amide bond hydrolysis was discovered in rats, not in humans, which could explain the prolonged half life of bicalutamide in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> {{has very}} low {{affinity}} for AR when tested on castrated rat prostate. Modifications such as replacing the N3 atom with oxygen has {{little effect on}} affinity of the compound for prostate AR. By replacing the oxygen atom with a sulfur atom at the C2 position of the imidazole ring and adding butylalcohol to the N3 atom, the receptor binding and biological activity of the compound increases 100 times that of NSAAs. Also the compound does not bind to other steroid receptors. If a methyl group is changed for the butylalcohol group, the compound shows 3 and 10 times more antiandrogenic activity in vivo than bicalutamide and <b>nilutamide,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|However, hydroxyflutamide {{worked as}} an {{antagonist}} for W741 mutant ARs. This concurs with the theory that flutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> antagonize AR through the mechanism of “passive antagonism”, as they are of a more modest size then bicalutamide. These drugs may therefore be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory prostate cancer previously treated with bicalutamide.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide {{became the}} first NSAA to be tested clinically. Later the NSAAs {{bicalutamide}} and <b>nilutamide</b> were developed. The alleged advantages of these compounds were {{that they did not}} affect libido or potency like the other centrally acting compounds under development, luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and cyproterone acetate. But this theory did not prove to be true. These NSAAs eventually crossed the blood–brain barrier, like cyproterone acetate, leading to a subsequent increase in serum testosterone levels.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyflutamide and its analogues, {{bicalutamide}} and <b>nilutamide,</b> {{share an}} anilide ring structure. The structures {{can be seen}} in figure 7, where the anilide ring is coloured red. These three compounds require an electron-deficient aromatic ring for efficient AR binding. Replacing the anilide with an alkene gives weakly active compounds, which {{can be attributed to the}} lack of intramolecular hydrogen binding or to poor hydrogen-bond donor capability. Various combinations of electron-withdrawing substitutions in the aniline ring of these drugs have not shown higher binding to the AR receptor, compared to compounds which have a chloro or trifluoromethyl group at the meta position (R1) and either a cyano or nitrogen group at the para position (R2).|$|E
2500|$|Bicalutamide has a cyano {{group at}} the para {{position}} instead of a nitro group like flutamide and <b>nilutamide.</b> This change in groups avoids the nitro reduction observed in <b>nilutamide.</b> Bicalutamide has a chiral carbon in its structure (labeled with an asterisk in figure 6), which {{is connected to the}} hydroxyl and methyl groups [...] It is therefore administered as a racemate. Post-approval investigation revealed that its antiandrogenic activity resides almost entirely in the (R)-enantiomer. (R)-bicalutamide has an almost fourfold higher affinity for the prostate AR than hydroxyflutamide and has a better side-effect profile compared to other antiandrogens.|$|E
2500|$|Nonsteroidal antiandrogens (NSAAs) used in HRT for {{transgender}} women include flutamide, <b>nilutamide,</b> and bicalutamide, {{all three}} of which are primarily used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer in cisgender men. Unlike steroidal antiandrogens such as spironolactone and cyproterone acetate, these drugs are pure androgen receptor antagonists. They do not lower androgen levels; rather, they act solely by preventing the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. However, they do so very strongly, and are highly effective antiandrogens. Bicalutamide has improved tolerability and safety profiles relative to cyproterone acetate, as well as to flutamide and <b>nilutamide,</b> and has largely replaced the latter two in clinical practice for this reason. Enzalutamide is a more recently introduced NSAA with even greater potency and efficacy as an antiandrogen than bicalutamide, but it is still under patent protection and in relation to this is currently (and for the foreseeable future) [...] extremely expensive. Moreover, enzalutamide has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABA receptor and has been associated with central side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, and, most notably, seizures (in ≈1% of patients), properties that it does not share with bicalutamide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> {{acts as a}} {{selective}} competitive silent antagonist of the AR (IC50 = 412 nM), which prevents androgens like testosterone and DHT from activating the receptor. The affinity of <b>nilutamide</b> for the AR is 100-fold {{less than that of}} testosterone, thus necessitating the use of relatively high dosages to achieve significant effectiveness. <b>Nilutamide</b> has approximately the same affinity for the AR as 2-hydroxyflutamide. Similarly to 2-hydroxyflutamide, but unlike bicalutamide, <b>nilutamide</b> is able to weakly activate the AR at high concentrations.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} risk of hepatoxicity with <b>nilutamide,</b> though {{occurrence}} is {{very rare}} and the risk is significantly less than with flutamide. The incidence of abnormal liver function tests (e.g., elevated liver enzymes) is 2-3% with <b>nilutamide,</b> relative to 42-62% for flutamide. Fulminant hepatic failure has been reported for <b>nilutamide,</b> with fatal outcome. Similarly to flutamide, <b>nilutamide</b> exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in hepatocytes by inhibiting respiratory complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase) (though not respiratory complexes II, III, or IV) in the electron transport chain, resulting in reduced ATP and glutathione production and thus decreased hepatocyte survival. The nitro group of <b>nilutamide</b> has been theorized {{to be involved in}} both its hepatotoxicity and its pulmonary toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> {{was found}} to more than double luteinizing hormone (LH) and {{testosterone}} levels and to triple estradiol levels. In contrast, follicle-stimulating hormone levels remained unchanged. A slight but significant increase in prolactin levels was observed, and levels of sex hormone-binding globulin increased as well. The addition of ethinylestradiol to <b>nilutamide</b> therapy after 8 weeks abolished the increase in LH, testosterone, and estradiol levels and dramatically suppressed testosterone levels, into the castrate range. Both <b>nilutamide</b> alone and the combination of <b>nilutamide</b> and estrogen were regarded as resulting in effective and favorable antiandrogen action and feminization in transgender women.|$|E

5000|$|In {{terms of}} binding to the , the active (R)-enantiomer of {{bicalutamide}} has 4-fold greater affinity relative {{to that of}} hydroxyflutamide, the active metabolite of flutamide (a prodrug), and 5-fold higher affinity relative to that of <b>nilutamide.</b> In addition, bicalutamide possesses the longest half-life of the three drugs, with half-lives of 6-10 days for bicalutamide, 5-6 hours for flutamide and 8-9 hours for hydroxyflutamide, and 23-87 hours (mean 56 hours) for <b>nilutamide.</b> Due to the relatively short half-lives of flutamide and hydroxyflutamide, flutamide must be taken three times daily at 8-hour intervals, whereas bicalutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> may be taken once daily. For this reason, dosing of bicalutamide (and <b>nilutamide)</b> is more convenient than with flutamide. The greater [...] affinity and longer half-life of bicalutamide {{allow it to be}} used at relatively low dosages in comparison to flutamide (750-1500 mg/day) and <b>nilutamide</b> (150-300 mg/day) in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> is the drug's INN, USAN, and BAN.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> {{has been}} {{assessed}} {{in the treatment}} of acne and seborrhea in women in at least one small clinical study. The dosage used was 200 mg/day, and in the study, [...] "seborrhea and acne decreased markedly within the first month and practically disappeared after 2 months of <b>nilutamide</b> treatment." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although <b>nilutamide</b> {{has been}} found to be {{clinically}} effective for transgender hormone therapy, the use of <b>nilutamide</b> in the treatment of prostate cancer and particularly for other indications that are of a less dire nature is now discouraged due to the unique adverse effects of the drug, most importantly a high incidence of interstitial pneumonitis. This is an adverse effect that can progress to pulmonary fibrosis and can potentially be fatal. For this reason, newer, safer [...] like bicalutamide have largely replaced <b>nilutamide</b> and are now used for such indications instead.|$|E
50|$|General {{side effects}} of NSAAs, {{including}} <b>nilutamide,</b> include gynecomastia (40-80%), breast pain/tenderness, hot flashes (67%), depression, fatigue, sexual dysfunction (including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction), decreased muscle mass, and decreased bone mass with an associated increase in fractures. Also, nausea (24-27%), vomiting, constipation (20%), and insomnia (16%) may occur with <b>nilutamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> (brand names Nilandron, Anandron) is a nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) used in {{the treatment}} of metastatic prostate cancer. It acts as a selective antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR). Because most prostate cancer cells rely on androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for growth and survival, <b>nilutamide</b> can slow the progression of the disease and extend life in men with prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|In the {{clinical}} studies of <b>nilutamide</b> for transgender hormone therapy, the drug, without being combined with estrogen, induced observable signs of clinical feminization in young transgender women (age range 19-33 years) within 8 weeks, including breast development, decreased male-pattern hair, decreased spontaneous erections and sex drive, and positive psychological and emotional changes. Signs of breast development occurred in all subjects within 6 weeks and {{were associated with}} increased nipple sensitivity; along with decreased hair growth, these changes were the earliest signs of feminization. The drug more than doubled luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone levels and tripled estradiol levels (see below), {{and the addition of}} ethinylestradiol, a potent estrogen, to <b>nilutamide</b> therapy after 8 weeks of treatment abolished the increase in , testosterone, and estradiol levels and dramatically suppressed testosterone levels, into the castrate range. On the basis of these results, both <b>nilutamide</b> alone, and particularly the combination of <b>nilutamide</b> and an estrogen, were regarded as effective in terms of producing antiandrogen effects and feminization in transgender women.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core side}} effects of [...] such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and hot flashes occur at similar rates with the {{different}} drugs. Conversely, bicalutamide {{is associated with a}} significantly lower rate of diarrhea compared to flutamide. In fact, the incidence of diarrhea did not differ between the bicalutamide and placebo groups (6.3% vs. 6.4%, respectively) in the [...] trial, whereas diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of patients treated with flutamide. The rate of nausea and vomiting appears to be lower with bicalutamide and flutamide than with <b>nilutamide</b> (approximately 30% incidence of nausea with <b>nilutamide,</b> usually rated as mild-to-moderate). In addition, bicalutamide (and flutamide) is not associated with alcohol intolerance, visual disturbances, or a high rate of interstitial pneumonitis. In terms of toxicity and rare reactions, as described above, bicalutamide appears to have the lowest relative risks of hepatotoxicity and interstitial pneumonitis, with respective incidences far below those of flutamide and <b>nilutamide.</b> In contrast to flutamide and <b>nilutamide,</b> no specific complications have been linked to bicalutamide.|$|E
50|$|Like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide, <b>nilutamide</b> is able {{to cross}} the blood-brain-barrier and has central antiandrogen actions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> {{is known}} to inhibit several {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4, and can result in increased levels of medications that are metabolized by these enzymes. It has also been found to inhibit the enzyme CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) in vitro and thus the biosynthesis of androgens. However, <b>nilutamide</b> monotherapy significantly increases testosterone levels in vivo, so the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|From a {{theoretical}} standpoint (on {{the basis of}} structure-activity relationships), {{it has been suggested}} that flutamide, bicalutamide, and <b>nilutamide,</b> to varying extents, all have the potential to cause liver toxicity. However, in contrast to flutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and <b>nilutamide,</b> bicalutamide exhibits much less or no mitochondrial toxicity and inhibition of enzymes in the electron transport chain such as respiratory complex I (NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase), and this may be the reason for its much lower risk of hepatotoxicity in comparison. The activity difference may be related to the fact that flutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and <b>nilutamide</b> all possess a nitroaromatic group, whereas in bicalutamide, a cyano group is present in place of this nitro group, potentially reducing toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Enzalutamide is a {{synthetic}} diarylthiohydantoin, and is structurally related to earlier NSAAs such as flutamide, <b>nilutamide,</b> and bicalutamide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> shows {{unique and}} {{unfavorable}} tolerability and toxicity profiles, most importantly a {{high incidence of}} interstitial pneumonitis (which can progress to pulmonary fibrosis, a potentially fatal condition), and this has limited its clinical use. From a safety standpoint, bicalutamide is clinically preferred not only over <b>nilutamide</b> (due primarily to its risk of interstitial pneumonitis) but also flutamide (due to its high risk of hepatotoxicity) in choice of NSAA.|$|E
50|$|The main antiandrogens are {{cyproterone}} acetate, flutamide, <b>nilutamide,</b> bicalutamide, and enzalutamide {{which are}} all administered in oral pill form.|$|E
5000|$|Antiandrogens: apalutamide, bicalutamide, cimetidine, darolutamide, DIMP, enzalutamide, EPI-001, EPI-506, flutamide, hydroxyflutamide, {{inocoterone}}, inocoterone acetate, <b>nilutamide,</b> RU-58642, RU-58841, and topilutamide ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Nilutamide</b> has a {{half-life}} of 23-87 hours, {{with a mean}} of 56 hours, {{or about}} two days; this allows for once-daily administration. Steady state (plateau) levels of the drug are attained after two weeks of administration with a dosage of 150 mg twice daily (300 mg/day total). It is metabolized by CYP2C19, with at least five metabolites. Virtually all of the antiandrogenic activity of <b>nilutamide</b> comes from the parent drug (as opposed to metabolites).|$|E
5000|$|Flutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> are first-generation , {{similarly}} to bicalutamide, {{and all three}} drugs possess the same core mechanism of action of being selective [...] antagonists. However, bicalutamide is the most potent of the three, with the highest affinity for the [...] and the longest half-life, and is the safest, least toxic, and best-tolerated. For these reasons, bicalutamide has largely replaced flutamide and <b>nilutamide</b> in clinical use, and {{is by far the}} most widely used first-generation [...]|$|E
5000|$|First-generation [...] {{including}} bicalutamide, flutamide, and <b>nilutamide</b> are synthetic, nonsteroidal anilide (N-phenyl amide) derivatives {{and structural}} analogues of each other. Bicalutamide is a diaryl propionamide, while flutamide is a monoarylpropionamide and <b>nilutamide</b> is a hydantoin. Bicalutamide and flutamide, though not <b>nilutamide,</b> {{can also be}} classified as toluidides. All three of the compounds share a common 3-trifluoromethyl aniline moiety. Bicalutamide is a modification of flutamide in which a 4-fluoro phenyl sulfonyl moiety has been added and the nitro group on the original phenyl ring has been replaced with a cyano group. Topilutamide, also known as fluridil, is another [...] that is closely related structurally to the first-generation , but, in contrast to them, is not used {{in the treatment of}} prostate cancer and is instead used exclusively as a topical antiandrogen in the treatment of androgenic alopecia.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that hydroxyflutamide and <b>nilutamide,</b> in contrast to bicalutamide, have some ability to weakly activate the [...] at high concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Antiandrogens are {{medications}} such as flutamide, <b>nilutamide,</b> bicalutamide, enzalutamide, and cyproterone acetate {{that directly}} block {{the actions of}} testosterone and DHT within prostate cancer cells.|$|E
