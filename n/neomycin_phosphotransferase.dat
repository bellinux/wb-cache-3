Purified DNAs from B. circulans and the plasmid ColE 1 -ApR were digested with EcoRI endonuclease and the resulting fragments covalently joined with polynucleotide ligase. The recombined DNA was used to transform E. coli and ampicillin-neomycin resistant colonies were selected. Analysis of several clones indicated that neomycin resistance in the E. coli transformants was due to the presence of the B. circulans phosphotransferase gene.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glyoxalase I is a {{metalloenzyme}} of the glyoxalase pathway {{that plays}} {{a central role}} in eliminating the toxic metabolite methyglyoxal. The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani possesses a unique trypanothione dependent glyoxalase system. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of the L. donovani GLOI sequence predicted a mitochondrial targeting sequence, suggesting that the enzyme is likely to be targeted to the mitochondria. In order to determine definitively the intracellular localization of GLOI in L. donovani, a full-length GLOI gene was fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene to generate a chimeric construct. Confocal microscopy of L. donovani promastigotes carrying this chimeric construct and immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-GLOI antibodies demonstrated that GLOI is localized in the kinetoplast of the parasite apart from the cytosol. To study the physiological role of GLOI in Leishmania, we first created promastigote mutants heterozygous for GLOI by targeted gene replacement using either hygromycin or <b>neomycin</b> <b>phosphotransferases</b> as selectable markers. Heterozygous mutants of L. donovani display a slower growth rate, have lower glyoxalase I activity and have reduced ability to detoxify methylglyoxal in comparison to the wild-type parasites. Complementation of the heterozygous mutant with an episomal GLOI construct showed the restoration of heterozygous mutant phenotype nearly fully to that of the wild-type. Null mutants were obtained only after GLOI was expressed from an episome in heterozygous mutants. CONCLUSIONS: We for the first time report localization of GLOI in L. donovani in the kinetoplast. To study the physiological role of GLOI in Leishmania, we have generated GLOI attenuated strains by targeted gene replacement and report that GLOI is likely to be an important gene since GLOI mutants in L. donovani showed altered phenotype. The present data supports that the GLOI plays an essential role in the survival of this pathogenic organism and that inhibition of the enzyme potentiates the toxicity of methylglyoxal...|$|R
40|$|The P, V, and NP {{genes of}} the {{paramyxovirus}} simian virus 5 (SV 5) were cloned such that their expression was {{regulated by the}} tetracycline-controlled transactivator (M. Gossen and H. Bujard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 : 5547 - 5551, 1992), and mammalian cell lines that inducibly expressed individually the P, V, or NP protein or coexpressed the P plus NP or V plus NP proteins were isolated. A plasmid that expresses the tetracycline-controlled transactivator linked, via the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2 A cleavage peptide sequence, to the <b>neomycin</b> aminoglycoside <b>phosphotransferase</b> gene was constructed. Cells were cotransfected with this plasmid, and the appropriate responder plasmids and clonies were {{selected on the basis}} of their resistance to Geneticin (via the <b>neomycin</b> aminoglycoside <b>phosphotransferase</b> gene). The properties of these cell lines, in terms of the induction of the P, V, and NP genes, are described in detail. Both the P and V proteins were phosphorylated when expressed alone. In immunoprecipitation studies using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both the P and V proteins, a nonphosphorylated host cell protein with an estimated molecular weight of 150, 000 was coprecipitated with V but not P. Immunofluorescence data demonstrated that when expressed separately, the P protein had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, but the related V protein had both a nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution. The NP protein had a granular cytoplasmic distribution, giving rise to punctate and granular fluorescence. Coexpression of the NP and P proteins resulted in the accumulation of large cytoplasmic inclusion aggregates, similar to those visualized at late times in SV 5 -infected cells. Coexpression of V with NP led to a partial redistribution of the NP protein in that the NP protein had both a diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution in the presence of V, but no NP-V aggregates or inclusion bodies were visualized. Direct binding studies also revealed that NP bound to both P and V. For SV 5, these studies suggest that V may have a role in keeping NP soluble prior to encapsidation...|$|R

40|$|Gene {{amplification}} {{is frequently}} observed in Leishmania cells selected for drug resistance. By gene targeting we have tagged both alleles of the H locus of Leishmania tarentolae with the <b>neomycin</b> and hygromycin <b>phosphotransferase</b> genes (neo and hyg). Selection of these recombinant parasites for low level methotrexate resistance led to amplification of the H locus {{as part of}} linear amplicons. The availability of tags has permitted us to determine that both alleles can be amplified in the same cell and that chromosomal deletions are frequent. When methotrexate concentration was increased in subsequent selection steps, circles were observed in several mutants. We have introduced a hyg marker into linear amplicons to test whether the circles originated from linear amplicons. After selection with a high methotrexate concentration, circles with the hyg marker were observed, showing that circles can indeed be formed from linear amplicons.

40|$|Parasitic {{protozoa}} {{belonging to}} the order Kinetoplastida contain trypanothione as their major thiol. Trypanothione reductase (TR), the enzyme responsible for maintaining trypanothione in its reduced form, {{is thought to be}} central to the redox defence systems of trypanosomatids. To investigate further the physiological role of TR in Leishmania, we attempted to create TR-knockout mutants by gene disruption in L. donovani and L. major strains using the selectable markers <b>neomycin</b> and hygromycin <b>phosphotransferases.</b> TR is likely to be an important gene for parasite survival since all our attempts to obtain a TR null mutant in L. donovani failed. Instead, we obtained mutants with a partial trisomy for the TR locus where, despite the successful disruption of two TR alleles by gene targeting, a third TR copy was generated as a result of genomic rearrangements involving the translocation of a TR-containing region to a larger chromosome. Mutants of L. donovani and L. major possessing only one wild-type TR allele express less TR mRNA and have lower TR activity compared with wild-type cells carrying two copies of the TR gene. Significantly, these mutants show attenuated infectivity with a markedly decreased capacity to survive intracellularly within macrophages, provided that the latter are producing reactive oxygen intermediates...|$|R

Transfected cells can be passaged {{in the same manner as}} control cells and can be induced to differentiate into cysts, in which form they maintain resistance to neomycin G 418 for at least several weeks, although expression of <b>neomycin</b> <b>phosphotransferase</b> is repressed during encystment.

EGFP expression can also be driven by the cyst-specific CSP 21 gene promoter, which is completely repressed in growing cells but strongly induced in differentiating cells. Transfected cells maintain their phenotype for several weeks, even in the absence of neomycin G 418, suggesting that transfected genes are stably integrated within the genome.
