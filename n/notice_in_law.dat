40|$|Phyllis Coleman, Note to Athletes, NFL, and NBA: Dog Fighting is a Crime, Not a Sport, 3 Journal of Animal Law 2 ̆ 6 Ethics 85 (2009). Americans {{were finally}} forced {{to face the}} issue of animal abuse and {{professional}} athletes when investigators discovered 66 pit bulls, in addition to dog fighting equipment, at a home owned by 2 ̆ 2 pro football 2 ̆ 7 s most electrifying quarterback. 2 ̆ 2 Although Michael Vick insisted he did not live in the house, and initially denied knowledge of any such activity on his Virginia property, stories of his involvement continued to swirl around the Atlanta Falcons 2 ̆ 7 franchise player. On July 17, 2007, Vick and three others were indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} for competitive dog fighting, procuring and training pit bulls for fighting, and conducting an illegal enterprise across state lines. On August 27, 2007, Vick pled guilty to one count of conspiracy. Shortly thereafter, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Vick from the NFL indefinitely and without pay. Approximately a month after the federal guilty plea, a Surry County (Virginia) grand jury indicted Vick on one count of 2 ̆ 2 conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture. 2 ̆ 2 His jury trial, originally scheduled for April 2, 2008, had to be delayed until June 27 because of the difficulty of transporting federal prisoners back to the state to face charges. While Vick is probably the most famous sports figure to have been accused and/or convicted of fighting dogs, sadly there are many others who also participate. Nevertheless, the issue of players abusing animals has almost escaped discussion, or even <b>notice,</b> <b>in</b> <b>law</b> reviews. To fill the gap, this article grapples with important questions concerning athletes involved in illegal dog fighting. Part II includes a brief history, description, and analysis of dog fighting. Part III reviews relevant laws including the recently enacted federal Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act. However, {{despite the fact that the}} underlying reasons to criminalize the conduct are the same no matter who causes the harm, it appears that the legal system may treat professional athletes differently than others who fail to properly protect and care for dogs, cats, and other domesticated critters. If true, this means it is even more important that professional sports leagues step in and punish participants in these illegal competitions. Part IV provides examples of sports figures who exploit or otherwise injure dogs through training them, and forcing them, to fight. While no appellate decisions exist yet, this section reviews a number of incidents reported in the media. Finally, in seeking to fashion a just and fair response, Part V proposes a concrete solution that will not only punish the guilty player for his criminal acts, and his team if they knew about the problem and allowed him to continue on the field or court, but will also benefit the real victims, the animals...|$|E

According to Ukrayinska Pravda, the Venice Commission did not <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> the draft <b>law</b> of Kolesnichenko any {{guarantees}} of {{the protection of}} the Ukrainian language and later came to a decision that the bill is another [...] "pre-election tool" [...] for the Party of Regions. V. Kolesnichenko, {{one of the authors of}} the law, claimed the 2011 analysis of the Venice Commission was [...] "generally supportive". The opponents noted that the analysis contained strong criticism, specifically about the failure to protect the role of Ukrainian as the State language.|$|R
40|$|Criminal law has {{developed}} to prohibit {{new forms of}} intrusion on the autonomy and mental processes of others. Examples include modern understandings of fraud, extortion, and bribery, which pivot on the concepts of deception, coercion, and improper influence. Sometimes core offenses develop to include similar concepts, such as when reforms <b>in</b> the <b>law</b> of sexual assault make consent almost exclusively material. Many of these projects are laudable. But progressive programs <b>in</b> substantive criminal <b>law</b> can raise difficult problems of culpability. Modern iterations of criminal offenses often draw lines using concepts involving relative mental states among persons whose conduct is embedded within socially welcome activities. With such offenses, legal institutions struggle in borderline cases to locate sufficient fault to satisfy the demands of justification for punishment. This Article demonstrates this problem through exploration {{of the law of}} each of these offenses in modern form. To address the problem, the Article turns to criminal law theory, finding a connection between culpability and the principle of <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> criminal <b>law.</b> Rather than its absence serving to exculpate, notice can profitably be understood to inculpate. To manage the problem of culpability in modern crime, the Article concludes, legal institutions should attend more explicitly — in both criminalization and adjudication — to the questions whether the actor was aware of the normative wrongfulness of her conduct and, if not, whether punishment is justified on a negligence level of fault. This orientation is especially advisable when further expansive moves in American criminal justice are now difficult to justify...|$|R
40|$|The author {{examines}} {{legal regulation}} of holographic and written will made before witnesses which represent private and regular forms of wills <b>in</b> the Serbian <b>Law</b> and other modern European Laws. A special {{attention has been}} paid to issues related to the requirements that must be fulfilled so that a will may be valid, and the procedure of drafting wills in domestic legislation in order to recognize good normative solutions and certain weaknesses in the legislation, particularly when it comes to the fact that the will has a protective function. The comparative analysis of legal solutions dedicated to the above forms of wills focuses on the differences, common solutions and basic principles that modern European legislation uses when regulating the above mentioned forms of wills. In the conclusion of this work, the author highlights advantages and disadvantages of holographic and written will made before witnesses, examines the extent to which their normative regulation <b>in</b> the domestic <b>law</b> is similar to and different from the existing normative regulation of these forms of wills in other European legal systems, takes into account the advantages of certain legal solutions <b>noticed</b> <b>in</b> the comparative <b>law,</b> and suggests possible directions legal regulation of these forms of wills may take in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to compare}} the legal {{regulation}} of notice of termination of employment in the legal systems of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The thesis consists of the introduction, conclusion and six chapters, each of which contains a comparison of {{various aspects of the}} two regulations. The introduction sets out the reasons for which I chose this topic and the method of processing my thesis. The first chapter characterises <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> general, its cancellation and requirements, i. e. the written form and the delivery of the notice. The second chapter focuses on the notice given by an employee and on particularities of the Czech regulation of the notice related to the transfer of rights and obligations arising from the employment relationship and the counterpart of such <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> Slovak labour <b>law,</b> which is the termination by agreement. Notice given by the employer is discussed in the third chapter. This chapter consists of three parts. The first part highlights the comparison of individual reasons of the notice, the second focuses on cases <b>in</b> which the <b>notice</b> is prohibited, and the third on the substantive conditions of the notice. The fourth chapter is divided into two parts. The first part discusses the differences in the regulation of redundancy payment accordance to the Labour [...] ...|$|R
60|$|These, {{with some}} {{regulations}} for payment of tithes and Church dues, {{and for the}} discovery and pursuit of stealers of cattle, comprise almost all the titles deserving <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> the Saxon <b>laws.</b> <b>In</b> those <b>laws</b> there are frequently to be observed particular institutions, well and prudently framed; {{but there is no}} appearance of a regular, consistent, and stable jurisprudence. However, it is pleasing to observe something of equity and distinction gradually insinuating itself into these unformed materials, and some transient flashes of light striking across the gloom which prepared for the full day that shone out afterwards. The clergy, who kept up a constant communication with Rome, and were in effect the Saxon legislators, could not avoid gathering some informations from a law which never was perfectly extinguished {{in that part of the}} world. Accordingly we find one of its principles had strayed hither so early as the time of Edric and Lothaire.[85] There are two maxims[86] of civil <b>law</b> <b>in</b> their proper terms in the code of Canute the Great, who made and authorized that collection after his pilgrimage to Rome; and at this time, it is remarkable, we find the institutions of other nations imitated. In the same collection there is an express reference to the laws of the Werini. From hence it is plain that the resemblance between the polity of the several Northern nations did not only arise from their common original, but also from their adopting, in some cases, the constitutions of those amongst them who were most remarkable for their wisdom.|$|R

5000|$|An {{obituary}} <b>in</b> the Cambridge <b>Law</b> Journal {{paid tribute}} to [...] "a legacy of outstanding scholarship. He reshaped administrative law as an academic subject in the United Kingdom, and his wide-ranging contributions to the literature of public law were consistently incisive and constructive. His style was both elegant and distinctive: like Blackstone - as Jeremy Bentham put it - he spoke {{the language of the}} scholar and the gentleman". The Cambridge Law Journal noted that de Smith [...] "was at his happiest in postgraduate teaching and the supervision of research students, but he cared deeply about all aspects of teaching and tripos reform ... Those that knew him will remember him as a somewhat reserved person with a quiet sense of humour, though they will not have known that the appearance of reserve was the result of deafness caused by his artillery service in the war; he was invariably encouraging to his students and younger colleagues and he was generous in his assessment of others". A <b>notice</b> <b>in</b> the Modern <b>Law</b> Review, a journal for which he served as secretary for many years, gave the following assessment:"His work <b>in</b> administrative <b>law</b> has been of seminal significance {{in the development of the}} principles of judicial review by courts throughout the Commonwealth. With characteristic modesty, he was astonished by the success of his major books. ... Stanley de Smith was a scholar and legal writer of exceptional quality. He was shy and gave a—perhaps deceptive—impression of diffidence, but his conversation was enlivened by a dry humour, sometimes rather reminiscent of his hero, Maitland, with whom as a constitutional lawyer he will certainly stand comparison".|$|R
