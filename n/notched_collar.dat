5000|$|Shirt dresses were {{sometimes}} called [...] "shirtwaist dresses" [...] {{when they were}} fashionable during the 1950s. The 1950s version of the shirtdress was launched as part of Christian Dior's post-World War II [...] "New Look" [...] couture designs, with a full skirt held up by wearing a crinoline. They often featured a <b>notched</b> <b>collar,</b> and elbow-length sleeves with cuffs. More informal versions of the shirtdress, made of cotton, but retaining the full skirt and collar, became a staple part of many women's wardrobes during the 1950s, with designers such as Anne Fogarty becoming known for their versions of this style. A 1957 issue of Life magazine includes {{a photo of a}} typical cotton shirtdress selling for $25 in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Frock coats (in French redingotes) {{increasingly}} replaced tail coats for informal day wear. [...] They were calf length, {{and might}} be double-breasted. Shoulder emphasis fell lower on the arm; shoulders were sloped and puffed sleeve heads gradually shrank and then disappeared. Waistcoats or vests were single- or double-breasted, with rolled shawl or (later) <b>notched</b> <b>collars,</b> and extremely tight through the waist. Waistcoats were sometimes worn two at time, in contrasting colors. Corsets or corset-like garments were worn by many men to draw in the waistline.

25|$|During the 1840s, men wore tight-fitting, calf length frock {{coats and}} a {{waistcoat}} or vest. The vests were single- or double-breasted, with shawl or <b>notched</b> <b>collars,</b> {{and might be}} finished in double points at the lowered waist. For more formal occasions, a cutaway morning coat was worn with light trousers during the daytime, and a dark tail coat and trousers was worn in the evening. The shirts were made of linen or cotton with low collars, occasionally turned down, and were worn with wide cravats or neck ties. Trousers had fly fronts, and breeches were used for formal functions and when horseback riding. Men wore top hats, with wide brims in sunny weather.|$|R
2500|$|Shirts of linen or cotton {{featured}} high upstanding or turnover collars The {{trend of}} detachable shirt collars and cuffs (although first appearing in men's fashion in the 1820s) became highly popularized {{during this time}} period. [...] The newly fashionable four-in-hand neckties were square or rectangular, folded into a narrow strip and tied in a bow, or folded on the diagonal and tied in a knot with the pointed ends sticking out to form [...] "wings". Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted, were worn for business occasions, over waistcoats or vests with lapels and <b>notched</b> <b>collars.</b> [...] Waistcoats were still cut straight across at the waist in front in 1850, but gradually became longer; the fashion for wearing the bottom button undone for ease when sitting lead to the pointed-hemmed waistcoat later in the century.|$|R

50|$|The name {{originated}} from {{the practice of}} gentlemen {{in the nineteenth century}} riding a horse in the morning with a cutaway front, single breasted morning coat. The modern twentieth century morning dress was originally a more casual form of half dress, but as the nineteenth century progressed it gradually became acceptable to wear it in more formal situations instead of a frock coat. In the Edwardian era it took over in popularity from the frock coat as the standard daytime form of men's full dress. When it was regarded as a more casual coat, it was common to see it made with step <b>collars</b> (<b>notched</b> lapels in American English), but as it took over from the frock coat in formality it began to be made with the more formal pointed lapels (peaked lapels in American English).|$|R
