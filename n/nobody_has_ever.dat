5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 {{edition of}} its World Development Indicators, the World Bank made a {{decision}} to no longer distinguish between “developed” and “developing” countries in the presentation of its data. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> agreed on a definition for these terms in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Philip's {{family have}} issued {{numerous}} appeals for information. A reconstruction {{took place in}} 2007 and was later televised on RTÉ One, while a reward of €10,000 has also been offered. The book, When Heaven Waits, published in 2007, featured an interview with Philip's mother. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been arrested. The case remains open.|$|E
25|$|The cream-coloured van {{was spotted}} on 22 March by a {{helicopter}} patrol, {{but before the}} area could be secured {{for the police to}} investigate it, the van was destroyed by fire. It was found that it had been stolen from a church car park on 18 March. Although the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for carrying out the attack, <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been charged with the killings.|$|E
25|$|This {{striving for}} {{perfection}} is very {{evident in his}} portrait drawings, where he searches with his brush {{for just the right}} line for the sitter's profile. The critical faculty in making this choice and his perception of its potency in communicating decisively the sitter's character is a true measure of Holbein's supreme greatness as a portrait painter. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> surpassed the revealing profile and stance in his portraits: through their telling use, Holbein still conveys across the centuries the character and likeness of his sitters with an unrivalled mastery.|$|E
60|$|And {{when they}} {{answered}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> before seen such lovely princesses he seemed quite annoyed.|$|R

500|$|During production, Lumet {{felt that}} the {{finished}} film would be [...] "an absolutely unique experience that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed before." [...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there {{was nothing to be}} gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even though our concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – {{we wanted to make sure}} that we never overlapped in any area." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, Bax {{composed}} {{the last four}} of his seven symphonies. Other works from the decade include the popular Overture to a Picaresque Comedy (1930), several works for chamber groups, including a nonet (1930), a string quintet (1933), an octet for horn, piano, and strings (1934) and his third and last string quartet (1936). The Cello Concerto (1932) was commissioned by and dedicated to Gaspar Cassadó, who quickly dropped the work from his repertoire. Although Beatrice Harrison championed the concerto in the 1930s and 1940s, Bax said, [...] "The fact that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> taken up this work {{has been one of}} the major disappointments of my musical life".|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} {{the outer}} limits of Castle Rock fortress, Ryu {{encounters}} Foster, who {{was the head of the}} CIA's Special Auxiliary Unit in the first Ninja Gaiden game, via a video image. After saying that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> made it through the fortress' defenses alive, Ryu inquires about Irene, to which Foster replies: [...] "I don't know what you're talking about." [...] Ryu vows to push on, Upon reaching the foundation of Castle Rock fortress, Ryu encounters his [...] "original", or a person designed to look like Ryu, and finds out that it was he who killed Irene.Look-alike: [...] "Sooo...What are you going to do about it?!" [...] They both thrust themselves at each other, and afterwards look-alike tells Ryu that he has gained all of his powers. The look-alike flees, saying that Foster ordered him not to eliminate Ryu quite yet.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} help laughing. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{detected}} anything amiss with Lady Jaquetta Trevor's spirits, but that they were too high at times.|$|R
60|$|I replied, as I {{usually did}} {{whenever}} I had a chance, that <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> loved anybody else as I loved Dora. Traddles {{came to my}} assistance with a confirmatory murmur.|$|R
50|$|During the 1988-89 season she won 14 World Cup races. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{achieved}} {{this before}} (the Swede Ingemar Stenmark once won 13 races), and her record {{has yet to}} be beaten since then.|$|R
500|$|David {{consciously}} {{followed in}} the path of Hilda Leyel and Dorothy Hartley in researching British ingredients and dishes. [...] Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as [...] "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" [...] before [...] "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".|$|E
2500|$|Huysmans {{predicted}} {{his novel}} {{would be a}} failure with the public and critics: [...] "It {{will be the biggest}} fiasco of the year — but I don't care a damn! It will be something <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> done before, and I shall have said what I want to say..." [...] However, when it appeared in May, 1884, the book created a storm of publicity. Though many critics were scandalised, it appealed to a young generation of aesthetes and writers.|$|E
2500|$|Dawkins then quizzes Father Liam Griffin {{about the}} {{complete}} number [...] of miraculous cures which {{have taken place}} over the years. Griffin reports 66 declared miracles and about 2,000 unexplained cures (out of approximately 80,000 sick visitors per year over more than a century) but claims that millions more have been healed spiritually. Dawkins remains sceptical, and remarks afterwards that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> reported the miraculous re-growing of a severed leg, the 'cures' invariably comprise afflictions that could have improved without any spiritual intervention whatsoever.|$|E
50|$|After 27 stagings of {{the winter}} event, Wilson still claimed <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{finished}} the course according to his extremely demanding rules. The race, and its summer equivalent, has suffered two fatalities during its history.|$|R

I was so scared.", [...] "the most {{frightening}} experience of my life.", [...] "I will never forget that day face down in a field {{for the rest of}} my life." [...] Speaking about the sound of bullets flying overhead, Kemp stated [...] "you realise that <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> come close to replicating the sound of bullets cutting through the air in films or on television". However, Kemp stated the hardest thing he had to do in the series was not to be shot at in Afghanistan, but to interview the families of the dead men, stating: [...] "I'm not ashamed to say I bawled my eyes out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two cowboys, a {{newcomer}} and an old-timer, are drinking beer {{in front of}} a saloon. Suddenly, there is a clatter of hooves, a great cloud of dust, and something moving extremely fast from one end of town to the other. The newcomer looks at the old-timer, but seeing no reaction, decides to let the matter drop. However, several minutes later, the same cloud of dust, accompanied by the clatter of hooves, rapidly proceeds in the other direction. Not being able to see what's behind the dust, and unable to contain his curiosity any longer, the newcomer asks: [...] "OK, what the hell was that, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Oh, that's Uncatchable Joe. <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> managed to catch him, Harry." [...] / [...] "Why? Is he so fast, Bill?" [...] / [...] "Nope, it's just because nobody needs him, Harry." [...] ('Variant: [...] "Nobody cares about him") ...|$|E
