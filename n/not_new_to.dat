5|$|Calleia had {{his first}} real role as a heavy in Small Miracle, and his success in the play was {{responsible}} for his move to Hollywood. Calleia's contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer permitted him a hiatus of six months a year, to continue his stage work. He was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, Public Hero No. 1 (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of The New York Times {{as one of the}} year's ten best male performances.|$|E
5|$|This {{ordnance}} {{duty was}} <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> {{him since he}} had been {{closely associated with the}} development of small arms marksmanship within the Marine Corps. In 1921, he had been a firing member of the winning Marine Corps Team at the National Matches at Camp Perry, Ohio. In 1927, 1930, and 1931, he served with the rifle and pistol teams as assistant coach. During the regional matches of 1932 and 1933, he acted as team coach and captain, respectively. Upon the resumption of the National Matches in 1935, he was captain of the Marine Corps national rifle and pistol teams of 1935 and 1936, winning the national trophies in both years.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} Maya, or the {{principle}} of illusion, is <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> oriental philosophy. The concept appears at least {{as early as the}} works of Indian philosopher Adi Shankara writing in the 9th century. Meher Baba makes a distinction, however, from the traditional interpretation of Maya as illusion itself, and says that it is that principle that causes one to be deceived into seeing the false as real.|$|E
25|$|Assuming {{that these}} reconstructions {{accurately}} reflect what Hipparchus wrote in On Sizes and Distances, then {{this work was}} a remarkable accomplishment. This approach of setting limits on an unknown physical quantity was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> Hipparchus (see Aristarchus of Samos. Archimedes also {{did the same with}} pi), but in those cases, the bounds reflected the inability to determine a mathematical constant to an arbitrary precision, not uncertainty in physical observations.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{smelting}} was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Sussex Weald: the Romans had a forge at Oldlands in Buxted, {{where their}} coins have been found. But the large-scale forging of weaponry was new. In {{a very short}} period of time the English made themselves masters of the art of gun-making. The Sussex landscape is sprinkled with names redolent of the forges: Furnace Wood, Furnace Pond, Minepit Wood, Little Forge, Culver Wood, Slag Meadow, Huggett's Furnace, and Hammerpond.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, growing {{frustration}} due to {{shortages and}} waiting hours in long lines for products led to looting throughout Venezuela. According to the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, hundreds of events involving looting and looting attempts {{occurred in the}} country {{in the first half of}} the year. It was also stated that the looting was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the country, but had been increasing throughout the year of 2015. Looters show signs of “desperation and discomfort” and resort to looting because they are “frustrated by the inability to find basic goods.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Challenger 600 lies in Canadair’s {{purchase}} of a concept for a business jet aircraft, the LearStar 600 from the American inventor and aircraft developer Bill Lear. However, Lear had practically no influence on the ensuing development and design of the aircraft. Even the name LearStar was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> this concept, since Lear had long before used the name for his conversion of Lockheed Lodestars into business transports. Thus, Canadair quickly abandoned the name LearStar and adopted the name Challenger.|$|E
25|$|The {{innovations}} in education raised tender social issues in Tunisia. Yet many of such controversies were <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the French, whose own educational institutions had met fundamental change during the 19th century. As France {{had come to}} develop and employ new technologies and the learning of the industrial age, French schooling adapted, and also became open to scrutiny. The balance between the teaching of traditional morality versus modern utilitarian skills, as well as exactly how and which morals to teach, became greatly contested {{in light of the}} wider French debate between religious versus secular values; it involved left-republican anticlerical politics. Similar issues arose later in Tunisia, including the views of the national movement.|$|E

25|$|Contacts between Asia and the West already dated back {{hundreds}} of years, especially between the Papacy and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Numerous traders – most famously Marco Polo – had traveled between {{eastern and western}} Eurasia. Christianity was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Mongols, as many had practiced Christianity of the Church of the East since the 7th century (see Christianity among the Mongols). However, {{the overthrow of the}} Mongol Yuan Dynasty by the Ming in 1368 resulted in a strong assimilatory pressure on China's Muslim, Jewish, and Christian communities, and outside influences were forced out of China. By the 16th century, there is no reliable information about any practicing Christians remaining in China.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbers and}} {{effectiveness}} of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century: payrolls were inflated so that pay could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold, their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities, and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill. However, , gross corruption, and occasional ineffectiveness were <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the Roman army; {{there is no consensus}} whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376. Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to physical size or strength. Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies, Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost {{to the end of the}} fourth century.|$|E
25|$|Walker was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> {{the world}} of business. Since his {{migration}} to Detroit he {{had been involved in}} several different projects. In his earlier days he worked as a grocery clerk from 1838 until 1845 for several different employers. Eventually, after being involved in the grocery business for several years, he took it upon himself to begin operating a grocery store of his own in 1846 which did not last. Following his work as a clerk, Walker was employed at the firm of Ingersoll and Kirby, a leather and leather goods business. Through this, he gained his first knowledge into the business world. By 1845, Walker saved enough money as a clerk to invest in a business, the firm of Walker and Parker, which specialized in tanning and leather sales. However, this partnership dissolved in 1846, and Walker returned to the grocery business. Eventually, the same tannery business that he invested in was burned down in 1848.|$|E

25|$|However, these {{expectations}} were not realised in practice, {{and in many}} regions of Bengal, the peasants bore {{the brunt of the}} increased demand, there being little protection for their traditional rights in the new legislation. Forced labour of the peasants by the zamindars became more prevalent as cash crops were cultivated to meet the Company revenue demands. Although commercialised cultivation was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the region, it had now penetrated deeper into village society and made it more vulnerable to market forces. The zamindars themselves were often unable to meet the increased demands that the Company had placed on them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of their lands were auctioned during the first three decades following the permanent settlement. The new owners were often Brahmin and Kayastha employees of the Company who had a good grasp of the new system, and, in many cases, some had prospered under it.|$|E
25|$|One cannot {{speak of}} fashion trends without {{mentioning}} {{the importance of}} hair styles, particularly for women. In {{the past few years}} there has been a resurgence of the asymmetrical hair cut with a contemporary spin. Stars such as Rihanna, Cassie and Kelis have all dared to be different by setting the new trend of the half-shaven head. The reemergence of Adidas track jackets and the use of fashion scarves have been some of the latest trends to hit the hip hop fashion scene. Adidas track suits are certainly <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> hip hop culture as they have been around essentially since commercialized hip hop was created, however they have recently once again become popular. Fashion scarves have also become popularized in recent years. Kanye West is the most recent artist to launch his own line of products by selling decorative scarves with provocative depictions, named Risque Scarves. Skateboarding fashion has been used in the Hip-Hop scene since the early 2010s including Knit Caps, Bonnets, Fitted Pants or Shorts, Vans, Nike SB (Skateboarding), Shirts with sleeves and Printed Tees (brands like OBEY, Supreme, Stussy, Adidas, Supra, Circa, DC, RDS and Emericas). Chris Brown, Tyler The Creator & Lil Wayne wear these on their music videos & concerts.|$|E
25|$|Gowen never {{completely}} {{gave up the}} practice of law. A notable instance was during the run up to the Reading's May 1880 bankruptcy: in March Gowen was in Harrisburg prosecuting bribery cases {{on behalf of the}} state of Pennsylvania, growing out of the state's Railroad Riots Act investigations, and from Gowen's perspective an extension of his ongoing legal wranglings against the allied activities of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Standard Oil. Gowen was president of the Reading Railroad and also had a history of involvement in civic matters. He had been a Democratic representative to the state constitutional convention in 1873 and had been a board of governors member of the Philadelphia Reform Club. As well, also in the run up to the railroad's 1880 bankruptcy, he had lent his name in support of one side of a fight for control of the state Democratic convention. At another point during his presidency his name was rumored as a possible Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania governor. In his forced retirement from the active affairs of the Reading, Gowen spent time composing limericks and also translating German poetry. Involvement with literature was <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> him — recall his founding role in the Pottsville Literary Society decades before; and he was well versed enough in the stage to include lengthy descriptions of two plays in his speech at one of the Molly Maguire trials.|$|E

Kathy Behrens, NBA president of social responsibility and player programs, recently commented on White saying the league has “great respect for Royce speaking about his struggles.” She says the NBA is <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the issue but has “a growing understanding {{of the importance of the}} subject.” ...|$|E
500|$|For season three, Jonathan {{also has}} to deal with his {{emerging}} heart problems. For Schneider, the [...] "treatments" [...] and [...] "cures" [...] that his character underwent were all for nothing, as the actor believes that Jonathan's heart attack at the end of [...] "Hereafter" [...] was less of a real heart attack and more of Jor-El trying to get Jonathan's attention. A heart condition is <b>not</b> <b>new</b> <b>to</b> the character, as it has been used in previous incarnations, like Glenn Ford's portrayal of Jonathan Kent in Richard Donner's Superman, as well as the comic books. In contrast to those versions, it was Smallville that tied his heart condition to a deal that he makes with Jor-El. When the moment came for his character to die, Schneider considers the event an [...] "empowering death", which he likens to John Wayne's character death as Wil Andersen in The Cowboys.|$|E
