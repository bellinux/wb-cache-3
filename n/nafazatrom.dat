40|$|<b>Nafazatrom,</b> an {{antithrombotic}} and antimetastatic agent {{containing a}} pyrazolone func-tionality, is a reducing substrate for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase. <b>Nafazatrom</b> inhibits the hydroperoxide-dependent oxidation of phenylbuta-zone, stimulates {{the reduction of}} 15 -hydroperoxy- 5, 8, 11, 13 -eicosatetraenoic acid, and is oxidized by microsomal or purified enzyme preparations from ram seminal vesicles. Consonant {{with the effects of}} other peroxidase-reducing substrates, <b>nafazatrom</b> stimu-lates the oxygenation of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin endoperoxides by the cycloox-ygenase component of PGH synthase. In addition, <b>nafazatrom</b> causes an elevation in the levels of 6 -keto-prostaglandin F 1, 1, the non-enzymatic hydrolysis product of prostacyclin (PGI 2) biosynthesized from arachidonic acid by ram seminal vesicle microsomes. Eleva-tion of PGI 2 biosynthetic capacity by <b>nafazatrom</b> occurs under conditions in which prostaglandin endoperoxide biosynthesis is maximal, suggesting that <b>nafazatrom</b> has a stimulatory effect on the conversion of prostaglandin endoperoxides to PGI 2. <b>Nafazatrom</b> has no effect on the ability of ram seminal vesicle microsomes to convert PGH 2 to PGI 2 but protects microsomal PGI 2 synthase from inactivation by 15 -hydroperoxy- 5, 8, 11, 13...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>nafazatrom</b> on {{leukocyte}} function in vitro and in vivo {{were related to}} its ability to salvage ischemic myocardium in an occlusion-reperfusion model of myocardial injury in the anesthetized dog. <b>Nafazatrom</b> (0. 4 - 75 microM) produced dose-related inhibition in vitro of neutrophil aggregation, superoxide anion generation, arachidonic acid metabolism, and, to a lesser extent, the release of beta-glucuronidase. In contrast, <b>nafazatrom</b> (0. 4 - 37. 5 microM) did not substantially influence platelet aggregation or the platelet metabolism of arachidonic acid. In vivo <b>nafazatrom</b> (10 mg/kg, po) reduced infarct size from 58 +/- 3 % of the risk area (mean +/- SEM, n = 9) in control dogs to 23 +/- 2 % of the risk area (n = 9, P less than 0. 01). <b>Nafazatrom</b> also reduced the incidence of accompanying arrhythmias. Nafazatrom-induced myocardial salvage {{was not associated with}} any hemodynamic changes; moreover, it was independent of platelets, since thrombocytopenia did not prevent <b>nafazatrom</b> from exerting a protective effect. Measurements of the neutrophil-specific myeloperoxidase enzyme in ischemic myocardium indicate that the smaller infarct size in dogs treated with <b>nafazatrom</b> is accompanied by diminished leukocyte infiltration. Thus, the ability of <b>nafazatrom</b> to inhibit neutrophil function in vitro and cell infiltration in vivo may underly its myocardial-protective effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral <b>nafazatrom</b> (Bay g 6575, 2 X 3 g) or placebo on inhaled antigen {{challenge}} was assessed in a double-blind study.

Neither <b>nafazatrom</b> nor placebo had any effect on baseline lung function or that after challenge. Leukotriene B 4 was generated by ex vivo stimulus of blood with ionophore A 23187, and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.) -radioimmunoassay. No inhibition of LTB 4 formation occurred ex vivo following oral <b>nafazatrom,</b> although addition of 10 (- 5) M <b>nafazatrom</b> to blood in vitro significantly inhibited LTB 4 release. Peak plasma <b>nafazatrom</b> levels during the study ranged from 3. 3 X 10 (- 7) M to 1. 47 X 10 (- 6) M which are below the concentration (10 (- 5) M) at which significant 5 -lipoxygenase inhibition occurs in vitro.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>nafazatrom,</b> a new {{antithrombotic}} agent, was studied in a canine model of regional myocardial ischemia. <b>Nafazatrom</b> was administered 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 h for 48 h. After 24 h of drug or placebo administration, animals underwent 90 min of occlusion of the proximal eft circumflex coronary artery followed by gradual reperfusion {{over a period}} of 30 min. Twenty-four hours later, the animals were sacrificed and infarct size was determined by histochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Nafazatrom-treated animals had a significant reduction in infarct size expressed as a percent of the anatomical area at risk for infarction: 21 + 5 % in the treated group vs. 41 + 5 % in the control group (X + S. E. M., P < 0. 05). Histological examination confirmed the gross results of postmortem histochemical staining. Salvage of ischemically jeopardized tissue appeared to be unrelated to myocardial oxygen demand as there were no hemodynamic differences between groups. The beneficial effects of <b>nafazatrom</b> are presumably related to a limitation of autolytic processes on the heart during and after ischemia s a result of the drug's ability to inhibit lipoxygenase and to prevent he enzymatic degradation of prostacyclin. <b>Nafazatrom</b> Myocardial ischemia Myocardial infarction I...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nafazatrom</b> (Bay g- 6575) is {{a potent}} {{antithrombotic}} agent which has been suggested to stimulate prostacyclin (PGI 2) release from the Vascular wall. This study demonstrates that <b>nafazatrom</b> inhibits 1 5 -hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (1 5 -OH PGDH) of bovine lung and Vascular wall. As 1 5 -OH PGDH, the key prostaglandin (PG) catabolizing enzyme, mac-tivates PGI 2 as well as PGE 2 and PGF 25, inhibition of this enzyme can result in increased levels of PGI 2. <b>Nafazatrom,</b> in the micromolar range, inhibits the metabolism of PGs by 15 -OH PGDH in a dose-dependent manner.

40|$|An in vivo {{model of}} {{coronary}} artery thrombosis in the conscious dog {{was used to}} evaluate the potential antithrombotic effect of <b>nafazatrom</b> (BAYg 6575). A silver wire electrode was implanted in the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and was used at a later time to deliver a 50 uA anodal current for 24 hours to the intimal surface of the vessel. The resulting injury to the endothelium was accompanied by the adhesion, aggregation, and subsequent formation of an occlusive thrombus in the LCX of vehicle-treated dogs. <b>Nafazatrom</b> was given as an intravenous dose of 1 mg/kg for 48 hours, before anodal stimulation of the coronary artery was initiated, and was repeated every 6 hours during anodal stimulation for a total treatment period of 72 hours. As compared to vehicle-treated control dogs, the dogs treated with <b>nafazatrom</b> had smaller thrombi, preservation of coronary blood flow, a lesser degree of ischemic injury in the myocardial region subserved by the LCX, and less frequent premature ventricular complexes during the final 12 hours of the study period. Concomitant ex vivo platelet aggregation studies revealed significant inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to collagen and adenosine diphosphate in drug-treated dogs.

In addition, by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) we have profiled the metabolism of AA by macrophages that are isolated from granulomatous foci, and have biochemically characterized the in vitro specificity and activity of selected CO and LO inhibitors. The development of hypersensitivity-type pulmonary granulomas in mice was dramatically suppressed by inhibitors with anti-LO activity (nordihydroguairetic acid (NDGA), <b>nafazatrom,</b> and BW 755 c) in a dose-dependent manner, while indomethacin, which is primarily CO-selective, had no significant effect.

FPL 55712 and piriprost appeared to act as pharmacological antagonists because they rapidly reduced tracheal tone established by OA. The prolonged phase (i. e. greater than 10 min post-challenge) of airways contractions induced by OA is assumed to be lipoxygenase-dependent and was inhibited by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), FPL 55712, <b>nafazatrom</b> and benoxaprofen, in order of potency. Piriprost had similar inhibitory effects on the trachea, but not on lung parenchyma. The inhibitory effects of NDGA and FPL 55712 were reduced, and those of <b>nafazatrom</b> increased by indomethacin. Indomethacin decreased the inhibitory effect of piriprost on the trachea, but facilitated inhibition by this agent on the parenchyma. A roughly similar pattern was seen on A 23187 -induced contractions, but FPL 55712 did not modify these contractions and benoxaprofen enhanced the response of the trachea. BW 755 C enhanced the overall contractile response of OA- and A 23187 -induced tracheal contractions (but not parenchymal contractions) in a bell-shaped manner, an effect not seen in the presence of indomethacin. This indicated that BW 755 C could be acting as a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor. The results suggested that, although inhibitors of the lipoxygenase pathway were partially effective in inhibiting the contractions of the airways induced by OA or A 23187, other mediators in addition to those of the lipoxygenase pathway contribute to these contractions.

40|$|Responses to arachidonate were {{examined}} in rings with and without epithelium of lobar, segmental, and subsegmental canine bronchi. Arachidonate evoked epithelium-dependent relaxations, which were less pronounced in subsegmental bronchi and abolished by indomethacin and meclofenamate. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and <b>nafazatrom</b> reduced epithelium-dependent relaxations only in lobar but unsmashed epithelium-independent relaxations to arachidonate in all bronchi. Prostaglandin E 2 and prostacyclin relaxed all tissues similarly. In lobar bronchi without epithelium, basal release of prostaglandin E 2 was reduced by indomethacin but unaffected by NDGA. Arachidonate augmented prostaglandin E 2 release more in subsegmental than in lobar bronchi with epithelium; in bronchi without epithelium the rise was absent (lobar) or attenuated (subsegmental). Arachidonate augmented the release of 6 -ketoprostaglandin F(1 α) more in lobar bronchi with than without epithelium; this was inhibited by indomethacin, but not NDGA. Thus arachidonate releases prostalglandin E 2 (possibly produced by cyclooxygenase inaccessible to inhibitors and activated by lipoxygenase products) but not prostacyclin from the epithelium.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an experimental model {{for the study of}} local prostaglandin production by platelets and the vessel wall following stimulation 'in vivo'. A nylon thread was inserted into the external jugular vein of rabbits; its presence did not induce an occluding thrombus. Thromboxane (TXB 2) values in the blood, sampled through the facial vein, immediately distal to the stimulus, rose and remained high for at least 4 hr, while 6 -keto prostaglandin (PG) F 1 alpha levels, after a first increase, gradually returned to normal ('exhaustion' of the endothelial cells?). No changes were observed in the contralateral jugular vein without thread. After infusion via the femoral vein of 10 mg/kg dazoxiben, a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, local TXB 2 production was completely abolished, whereas 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha formation no longer returned to basal values, but tended to increase. This leads to the conclusion that upon inhibition of TXB 2 formation endoperoxide metabolism is reoriented 'in vivo' towards prostacyclin, and this mainly at the site where platelets are activated. Injection of 100 mg/kg lysine acetylsalicylic acid resulted in complete inhibition of TXB 2 and 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha formation, the latter, however, slowly recovering with time. The administration of <b>nafazatrom</b> to the animals did not influence the local TXB 2 changes, but partially prevented the decline of 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha with time.

40|$|Activation (defined as {{lysosomal}} enzyme secretion and {{generation of}} O(2) of rat neutrophils has been measured {{with the use}} of varying doses of soluble stimuli (phorbol myristate acetate (PMA); calcium ionophore A 23187; and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenyl-alanine (FMLP] and particulate agents (immune complexes and zymosan particles). With either the calcium ionophore or the chemotactic peptide (FMLP), substantial enzyme release occurred, but the amount of O(2) produced was very small. Cytochalasin B greatly enhanced the enzyme release response to the chemotactic peptide but had little effect on neutrophil responses to other soluble stimuli. The cell response to PMA resulted in the greatest production of O(2) with significant enzyme secretion. When cell stimulation with insoluble stimuli (immune complexes or zymosan particles) was studied, significant amounts of enzyme release occurred in parallel with the generation of substantial amounts of O(2). The presence of cytochalasin B enhanced the cell responses to immune complexes but had an inhibitory effect on zymosan-induced responses. As expected, the amount of lysozyme secreted by stimulated rat neutrophils tended to exceed the amount of beta-glucuronidase released from the same cells. Neutrophil responses were investigated in the presence of drugs that were demonstrated in the rat neutrophil to inhibit either the lipoxygenase or the cyclooxygenase pathway. Inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase pathway (indomethacin, piroxicam, ibuprofen, BW 755 C), with few exceptions, consistently enhanced the enzyme secretion response, while effects on O(2) generation were less clear-cut but tended to be predominantly inhibitory. Drugs with inhibitory effects on the lipoxygenase pathway (nordihydroguaiaretic acid and <b>nafazatrom)</b> had significant inhibitory effects on both enzyme secretion as well as generation of O(2). These data suggest that activation responses (enzyme secretion and O(2) generation) of rat neutrophils may be dissociated (ie, one not always accompanying the other). Further, it appears that neutrophil activation, as defined by enzyme secretion, is enhanced by products of the lipoxygenase pathway and suppressed by products of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Generation of O(2) is not affected in such a clear-cut manner. Taken together the data suggest that enzyme release and O(2) production by activated rat neutrophils may be under separate control...|$|E
