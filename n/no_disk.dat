25|$|The Towers of Hanoi puzzle {{involves}} moving disks {{of different}} sizes between three pegs, maintaining the property that <b>no</b> <b>disk</b> is ever placed {{on top of a}} smaller disk. The states of an n-disk puzzle, and the allowable moves from one state to another, form an undirected graph that can be represented geometrically as the intersection graph of the set of triangles remaining after the nth step {{in the construction of the}} Sierpinski triangle. Thus, in the limit as n goes to infinity, this sequence of graphs can be interpreted as a discrete analogue of the Sierpinski triangle.|$|E
25|$|Lenticular galaxies share {{kinematic}} properties {{with both}} spiral and elliptical galaxies. This {{is due to}} the significant bulge and disk nature of lenticulars. The bulge component is similar to elliptical galaxies in that it is pressure supported by a central velocity dispersion. This situation is analogous to a balloon, where the motions of the air particles (stars in a bulge's case) are dominated by random motions. However, the kinematics of lenticular galaxies are dominated by the rotationally supported disk. Rotation support implies the average circular motion of stars in the disk is responsible for the stability of the galaxy. Thus kinematics are often used to distinguish lenticular galaxies from elliptical or spiral galaxies. The distinction between spiral galaxies and lenticular galaxies is often simpler to analyze as the dividing line is often set at a particular bulge-to-disk ratio. Determining the distinction between elliptical galaxies and lenticular galaxies often relies on the measurements of velocity dispersion (σ), rotational velocity (v), and ellipticity (ε). In order to differentiate between lenticulars and ellipticals, one typically looks at the v/σ ratio for a fixed ε. For example, a rough criterion for distinguishing between lenticular and elliptical galaxies is that elliptical galaxies have v/σ < 0.5 for ε = 0.3. The motivation behind this criterion is that lenticular galaxies do have prominent bulge and disk components whereas elliptical galaxies have <b>no</b> <b>disk</b> structure. Thus, lenticulars have much larger v/σ ratios than ellipticals due to their non-negligible rotational velocities (due to the disk component) in addition to not having as prominent of a bulge component compared to elliptical galaxies.|$|E

50|$|In fact, some PDP-10 systems had <b>no</b> <b>disks</b> at all, using DECtapes {{alone for}} their primary data storage. The DECtape was also widely used on other PDP models, {{since it was}} much easier to use than hand-loading {{multiple}} paper tapes. Primitive early time-sharing systems could use DECtapes as system devices and swapping devices. Although superior to paper tape, DECtapes were relatively slow, and were supplanted once reliable disk drives became affordable.|$|R

50|$|All strains carry a payload {{related to}} floppy disk access, {{but this has}} no effect in practice. When an {{infected}} application calls the MountVol function, the virus checks that the disk is actually a floppy disk, and if so, reads the first sector (512 bytes) of track 16. Then the virus compares the text at an offset 8 bytes into that sector against the string $16+"%%S". If the text matches, the virus executes the code at offset 0 of the sector via a JSR. <b>No</b> <b>disks</b> containing a matching string are known to exist, so in practice this payload has no effect.|$|R
