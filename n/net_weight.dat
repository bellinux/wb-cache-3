5|$|By 1864 {{the company}} was {{operating}} a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service, {{and she had been}} joined by Hunter, Mynora and Kembla. Both Kembla, a 204-ton iron steamship, and Hunter, a paddle steamer with a <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of 105 tons, were built in Glasgow, Scotland. The Mynora was built in Australia at Prymont in Sydney. A 117-ton wooden paddle steamer, her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay. In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew, the captain fought to keep the ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland. While the boat was lost, all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved.|$|E

Prior to sale she had been lengthened from her original 123 feet to 154 feet, and her tonnage increased to 111 tons. The Nora Creina, on the other hand, was lighter at 93 tons, and was locally built in Sydney. She was sold by the company in 1861.

40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> for timing-driven {{placement}} {{has been}} very popular in industry and academia. It has various advantages such as low complexity, high flexibility and ease of implementation. Existing <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> algorithms, however, are often ad-hoc.

In this paper, we present a novel <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> algorithm based {{on the concept of}} path-counting, and apply it in timing-driven FPGA placement application. Theoretically this is the first ever known accurate, all-path counting algorithm. Experimental data shows that compared with the weighting algorithm used in state-of-the-art FPGA placement package VPR[1], this new algorithm can achieve the longest path delay reduction of up to 38. 8 %, 15. 6 % on average with no runtime overhead and only a 4. 1 % increase in total wirelength. ...|$|R

For min-cut partitioning placement, we apply the XHPWL and XStWL models to the generalized net-weighting method that can exactly model the wirelength after partitioning by <b>net</b> <b>weighting.</b> For analytical placement, we smooth the XHPWL function using log-sum-exp functions to facilitate analytical placement.
