40|$|Softening of {{the flesh}} and the rise in {{ethylene}} evolution and respiration associated with ripening in pear (Pyrus communis L.) fruit was delayed when mannose was vacuum infiltrated into intact fruit. The extent of delay could be modified by altering the concentration or the volume of mannose applied to the fruit. Inhibition of ripening was associated with phosphorylation of mannose to mannose 6 -phosphate (M 6 P), and accumulation of M 6 P was associated with lowered levels of inorganic phosphate (Pi), glucose 6 -phosphate (G 6 P), and ATP in the fruit tissue. Subsequently, however, as the M 6 P was metabolized, the levels of Pi, G 6 P, and ATP increased and ripening processes were concomitantly <b>released</b> <b>from</b> <b>inhibition.</b> Hence, the degree of inhibition by mannose or the <b>release</b> <b>from</b> <b>inhibition</b> {{was related to the}} level of M 6 P in the fruit and its rate of metabolism. The data provide correlative evidence to support a view that one inhibitory effect of mannose is depletion of Pi in the cell as a result of phosphorylation of mannose to M 6 P. Inhibition of ripening by mannose was not alleviated by co-application of glucose as a competitive substrate for the hexokinase(s), or by Pi, presumably the depleted metabolite. Also, incubation of tissue disks with M 6 P resulted in inhibition of ethylene production and respiration. The structural analogs of mannose, glucosamine, and 2 -deoxyglucose, which have been shown to mimic mannose action in several plant tissues, did not cause inhibition of ripening of pear fruit comparable with that associated with mannose. Both analogs stimulated respiration, and glucosamine caused only a small inhibition of softening and ethylene evolution. Another mannose analog, α-methylmannoside, did inhibit fruit ripening though to a lesser extent than mannose. Its influence was also associated with accumulation of M 6 P and a decrease of Pi levels. We conclude that the mannose effect may, in part, be due to M 6 P toxicity, as well as by depletion of Pi...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of compartment-specific transcription in sporulating cells of B. subtilis is governed {{at the level}} of the activity of transcription factor sigma(F). Genetic experiments have suggested that SpollAA and SpollAB, the other products of the sigma(F) operon, are involved in regulating sigma(F) activity. This activity is inhibited in the predivisional cell but specifically <b>released</b> <b>from</b> <b>inhibition</b> in the prespore about 1. 5 hr after sporulation is induced. We now show that purified SpollAB inhibits transcription directed by sigma(F) in vitro. We note that the amino acid sequence of SpollAB shows some similarity to a group of bacterial histidine protein kinases, and we find that SpollAB is indeed a protein kinase that phosphorylates SpollAA on a serine residue.

The significant delays in timing produced by emotionally charged distracters were numerically simulated by a strong phase resetting of all neural oscillators involved in the SBF network for the entire duration of the evoked response.

This study shows that in normal monkeys the nonnociceptive, lemniscal component of the somatosensory pathways at spinal, brainstem, and thalamic levels is distinguished by cells and fibers immunoreactive for the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin, whereas cells of the nociceptive component at these levels are distinguished by immunoreactivity for 28 -kDa calbindin. Long-term dorsal rhizotomies in monkeys lead to transneuronal degeneration of parvalbumin cells at brainstem and thalamic sites accompanied in the thalamus by a down-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and an apparent increase in activity of calbindin cells preferentially innervated by central pain pathways. <b>Release</b> <b>from</b> <b>inhibition</b> and imbalance in patterns of somatosensory inputs from thalamus to cerebral cortex may constitute subcortical mechanisms for inducing changes in representational maps and perturbations of sensory perception, including central pain...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} how the auditory scene is analyzed and perceived, auditory spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) are generally {{used as a}} convenient way to describe how frequency and temporal sound information is encoded. However, using broadband sounds to estimate STRFs imperfectly reflects the way neurons process complex stimuli like conspecific vocalizations insofar as natural sounds often show limited bandwidth. Using recordings in the primary auditory cortex of anesthetized cats, we show that presentation of narrowband stimuli not including the best frequency of neurons provokes the appearance of residual peaks and increased firing rate at some specific spectral edges of stimuli compared with classical STRFs obtained from broadband stimuli. This result {{is the same for}} STRFs obtained from both spikes and local field potentials.

50|$|Wickens's {{research}} led him {{to discover}} the “release from proactive inhibition.” When consecutive trials involve items from the same conceptual category, there was decreased processing of short-term memory. However, Wickens showed that when subjects perceive {{a change in the}} category of the item to be remembered, there was increased processing of short-term memory. Wickens then used “release from proactive inhibition” as a technique in research involving semantic relatedness of words. His 1972 Psychological Review article, “Encoding Categories of Words; an Empirical Approach to Meaning,” is currently {{one of the most widely}} cited articles in the history of recent psychology. In the article, the “release from proactive inhibition” technique is used to investigate the dimension along which words are encoded in short-term memory. If the semantic content is changed in a consecutive series, a considerable amount of <b>release</b> <b>from</b> proactive <b>inhibition</b> is produced. In the years following this article, Wickens conducted much supporting research. For example, Wickens’ “Lack of Memory for Nonattended Items in Dichotic Listening” illustrates the relationship between “release from proactive inhibition” and semantic coding. The study consisted of 3 different groups of participants: professions, meat, and fruit. Participants in each condition listened to 3 words, counted backwards for 15 seconds, and then attempted to recall the words. Wickens repeated 4 trials with different words in each trial. The results found that the second and third trials decreased in accuracy due to the build up of proactive interference. The fourth trial, however, increased in accuracy after <b>release</b> <b>from</b> the profession and meat conditions. The <b>release</b> <b>from</b> proactive <b>inhibition</b> depended on the words’ categories (profession, fruit, and meat). Proactive inhibition was reduced when the item presented on a subsequent trial was drawn from a different condition. In other words, the <b>release</b> <b>from</b> proactive <b>inhibition</b> depended on the words’ categories (profession, fruit, and meat). The results demonstrate the operation of semantic coding in short term memory.|$|R

Unloading induces a shrinkage of the cortical representation of the affected body part associated to a reorganization of topographic maps and to an expansion of receptive fields. Previous studies have suggested that cortical plasticity {{was the result of a}} change in the balance of excitation and inhibition in the cortex. The aim of the present study was thus to determine whether deafferentation of the hindlimb representation in the somatosensory cortex, by 14 days of unloading or by surgical means (selective dorsal rhizotomy during 17 days), can change the concentration in various amino acid neurotransmitters in the deprived cortex. The present findings indicate that both types of deafferentation result in a decrease in inhibitory amino acids (GABA, taurine) without significant changes in the main excitatory amino acid (glutamate). In conclusion, the present results support the idea that cortical changes are more likely due to a <b>release</b> <b>from</b> <b>inhibition</b> than to an increased excitation...|$|R

In this paper we review four mechanisms that underlie the group I evoked enhancement of ipsilateral extensor activity during locomotion.

Lack of direct evidence proving the above assumption in radish plants (Raphanus sativus L.) urged us to assume the presence of an anti-bolting compound; actively maintaining the rosette habit through inhibition of bolting. Anti-bolting activity was detected in an extract of rosette shoots of radish plants by an assay using seedlings cultured in vitro.
