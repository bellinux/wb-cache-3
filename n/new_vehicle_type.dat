The Ames involvement with the tilt rotor aircraft began in 1957 with investigations of the performance and dynamic behavior of the Bell XV- 3 tilt rotor aircraft. At that time, Ames Research Center was known as the Ames Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). As we approach the new millennium, and after more than 40 years of effort and the successful completion of our initial goals, it is appropriate to reflect on the technical accomplishments and consider the future applications of this unique aircraft class, the tilt rotor. The talented engineers, technicians, managers, and leaders at Ames have worked hard with their counterparts in the U. S. rotorcraft industry to overcome technology barriers and to make the military and civil tilt rotor aircraft safer, environmentally acceptable, and more efficient. The tilt rotor aircraft combines the advantages of vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, inherent to the helicopter, with the forward speed and range of a fixed wing turboprop airplane. Our studies have shown that this <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> can provide the aviation transportation industry with the flexibility for highspeed, long-range flight, coupled with runway-independent operations, thus having a significant potential to relieve airport congestion.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the potential contribution of electric vehicles in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction {{over the next}} decade. The effect of electric vehicles (EVs) on traffic related pollution is assessed at the transportation link level in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) following a simulation procedure from 2006 to 2021. The traffic emissions considered in this paper are: total hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and a basic estimate of carbon dioxide (CO 2). Emissions were estimated {{through a number of}} steps. Firstly, different EV market penetration scenarios were introduced (conservative, medium, optimistic) and compared to the base case scenario where no action or minimum policy controls are supposed to take place {{over the next couple of}} decades. Scenarios were determined through a comprehensive review of penetration estimates in the literature. Following these, the spatial distribution patterns of EVs were predicted using the vehicle registration data for the Hamilton CMA along with socioeconomic data obtained from 2006 census. Different distribution patterns of EVs adoption were assessed creating sub-scenarios, in order to reflect the possible changes in the future. Subsequently, the results from the regression model were used to properly modify the Origin-Destination (OD) matrices by type of vehicle. These matrices were used as input into our traffic simulation model (TRAFFIC) that assigns traffic on the network and estimates volumes for each of the links. MOBILE 6. 2 C was customized to accept the <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> and to compute the emission factors. The hourly emissions on each link were mapped through a geographic information system (GIS) framework after the integration of three parameters: street network, associated traffic flows and emissions (Link_emissions model). We conclude that different distribution patterns produce different spatial patterns of traffic related emissions in the links and even a modest adoption of EV technology may lead to significant reduction in traffic emissions.

The expected gains in environmental performance for these <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>types</b> are associated with higher technology costs. In parallel, the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrids is continuously improved, which in turn advances their environmental performance but also leads to additional technology costs versus today¿s vehicles. The present study compares the well-to-wheel CO 2 emissions, costs and CO 2 abatement costs of generic European cars, including a gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, gasoline hybrid, diesel hybrid, plug in hybrid and battery electric vehicle. The predictive comparison is done for the snapshots 2010, 2020 and 2030 under a new energy policy scenario for Europe.

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{probability}} that communication between vehicles in a traffic network and between vehicles and traffic controllers {{will be the next}} major wave of technological innovation in traffic. The collection of data of communicating vehicles in traffic offers live information about the traffic conditions, which can be used to control traffic optimally. It is expected that in the coming years a <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>type</b> will take part in traffic that is able to navigate through traffic without driver and communicates with traffic controllers to share its information and receive its optimal trajectory: the automated vehicle. The automated vehicle is different from the autonomous vehicle, which does not communicate with traffic controllers or other traffic. The traffic mixture consisting of conventional, connected and automated vehicles will change gradually over time. Designing a traffic control strategy that performs well for traffic consisting of different shares of these three types of vehicles and requires only a limited amount of computational power will be a main challenge in traffic control the coming years. This report proposes a traffic control strategy and assesses the influences of this strategy on the network wide traffic conditions using a traffic simulation. In this way, the research will provide insight in the effects of vehicle connectivity and automation on the network wide traffic conditions. Based on the live traffic information from the communicating vehicles in a network, traffic can be controlled from two sides: the traffic signal control and the automated vehicle trajectory control. The traffic control method proposed in this report works as follows: first, the traffic controller collects all the information of connected and automated vehicles in the network to update the vehicle set. Locations and speeds of connected and automated vehicles can be obtained directly. Automated vehicles also provide the traffic controller of information of the non-communicating vehicles in their surroundings, detected by their sensors. Then, the virtual departure time of each vehicle will be determined, which is the time at which the vehicle would depart not hindered by other traffic or traffic signal and can be calculated using the kinematic laws. Also the corresponding virtual departure speed is determined for each vehicle. Then, starting from the first vehicle on the link, the expected departure time will be calculated, based on the virtual departure time and the traffic signal state. The expected departure times and speeds of the other vehicles on the link will be based on their virtual departure time, the expected departure time of the vehicles in front of the vehicle and the signal state. The virtual and expected departure times and speeds are used for both the signal control and the trajectory control. This report presents a decentralized signal control to limit the computational power required in large traffic networks. This signal control is based on the original back-pressure algorithm, which compares the downstream traffic conditions with the upstream traffic conditions around an intersection and makes decisions for the signal control based on the difference in back-pressure of different movements on an intersection. The proposed signal control strategy takes the approaching and exiting vehicles within a certain range from the intersection into account. At the start of each time slot, a prediction is made for the pressure of a link on the intersection {{at the start of the}} next time slot, based on the current number of approaching and exiting vehicles on a link, their expected departure time from the intersection and the expected traffic demand. Based on the predicted pressures at every link that is connected with the intersection, the traffic controller decides whether it should switch the traffic signal at the start of the next time slot. The proposed method for the trajectory control of the automated vehicles is based on the decisions of the traffic controller regarding the traffic signal and the expected departure times and speeds of the vehicles in the network. The main goal of the trajectory control is to use the green phases in an optimal way, i. e. maximizing the amount of departing vehicles per unit of green time. The trajectory control should limit accelerations and decelerations in the network as much as possible to limit emissions and traveller discomfort. Therefore, a third type of departure time and speed, the smooth departure time and speed, is introduced and compared with the expected time and speed of an automated vehicle to optimize its trajectory. The smooth departure time is the moment in time at which the vehicle would depart from the intersection if it would accelerate constantly to the expected departure speed over the total distance to the intersection. If the expected departure time is later in time than the smooth departure time, the vehicle will slow down and vice versa. If the smooth departure time is equal to the expected departure time, the vehicle will accelerate constantly towards the intersection. The proposed control method is tested in a traffic simulation to obtain the effects of the method on the traffic conditions for different traffic scenarios. For each scenario the average traffic time delay, average green time, average and maximum queue length and average acceleration and acceleration time is retrieved from the simulation to assess the effects of the proposed methods on the traffic conditions. The simulated network consists of a two-directional main road with five signalized intersections with side roads. The traffic consists of only cars and other modes of transportation are neglected for simplicity. Different shares of connected and automated vehicles and different vehicle flows in the network are tested. The simulation results show that the proposed signal control strategy leads to relatively short green times, which decrease the intersection throughput and the ability of adjusting the green time ratio between the two crossing roads to the traffic demand. Traffic on the main road encounters relatively longer green times and shorter queue lengths than traffic on the side roads. The throughput of the intersections does not satisfy the traffic demand and therefore, the first intersection will function as a bottleneck and lowers the traffic flow at the next intersections. Therefore, queues especially occur at the first intersection that vehicles encounter. The results show that the higher the penetration rate of communicating vehicles is, the better the traffic controller is able to adapt the signal sequence to the current traffic situation. The signal control requires several improvements in order to function optimally, but has the potency to be a suitable decentralized control method in a partly connected and automated environment. Results regarding the proposed trajectory control show that a higher share of automated vehicles in the network results in a higher average acceleration in a relatively shorter total acceleration time, which is a result of the fluctuations in the vehicle speed due to the trajectory control. However, automated vehicles increase the average number of departing vehicles per unit of green time, which leads to shorter queues and less average travel time delay in the network. Next to the proposed signal control strategy, an existing coordinated signal control strategy is implemented and tested in the simulation without connected or automated vehicles to compare the results with the proposed methods. Simulations of this green wave control result in larger average travel time delays and larger queue lengths due to relatively shorter green phases. The average acceleration, however, is relatively low, since the green wave strategy avoids vehicles to decelerate to complete standstill after they cross the first intersection of the traffic corridor. This research shows that vehicle connectivity and automation offer the ability to improve network wide traffic conditions applying a decentralized traffic control method to control signalized intersections and automated vehicles. Although the proposed traffic control method is not optimized yet, it shows that low shares of connected and automated vehicles in traffic already make a significant difference in the network wide traffic conditions and that the signal sequences and automated vehicle trajectories can be even optimized if these shares get higher. Since the control strategy is decentralized, the required amount of computational power of a traffic controller is limited to the amount that the control of one single intersection requires and is not depending on the network size. This research provides several recommendations for further research to improve the proposed strategy. Instead of taking only vehicles into account within a certain range from the intersection, which all have the same contribution to the back-pressure, an interesting alternative is to take all vehicles around an intersection into account for the back-pressure and add a certain weight to each vehicle based on the distance to the intersection. This weight can be used to determine the contribution of each vehicle to the back-pressure. Next, a threshold for switching and a dynamic slot time instead of a fixed one could be improvements to the proposed method and should be tested in further research. The trajectory can be optimized especially regarding the vehicle accelerations and decelerations. It is recommended to avoid the occurring speed fluctuations in the proposed method by optimizing the acceleration rate that is used for automated vehicles to reach the desired trajectory. It is recommended to test the proposed method in more realistic traffic simulations in further research to get more insight in the effects to real traffic. In that way the control method can be adapted to real traffic. The simulation of this research uses many assumptions regarding several parameters which require further research to optimize the performance of the control method. Last, before implementing the proposed method or a similar method in traffic, further research is required regarding the traffic safety. Especially the fact that automated vehicles are able to depart from intersections exactly at the moment the traffic signal switches to green could lead to unsafe situations, since other traffic users are not yet used to this behaviour of automated vehicles. <br/...|$|E

Measurements carried out on an experimental test track covered with dense asphalt concrete included microphones at the standard position (distance 7. 5 m and height 1. 2 m) and a wide range of driving conditions (constant speed, acceleration, deceleration and braking) and vehicle speeds. The dataset has been completed with results already available by project partners. Global and frequency dependent results have been compared with the sound emission model provided in CNOSSOS-EU. When appropriate, an adaptation of CNOSSOS-EU input data is proposed, as a first step towards the specification of light electric-powered vehicles in the European traffic noise predicting method...|$|R
5000|$|The {{console and}} PC {{versions}} of the game have 18 cars, while the Australian XR Edition swapped 3 standard cars for 3 iconic Australian market Falcons. The game featured team and solo championship modes {{as well as an}} [...] "Arcade" [...] mode. Team mode allows you to toggle between the cars in your team during the race; cars that you are not driving are driven by the AI until you select it. You have to play and win the various championships to unlock <b>new</b> tracks, <b>new</b> <b>vehicles,</b> <b>new</b> race <b>types</b> (elimination, time trial, etc.) and unlock new tournaments to earn cash to purchase those newly unlocked vehicles and/or repair the ones you currently own. These unlocked cars, tracks, and race types can be raced, without consequence, in the Arcade mode. Notable cars featured in the game including Ford Mustang Boss 302, Ford RS200, Ford GT, Ford Lightning and the Ford Mustang SVT Cobra. On September 9, 2014 it was released on Steam.|$|R
30|$|Virtually, all {{authors who}} have worked on this topic (like [9, 14, 15]) assume device {{efficiencies}} used by Reistad [16] to evaluate energy and exergy utilisation efficiencies. This work differs from theirs for one main reason: the present work is on a developing African country where cars and trucks {{that have been used}} elsewhere before being imported into the country and brand new ones compete for dominance. For instance, according to the Nigerian Customs and Excise sources, in 2005, 18, 391 <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> and 33, 134 used vehicles were imported into the country, while in 2006, 31, 010 <b>new</b> <b>vehicles</b> of all <b>types</b> were imported as against 43, 606 used <b>vehicles</b> of all <b>types</b> [17]. According to Oritse [18], for December 2011, out of the 3, 725 vehicles arriving or expected at Lagos ports, about 1, 000 were new while the remaining 2, 725 are used vehicles. Specifically, more than 85 % of motor vehicles being imported into the country annually are used vehicles [19].|$|R

40|$|In {{the near}} future, the {{culmination}} of <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> technologies, greater competition in the energy markets, and government policies to fight pollution and reduce energy consumption will result in changes in the United States' vehicle marketplace. This project proposes to create a stated preference (SP) survey along with discrete choice models to predict future demand for electric, hybrid, alternative fuel, and gasoline vehicles. The survey {{is divided into three}} parts: socioeconomics, revealed preference (RP), and SP sections. The socioeconomics portion asks respondents about themselves and their households. The RP portion asks about household's current vehicles. The SP section presents respondents with various hypothetical scenarios over a future five-year period using one of three game designs. The designs correspond to: changing vehicle technology, fuel pricing and availability, and taxation policy. With these changes to the vehicle marketplace, respondents are asked whether they will keep or replace their current vehicles and if he will purchase a <b>new</b> <b>vehicle</b> and its <b>type.</b> To facilitate the design and administering of the survey, a web survey framework, JULIE, was created specifically for creating stated preference surveys. A preliminary trial of the survey was conducted in September and October 2010 with a sample size of 141 respondents. Using the SP results from this preliminary trial, a multinomial logit model is used to estimate future vehicle ownership by <b>vehicle</b> <b>type.</b> The models show that the survey design allows for estimation of important parameters in vehicle choice...|$|R
