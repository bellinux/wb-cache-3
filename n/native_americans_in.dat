5|$|<b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> {{northern}} California suffered greatly at {{the hands}} of European-Americans in {{the last half of the}} 19th century, and their population decline is often characterized as genocide. The Wiyot people, who lived around Humboldt Bay, were particularly hard hit. Their population declined from about 1,500-2,000 in 1850 to about 200 in 1860.|$|E

5|$|Edwards won an {{unlikely}} 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois. Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards' administration, {{as did the}} pursuit of Indian removal. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against <b>Native</b> <b>Americans,</b> <b>in</b> the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War, and signed treaties for the cession of Native American land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of cholera two years later.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, {{and so the}} {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E
5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>In</b> the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 a runaway truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|In late July, a {{boy named}} John Billington became lost for {{some time in the}} woods around the colony. It was {{reported}} that he was found by the Nauset, the same group of Native Americans on Cape Cod from whom the Pilgrims had unwittingly stolen corn seed the prior year upon their first explorations. The English organized a party to return Billington to Plymouth. The Pilgrims agreed to reimburse the Nauset for the corn which they had taken in return for the Billington boy. This negotiation did much to secure further peace with the <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the area.|$|E

5|$|In the precolonial era, the village's {{area was}} {{inhabited}} by {{a band of}} the Wappinger tribes of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>In</b> the early 19th century, the area was known as Whitson's Corners. Walter William Law moved to the area and purchased lands during the 1890s. Law developed the village, establishing schools, churches, parks, and the Briarcliff Lodge. Briarcliff Manor was incorporated as a village in 1902, and celebrated its centennial on November 21, 2002. The village has grown from 331 people when established to 7,867 in the 2010 census.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay out of the war.|$|E
5|$|Little Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled by the Takelma, {{and possibly the}} Shasta tribes of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> <b>In</b> the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. Early settlers named Little Butte Creek and nearby Big Butte Creek after their proximity to Mount McLoughlin, which was known as Snowy Butte. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production. The city of Eagle Point was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The final treaty also voided Spanish {{guarantees}} of military support that colonial officials {{had made to}} <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the disputed regions, greatly weakening those communities’ ability to resist encroachment upon their lands. The treaty represented a major victory for Washington administration, and placated many of the critics of the Jay Treaty. It also enabled and encouraged American settlers to continue their movement west, by making the frontier areas more attractive and lucrative. The region that Spain relinquished its claim to through the treaty was organized by Congress as Mississippi Territory on April 7, 1798.|$|E
5|$|After {{the presidential}} visit, the royal party headed to Baltimore where Secretary of State William H. Hunt {{provided}} a governmental vessel, the USS Despatch, to transport them to Tidewater Virginia. The King toured Fortress Monroe where General George W.

The King {{was interested in the}} institution's role in educating <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the industrial trade, a model he wanted to bring back to his people, even though Samuel Armstrong had modeled his school after the Hilo Boarding School in Hawaii. After a visit to the Old Soldier's Home and a reception at Virginia Hall, the party returned north to Fortress Monroe, where they witnessed a review, and then proceeded to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. It was reported that the royal party also visited Yorktown to observe the centennial celebration of its siege.|$|E
5|$|Chapman left Portland in 1853 for Fort Umpqua in Southern Oregon. There he {{engaged in}} cattle {{ranching}} while keeping his Portland law practice.

After the war he returned to Corvallis in 1856 before moving to Eugene in 1857. Chapman was appointed as surveyor general of Oregon and served from 1857 to 1861 {{when he returned to}} Portland. He left this federal government position due to his opposition to the election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President. Oregon entered the Union as the 33rd state in 1859.|$|E

5|$|From July to August 1764, Johnson {{negotiated}} a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had {{stayed out of}} the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was particularly interested in the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E

Sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season, naming the Bulldogs' Wilbur Henry to the first team. Cub Buck, Harry Dadmun, and Joe Guyon were on the second team, and Pete Calac was on the third team. Three men who played for the 1920 Canton Bulldogs were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Thorpe and Pete Henry in 1963 and Guyon in 1966.|$|E
