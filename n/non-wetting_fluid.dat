For example, the effect of reactions on the solid matrix can affect the formation and stability of fingering instabilities associated with the invasion of a buoyant <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid.</b> In this study, we focus on the formation and stability of capillary channels of a buoyant <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> (developed because of capillary instabilities) and their impact on the transport and distribution of a reactant in the porous medium. We use a combination of pore-scale numerical calculations based on a multiphase reactive lattice Boltzmann model (LBM) and scaling laws to quantify (i) the effect of dissolution on the preservation of capillary instabilities, (ii) the penetration depth of reaction beyond the dissolution/melting front, and (iii) the temporal and spatial distribution of dissolution/melting under different conditions (concentration of reactant in the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid,</b> injection rate). Our results show that, even for tortuous <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> channels, simple scaling laws assuming an axisymmetrical annular flow can explain (i) the exponential decay of reactant along capillary channels, (ii) the dependence of the penetration depth of reactant on a local Péclet number (using the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> velocity in the channel) and more qualitatively (iii) the importance of the melting/reaction efficiency on the stability of <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> channels.

40|$|We {{study the}} physics of flow through porous {{materials}} in two different ways: by di-rectly visualizing flow through a model three-dimensional (3 D) porous medium, and by investigating the deformability of fluid-filled microcapsules having porous shells. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we develop an experimental approach to directly visu-alize fluid flow through a 3 D porous medium. We use this to investigate drainage, the displacement of a wetting fluid from a porous medium by a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid,</b> as well as secondary imbibition, the subsequent displacement of the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> by the wet-ting fluid. We characterize the intricate morphologies of the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> ganglia left trapped within the pore space, and show how the ganglia configurations vary with the wet-ting fluid flow rate. We then visualize the spatial fluctuations in the fluid flow, both for single- and multi-phase flow. We use our measurements to quantify the strong variability in the flow velocities, as well as the pore-scale correlations in the flow. Finally, we use our experimental approach to study the simultaneous flow of both a wetting and a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> through a porous medium, and elucidate the flow instabilities that arise for sufficientl...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} and numerical study of immiscible two-phase flow in 3 -dimensional (3 D) porous media {{to find the}} relationship between the volumetric flow rate (Q) and the total pressure difference (Δ P) in the steady state. We show that in the regime where capillary forces compete with the viscous forces, the distribution of capillary barriers at the interfaces effectively creates a yield threshold, making the fluids reminiscent of a Bingham viscoplastic fluid in the porous medium, introducing a threshold pressure P_t. In this regime, Q depends quadratically on an excess pressure drop (Δ P-P_t). While increasing the flow-rate, there is a transition, beyond which the flow is Newtonian and the relationship is linear. In our experiments, we build a model porous medium using a column of glass beads transporting two fluids [...] de-ionized water and air. For the numerical study, reconstructed 3 D pore-networks from real core samples are considered and the transport of wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluids</b> through the network are modeled by tracking the fluid interfaces with time.

40|$|We {{show that}} when a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> drains a {{stratified}} porous medium at sufficiently small capillary numbers Ca, it flows only through the coarsest stratum of the medium; by contrast, above a threshold Ca, the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> is also forced laterally, into part of the adjacent, finer strata. The spatial extent of this partial invasion increases with Ca. We quantitatively understand this behavior by balancing the stratum-scale viscous pressure driving the flow with the capillary pressure required to invade individual pores.

40|$|Two {{immiscible}} fluids {{flowing in}} parallel {{with respect to the}} interface separating them in a two-dimensional porous medium has been studied using a dynamic network model. Two immiscible fluids, one wetting and the other non-wetting moving in parallel is a complicated process that haven't gotten much attention. It is found that there is a competition between imbibition and drainage displacements at the pore-scale along the front separating the two fluids due to an external force driving both the fluids in the direction parallel to this front. Imbibition is the process where a wetting fluid displaces a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid,</b> while drainage is when a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> displaces a wetting fluid. When an external force driving the system in the direction parallel to the front separating the two liquid is small, such that the capillary forces are much strong that viscous forces, we find that imbibition displacements will dominate along the front. The wetting fluid is found to displace the non-wetting such that the front separating the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> from the wetting fluid moves with a velocity proportional to the volumetric flow rate perpendicular to the imposed flow direction. A wetting fluid will prefer to displace a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> along narrow channels {{due to the fact that}} capillary forces provide suction in imbibition, as opposed to resistance in drainage. When the front is moving, we find that clusters of non-wetting fluids are left behind the front, concentrated in the widest part of the network. These cluster will not be able to be move as long as the external driving force is not large enough to overcome the the capillary forces holding back the cluster. Wetting fluid will flow in the space around the clusters. If the external driving force is large enough so that these clusters can be mobilized, then we'll have viscous forces start dominating, and there will be a mixture of imbibition and drainage depending on the local geometry and boundary conditions. If drainage starts dominating the front will stop moving and become unstable, and non-wetting fingers will start moving in the direction of the wetting liquid. If the driving force is strong enough, these fingers will break up into bubbles due to crossing wetting fluids, and non-wetting bubbles will start migrating into the wetting fluid. For special case of a band of <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> surrounded by wetting fluid on both sides, we find that the wetting fluid will try to displace the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> from both sides simultaneously. If the external driving force is not strong enough so that the clusters broken off from either side can be mobilized, we find that both the fronts stabilize and stop moving. The non-wetting and wetting fluid will then flow by themselves as if they were part of its own effective network separated by the fluid-fluid front, without any influence from the other fluid. The two fronts will be stationary as long as the capillary forces are dominating over viscous forces. </p...|$|E
30|$|In the {{spontaneous}} imbibition process, the fluid in the fracture (brine around the core) penetrates {{into the rock}} and pushes the resident fluid (oil) out of the core. This process {{is due to the}} positive capillary pressure between wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluids</b> in the porous media (the wetting phase pressure is lower than the non-wetting phase pressure). When all the faces of the core are open to the brine both co-current and counter-current flow may occur. The fluid displacement in {{the spontaneous}} imbibition phenomena is governed by the both capillary and gravity forces. However, for the case in which the height of rock is small enough and also the capillary pressure is significant (tight rock), the dominant mechanism is capillary force, whereas the gravity force becomes negligible. In the case of mixed-wet rock, the brine cannot diffuse into the rock at the start of test, because the brine is non-wetting phase against oil in the pores (capillary pressure is negative). However, the ion exchange between brine and rock surface alters the wettability of the outer pores towards the water-wet, and thus, the brine imbibes into the rock and displaces oil. The interaction between brine and rock surface is gradually developed to the internal pores, and hence, the wettability of other parts of rock changes toward water-wetness.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, a poroelastic displacement, {{which is}} caused by pore fluid flow, is a {{plausible}} mechanism for the observed local uplift in the Kanto Plain. The poroelastic displacement by an earthquake was observed previously around the mainshock fault (within a fault length of the ruptured fault) [e.g., the 1992 Landers earthquake by Johnston et al. (1995) and Fialko (2004); the 2000 South Iceland earthquake by Jonsson et al. (2003)]. This model indicates that the cause is the migration of groundwater due to static stress (pore pressure) changes that are induced by an earthquake, which subsequently displaces the ground surface. However, in the Kanto Plain, groundwater flow from changes in the shear stresses is unlikely, because the Kanto Plain is situated far from the ruptured fault. Instead, permeability enhancement {{is the most likely}} mechanism of groundwater migration by an earthquake far from a mainshock fault. Indeed, groundwater level changes caused by a permeability increase from earthquakes have been observed previously (Manga et al. 2003, 2012). It is believed that this permeability enhancement by a factor of a few [e.g., < 2 in southern California by the 1992 Landers earthquake (Elkhoury et al. 2006), > 5 in Awaji island by the 1995 Kobe earthquake (Tokunaga 1999)] occurs because of mobilizing colloids, including clay minerals and bubbles of <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluids</b> that trap pores and fractures (Manga et al. 2012). Moreover, long-period (low-frequency) seismic waves can increase permeability (Manga et al. 2012).|$|R
30|$|In the {{drainage}} process, the non-wetting phase displaces wetting phase {{from the large}} pores. Therefore, after the process some non-wetting phases remain trapped in the smaller pores causing capillary retention that can explain the behavior of drainage curve of capillary pressure at higher saturation than the imbibition one. Imbibition process takes places by displacement of non-wetting phase by wetting phase. In this process, <b>non-wetting</b> phase <b>fluid</b> in smaller pores first gets displaced by wetting phase fluid. As a matter of fact, the imbibition curve shows a high threshold capillary pressure for the same sample up-structure that has low drainage threshold capillary pressure. Due to capillary pressure hysteresis, capillary pressure curves obtained in imbibition process are in the lower range of saturation accordingly.|$|R
40|$|We use {{confocal}} microscopy {{to directly}} visualize {{the formation and}} complex morphologies of trapped <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> ganglia within a model 3 D porous medium.

We find that the ganglia configurations do not vary for small Ca; by contrast, as Ca is increased above a threshold value, the largest ganglia start to become mobilized and are ultimately removed from the medium. By combining our 3 D visualization with measurements of the bulk transport, we show that this behavior can be quantitatively understood by balancing the viscous forces exerted on the ganglia with the pore-scale capillary forces that keep them trapped within the medium. Our work thus helps elucidate the fluid dynamics underlying the mobilization of a trapped <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> from a 3 D porous medium...|$|E

By performing experiments over a range of flow rates, using fluids of different viscosities, and with porous media having different geometries, we show that this transition can be characterized by a state diagram {{that depends on the}} capillary numbers of both fluids, suggesting that it is controlled by the competition between the viscous forces exerted on the flowing oil and the capillary forces at the pore scale.

40|$|Mechanical fault {{reactivation}} is {{a mechanism}} where high fluid pressures generated within a fault zone {{can change the}} effective stress such that an optimally orientated fault segment will rupture. This style of strain has been recognized in three settings: (1) deep crustal locations at greenschist and higher-grade metamorphism with fluid generation; (2) active plate boundaries where tectonic stresses can result in seismicity; and (3) hydrocarbon column buoyancy pressure reactivation of critically stressed fault-bound traps. This paper examines category 3 {{in the context of}} mechanical fault reactivation and capillary processes. For water-wetting fault rock, mechanical reactivation may be reached prior to the capillary seal capacity. However, the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> cannot access the fault rock pore space until the hydrocarbon column height reaches the capillary threshold pressure. At the threshold pressure, the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> enters the fault rock imparting a buoyancy pressure in excess of the mechanical reactivation threshold causing rupture.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the investigation of refrigerant flow boiling heat transfer in multi-microchannel copper cold plate evaporators. A comprehensive review of recent studies related to saturated flow boiling in minichannels and microchannels is first presented. The review {{focuses on the}} functional dependence of heat transfer characteristics on thermodynamic vapor quality. Results from recent investigations in the literature are compiled and analyzed. Correlations for flow boiling are quantitatively assessed by comparing them against independent data sets from the published literature. ^ Flow boiling heat transfer data for the refrigerants R- 134 a and R- 245 fa in multi-microchannel copper cold plate evaporators are obtained using a carefully designed and fabricated experimental setup. The first test section contains 17 channels with hydraulic diameters of 1. 09 mm. The second test section contains 33 channels with 0. 54 mm hydraulic diameter. The heat transfer coefficient is measured locally for a thermodynamic vapor quality range from - 0. 2 to 0. 9 (negative quality indicates subcooled inlet conditions), a saturation temperature range from 8 to 30 °C, a mass flux range from 20 to 350 kg m- 2 s- 1 and heat fluxes ranging from 0 to 22 W cm- 2. Measurement results were repeatable and showed low measurement uncertainty. The heat transfer coefficient is found to vary significantly with heat flux and vapor quality, but only slightly with saturation pressure and mass flux for the range of values investigated. ^ Finally, a composite correlation including nucleate boiling and convective heat transfer terms is developed. The values predicted by the correlation are compared to a database of 3899 measured heat transfer coefficients from 14 studies covering 12 different wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluids</b> {{and a range of}} hydraulic diameters from 0. 16 to 2. 92 mm.

The correlation is able to predict the measured heat transfer coefficients with a mean absolute error of 28 % even though several measured data sets show opposing trends to the predictions with respect to some operating parameters. ...|$|R
40|$|Wettability is an {{important}} factor which controls the displacement of immiscible fluids in permeable media, with far reaching implications for storage of CO 2 in deep saline aquifers, fuel cells, oil recovery, and for the remediation of oil contaminated soils. Considering the paradigmatic case of random piles of spherical beads, fluid front morphologies emerging during slow immiscible displacement are investigated in real time by X-ray micro–tomography and quantitatively compared with model predictions. Controlled by the wettability of the bead matrix two distinct displacement patterns are found. A compact front morphology emerges if the invading fluid wets the beads while a fingered morphology is found for <b>non–wetting</b> invading <b>fluids,</b> causing the residual amount of defending fluid to differ by one order of magnitude.

The process is characterized by a quite low desaturation of the medium. Considering the special case of a constant stabilizing gradient, we first study the sensitivity of the solution given by the classical continuum two phase flow model to the shape of the retention curve. The solution is found to be very sensitive to the evolution of the retention curve in the range of the high wetting fluid saturations. We show how to construct the retention curve so as to minimize the prediction error with the classical two-phase flow model.

The adsorption corresponds to the metastable nucleation of the liquid phase, starting from a partially filled pore (a molecular thick film adsorbed at the pore surface).

The intrusion of the <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> proceeds through the invasion in the pore of the liquid/gas interface (convex meniscus), while the extrusion consists of the nucleation of the gas phase within the pore.

30|$|One of the fluids wets the porous medium {{more than}} the other; we refer to this as the wetting phase fluid and we refer to the other as the <b>non-wetting</b> phase <b>fluid.</b> In an oil-gas system, oil is the wetting phase.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stochastic differential equation approach to multiphase flow, a typical example {{of which is}} flow in the unsaturated domain. Specifically, a two phase problem is studied which consists of a wetting phase and a nonwetting phase. The approach given results in a nonlinear stochastic differential equation describing {{the position of the}} <b>non-wetting</b> phase <b>fluid</b> particle. The nonlinearity arises because both the drift and diffusion coefficients depend on the volumetric fraction of the phase which in turn depends on the position of the fluid particle in the experimental domain. Central to the development described in this report is the concept of a fluid particle. Expressions for both saturation and volumetric fraction are developed using the fluid particle concept. Darcy’s law and the continuity equation are then used to derive a Fokker-Planck equation using these expressions. The Itô calculus is then applied to derive a stochastic differential equation for the non-wetting phase. This equation has both drift and diffusion terms which depend on the volumetric fraction of the non-wetting phase. Computational aspects of the approach are discussed in some detail, and a sample problem is worked. ...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{stimulation}} is {{a promising}} technology aimed {{to mobilize the}} entrapped <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluids</b> in the subsurface. The applications include enhanced oil recovery or, alternatively, facilitation of movement of immiscible/partly-miscible gases far into porous media, for example, for CO 2 sequestration. This work is devoted to detailed quantitative studies of the two basic pore-scale mechanisms standing behind seismic stimulation: the mobilization of bubbles or drops entrapped in pore constrictions by capillary forces and the break-up of continuous long bubbles or drops. In typical oil-production operations, oil is produced by the natural reservoir-pressure drive during the primary stage and by artificial water flooding at the secondary stage. Capillary forces act to retain a substantial residual fraction of reservoir oil even after water flooding. The seismic stimulation is an unconventional technology that serves to overcome capillary barriers in individual pores and liberate the entrapped oil by adding an oscillatory inertial forcing to the external pressure gradient. According to our study, the effect of seismic stimulation on oil mobilization is highly dependent on the frequencies and amplitudes of the seismic waves. Generally, the lower the frequency and the larger the amplitude, more effective is the mobilization. To describe the mobilization process, we developed two theoretical hydrodynamics-based models and justified both using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Our theoretical models have a significant advantage over CFD in that they reduce the computational time significantly, while providing correct practical guidance regarding the required field parameters of vibroseismic stimulation, such as the amplitude and frequency of the seismic field. The models also provide important insights into the basic mechanisms governing the vibration-driven two-phase flow in constricted capillaries. In a waterflooded reservoir, oil can be recovered most efficiently by forming continuous streams from isolated droplets. The longer the continuous oil phase under a certain pressure gradient, the more easily it overcomes its capillary barrier. However, surface tension between water and oil causes the typically non-wetting oil, constituting the core phase in the channels, to break up at the pore constriction into isolated beads, which inhibits further motion. The break-up thus counteracts the mobilization. We developed a theoretical model that provides an exact quantitative description {{of the dynamics of}} the oil-snap-off process. It also formulates a purely geometric criterion that controls, based on pore geometry only, whether the oil core phase stays continuous or disintegrates into droplets. Both the theoretical model and the break-criterion have been validated against CFD simulations. The work completed elucidates the basic physical mechanisms behind the enhanced oil recovery by seismic waves and vibrations. This creates a theoretical foundation for the further development of corresponding field technologies...|$|R

40|$|Injection of {{anthropogenic}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) into geological formations is a promising approach to reduce {{greenhouse gas emissions}} into the atmosphere. Predicting the amount of CO 2 that can be captured and its long term storage stability in subsurface requires a fundamental understanding of multiphase displacement phenomena at the pore scale. In this paper, the lattice Boltzmann method is employed to simulate the immiscible displacement of a wetting fluid by a non-wetting one in two microfluidic flow cells, one with a homogeneous pore network {{and the other with}} a randomly heterogeneous pore network. We have identified three different displacement patterns, namely stable displacement, capillary fingering and viscous fingering, all of which are strongly dependent upon the capillary number (Ca), viscosity ratio (M), and the media heterogeneity. The <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> saturation (Snw) is found to increase nearly linearly with log Cafor each constant M. Increasing M (viscosity ratio of <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> to wetting fluid) or decreasing the media heterogeneity can enhance the stability of the displacement process, resulting in an increase in Snw. In either pore network, the specific interfacial length is linearly proportional to Snw during drainage with equal proportionality constant for all cases excluding those revealing considerable viscous fingering. Our numerical results confirm the previous experimental finding that the steady state specific interfacial length exhibits a linear dependence on Snw for either favorable (M≥ 1) or unfavorable (M< 1) displacement, and the slope is slightly higher for the unfavorable displacement...|$|E

CO 2 -brine-rock {{chemical}} reactions change the transport parameters (saturated and relative permeability of the wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid,</b> porosity, diffusion coefficient, pore size distribution) of reservoir rocks for geological CO 2 storage by dissolution and precipitation processes that modify the pore space geometry. These changes {{can affect the}} storage capacity and injectivity of the formation. The knowledge of these transport parameters and how they evolve in time is also vital also for accurate modelling of CO 2 storage and multi-phase flow simulations. Most published studies for reservoir rocks concentrate on the changes of porosity and saturated liquid permeability, but hardly any data {{is available on the}} other parameters, and even less on their evolution during interaction with CO 2. In the present laboratory experiments the joint evolution of all relevant transport parameters of sedimentary reservoir rocks upon reaction with CO 2 is being investigated. After determination of initial saturated and relative permeability of the wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid,</b> porosity, diffusion coefficient, and pore size distribution, the rock sample is attacked by permeation with dissolved CO 2. After partial dissolution, the suite of transport parameters is measured again.

We show that the invasion process takes place in an active zone within a characteristic screening length from the tip of the most advanced finger. The invasion probability density is found to only depend on the distance to the latter tip, and to be independent of the value for the capillary number Ca. The mass density along the flow direction is related analytically to the invasion probability density, and the scaling with respect to the capillary number is consistent with a power law. Other quantities characteristic of the displacement process, such as the speed of the most advanced finger tip or the characteristic finger width, are also consistent with power laws of the capillary number. The link between the growth probability and the pressure field is studied analytically and an expression for the pressure in the defending fluid along the cluster is derived. The measured pressure are then compared with the corresponding simulated pressure field using this expression for the boundary condition on the cluster. Comment: 11 pages 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Instability {{of fluid}} {{cylinders}} and jets, a highly nonlinear hydrodynamic phenomenon, has fascinated researchers for nearly 150 years. A {{subset of the}} phenomenon is the core-annular flow, in which a <b>non-wetting</b> core <b>fluid</b> and a surrounding wall-wetting annulus flow through a solid channel. The model, for example, represents the flow of oil in petroleum reservoirs. The flow {{may be forced to}} break up when passing through a channel’s constriction. Although it has long been observed that the breakup occurs near the neck of the constriction, the exact conditions for the occurrence of the forced breakup and its dynamic theory have not been understood. Here, we test a simple geometric conjecture that the fluid will always break in the constrictions of all channels with sufficiently long wavelengths, regardless of the fluid properties. We also test a theory of the phenomenon. Four constricted glass tubes were fabricated above and below the critical wavelength required for the fluid disintegration. In a direct laboratory experiment, the breakup occurred according to the conjecture: the fluids were continuous in the shorter tubes but disintegrated in the longer tubes. The evolution of the interface to its pinch-off was recorded using high-speed digital photography. The experimentally observed core-annulus interface profiles agreed well with the theory, although the total durations of the process agreed less satisfactorily. Nonetheless, as the theory predicts, the ratio between the experimental and theoretical times of the breakup process tends to one with decreasing capillary number. The breakup condition and the dynamic theory of fluid disintegration in constricted channels can serve as quantitative models of this important natural and technical phenomenon...|$|R

This procedure successfully combines {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} imaging with a porous membrane chamber in order to visualize the <b>non-wetting</b> and wetting <b>fluid</b> flows with controlled boundary conditions. A specific pressure minute membrane chamber, made of non magnetic materials and able to withstand 4 MPa, was conceived and built for this purpose. These two techniques were applied to the drainage of Douglas fir sapwood. In {{the study of the}} longitudinal flow, narrow drainage fingers are formed in the latewood zones. They follow the longitudinal direction of wood and spread throughout the sample length. These fingers then enlarge in the cross-section plane and coalesce until drainage reach the whole latewood part. At the end of the essays, when drainage of liquid water in latewood is completed, just a few sites of percolation appear in earlywood zones. This difference {{is a result of the}} wood anatomical structure, where pits, the apertures that allow the sap to flow between wood cells, are more easily aspirated in earlywood than in latewood...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{two-phase}} flow in porous media {{has been studied}} experimentally, in a large quasi two-dimensional laboratory model of roughly $~ 214000 $ pores. Both the invasion phase and steady-state have been considered. Steady-state flow is a more realistic description of the situation deep inside natural reservoirs, than pure transient regimes. In all experiments the combination of glycerol/water and air {{have been used as}} the pair of wetting and <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> respectively. Analysis has been performed on the basis of digital imaging of displacement structures, pressure measurements and balance readings of produced output volume of wetting fluid. We seek to answer how pressure and fluid flow relate to dynamics and the observed displacement structures...|$|E
40|$|Generally, the {{interfacial}} stiffness {{is defined}} as the ratio of the normal or transverse stress to the corresponding interface opening displacement. The interfacial stiffness of a solid/solid interface is characteristic to the nature and degree of interface imperfections therefore it is a sensitive quantitative measure of bond quality. A similar definition of the normal interfacial stiffness can be introduced for fluid/fluid-saturated porous solid boundaries, too. In most cases, the surface pores are inherently “open” and the surface impedance is negligible when the sample is fully submerged in fluid. On the other hand, due to surface tension, practically closed-pore boundary conditions can prevail at an interface between a <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> (e. g., air) and a porous solid saturated with a wetting fluid (e. g., water) ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Geological carbon sequestration, as {{a method}} of {{atmospheric}} greenhouse gas reduction, is at the technological forefront of the climate change movement. During sequestration, carbon dioxide (CO₂) gas effluent is captured from coal fired power plants and is injected into a storage saline aquifer or depleted oil reservoir. In an effort to fully understand and optimize CO₂ trapping efficiency, the capillary trapping mechanisms that immobilize subsurface CO₂ were analyzed at the pore-scale. Pairs of proxy fluids representing the range of in situ supercritical CO₂ and brine conditions were used during experimentation. The two fluids (identified as wetting and non-wetting) were imbibed and drained from a flow cell apparatus containing a sintered glass bead column. Experimental and fluid parameters, such as interfacial tension, fluid viscosities and flow rate, were altered to characterize their relative impact on capillary trapping. Computed x-ray microtomography (CMT) was used to identify immobilized CO₂ (<b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid)</b> volumes after imbibition and drainage events. CMT analyzed data suggests that capillary behavior in glass bead systems do not follow the same trends as in consolidated natural material systems. An analysis of the disconnected phases in both the initial and final flood events indicate that the final (residual) amount of trapped non-wetting phase has a strong linear dependence on the original amount of non-wetting phase (after primary imbibition), which corresponds to the amount of gas or oil present in the formation prior to CO₂ injection. More importantly, the residual trapped gas was also observed to increase with increasing <b>non-wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> phase viscosity. This suggests that CO₂ sequestration can be optimized in two ways: through characterization of the trapped fluid present in the formation prior to injection and through alterations to the viscosity of supercritical CO 2...|$|E
40|$|The most {{interesting}} feature of acoustic wave propagation in fluid-saturated porous media is {{the appearance of}} a second compressional wave, the so-called slow compressional wave, in addition to the conventional P (or fast) wave and the shear wave [1, 2]. The slow compressional wave is essentially the motion of the fluid along the tortuous paths in the porous frame. This motion is strongly affected by viscous coupling between the fluid and the solid. Therefore, both the velocity and the attenuation of the slow wave greatly depend on the dynamic permeability of the porous frame. It was not until 1980, that Plona first experimentally observed the slow compressional wave in water-saturated porous ceramics at ultrasonic frequencies [3]. Only three years later, Feng and Johnson predicted the existence of a new slow surface mode on a fluid/fluid-saturated solid interface in addition to the well-known leaky-Rayleigh and true Stoneley modes [4, 5]. The slow surface mode is basically the interface wave equivalent of the slow bulk mode, but there is a catch: the surface pores of the solid have to be closed so that this new mode can be observed. Otherwise, a surface vibration can propagate along the fluid/fluid-saturated porous solid interface without really moving the fluid since it can flow through the open pores without producing any significant reaction force. All previous efforts directed at the experimental observation of this new surface mode failed because of the extreme difficulty of closing the surface pores without closing all the pores close to the surface (e. g., by painting). On the other hand, it has been recently shown that surface tension itself could be sufficient to produce essentially closed-pore boundary conditions at the interface between a porous solid saturated with a wetting fluid, such as water or alcohol, and a <b>non-wetting</b> superstrate <b>fluid,</b> like air [6]...|$|R

40|$|A poromechanical {{model of}} {{partially}} saturated deformable porous media is proposed {{based on a}} phase field approach at modeling {{the behavior of the}} mixture of liquid water and wet air, which saturates the pore space, the phase field being the saturation (ratio). While the standard retention curve is expected still to provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous skeleton, depending on the porous texture, an enhanced description of surface tension between the wetting (liquid water) and the <b>non-wetting</b> (wet air) <b>fluid,</b> occupying the pore space, is stated considering a regularization of the phase field model based on an additional contribution to the overall free energy depending on the saturation gradient. The aim is to provide a more refined description of surface tension interactions. An enhanced constitutive relation for the capillary pressure is established together with a suitable generalization of Darcy’s law, in which the gradient of the capillary pressure is replaced by the gradient of the so-called generalized chemical potential, which also accounts for the “force” associated to the local free energy of the phase field model. A micro-scale heuristic interpretation of the novel constitutive law of capillary pressure is proposed, in order to compare the envisaged model with that one endowed with the concept of average interfacial area. The considered poromechanical model is formulated within the framework of strain gradient theory in order to account for possible effects, at laboratory scale, of the micro-scale hydro-mechanical couplings between highly-localized flows (fingering) and localized deformations of the skeleton (fracturing) ...|$|R
