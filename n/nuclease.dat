5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology. Since the 1970s, {{a variety of}} techniques have been developed to specifically add, remove and edit genes in an organism. Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered <b>nuclease</b> enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired. The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism.|$|E
5|$|Topoisomerases are enzymes {{with both}} <b>nuclease</b> and ligase activity. These {{proteins}} change {{the amount of}} supercoiling in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break. Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix. Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.|$|E
5|$|The poly(A) tail acts as {{the binding}} site for poly(A)-binding protein. Poly(A)-binding protein {{promotes}} export from the nucleus and translation, and inhibits degradation. This protein binds to the poly(A) tail prior to mRNA export from the nucleus and in yeast also recruits poly(A) <b>nuclease,</b> an enzyme that shortens the poly(A) tail and allows the export of the mRNA. Poly(A)-binding protein is exported to the cytoplasm with the RNA. mRNAs that are not exported are degraded by the exosome. Poly(A)-binding protein also can bind to, and thus recruit, several proteins that affect translation, {{one of these is}} initiation factor-4G, which in turn recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit. However, a poly(A) tail is not required for the translation of all mRNAs. Further, poly(A) tailing (oligo-adenylation) can determine the fate of RNA molecules that are usually not poly(A)-tailed (such as (small) non-coding (sn)RNAs etc.) and thereby induce their RNA decay.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTrinucleotide repeat {{expansions}} {{are involved}} {{in more than two}} dozen neurological and developmental disorders. Conventional therapeutic approaches aimed at regulating the expression level of affected genes, which rely on drugs, oligonucleotides, and/or transgenes, have met with only limited success so far. An alternative approach is to shorten repeats to non-pathological lengths using highly specific <b>nucleases.</b> Here, I review early experiments using meganucleases, zinc-finger <b>nucleases</b> (ZFN), and transcription-activator like effector <b>nucleases</b> (TALENs) to contract trinucleotide repeats, and discuss the possibility of using CRISPR-Cas <b>nucleases</b> to the same end.

25|$|This is {{important}} because enzymes do not have perfect discrimination; a <b>nuclease</b> will still have some likelihood of acting even if the sequence does not match perfectly. So {{the activity of the}} <b>nuclease</b> on a sequence with one mismatch is less than the no-mismatch case, and activity is even less for two mismatches, but still not zero. Exclusion of these sequences, which are very similar but not identical, is still an important problem to be overcome in genome engineering.|$|E
40|$|Gene therapy by {{engineered}} <b>nucleases</b> is {{a genetic}} intervention being investigated for curing the hereditary disorders by targeting selected genes with specific nucleotides for establishment, suppression, abolishment of a function or correction of mutation. Here, we review the fast developing technology of targeted genome engineering using site specific programmable <b>nucleases</b> zinc finger <b>nucleases</b> (ZFNs), transcription activator like <b>nucleases</b> (TALENs) and cluster regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas) based RNA-guided DNA endonucleases (RGENs) and their different characteristics including {{pros and cons}} of genome modifications by these <b>nucleases.</b> We have further discussed different types of delivery methods to induce gene editing, novel development in genetic engineering other than <b>nucleases</b> and future prospects.

30|$|By contrast, {{the use of}} mitochondria-targeted <b>nucleases</b> {{has shown}} promise {{regarding}} their ability to target mutant mtDNA. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} mitochondria-targeted restriction endonucleases can be used to eliminate mutant mtDNA and to alter mtDNA heteroplasmy in living cells (Alexeyev et al., 2008) and mice (Reddy et al., 2015; Bacman et al., 2010). Moreover, customized endonucleases, such as transcription activator-like effector <b>nucleases</b> (TALENs) (Bacman et al., 2013) and zinc finger <b>nucleases</b> (ZFNs) (Minczuk et al., 2006), targeted to mitochondria have been utilized for the specific elimination of mitochondrial genomes carrying mutations responsible for mitochondrial diseases. In addition, these customized <b>nucleases</b> allow the development of specific <b>nucleases</b> against essentially any DNA sequence, overcoming the main limitation of restriction endonucleases, which typically have strict and limited DNA sequence recognition capacities (Bacman et al., 2013). However, these approaches have only been demonstrated in human tumor-derived cell lines or mouse models harboring mtDNA mutations. Characterizing the effects of mitochondria-targeted <b>nucleases</b> in patient-derived primary cells, especially pluripotent cells, is critical for our understanding of the practical application of mitochondria-targeted <b>nucleases</b> for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases and the prevention of germline transmission of mutant mtDNA.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{researchers}} developed zinc finger <b>nucleases,</b> synthetic proteins whose DNA-binding domains {{enable them to}} create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic <b>nucleases</b> called transcription activator-like effector <b>nucleases</b> (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger <b>nucleases</b> and TALENs require {{the creation of a}} custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.|$|R
25|$|Transcription activator-like {{effector}} nucleases (TALEN) are restriction {{enzymes that}} can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a TAL effector DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain (a <b>nuclease</b> which cuts DNA strands). Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) can be engineered to bind to practically any desired DNA sequence, so when combined with a <b>nuclease,</b> DNA can be cut at specific locations. The restriction enzymes can be introduced into cells, for use in gene editing or for genome editing in situ, a technique known as genome editing with engineered nucleases. Alongside zinc finger nucleases and CRISPR/Cas9, TALEN is a prominent tool {{in the field of}} genome editing.|$|E

25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{classification}} include: method of killing (pore-forming, <b>nuclease</b> activity, peptidoglycan production inhibition, etc.), genetics (large plasmids, small plasmids, chromosomal), molecular weight and chemistry (large protein, peptide, with/without sugar moiety, containing atypical amino acids such as lanthionine), and {{method of production}} (ribosomal, post-ribosomal modifications, non-ribosomal).|$|E
50|$|DNA purification: The {{ability to}} purify DNA from a sample is {{important}} for many modern biotechnology processes. However, samples often contain <b>nucleases</b> that degrade the target DNA {{before it can be}} purified. It has been shown that DNA fragments will partition into the light phase of a polymer-salt separation system. If ligands known to bind and deactivate <b>nucleases</b> are incorporated into the polymer phase, the <b>nucleases</b> will then partition into the heavy phase and be deactivated. Thus, this polymer-salt system is a useful tool for purifying DNA from a sample while simultaneously protecting it from <b>nucleases.</b>|$|R

50|$|One unique {{family of}} <b>nucleases</b> is the meganucleases, which are {{characterized}} by having larger, and therefore less common, recognition sequences consisting of 12 to 40 base pairs. These <b>nucleases</b> are particularly useful for genetic engineering and Genome engineering applications in complex organisms such as plants and mammals, where typically larger genomes (numbering in the billions of base pairs) would result in frequent and deleterious site-specific digestion using traditional <b>nucleases.</b>|$|R
25|$|Decay {{of mature}} miRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans is {{mediated}} by the 5´-to-3´ exoribonuclease XRN2, also known as Rat1p.

5000|$|Genome editing, or {{genome editing}} with {{engineered}} <b>nucleases</b> (GEEN) {{is a type}} of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted or replaced in the genome of a living organism using engineered <b>nucleases,</b> or [...] "molecular scissors." [...] These <b>nucleases</b> create site-specific double-strand breaks (DSBs) at desired locations in the genome.

5|$|<b>Nucleases</b> are {{enzymes that}} cut DNA strands by catalyzing the {{hydrolysis}} of the phosphodiester bonds. <b>Nucleases</b> that hydrolyse nucleotides from {{the ends of}} DNA strands are called exonucleases, while endonucleases cut within strands. The most frequently used <b>nucleases</b> in molecular biology are the restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line.

Among other remarkable uses, these <b>nucleases</b> have been employed to produce gene knockouts in mid-size and large animals, such as rabbits and pigs, respectively. This approach is cost effective, relatively quick, and can produce invaluable models for human disease studies, biotechnology or agricultural purposes.

25|$|Dimethyl sulfate also methylates adenine in {{single-stranded}} {{portions of}} DNA (e.g., those with proteins like RNA polymerase progressively melting and re-annealing the DNA). Upon re-annealing, these methyl groups interfere with adenine-guanine base-pairing. <b>Nuclease</b> S1 {{can then be}} used to cut the DNA in single-stranded regions (anywhere with a methylated adenine). This is an important technique for analyzing protein-DNA interactions.|$|E
25|$|The ERCC4/XPF protein {{consists}} of two conserved areas separated by a less conserved region in the middle.
