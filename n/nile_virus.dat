5|$|The American robin is a known {{reservoir}} (carrier) for West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus.</b> While crows and jays {{are often}} the first noticed deaths in an area with West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> the American robin is suspected {{to be a key}} host, and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.|$|E
5|$|American crows are common, widespread, and {{susceptible}} to the West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> making them useful as a bioindicator to track the virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from American crows to humans is unheard of and unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E

50|$|The Zika virus {{belongs to}} the Flaviviridae family and the Flavivirus genus, and is thus related to the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses.</b> Like other flaviviruses, Zika virus is enveloped and {{icosahedral}} and has a nonsegmented, single-stranded, 10 kilobase positive-sense RNA genome. It is most {{closely related to the}} Spondweni virus {{and is one of the}} two known viruses in the Spondweni virus clade.|$|R
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite this decline, the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, toxoplasmosis and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus.</b> Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E

Here we describe arbovirus co-infection detected in 310 sera samples collected from febrile, clinically suspected malaria/typhoid patients in Borno State, Nigeria. METHODOLOGY: Tested initially for Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy and for Salmonella Typhi by Widal test, samples were subsequently tested for chikungunya (CHIKV), yellow fever (YFV), dengue (DENV) and West <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses</b> (WNV) by plaque reduction neutralization test.

30|$|The Zika virus {{belongs to}} the Flaviviridae family and the Flavivirus genus and is thus related to the dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses</b> (Zuanazzi et al. 2017). Most {{patients}} show no symptoms or have mild symptoms (Zhang et al. 2017). Only 20 % of patients experience fever, rash, conjunctivitis and joint pain, while in some cases, symptoms disappear within a week (Wilbe et al. 2017; Zamani and Zamani 2017). Therefore, to develop a rapid and robust nucleic acid amplification assay to efficiently detect Zika virus is critically important for clinical treatment and disease prevention.|$|R
5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West <b>Nile</b> <b>Virus</b> may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
5|$|External parasites include chewing lice of {{the genus}} Saemundssonia, feather lice and fleas such as Ceratophyllus borealis. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite {{different}} species. Internal parasites include the crustacean Reighardia sternae, and tapeworms such as Ligula intestinalis {{and members of the}} genera Diphyllobothrium and Schistocephalus. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry Haemoproteus species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zika virus (ZIKV) is {{a member}} of the virus family Flaviviridae. It is spread by daytime-active Aedes mosquitoes, such as A. aegypti and A. albopictus. Its name comes from the Ziika Forest of Uganda, where the virus was first {{isolated}} in 1947. Zika virus is related to the dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West <b>Nile</b> <b>viruses.</b> Since the 1950s, it has been known to occur within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia. From 2007 to , the virus spread eastward, across the Pacific Ocean to the Americas, leading to the 2015-16 Zika virus epidemic.|$|R
50|$|Other {{possible}} viral causes are arbovirus (St. Louis encephalitis, West <b>Nile</b> encephalitis <b>virus),</b> bunyavirus (La Crosse strain), arenavirus (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) and reovirus (Colorado tick virus). The Powassan {{virus is}} a rare cause of encephalitis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Vector-borne {{diseases}} pose {{a continuing}} health {{risk to the}} global population. In the United States, the spread of West <b>Niles</b> <b>virus</b> (WNV) {{in the past several}} years across the country has been alarming. Using WNV as an example, this paper demonstrates how geographic information science (GIScience) and attendant technologies in remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and spatial statistics, can be used for the surveillance and control of disease vectors in general, and specifically mosquitoes in the case of WNV. Data supporting the analyses consist of local field surveillance data, population demographic data, and remote sensing data for habitat characterisation and environmental conditions affecting mosquito vector breeding. The results of this paper provide evidence that these technologies, integrated in scientific methods, provide valuable information to formulate risk management policies and actions...|$|R
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus,</b> which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E
25|$|Corvids are {{reservoirs}} (carriers) for the West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> in the United States. They {{are infected}} by mosquitoes (the vectors), primarily of the Culex species. Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an early-warning system when West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> arrives {{in an area}} (as are horse and other bird species deaths). One of the first signs that West <b>Nile</b> <b>virus</b> first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.|$|E
