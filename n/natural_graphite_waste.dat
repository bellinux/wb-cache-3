40|$|Heat {{spreaders}} can be {{made from}} <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> sheet materials. These spreaders take advantage of the anisotropic thermal properties of <b>natural</b> <b>graphite.</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>graphite</b> exhibits a high thermal conductivity in the plane of the sheet combined with a much lower thermal conductivity through the thickness of the sheet. As a result, a <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> sheet can function as both a heat spreader and an insulator and can be used to eliminate localized hot spots in electronic components. In some cases, a <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> heat spreader can replace a conventional thermal management system consisting of a heat sink and cooling fan. This paper examines the properties of <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> heat spreaders and the application of these spreaders to thermal management problems in laptop computers. The thermal and mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> <b>graphite</b> heat spreaders are presented along with a discussion of how those properties are measured.

40|$|Graphite {{has been}} used as a {{moderator}} and reflector of neutrons in more than 100 nuclear power plants and in many research and plutonium-production reactors. It is used primarily as a neutron reflector or neutron moderator, although graphite is also used for other features of reactor cores, such as fuel sleeves. Many of the graphite-moderated reactors are now quite old, with some already shutdown. Therefore radioactive graphite dismantling and the management of radioactive <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> are becoming an increasingly important issue for a number of IAEA Member States. Worldwide, there are more than 230 000 tonnes of radioactive graphite which will eventually need to be managed as radioactive waste. Proper management of radioactive <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> requires complex planning and the implementation of several interrelated operations. There are two basic options for <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> management: (1) packaging of non-conditioned <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> with subsequent direct disposal of the waste packages, and (2) conditioning of <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> (principally either by incineration or calcination) with separate disposal of any waste products produced, such as incinerator ash.

40|$|A {{large number}} of nuclear {{reactors}} with graphite as moderator and reflector material are facing to be decommissioned now or later, and the radioactive <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> is {{a large part of}} the involved wastes. In addition, high temperature gas-cooled reactors being developed rapidly use a large quantity of graphite material (up to 95 %) in the nuclear fuel elements, besides graphite material as their moderator and reflector material in the reactor cores. Therefore, it is very critical to manage these <b>graphite</b> <b>wastes</b> from the decommissioned and being decommissioned reactors. The part with low-level radioactive contamination that could not be reused now, may be disposed of as solid waste to reduce its volume, and the possibility of its being retrieved and reused in the future with advanced technology should be considered. The other <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> with high-level radioactive contamination requires much more consideration. Due to several factors, such as its large quantity, a lack of available disposal sites and public acceptance, it may not be disposed of directly in the repository any more. An option may be the transformation of the high-level radioactive <b>graphite</b> <b>waste</b> into low-level radioactive waste through physical and chemical processes. The current technologies involve, e. g., thermal treatment to release 36 Cl, capture of the 14 C from the gases of incineration of carbon material and decomposition of carbon dioxide into solid carbon. After these treatments the carbon material might be decontaminated and separated as low-level radioactive waste and a small amount of residual high-level waste could be disposed of ultimately. In order to achieve a sustainable development of graphite material, the maximum utility and the minimal disposal of radioactive graphite should be considered in the management of radioactive <b>graphite</b> <b>waste.</b> It is urgent to explore new technologies for decontaminating and recycling radioactive graphite. ...|$|R
