25|$|<b>Nucleating</b> {{factors are}} {{necessary}} to stimulate actin polymerization. One such <b>nucleating</b> factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a G-actin dimer in order to stimulate the nucleation (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric G-actin. The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments. Arp2/3-mediated nucleation is necessary for directed cell migration. Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|Slow cooling methods rely on {{the fact}} that cells contain few <b>nucleating</b> agents, but contain {{naturally}} occurring vitrifying substances that can prevent ice formation in cells that have been moderately dehydrated. Some cryobiologists are seeking mixtures of cryoprotectants for full vitrification (zero ice formation) in preservation of cells, tissues, and organs. Vitrification methods pose a challenge in the requirement to search for cryoprotectant mixtures that can minimize toxicity.|$|E
40|$|A nano-calcium {{carbonate}} supported calcium pimelate (CaHA) β-nucleating {{agent and}} β-nucleated PP was prepared. The influences {{of the content}} of support nano-calcium carbonate and supported β-nucleating agent on crystallization behaviors, melting characteristics and the content of β-PP were investigated by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analyses, and compared with calcium pimelate (CaHA) <b>nucleated</b> PP. The results indicated that PP <b>nucleated</b> by supported β-nucleating agent showed higher crystallization temperature than that of CaHA <b>nucleated</b> PP. The crystallization temperature and melting temperature of PP <b>nucleated</b> by supported β-nucleating agent increased with increasing the content of supported β-nucleating agent and decreased with increasing the content of the support nano-calcium carbonate. The content of β-iPP in the PP <b>nucleated</b> by supported β-nucleating agent was higher than that of CaHA <b>nucleated</b> PP. Further more, the content of β-PP was independent on the content of supported β-nucleating agent and nano-calcium carbonate...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{procedure}} {{was developed to}} account for the contribution of freshly <b>nucleated</b> particles to the total polymerization rate during micellar nucleation. It has been shown that the polymerization rate of the freshly <b>nucleated</b> particles cannot be described by a steady-state solution for a radical population balance over the particle size distribution, i. e., the classical Smith-Ewart recursion relation. Once <b>nucleated,</b> the particles grow for a significant period of time with one radical before either radical desorption or radical absorption, followed by instantaneous bimolecular termination, occur. For most emulsion polymerizations, radical desorption is the dominant process for radical loss of the freshly <b>nucleated</b> particles. A relation for the mean time that the freshly <b>nucleated</b> particles grow with one radical was derived...|$|R

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{proteins}} {{associated with the}} actin cytoskeleton in plants include: villin, which belongs to the same family as gelsolin/severin {{and is able to}} cut microfilaments and bind actin monomers in the presence of calcium cations; fimbrin, which is able to recognize and unite actin monomers and which is involved in the formation of networks (by a different regulation process from that of animals and yeasts); formins, which are able to act as an F-actin polymerization <b>nucleating</b> agent; myosin, a typical molecular motor that is specific to eukaryotes and which in Arabidopsis thaliana is coded for by 17 genes in two distinct classes; CHUP1, which can bind actin and is implicated in the spatial distribution of chloroplasts in the cell; KAM1/MUR3 that define the morphology of the Golgi apparatus as well as the composition of xyloglucans in the cell wall; NtWLIM1, which facilitates the emergence of actin cell structures; and ERD10, which is involved in the association of organelles within membranes and microfilaments and which seems to play a role that is involved in an organism’s reaction to stress.|$|E
500|$|While PrP is {{considered}} the only mammalian prion, prion-like domains {{have been found in}} a variety of other mammalian proteins. Some of these proteins have been implicated in the ontogeny of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, known as Motor Neurone Disease outside the US), [...] frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as some forms of Systemic Amyloidosis including AA (Secondary) Amyloidosis that develops in humans and animals with inflammatory and infectious diseases such as Tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, Rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV AIDS. AA amyloidosis, like prion disease, may be transmissible.

In the {{presence}} of <b>nucleating</b> substances the freezing point of water {{is the same as the}} melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can supercool to −42°C (−43.6°F, 231K) before freezing. The chemical element with the highest melting point is tungsten, at 3687 K (3414°C, 6177°F); this property makes tungsten excellent for use as filaments in light bulbs. The often-cited carbon does not melt at ambient pressure but sublimes at about 4000K; a liquid phase only exists above pressures of 10MPa and estimated 4300–4700K (see [...] ). Tantalum hafnium carbide (Ta4HfC5) is a refractory compound with a very high melting point of 4215K (3942°C, 7128°F). At the other end of the scale, helium does not freeze at all at normal pressure even at temperatures close to absolute zero; pressures greater than twenty times normal atmospheric pressure are necessary.|$|E

40|$|Rat kidneys were {{disaggregated}} with 0. 25 % trypsin. Cell {{were separated}} by velocity sedimentation in a previously described isokinetic gradient, by isopycnic sedimentation, and by velocity sedimentation followed by isopycnic sedimetation. In some fractions from the isokinetic gradient, 71. 8 +/- 2. 4 + of the <b>nucleated</b> cells contained histochemically demonstrable alkaline phosphatase (HDAP); in semithin sections, 62. 7 +/- 2. 3 % of these cells had brush borders. The correspondence between fractions enriched for cells with HDAP and fractions enriched for brush border suggested that HDAP might be a suitable marker for rat proximal tubule cells. These cell constituted 46. 5 +/- 2. 6 % of the <b>nucleated</b> cells in the starting sample suspension of kidney cells, and 81. 9 +/- 2. 7 % of <b>nucleated</b> cells in the purified fractions from the gradients.

2500|$|Aside {{from its}} direct {{clinical}} use, paclitaxel is used extensively in biological and biomedical research as a microtubule stabilizer. [...] In general, in vitro assays involving microtubules, such as motility assays, rely on paclitaxel to maintain microtubule integrity {{in the absence}} of the various <b>nucleating</b> factors and other stabilizing elements found in the cell. [...] For example, it is used for in vitro tests of drugs that aim to alter the behavior of microtubule motor proteins, or for studies of mutant motor proteins. [...] Moreover, Paclitaxel has been used in vitro to inhibit insulin fibrillation; in a molar ratio of 10:1 (insulin:paclitaxel), it hindered insulin fibrillation near 70%. Iso-thermal titration calorimetry (ITC) findings indicated a spontaneous tendency of paclitaxel to interact with insulin through hydrogen bonds and van der Waal’s forces. Paclitaxel is sometimes used for in vivo studies as well; it can be fed to test organisms, such as fruit flies, or injected into individual cells, to inhibit microtubule disassembly or to increase the number of microtubules in the cell. [...] Paclitaxel induces remyelination in a demyelinating mouse in vivo and inhibits hPAD2 in vitro though its methyl ester side chain. [...] Angiotech Pharmaceuticals Inc. began phase II clinical trials in 1999 as a multiple sclerosis treatment but in 2002, reported that the results showed no statistical significance.|$|E
