If change is gradual, there may be enough time for biota adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather poor soil and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum natural selection and adaption.|$|E
25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|Löhe {{was born}} on 21 February 1808 {{in the town of}} Fürth in present-day Middle Franconia. The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 and he seemed to have had a very lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> the lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E

He was attracted to the United Party <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> its policies but by his admiration for its leading figures—he considered the Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins [...] "a man of the calibre I think of Rhodes". The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial Legislative Assembly were overwhelmingly from the white minority (about 5% of the population). The United Party broadly represented commercial interests, civil servants and the professional classes.|$|E

Tony Perry of The Patriot-News felt {{it was one of}} the low points of the album, stating [...] "'Exit'... crescendoes into little more than noise", a sentiment echoed by Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News who called it [...] "a dull piece". Writing for the Orange County Registrar, Jim Washburn and Noel Davis called it [...] "a journey through a killer's mind, made harrowing <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> Hewson's creepy-religio lyrics as by the band's (still the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton) overdriven backing, which practically boils right out of the pot."

500|$|Van Meegeren played {{different}} roles, some {{of which}} were shrouded in fraudulent intentions, as he sought to fulfill his goal of besting his critics. Han’s father was said to have once told him, [...] "You are a cheat and always will be." [...] On the other hand, his brothers and sisters perceived him as loyal, generous, and affectionate, and he was always loving and helpful to his own children. The question [...] "what was his character" [...] cannot be answered unequivocally. Indeed, recent works question many of the existing assumptions about van Meegeren and the motivations for his career in forgery. With Han van Meegeren, everything was double-edged, and his character presents itself as fragments rather than unity. In 2008, Harvard-trained art historian Jonathan Lopez had become fluent in Dutch and published 'The Man Who Made Vermeers, Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han Van Meegeren'. His extensive research confirmed that van Meegeren started to make forgeries, <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> feeling misunderstood and undervalued by art critics as for the income that it generated, income which he needed to support his addictions and promiscuity. Lopez confirmed the veracity of Jan Spierdijk's article in 'De Waarheid' in which Spierdijk reported that the book 'Tekeningen 1' by van Meegeren was in Hitler's library, signed by the artist and dedicated to the Führer.|$|E

500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E

2500|$|The Semitic {{languages}} are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology.

For example, in Arabic, the root meaning [...] "write" [...] has the form k-t-b. From this root, words are formed by filling in the vowels and sometimes adding additional consonants, e.g. كتاب kitāb [...] "book", كتب kutub [...] "books", كاتب kātib [...] "writer", كتّاب kuttāb [...] "writers", كتب kataba [...] "he wrote", يكتب yaktubu [...] "he writes", etc.|$|E

During the audience Fitzwilliam explained his position and the King [...] "Upon the whole his attention was gracious, but he gave no opinion whatever, only as to my intentions".

2500|$|Two {{unresolved}} historical {{debates are}} associated with Roerich's departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people's commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture) which the Bolsheviks considered establishing during 1917–1918, but that he {{refused to accept the}} job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat. [...] It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot {{by the fact that the}} Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat. [...] Second, when he wished to reconcile with the USSR, Roerich maintained later that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in Karelia (there he painted a series of pictures under the name [...] ""), had been isolated from their homeland when civil war began in Finland. However, Roerich's extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime – prompted <b>not</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>by</b> a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at Lenin's ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia's artistic and architectural heritage – was amply documented. [...] He illustrated Leonid Andreyev's anti-communist polemic [...] "S.O.S." [...] and had a widely published pamphlet, [...] "Violators of Art" [...] (1918–1919). Roerich believed that [...] "the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend".|$|E
