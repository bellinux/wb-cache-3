In 1863, the surrounding estates and park were sold off altogether by the duchy to Earl Brownlow; Brownlow also agreed to rent the castle from the duchy for a <b>nominal</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stretford Public Hall {{was built}} in 1878 by John Rylands. It was {{designed}} by N. Lofthouse {{and is on the}} western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford's first public lending library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building at the disposal of the local authority for a <b>nominal</b> <b>rent,</b> and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's {{allowance}} was {{supplemented by}} government favours and illegal currency trading. The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine {{side of the}} Bois de Boulogne, for a <b>nominal</b> <b>rent.</b> The French government exempted him from paying income tax, and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary. In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement with liberal politics. The royalties from the book added to their income. Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, A Family Album, chiefly about the fashion and habits {{of the royal family}} throughout his life, from the time of Queen Victoria to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} long run {{historic}} development of the Amsterdam rental housing market (1550 - 1850). Using rent data on a large cross section of residential properties in Amsterdam {{we are able to}} develop an annual constant-quality rent index for the entire time period. Whereas <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> nearly tripled over the considered sample period, average Amsterdam house rents, in real terms, had approximately the same level in 1850 as they exhibited in 1550. Otherwise stated, <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> and goods prices rose at the same pace. Over these 301 years, the real index moves between a minimum level of 45. 6 and a maximum of 162. 4. As concerns the relation between the housing market and the real economy, we find empirical evidence that fluctuations in rents and fluctuations in proxies of business cycle activity comove, both in nominal and in real terms...|$|R

25|$|In the 16th century, {{the town}} fell into decline after {{abandonment}} of the castle {{following the death of}} Cicely Neville, Duchess of York in 1495, {{and the rise of the}} nearby town of Hemel Hempstead (which was granted a Charter of Incorporation by Henry VIII on 29 December 1539). Berkhamsted Castle passed through the hands of three of Henry VIII's wives: Catherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII bequeathed Ashridge Priory to his daughter Elizabeth. The priory became her private residence during her sister Mary I's reign. The population of the town in 1563 has been estimated at only 545. In 1580, the castle ruins and the park were leased by Elizabeth I to Sir Edward Carey, for the <b>nominal</b> <b>rent</b> of one red rose each year. Stone from the castle was used to build Berkhamsted Place, a local school, and other buildings in the late 16th century. Brewing and maltings was noted as one of the town’s principal industries in the reign of Elizabeth. Around 1583, a new market house was erected west of St Peter's Church at the end of Middle Row (alternatively named Le Shopperowe or Graball Row). The market house was destroyed in a fire in 1854.|$|E

His chief task was to establish the plantation of the southern province of Munster, a significant escalation of colonial policy. The Crown sought to parcel out lands at <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> from the confiscated estates of the lately defeated Earl of Desmond - some 600,000 acres (2,400 km²) — on condition that the undertakers plant English farmers and labourers to build towns and work the land.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} 'tenancy rent control' where rent increases on, and evictions of, sitting tenants are prohibited but <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> for "new" tenants are unrestricted. If there is "any" inflation, landlords prefer to take short-staying tenants. If {{there is no way}} for landlords to tell a tenant's type, an adverse selection problem arises. If landlords have monoply power, then they may prefer not to raise the rent even when there is excess demand for housing. These 'efficiency rents' show that tenancy rent control can give rise to equilibria that look as if there were a flat ceiling on rents.

500|$|Following the {{foundation}} of Newton Heath LYR F.C., {{at the request of}} the employees of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) company's Carriage and Wagon Works, the club needed a pitch to play on. The chosen site was owned by the Manchester Cathedral authorities, but although conveniently sited next to the wagon works it was a [...] "bumpy, stony patch in summer, [...] a muddy, heavy swamp in the rainy months". The railway company agreed to pay a <b>nominal</b> <b>rent</b> to the authorities and to lease the ground to the football club. As it was next to the railway line operated by the LYR, the ground was often clouded in a thick mist of steam from passing trains. Players had to get changed in TheThreeCrowns public house, a few hundred yards away on Oldham Road, as there were no facilities nearby. There may have been some kind of refreshment offered to supporters at the eastern end of the site.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> {{for at least}} one form of capital, offices, are at least as rigid as the nominal prices and wages. We build a closed economy NNS model with two types of capital, offices and {{business}} capital, in order to investigate how office rent rigidity affects the design of the optimal monetary policy. Our findings suggest that an interest rate rule that reacts only to office rent inflation achieves levels of welfare that are remarkably close to the Ramsey optimal policy. We also find that when both price and wage rigidities exist, an interest rate rule that reacts only to office rent inflation outperforms interest rate rules that react to either price or wage in‡ation, regardless of whether the office rents are rigid...|$|R

[...] Sir William Whitmore's building still stands in St Leonard's Close. It has been converted into three private town houses with Grade II* listed status. The School was named by Edward Careswell of Bobbington as one of the several free grammar schools in Shropshire, also including Shrewsbury, Newport, Wem, Shifnal and Donnington (the last appears to have had only a short existence) to benefit by his will, which in 1690, {{during the reign}} of William III and Mary II devoted certain local properties to the maintenance of eighteen, later reduced to ten, scholars from these schools at Christ Church, Oxford University.

The Bishop Estate had subdivided some of its land on Oahu, and leased individual lots to land lessees who built homes on them, at first paying <b>nominal</b> <b>rents</b> to the estate.

2500|$|The Fire Brigade's {{original}} premises {{were located}} in the undercroft area of the Perth Town Hall, for which they paid a <b>nominal</b> <b>rent.</b> [...] In 1899 the Fire Brigades Board proposed that land be bought in {{the proximity of the}} Town Hall and a new station be built. In October 1899 it was reported that the Roman Catholic Bishop Gibney had offered some land at the intersection of Murray and Irwin Streets, which was then purchased for ₤3,125. A list of architects was submitted to the Board, which on 26 October 1899 selected Michael Cavanagh, with the stipulation that the building he design not exceed ₤4,000. [...] Cavanagh was an architect who came from Adelaide to Perth in 1895, attracted by the gold boom prosperity in Western Australia. He formed his own architectural firm, Cavanagh & Cavanagh, with his brother James. Cavanagh also designed the Great Western Hotel (Brass Monkey Hotel), alterations to St Mary's Cathedral, Mount Hawthorn Hotel (Paddington Ale House), Fremantle Fire Station (1908), St Patrick's Basilica (Fremantle), Sisters of Mercy Convent (Bunbury) and remodelled the Archbishop's Palace.
