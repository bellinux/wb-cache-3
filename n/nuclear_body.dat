40|$|The {{transcription}} factor STAT 3 {{is involved in}} a variety of biological functions. It is most essential for the signal transduction of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and related cytokines. In response to IL- 6 stimulation STAT 3 monomers are recruited by the gp 130 subunit of the IL- 6 receptor, become phosphorylated, dissociate, dimerize, and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to enhancer sequences of target genes. * The subnuclear localization of the {{transcription factor}} STAT 3 was analyzed by confocal laserscanning microscopy. Activated STAT 3 was found in dot-like structures within the nucleus which were termed STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies.</b> * The fusion protein STAT 3 -YFP was generated to visualize the nuclear translocation after stimulation in living cells. The formation of STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> appeared to be transient. It correlated with STAT 3 tyrosine phosphorylation kinetics. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that STAT 3 in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> is phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 and serine 727. * FRAP- and FLIP-techniques allowed to analyse the mobility of STAT 3 -YFP in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies.</b> FRAP revealed that irreversibly bleached STAT 3 -YFP in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> is substituted by unbleached STAT 3 -YFP. Moreover, a quantitative approach showed that STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> consist of a mobile and an immobile fraction of STAT 3. Taken together, on the one hand there is a rapid exchange of STAT 3 in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> with the environment {{and on the other hand}} the immobile STAT 3 molecules are bound to an interaction partner. Nuclear STAT 3 that was not accumulated in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> diffuses freely in the nucleoplasm. * Furthermore, colocalization studies were performed with respect to the spatial relationship of STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>nuclear</b> architecture. These studies showed that STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> were neither colocalized with splicing factor compartments (SFC, "speckles") nor with PML <b>bodies.</b> STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> appeared to be an autonomous subnuclear compartment. Interestingly, STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> are colocalized with markers of transcriptionally active chromatin (i. e. acetylated histones, histone-acetyl-transferases). STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> and nascent pre-mRNA are spatially accompanied. * For additional studies a deletion mutant called STAT 3 -?TAD 709 -YFP was generated. This mutant lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). STAT 3 -TAD 709 -YFP showed a weak nuclear translocation after stimulation. STAT 3 -TAD 709 -YFP did not appear in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> and it inhibited the formation of STAT 3 -wild type-nuclear bodies in a dominant-negative manner. This is a hint, that the transactivation domain of STAT 3 could have a mediating function in the assembly of STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies.</b> One could imagine two functions of STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies.</b> (1) STAT 3 <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> could be directly involved in active gene transcription. In this case STAT 3 in <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> would be bound to DNA and is accompanied with transcriptional cofactors.

This structure is disrupted in a variety of human disorders including acute promyelocytic leukemia and viral infections, suggesting that alterations in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>body</b> may have {{an important role in the}} pathogenesis of these diseases. In this study, we identified a cDNA encoding a leukocyte-specific <b>nuclear</b> <b>body</b> component designated Sp 110. The N-terminal portion of Sp 110 was homologous to two previously characterized components of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>body</b> (Sp 100 and Sp 140). The C-terminal region of Sp 110 was homologous to the transcription intermediary factor 1 (TIF 1) family of proteins. High levels of Sp 110 mRNA were detected in human peripheral blood leukocytes and spleen but not in other tissues. The levels of Sp 110 mRNA and protein in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB 4 increased following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and Sp 110 localized to PML-Sp 100 nuclear bodies in ATRA-treated NB 4 cells. Because of the structural similarities between Sp 110 and TIF 1 proteins, the effect of Sp 110 on gene transcription was examined. An Sp 110 DNA-binding domain fusion protein activated transcription of a reporter gene in transfected mammalian cells. In addition, Sp 110 produced a marked increase in ATRA-mediated expression of a reporter gene containing a retinoic acid response element. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that Sp 110 is a member of the Sp 100 /Sp 140 family of <b>nuclear</b> <b>body</b> components and that Sp 110 may function as a nuclear hormone receptor transcriptional coactivator. The predominant expression of Sp 110 in leukocytes and the enhanced expression of Sp 110 in NB 4 cells treated with ATRA raise the possibility that Sp 110 has a role in inducing differentiation of myeloid cells...|$|E

By the combination of both classifications, 11 types of <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> were distinguished. The separation between filamentous and granular components was distinct in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>bodies</b> of the mice, cats and dogs, incomplete in those of the sheep and cows, and both components were so heavily intermingled with each other in those of the horses and ass.
