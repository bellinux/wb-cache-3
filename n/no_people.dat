5|$|As the {{hurricane}} {{passed over the}} Azores, several weather stations reported low barometric pressures, with the lowest being a measurement of 984 mbar (hPa; 29.06 inHg) on Terceira Island at 0600 UTC on September 25. As {{a result of the}} impending storm, several Pan Am Clipper flights to the archipelago were suspended for three consecutive days. The maximum reported gust in the Azores was an observation of 65mph (100km/h) on September25. As a result of moving slowly over the islands, torrential rainfall was also reported. At Angra do Heroísmo, 13.11in (333mm) of precipitation was reported in a four-day, accounting for a third of the station's yearly average rainfall. Strong storm surge was reported at the same location. The waves swept boats away from the coasts of islands. Further inland, there was extensive damage to homes and crops, though <b>no</b> <b>people</b> died. Despite evidence that the system had distinct tropical characteristics, it was not operationally added to HURDAT.|$|E
5|$|In 1725, the French sailor Julien Tafforet was marooned on the Mascarene {{island of}} Rodrigues for nine months, and his report {{of his time}} there was later {{published}} as Relation d'île Rodrigue. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of Île Gombrani, which was then called au Mât. François Leguat, a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), {{did not have a}} boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did. <b>No</b> <b>people</b> who later traveled to the island mentioned the bird. In an article written in 1875, the British ornithologist Alfred Newton attempted to identify the bird from Tafforet's description, and hypothesised that it was related to the extinct hoopoe starling (Fregilupus varius), which formerly inhabited nearby Réunion.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} two {{hurricane}} landfalls, Hurricane Valerie, struck northwestern Mexico in June. The other, Hurricane Doreen, hit further {{to the north of}} Valerie in October. The most impacting storm of the season was Tropical Storm Claudia, after its remnants dropped heavy rainfall in portions of Arizona. The rainfall left damaging flooding across rivers and towns. <b>No</b> <b>people</b> were killed, but damage totaled to $11 million (1962 USD). Moreover, Tropical Storm Bernie also made landfall along the Baja California peninsula, later providing rain to Arizona. An unusually high number of storms threatened the Palmyra Atoll, where only 1% of known Pacific tropical cyclones have threatened. In all, a total of 16 storms were observed, which was above average though only two (Valerie and Doreen) reached hurricane intensity.|$|E

5|$|At {{its closest}} {{approach}} to China, Saomai generated high waves that coincided with high tide, resulting in extensive damage. In {{preparation for the}} storm, schools in Ningbo were forced to close, and ferry service was discontinued. Over 20,000people were evacuated by the Chinese government onto higher land. The most severely affected Chinese province was Zhejiang. A station in Dinghai District observed 102mm (4.02in) of rain in 18hours, equivalent to {{more than half of}} that station's monthly average. In Zhoushan, 20,000hectares of farmland were inundated and 2,500homes collapsed. Off the island, ten fishing boats collided, and another oil tanker capsized. Areas in Gaoting were submerged under as much as 1m (3.3ft) of water. Off the coast, 225boats and 130piers were damaged. In Shanghai, 20streets were flooded and hundreds of homes were flooded with water. At nearby Hongquiao Airport, an Airbus A340 bound for Paris slipped off the runway. Though <b>no</b> <b>people</b> were injured, the airport was closed for eight hours. The typhoon also caused the Huangpu River to rise to its third highest level in recorded history.|$|E

25|$|On Kayangel in Palau, a high {{storm surge}} damaged several houses, while strong winds downed trees.

In Koror, winds reaching as high as 120km/h (75mph) blew out rooftops and downed trees and power lines. A causeway linking an offshore hospital to the main island was temporarily shut down after being inundated by water.

25|$|The biggest {{disaster}} {{in the history of}} the BVZ occurred in its jubilee year of 1991. On 18 April at 6.45 am, approximately 15 million cubic metres of rock broke away from the Wartfluh northwest of Randa and buried the Vispa and parts of the hamlet Lerc, along with 100 metres of railway track. <b>No</b> <b>people</b> were injured, as the hamlet Lerch was uninhabited and at the time of the landslide there was no train in the affected section of track. However, a goods train heading for Zermatt was left standing a few hundred metres north of the incident site, after its traction failed due to damage to the overhead line and the resulting short circuit. Passenger and goods traffic was temporarily moved to the road, which was left undamaged. Between Herbriggen and Randa, omnibuses operated bustitution services, and between Randa and Zermatt the trains ran in a shuttle service. As from 22 April, it was again possible to operate through goods trains, for which a diesel locomotive of type HGm 4/4 was hired from the Furka Oberalp Bahn. Passenger traffic initially remained suspended, as further landslides could not be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November 1968 the Ilmatar was {{en route}} from Stockholm to Turku in heavy fog with 177 {{passengers}} on board. She was scheduled to pass Botnia of Siljavarustamo near Långnäs, Åland around 2 AM. Both ships were in radar and radio {{contact with each other}} and their captains agreed on where and when the ships would pass each other. Despite the precautions the ships collided at 2:12 am, after the Botnia had accidentally drifted to {{the wrong side of the}} shipway. Due to the heavy fog, visual contact was not established until five seconds before the collision. The Ilmatars bow hit the Botnias starboard side in a 40° angle, tearing a 40-meter gash on the Botnia and destroying eight cabins. One crew member and two passengers of the Botnia were killed instantly, while seven passengers were seriously injured and three of them died later on. The Ilmatars bow was entirely destroyed but <b>no</b> <b>people</b> on board here were seriously injured. She was able to continue to Turku under her own power, and re-entered service after repairs on 8 December 1968. The crew of the Ilmatar were found innocent of causing the accident.|$|E
