40|$|In Argentina, {{especially}} in San Matias Gulf, oyster {{culture is a}} recent activity. Culture of native flat oyster, Ostrea puelchana (d'Orbigny, 1842), was particularly promising until an abnormal mortality occurred in 1996. Preliminary diagnosis, based on histology, revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in some individuals. In order to identify the pathological agent apparently involved in this mortality and to quantify its impact on <b>natural</b> <b>beds,</b> 42 batches of 30 individuals were sampled on <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> and culture areas between years 1996 and 2001. Samples were analyzed by traditional techniques including heart imprints and histology, complemented by PCR and in situ hybridization. Histology and heart imprints revealed the presence of Bonamia-like cells in connective tissue of O. puelchana, free or within haemocytes, mainly in gills, digestive gland, stomach, intestine and gonad. PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed the belonging of the parasite to the genus Bonamia. Cultivated oysters and close <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> presented highest frequency of parasite detection (50 - 60 %) when mortality was maximal (October 1997). Subsequently, prevalence decreased slowly until 2000 and increased again from 6 % to 10 % between 2000 and 2001. Spatial and temporal propagation of the parasite was observed from culture areas to <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> during two time intervals (1997 - 1999 and 2000 - 2001). Now, it needs to characterize this new microcell from molecular and ultrastructural point of views {{in order to assess}} it taxonomic relationships with other Bonamia species...|$|R

50|$|In 1954, Hurricane Hazel moved large {{sedimentary}} land in {{the valley}} of the Rivière Blanche, forming a sediment dam spanning 192 km² and diverting the course of the Rivière Blanche from its <b>natural</b> <b>bed.</b> Its waters found an outlet downstream in the flowing direction of the Étang Saumâtre. In January 2014, a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Association of Agricultural Producers was signed, to correct the alignment of the Rivière Blanche to re-groove its original channel over a length of 5.5 km long, and by harnessing to strengthen this part of the river course weak.|$|E
50|$|Hydroelectric {{installations}} {{and chains}} of locks on the Durance, {{and its tributaries}} the Verdon, Buëch and Bléone had the most significant economic impacts and are the most visible change in the landscape. The {{major part of the}} flow was diverted into canals downstream from Serre-Ponçon, and the flow in the river's <b>natural</b> <b>bed</b> is a minimal flow of , which is only 1/40 of its natural flow. The silt in the river bed has become stabilised by vegetation and this also reduces the flow. Thanks to the reservoirs at Serre-Ponçon and Sainte-Croix, which together can hold more than 2 billion tonnes of water, irrigation remains possible in summer even during the driest years. The predictable water levels have also allowed development of the local economy through summer tourism.|$|E
50|$|The canal's {{eastern end}} {{was in the}} Kieler Förde {{at the mouth of}} the river Levensau. The canal ran westward in the small river's <b>natural</b> <b>bed</b> to the first lock, by the Holtenau packing house, and on to the second, by Gut Knoop. At both of these sites there were {{pre-existing}} bridges across the Levensau. Then, for a short distance the canal separated from the Levensau to run northwest from Achtstückenberg to the third lock at Rathmannsdorf, where the canal reached its maximum elevation of 7 m above sea level. The section of the canal from Knoop to the Rathmannsdorf lock has been preserved, with remains of the locks still standing. West of Rathmannsdorf the canal rejoined the riverbed of the Levensau and followed it westward until connecting with the Flemhuder See, which provided the reservoir of water for the operation of the canal's most elevated segment.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to analyse genetically <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> and {{cultures}} of the most commercially important mollusc of Santa Catarina (South Brazil), the brown mussel Perna perna. Two sites were chosen for sampling from <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> and for settling experimental lines with seeds obtained from each local farm. Experimental lines were maintained during four months for evaluating the growth of mussels from different cultures. DNA was extracted by Chelex-Proteinase-k method from adductor muscle and amplified by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using PMS 1 microsatellite primers. Denatured 6 % polyacrylamide gel and silver staining were used for separation and visualisation of PCR products, respectively. The nuclear locus obtained showed {{no significant differences in}} allele frequencies between natural stocks. Cultured mussels in Penha did not differ genetically from <b>natural</b> <b>beds,</b> but Canto Grande culture was significantly different from the local stock. Mean sizes reached in experimental lines and also from individuals collected in natural stocks were found to be higher in Canto Grande than in Penha. Canto Grande samples showed departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the studied locus, due to heterozygote deficiency. The genetic distinction of Canto Grande cultured mussels suggests that seeds from other localities may have been used occasionally by fishermen to set lines for culture...|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally small {{diameter}} holes (35 mm) were drilled horizontally {{under each}} rock {{and charged with}} a small quantity of gunpowder, chosen because of its relative non-shattering properties. When fired the gunpowder produced a [...] "heave" [...] which dislodged the rock from its <b>natural</b> <b>bed,</b> hopefully undamaged. Stone was cut using plugs and feathers, where a series of short, small diameter (typically 30 mm) holes are drilled in a line where a cut is to be made. One plug and two feathers were inserted into each hole and each plug is hit in turn with a sledgehammer until the stone yields to the extreme tensile stresses produced. Most stone is many times weaker in tension than in compression, plugs and feathers utilize this fact. It is also worth noting that stone tends to split much more easily parallel to bedding planes (called graining) than perpendicular to them (called cutting).|$|E
50|$|In {{the center}} of the Blacksburg campus lies the Drillfield, a large oval field running {{northeast}} to southwest, encircled by a one-way street that is known as Drillfield Drive. The Drillfield's name, coined in 1926 after the completion of Virginia Tech's first real stadium, stems from its use by the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets to conduct military drills. A waterway, Stroubles Creek, runs beneath the Drillfield on the south side. A three-sided conduit for the creek that retains the <b>natural</b> <b>bed</b> of the creek was installed in 1934, and, in 1971, the first two asphalt walks were added. The urban legend that the Drillfield is sinking at the rate of an inch per year, however, has no basis in fact. In the summer of 2014, three dirt paths were paved as part of the university's master plan to improve the landscaping and pathways, add seating areas, and enhance path entrances around the Drillfield.|$|E
40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{represent an}} important source of cadmium exposure in humans, in particular oysters, because of their high filter feeding capability and high concentration of metal-binding metallothionein in tissues. In this study the authors investigated the difference in cadmium bioaccumulation in European flat oysters harvested from production areas in the district of San Benedetto del Tronto (Ascoli Piceno province, Italy), as a function of their origin (farming or <b>natural</b> <b>beds)</b> and the time of gathering. The beds lie 3 nm off-shore at a depth of 20 - 40 m and are collected by dredging. In the farms, baskets are suspended in the water column 2. 5 - 3 nm offshore at a depth of 4 m.

Although the few data did not allow to find a significant statistical association, they suggested two findings: i) cadmium concentration in oysters from <b>natural</b> <b>beds</b> seemed to be lower than in farmed oysters; and ii) in farmed oysters cadmium concentration even exceeded allowed maximum level for human consumption, in particular in autumn. The vertical stratification in the water column of phytoplankton and a cadmium dilution at oyster gonadal maturation might cause changes in oyster cadmium accumulation...|$|R
