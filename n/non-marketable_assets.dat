40|$|Very {{preliminary}} draft Several investment decisions deal with <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> <b>Non-marketable</b> <b>assets</b> are often {{available only to}} one investor and indivisible. This has relevant consequences on investors ’ investment opportunities. Adhering to a mean variance representation of the investment space and considering a non-marketable asset (divisible or not), we derive some possible investment scenarios an investor may face. Furthermore, we show how bounded rationality affects investors ’ portfolio choices. Our results define a set of conditions under which the non-marketable asset represents a good investment and show that, under certain assumptions, the efficient frontier exhibits non-linearities and discontinuity points. That permits us to divide investors which can access a non-marketable investment between entrepreneurs, that undertake it, and clerks, that invest their entire wealth on the market.

40|$|The close {{relationship}} between the social welfare of citizens and environmental goods is as clear {{as the fact that}} such environmental goods cannot be sold in the market, simply because they are priceless. This leads people to misuse them, preventing them from fulfilling their vital social functions. Based on this relationship, this study describes and analyzes the main specific methods and the respective econometric models of valuation of those goods, generated in valuation processes as a result of extra economic actions or fortuitous situations that did not arise from their own economic or market actions. Thus, its public nature is defined from a legal point of view and from the conventional economic theory, and the importance of its valuation is dimensioned in detail. In addition to highlighting the most relevant limitations, direct and indirect methods of valuation for <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets</b> are examined, particularly the contingent valuation method and its referendum variant, as well as the hedonic valuation method, applied to non-homogeneous goods, distinguishable by their attributes, including the environmental ones...|$|E
40|$|A {{discount}} for {{the lack}} of marketability is the implicit cost of quickly monetizing a <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> at its current value. These discounts are used in many venues to determine the fair market value of a <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> such as a privately-held business. There has been much written on the quantification of the discount {{for the lack}} of the marketability which is briefly summarized in this article. Marketability refers to monetizing the <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> at its cash equivalent current value. Current practice often uses the cost of a put option as a proxy for the discount. A put option insures that the investor will receive no less than the current value of the underlying asset. However, the use of a put also allows the investor to maintain the asset’s upside potential. Therefore, the cost of a put overstates the discount {{for the lack of}} marketability. We show that the cost of monetizing a <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> at its current value through a loan, secured by an at-the-money equity collar, more effectively captures the true cost of marketability. When puts and calls cannot be employed to secure the current value on the underlying asset, a portfolio consisting of the <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> and a stock index, where puts and calls can be written on the index can be constructed. The effectiveness of the portfolio in creating a risk free outcome depends upon the correlation and volatility of the stock index and the <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset.</b> We demonstrate that, relative to current practice, the use of an equity collar with a loan greatly reduces the implied discount for the lack of marketability...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} the possible normative {{relevance of the}} links between human capital and financial assets via an example related to growth. Human capital investments occur in a risky environment, {{in that they are}} subject to aggregate uncertainty. Agents are heterogenous in their income streams, and this generates different risk attitudes and the scope for trading in financial assets. In this environment, human capital is a <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> that interacts with the existing financial structure in transferring wealth over time. When the financial structure is complete, growth is indeterminate because individual allocations between human capital and a tradable asset are indeterminate. When the financial structure is incomplete, the growth rate depends on the payoff structure of the assets. An issue of optimality for the structure of asset returns is raised. Incomplete Markets, Human Capital, Growth...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the environment of}} Foreign Direct Investment in Brazil {{with the purpose of}} determining the biggest hurdles and incentives for establishing a business in the country. The study is analysed {{in the context of the}} Diamond model of national wealth, first introduced by Porter (1990) and is based on secondary source research and data. The main motives are outlined as resource-seeking, market-seeking and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> seeking and assessed by using a number of determinants that is commonly used when investing whether a country is competitive in role of attracting investments from abroad. Found was that Brazil has a competitive advantage in terms of market size and a population growing purchasing powers that stems from recent economic growth. The main obstacle for Brazil is now to regain economic stability since the country currently is undergoing recession and invest in infrastructure which is currently one of the largest barrier for foreign (and domestic) businesses...|$|R
40|$|The {{valuation}} of illiquid or <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets</b> {{is complicated by}} the fact that the discount rate cannot be computed by using the risk attributes of the asset along with market parameters. Rather, individual attitudes toward risk affect the discount rate. Some recent research has avoided this difficulty by adopting an "opportunity cost approach", arguing that an undiversified holder of a risky asset will require at least the return that they could have earned by leveraging the market portfolio to achieve the same level of risk. We evaluate this claim in a model with an explicit utility function. It turns out not to be true that the opportunity cost necessarily understates the required rate of return, unless we also restrict the holder of an illiquid asset to invest all her liquid wealth in the market portfolio. When the holder can also invest in a riskless asset, the opportunity cost method actually overstates the required rate of return for investors with sufficiently low risk-aversion. In general, however, the opportunity cost approach provides a reasonable approximation to the exact required rate of return over a wide range of risk-aversion levels provided the investor can also borrow and lend. ...|$|E
40|$|Through {{this paper}} we analyze {{the demand for}} assets in {{presence}} of a dependent background risk (informational asymmetries, political risk, "noisy traders", investment constraints, moral hazard, cross border risk, market risk, <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets,</b> [...] ). The desirability of the risky asset is pointed out and {{also the fact that}} the demand is monotonously decreasing in the degree of dependence in a specified interval by the use of stochastic variation. Negative dependence is enough to guarantee that investors will take more risky asset even if the expected excess return is null, and this result is reversed in case of positive one. The convexity of the marginal utility is enough to guarantee that the fraction of wealth optimally invested in the risky asset is unambiguously larger (smaller) for wealthier individuals when the dependence is negative (positive). The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop an analytical framework for investment decision making in globalize international financial markets. To this end we will use some results coming from the area of risk theory. We will also show how this framework can be applied to the particular case of noisy markets. Our attention will be focused on the dependence between the risky asset and the background risk...|$|E
40|$|Income {{is a major}} {{indicator}} of the economicwell-being of families. But income measures onlyshort-term inflows that affect current consumption and saving. Wealth, on the other hand, measures the surplus accumulated by families and thus provides a better {{indicator of}} long-term well-being. Wealth may be targeted toward long-term goals such as retirement, {{but it can also}} help families cope with income inter-ruptions or handle unexpected expenditures. Income is widely available from survey and adminis-trative sources. Wealth, on the other hand, is much harder to measure and, as such, {{has been the focus of}} only infrequent surveys (see Data source and definitions). Wealth has many components, some of which are measured more easily than others. The main division is between marketable components, which can be sold or transferred, and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets,</b> which have value only for those who hold them. Some market-able assets such as savings accounts, tax-deferred sav-ings plans, stocks, bonds and mutual funds are readily measured. Others such as real estate, durable goods or business equity are seldom traded, and so their value must be estimated. The principal non-marketable asset is an employer pension plan. Employees or their survivors may draw benefits according to the plan, but its present value is not a tradable commodity and is complicated to estimate. After all assets are valued and summed, debt must be subtracted to arrive at a final measure of wealth. This article explores the levels and components of wealth inequality in Canada. Many studies have detailed the effects of regional diversity on the distribution of income (Alasia 2003; Finnie 1998; Melvin 1987...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} it is contended the idea that, even though FDI {{has been at}} the centre of the {{analysis}} for a long time, economic literature has not still adopted a unified framework for the investigation of the issue at stake. Indeed, despite some important exceptions, above all Dunning [29], motivations have been highly disregarded from the current analysis. We put forward the idea that motives underlying what we have called a “cherry picking ” activity must be considered essential cause they shape and direct the different alternatives available to the firm. Moreover, a well structured motive-based taxonomy concerning FDI decision is presented, composed by three main parts: (i) resource seeking, (ii) market seeking and (iii) <b>non-marketable</b> <b>asset</b> seeking. Finally, the effects of a set of factors on FDI decision are taken into account. We start by pointing out that empirical literature has found seemingly contradictory results on the effects of several variables on inward/outward FDI decisions. Indeed, it is shown that useful insights can be drawn from our taxonomy taking {{a closer look at the}} empirical literature dealing with factors affecting FDI decision...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship is {{more and}} more {{considered}} a key driver of economic performance. Recent works in the literature on this research area (see Saxenian, 1994; Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004; Cooke, 2004; Cassia, Fattore and Paleari, 2006) suggest that there is a positive link between entrepreneurship capital, regional economic performance and the creation of new firms and businesses. This kind of intangible assets promotes the spillover of knowledge, becoming crucial in building firms and regional innovation capability and strengthening learning capacities. Entrepreneurship is, thus, about change and innovation. In relation to these concepts, the aim of the paper is to highlight the entrepreneurial dimension behind the creation of firms formed around new business ideas in a knowledge-based economy, where value-relevant assets are expected to consist predominately of intangible and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets.</b> To this purpose, we focus on companies going public on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a market dedicated to young and growing companies in both science and non-science based industries. The AIM was launched in 1995, allowing to a large number of SME to go public in the UK, and, today, is recognized as the most successful secondary market in Europe, brought forward as an example by other stock exchanges in mainland Europe. In the paper we investigate the post-IPO performance of listed firms, during the period going from 1995 to 2002, with the aim, first, to highlight the determinants shaping that performance and influencing the local milieu and, secondly, to underline the role of entrepreneurship. The results of this work have some policy implications both at national and regional level. At the national level, policy makers should take into account the relevance of an efficient financial system, in particular the emerging role of secondary markets, and try to remove financial constraints that hamper the the prospect of new businesses. At the regional level, political intervention should aim to promote entrepreneurial activities, which ease the regional process of change, for example, by encouraging the propensity to risk and facilitating the access to external capital. ...|$|E
40|$|Futures bias, the {{phenomenon}} that futures prices deviate from expected future spot prices, is widely acknowledged and documented by researchers and practitioners alike. Academic literature presents two prominent explanations for this effect. The first theory, documented by e. g. Black (1976), implies that futures bias {{is caused by}} systematic risk, the covariance of futures returns with market portfolio returns, and therefore {{can be viewed as}} a risk premium that market participants are willing to earn (or pay) when entering futures positions. Besides systematic risk, futures bias is explained by hedging pressure, the effect of net positions of commercial traders on futures returns. Keynes (1930) and Hicks (1939) imply that excess supply of futures contracts resulting from producers hedging their long commodity positions drives futures prices below expected future spot prices. Later literature such as Rolfo (1980) and Hirshleifer (1988) show that quantity risk and elastic demand may cause producers to enter long futures positions, inducing upward futures bias. Bessembinder (1992) and de Roon et al. (2000) introduce models combining systematic risk and hedging pressure in a single framework. The latter paper shows that, with market participants holding both marketable securities and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets</b> requiring futures hedging, futures returns should partly be determined by each futures contract’s own hedging pressure, as well as cross pressures from other futures markets. Hedging pressure is also shown to affect underlying asset returns. Testing their models empirically, both papers conclude that while hedging pressure effects are present on most futures markets, evidence in financial futures markets is inconclusive. Commitments of Traders (COT) reports issued weekly by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) show aggregate futures positions of large commercial (hedging), non-commercial (speculative) and non-reportable (small) traders. This data allows for creating time series of hedging pressure, as well as speculative and small trader pressure variables, showing whether each trader class is net long or short futures on average. In addition, total open interest in each futures contract is documented in COT reports. Building on the hedging pressure model introduced in de Roon et al. (2000), this study adds new variables for speculative and small trader pressure. The original model, extended pressure model and simple regressions from total open interest to returns are tested on six financial futures indices with data from 2003 to 2015. Splitting the sample in two sub-periods, temporal changes in pressure and open interest effects on returns are examined. The results show that, controlling for systematic risk, some statistically significant effects for all included pressure variables are present in both sub-periods. For five out of six futures indices, however, total open interest is more significant than any pressure variable in explaining futures returns. Effects of pressure variables on other financial futures, or on underlying asset returns, are not observed to a significant extent...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Innovation in {{information}} technology (IT) has changed the way economic activity is carried out and organised. The eventual macroeconomic outcome of these changes and the macroeconomic profile of an IT-based economy are still uncertain. The major global correction in equity prices of IT companies, the dramatic cutbacks in IT investment and the abrupt deterioration in business conditions in the United States and elsewhere have all contributed to {{the sense that the}} structural changes in the economy may well be smaller and less beneficial than some of the most enthusiastic proponents of the "new economy" had argued. Since the contribution of the most recent wave of IT development has not been observed over a full business cycle, the outcome remains uncertain. But evidence of structural changes in different countries is abundantly available at the microeconomic level, with implications for firms’ financial structure and the character of financial intermediation. By improving the availability and dissemination of information, IT has the potential to act as a catalyst for fundamental changes in production processes and in the competitive environment within and outside the IT sector. IT facilitates more customised production based on flexible work processes. This involves firm reorganisation that allows IT and human capital to be combined in an efficient way. As a consequence of these skill-biased production changes, intangible and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>assets</b> such as intellectual property rights and firm-specific knowledge gain in importance. In addition, incorporating performance-based incentives into compensation schemes becomes more prevalent. This fundamental transformation of the firm is mirrored by changes in the household sector. Households tend to assume more business risk both through the provision of capital and, in tendency, also through labour income. These trends have implications for the financing needs of firms and the confidence with which firms’ performance can be assessed and foreseen. Firm reorganisation towards "soft" and customised production tends to increase idiosyncratic risks. And simultaneous changes in the competitive environment and in business models may alter the risk-reward profile of firms quickly and in an unpredictable way. In tendency, the need increases for capital that bears business risk and for corporate governance structures that create incentives to adapt to new ways of production. This suggests a greater role for equity and for financial contracts that incorporate equity characteristics. Corporate financing patterns support the notion of an increasing role for equity and equity-like instruments in the financing of both new and established firms. Venture capital has offered a way to combine funding of high-risk projects and managerial support in a flexible way for new and innovative firms, which typically lack collateral, track record and managerial experience. Established firms in the IT sector, but also in other industries, have increasingly relied on public equity and on debt instruments incorporating equity characteristics such as convertible bonds, issuance in the high-yield segment of the bond market, coupon step-up clauses or bank loans with terms contingent on the borrower’s performance. The boom and bust in the IT segment of equity markets has clearly influenced external funding, but factors like the establishment of new instruments and markets for equities or related instruments suggest that there will be lasting effects. Generally, the character and the role of different financial arrangements can be expected to change according to the altering risk-return profile and financing preferences of firms. In addition to modifications in the design of financial contracts, this would include adjustments in the valuation techniques applied by financial intermediaries and in the management of risks and exposures. One example is an increasing specialisation of intermediaries in financing firms in different stages of the corporate life cycle. Another may be greater reliance on credit risk transfer in order to achieve the desired diversification of portfolios. The boom and bust of IT equities and their impact on the financial system highlight several important issues raised in this study. First, on the positive side the huge loss in equity wealth has not triggered any major default among financial intermediaries. This suggests that the shift of risk from financial intermediaries to investors in financial markets through increasing reliance of firms on market-based financing has provided for a better, more dispersed allocation of risks across sectors that have been able to bear them. This possibly includes the diffusion of IT-related credit exposures through credit risk transfer markets. Overall, business-related risks seem to have been distributed more broadly across the economy. Second, valuation problems have been substantial and were probably exacerbated by market practices - eg with respect to IPOs - that might not have dealt appropriately with the specific information and valuation problems that characterise new and innovative firms. Looking ahead, greater relevance of firm-specific risks and difficulties in evaluating them is likely to affect volatility clusters in financial markets and in particular in equity markets. While overall market volatility need not necessarily be higher, heightened price volatility of individual stocks could become a persistent phenomenon. With rising idiosyncratic risk, diversification may require larger portfolios and more widely ranged exposures than before to generate desired levels of risk. Third, equity market conditions had considerable knock-on effects for other segments of the financial system. The decline of IT equity prices impacted adversely on the provision of venture capital and private equity to high-tech firms. The drop in equity market capitalisation also reduced the willingness of banks and other financial institutions to provide new finance to these sectors, as the validity of earlier assumptions about the ease of refinancing existing debt finance through equity markets was undermined. As equity market valuation is likely to become more central, fluctuations in equity prices would be easily transmitted to other markets. One transmission channel that may involve risk is the reliance on the equity market capitalisation of a firm as an indicator of its future earning capacity and hence its ability to service debt. Fourth, the difficulties associated with the assessment of credit risk involved in financing innovative activities became apparent. A case in point is the telecoms sector. The quality of telecoms debt declined rapidly and the inability of some telecoms companies to arrange equity market take-outs of bank debt and rising defaults left banks with unanticipated exposures. More generally, in a climate of rapid technological change and intense competition, banks may face a rapidly evolving credit risk environment. Correlation of risk factors among sectors will change when industries expand into new markets. As a consequence, issues related to sectoral exposures or an increasing reliance on credit risk transfer tools would become increasingly relevant. And technological change challenges the reliability of backward-looking indicators (such as default histories) for credit risk assessment. In a longer-term perspective, these experiences can be seen as part of a learning process for all participants, which may have led to significant improvements in risk management and valuation capability. However, the tentative nature of these arguments should be recognised, as it is still too early to draw final conclusions about the implications of the IT sector boom, its subsequent bust and its future course. Reconsidering and reassessing these implications should be the subject of future investigations. The general issue for public policy {{in the face of a}} technological shock is to strike the right balance between exploiting potential gains and avoiding risks that could threaten the overall system. Financing plays a role in supporting the reorganisation of the corporate sector and in allocating the risks associated with this process. And this role is likely to increase as market-based incentive mechanisms gain in importance and the management of financial risks becomes more complex. Main risks involved in the financing of new technologies are large-scale failures of investment projects that may damage the financial institutions providing funding and excessive price movements in financial markets resulting from unrealistic expectations. Against this background, the task of financial policy is to set a framework of standards and guidelines that allows for market-driven adjustment of financing mechanisms and encourages ongoing improvement in risk management techniques. Central banks can play an active role in this process. One aspect of this role is employing the research capabilities and the knowledge of the financial system combined in central banks to improve the understanding of the financial impact of technological change. The other aspect is active monitoring of the financial system. Changing linkages between the real and the financial sphere and across the different segments of the financial system, and in particular the reallocation of risks across the financial system, underline the need for systemic monitoring. ...|$|E
