500|$|Madonna {{collaborated with}} Cirque du Soleil {{to produce the}} show, and her {{longtime}} choreographer Jamie King was its music director. King suggested hiring Moment Factory. The production studio, which had worked on Celine Dion's Las Vegas residency shows, specializes in [...] multimedia effects. Jacques Methe, Cirque du Soleil executive producer for special events, {{said that it was}} [...] "contributing to the creative process that will lead to the creation of this very special moment... For us, it's an interesting opportunity. It's <b>not</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do very often, working with other stars". According to Methe, Cirque du Soleil was involved with the creative side of the halftime show and its logistical challenges. The circus had previously put together a nine-minute pregame show at the 2007 Super Bowl. [...] "Our work has been done mostly to help magnify and create an environment for the artists", said Moment Factory executive producer Eric Fournier, citing shows in which the studio had used lighting and video projections for special effects.|$|E

40|$|In {{this short}} {{rejoinder}} to Friedrich Kratochwil 2 ̆ 7 s plea for a 2 ̆ 7 pragmatic approach to theory building 2 ̆ 7, I argue that, despite his {{claims to the}} contrary, his position essentially rests on a curious form of foundationalism and relativism. The problem, as I identify it, is that Kratochwil 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to move contemporary debate forward fails because he treats the issue only in epistemological terms. Kratochwil is deeply suspicious of {{the very idea of}} the 2 ̆ 7 real world 2 ̆ 7 and reduces it to an infinitely malleable construct of our ways of thinking and talking about it. This means that he remains trapped in the epistemological cave and is condemned to an endless quest to solve problems that have no solution. But the real world is <b>not</b> simply <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> think and talk about but, rather, we engage with it in practice and as such it offers resistance to our attempts to grasp it. Hence, it is not a subject without a voice in the global conversation. This is an important theoretical limit, particularly in relation to contemporary issues surrounding global environmental problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} detail the Biblical {{principle}} of the Tangible Emmanuel (coined by author) in how God, who is with us, uses his creation to show forth His glory. Tracing several Biblical passages where God uses matter {{as a means to}} reveal His message, presence, or glory. The listener will be drawn into {{a deeper understanding of the}} connection between the spiritual and material realms. Once this is established, a brief understanding of the sacramental system (matter and spirit in our own time) will be outlined, and finally the Shroud of Turin will be discussed in great detail on how it fits into the Tangible Emmanuel. By understanding the Biblical actions of God, we can understand with greater clarity the presence of the Shroud of Turin and how this “Biblically unmentioned ” cloth follows the logic and pattern of the actions of God as recorded in Sacred Scripture. The conclusion of this paper will reveal that the Shroud‟s presence should <b>not</b> necessarily be <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be astonished at, but rather, through tracing the Scriptural account of how God works in this world, we should almost expect something like the Shroud to come as a result of the crucifixion and the resurrection. It is the mysteries that lie within the cloth, mor...|$|R

40|$|The Thousand and One Nights {{is often}} brushed aside as {{a manifestation of}} a long-ago past, its stories recast in orientalist tropes and scoured for clues to the secrets of foreign cultures. Yet, increasingly, {{scholars}} are engaging with the text in more complex ways, realising that to read it in this manner is to chain it to a context with which it was never entirely familiar. Born out of centuries of dissemination and cross-pollination, the Nights is better understood as a dynamic thing, a work produced in its movement through time and place. It therefore asks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> find a mode of reading suited to its restlessness, one that accounts for what, in The Limits of Critique, Rita Felski identifies as "the transtemporal liveliness of texts". Such a reading draws us towards a discussion of the text <b>not</b> simply as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can hold but as a phenomenon, as more thing than object. By looking at the text-as-thing alongside the things in the text, we can see the many ways in which the Nights can be considered what Marina Warner describes as a world of stories "lodged in goods" that are alive and sentient. Making use of Warner's insightful study of the text, Stranger Magic, together with Felski's literary reworking of Actor–Network Theory, this thesis explores the thing-culture of the Nights, looking at how the saturation of the text's historical and fictional worlds with objects, both worldly and otherworldly, reveals more than simply the artefacts of bygone eras. By recognising the agency of things, the thesis proposes, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>we</b> come closer to a method of reading that treats the text with neither reverence nor suspicion and, in doing so, reveal {{the ways in which the}} Nights is able to contribute to understandings of our own thing-culture and current literary praxes...|$|R

[...] He described [...] "One More" [...] as a song for [...] "every addict of everything", adding [...] "I need one more day or one more hour, give me another cigarette, give me one more drink, dope, sex, whatever. I think the chorus is kind of cool. All I need is one more this, one more that, sunshine, not the sunshine of your love, but it could be that.
