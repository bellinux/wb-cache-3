The fundamental functions are: the logical AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and <b>NAND</b> <b>operations</b> (gates) and bit-by-bit arithmetic operations. Each of the logical operations is realized by employing a single chaotic element. Computer memory can be constructed by combining logical gates. With these fundamental ingredients in hand, it is conceivable to build a simple, fast, yet cost effective, general-purpose computing device.

These devices can be modeled as dynamical systems, i. e. memristive devices or memristors for short.

In this work, two logic-in-memories approaches are studied by means of dynamical simulations. The first one is the initial ‘stateful’ logic concept introduced by Boghetti et al., and the second approach is the complementary switch-based concept later suggested by Linn et al. In both cases, the considered device is an electrochemical metallization cell for which good dynamical models are available. The study {{is limited to the}} comparison of elementary logic functions—multi-stage logic as well as parallelization features of both approaches are not considered here.

40|$|A Sheffer {{function}} {{is a function}} which can produce by superposition all functions of a con-sidered set. In this paper we give an exact formula {{for the number of}} n-ary Sheffer symmetric functions in three-valued losic. 1. Preliminaries The set of k-valued logical functions, i. e. the union of all the sets t / | nf- noy for neco, where Ep:{ 0, 1,, [...] ,k- l}, is denotedby Pp. A Sheffer function in P 1 is a function which can produce by superposition (cf. [8, 18]) all functions of Pk. A typical example of such a {{function is}} the <b>NAND</b> <b>operation</b> in the algebra of logic. In the combinatorial circuits it corresponds to a logical primitive which can construct all circuits solely by using it. A variation of the definition of Sheffer functions is the concept of &quot;Sheffer with constants &quot; which assumes that one can freely utilize constant-valued functions, besides a primitive function, at function composition. This is considered as a more suitable assumption in real combinatorial circuit design, since the constant-valued functions are usually obtained with no extra cost. We will briefly present results about Sheffer functions in P 2. The number of Sheffer functions of n variables in P 2 is 22 '- 2 - 22 '-'-l (cf. [5, 7, 18]) while the number of n-ary symmetric Sheffer functions of P 2 is 2 n- 1 for n even and 2 '-t- 2 @-t) / 2 otherwise [23]. When n is large, 25 Vo of the (symmetric) functions are Sheffer functions. The number of n-variable Sheffer functions with constants in P 2 is 22 '-Zn+r + n + 2 - F(n), where P(n) denotes the number of monotone increasing functions of n variables [7]. The number of symmetric Sheffer functions with constants in P 2 is zn+t-n- 4 (n> 2) [21]. When n is large, almost all (symmetric) Boolean functions are Sheffer with constants. Sheffer functions in P 3 {{have been reported in the}} literature (cf. ll 2,l 3, 17, 18, 251). Let W,(k) be the number of n-ary Sheffer functions in Pp.

40|$|In recent years, organic {{thin-film}} electronics {{have emerged}} as a route towards flexible, low-cost, large area applications, which are unfeasible in the current silicon technology. For example, low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can be placed on any object, as envisioned by the Internet of Things, for smart labeling, security, monitoring, or tracking purposes. For these applications, a nonvolatile memory functionality is crucial for their intended operation. Therefore, simultaneous {{to the development of}} organic transistors and circuits, progress needs to be made towards a compatible nonvolatile, electrically reprogrammable memory array. In this doctoral research, we aim to realize such an organic memory array that can be integrated with the organic logic circuits on the same, flexible substrate. More specifically, we focus on the device architecture and materials of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFET) as the basic memory unit. The objective of this work was pursued by a combination of i) technological advancements over the state-of-the-art; ii) further understanding of the device operation; iii) devising a read-and write scheme suited for an array; and iv) use of novel materials and device architectures. By optimizing the processing conditions, we demonstrate high-performance bottom gate - top contact (BG-TC) FeFETs with pentacene as the organic semiconductor, as shown in Chapter 2. These memory devices can switch within a few ms, and can be cycled for at least 10000 times. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate a long term retention data of more than one year. These results make this device highly promising for non-volatile memory applications. Unexpectedly for a bi-stable material, the BG-TC FeFET shows three reprogrammable memory states: OFF, Intermediate and ON state. Using Scanning Kelvin Probe Microscopy, we elucidate the device operation in this device structure in Chapter 3. These measurements show that the ferroelectric layer in the channel region of the FeFET is not fully polarized in the OFF and Intermediate states. The difference between these two states can be explained by a different injection property of the contacts, caused by the ferroelectric polarization state underneath the source-drain contacts. This refinement clarifies the peculiarities experimentally found in literature, as well as in our own results. To integrate with organic circuits, as well as to fabricate memory arrays, photolithography must be used. In addition, the bottom gate - bottom contact (BG-BC) device architecture needs to be adopted. By further technology development, we realize such a memory FeFET that can be integrated with current state-of-the-art organic circuits on flexible substrates, as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Moreover, we employ this technology to fabricate a passive NAND array, as described in Chapter 5. The NAND architecture was chosen, as it offers the highest possible density of all transistor memory arrays. Despite the fact that passive arrays are more challenging to reliably address all FeFETs, we demonstrate a non-destructive read and write operation in the NAND array. Finally, novel device architecture and materials are explored to improve the memory characteristics in Chapter 6. Replacing pentacene with novel, high mobility semiconductors alone are proven to be unsuccessful to enlarge the memory window in the BG-BC FeFET. On the other hand, by adapting a planar heterojunction structure in the device, the memory window can be significantly enlarged by 30 - 60 %. The heterojunction device architecture is promising for further improvements, as many combinations of organic semiconducting materials are possible.

40|$|Scaling of {{nanoelectronics}} consequently {{comes along}} with power consumption in integrated circuits, either {{in terms of}} static power consumption Pstatic due to different leakage contributions or in terms of dynamic power consumption Pdynamic, accounting for the power density arising in an integrated circuit and thus, restricting an arbitrary miniaturization. Since dynamic power consumption scales with the second power of the supply voltage, Pdynamic / V 2 DD, a reduction of the latter represents a promising approach in order to enable low power electronics. However, a reduction of the supply voltage VDD inevitably results in an either lowered on-current Ion or increased off-current Ioff of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). A reduction of the subthreshold swing SS of the transistoras {{a measure of the}} steepness of its transition from the off- to the on-state in turn allows for a reduction of the supply voltage VDD without accepting an either lowered on-currentIon or increased off-current Ioff. However, since charge transport in a MOSFET is based on thermionic emission over a potential barrier due to a broadened Fermi distribution function, its subthreshold swing SS is limited to 60 mV/dec at room temperature T = 300 K. In order to overcome this inherent limitation of a MOSFET and allow for a smaller subthreshold swing SS, the tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) has been suggested as a promising alternative due to its charge transport realized by means of quantum mechanical band-to-band tunneling (BTBT). Within the framework of this thesis, two different proposals of a TFET device concept allowing for low power applications are investigated. As a first approach, a vertical Silicon-Germanium/Silicon (SiGe/Si) heterostructure TFET is considered which makes use of strained SiGe as a material with smaller band gap Eg at the source tunnel junction in order to increase the probability for BTBT while suppressing the ambipolar switching characteristics in parallel due to the use of Si with its higher band gap Eg as compared to SiGeat the drain tunnel junction, thus enabling a heterostructure device concept. As a second approach, a planar SiGe/Si heterostructure TFET is presented which not only makes use of strained SiGe as a material with smaller band gap Eg at the source tunnel junction, but also benefits from a selective and self-adjusted silicidation in combination with a counter doped pocket at the source tunnel junction in order to enable line tunneling aligned with the gate electric field lines in an enlarged area directly underneath the gate. In addition, for both types of TFETs, technology computer aided design (TCAD) simulations are consulted in order to evaluate the respective experimental results as well as to illustrate potential improvements of each device concept. However, the vertical SiGe/Si heterostructure n-TFET suffers from a high subthresholdswing SS, a weak onset of the drain current Id with a pronounced S-shape as well as novisible saturation of the drain current Id due to a strong degradation of both tunnel junctions which may stem from poor electrostatic control caused by a defective interface between semiconductor and high- dielectrics as well as a pronounced surface roughness at the sidewalls of the fin, both favoring trap assisted tunneling (TAT). In addition, a pronounced ambipolar switching characteristics despite a heterostructure device concept becomes obvious, resulting from a much stronger contribution from TAT at the p++-SiGe tunnel junction as compared to the n+-Si tunnel junction, caused by the different chemical compositions of their respective interfacial oxide layers {{on the one hand and}} a much higher carrier concentration n within the SiGe layer on the other hand, scaling TAT. The planar SiGe/Si heterostructure p-TFET in turn reveals a high on-current Ion of 6. 7 μA/μm at a supply voltage VDD of 0. 5 V in parallel with an average subthreshold swing SS of about 80 mV/dec over four orders of magnitude of drain current Id. Benchmarking the planar SiGe/Si heterostructure p-TFET with published state of the art TFETs in terms of on-current Ion and average subthreshold swing SS over four orders of magnitude of drain current Id highlights the planar SiGe/Si heterostructure p-TFET outperforming other devices due to line tunneling aligned with the gate electric field lines being the dominant contribution to BTBT. Pulsed measurements allow for an identification of TAT being responsible for a degradation of the subthreshold swing SS. A sharp transition of the activation energy Ea from both Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and TAT to BTBT regime within a small gate voltage window Vg of less than 0. 4 V is revealed by means of low temperature T measurements, being much steeper as compared to state of the art Si, SiGe or Ge TFETs, thus facilitating high on-currents Ion at a low supply voltage VDD and a constant subthreshold swing SS in parallel. Finally, p-logic Not-AND (<b>NAND)</b> <b>operation</b> is demonstrated by means of two planar SiGe/Si heterostructure p-TFETs connected in series, highlighting their ability for both low power electronics and logic applications down to ultra-low supply voltages VDDof 0. 1 V...|$|E

40|$|An {{attractive}} {{direction in}} next-generation information processing {{is the development}} of systems employing particles or quasi-particles other than electrons ideally with low dissipation as information carriers. One such candidate is the magnon: the quasi-particle associated with the eigen-excitations of magnetic materials known as spin waves. Magnonics, the Þeld of science dealing with magnon-based data operations, encompasses a full spectrum of phenomena used in general wave-based signal processing [1]. The data can be coded into magnon phase or density and processed using wave effects such as interference. This approach has already been realised in spin-wave logic gates performing XNOR and <b>NAND</b> <b>operations</b> [24]. The main drawback of these gates is that the input data was coded in a form of DC electric pulses manipulating magnon phases, while the output signal was carried by the magnons themselves. Obviously, that made it impossible to combine two logic gates without additional magnon-to-voltage converters. More-over, the processing of large amounts of data has to be made on the same magnetic chip exclusively within the magnonic system. This fact stimulated a search for a way to control one magnon by another magnon and {{for the development of the}} all-magnon device. In this Report we present an insulator-based magnon transistor.

We developed an accurate energy consumption model for SSDs that computes aggregate, {{as well as}} component-specific, energy consumption of SSDs in sub-msec time scale. In our study, we used five different FTLs (page mapping, DFTL, block mapping, and two different hybrid mappings) and four different channel configurations (two, four, eight, and 16 channels) under seven different workloads (from large-scale enterprise systems to small-scale desktop applications) in a combinatorial manner. For each combination of the aforementioned parameters, we examined the energy consumption for individual hardware components of an SSD (micro-controller, DRAM, NAND flash, and host interface). The following are some of our findings. First, DFTL is the most energy-efficient address-mapping scheme among the five FTLs we tested due to its good write amplification and small DRAM footprint. Second, a significant fraction of energy is being consumed by idle flash chips waiting for the completion of <b>NAND</b> <b>operations</b> in the other channels. FTL should be designed to fully exploit the internal parallelism so that energy consumption by idle chips is minimized. Third, {{as a means to}} increase the internal parallelism, increasing way parallelism (the number of flash chips in a channel) is more effective than increasing channel parallelism in terms of peak energy consumption, performance, and hardware complexity. Fourth, in designing high-performance and energy-efficient SSDs, channel switching delay, way switching delay, and page write latency need to be incorporated in an integrated manner to determine the optimal configuration of internal parallelism.

40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to resolve the Journaling of Journal Anomaly in Android IO stack. We orchestrate SQLite and EXT 4 filesystem so that SQLite’s file-backed journaling activity can dispense with the expensive filesystem intervention, the journaling, without compromising the file integrity under unexpected filesystem failure. In storing the logs, we exploit the direct IO to suppress the filesystem interference. This work consists of three key ingredients: (i) Preallocation with Explicit Journaling, (ii) Header Embedding, and (iii) Group Synchronization. Preallocation with Explicit Journaling eliminates the filesystem journaling properly protecting the file metadata against the unexpected system crash. We redesign the SQLite B-tree structure with Header Embedding to make it direct IO compatible and block IO friendly. With Group Synch, we minimize the synchronization overhead of direct IO and make the SQLite <b>operation</b> <b>NAND</b> Flash friendly. Combining the three technical ingredients, we develop a new journal mode in SQLite, the WALDIO. We implement it on the commercially available smartphone. WALDIO mode achieves 5. 1 × performance (insert/sec) against WAL mode which is the fastest journaling mode in SQLite. It yields 2. 7 × performance (inserts/sec) against the LS-MVBT, the fastest SQLite journaling mode known to public. WALDIO mode achieves 7. 4 × performance (insert/sec) against WAL mode when it is relieved from the overhead of explicitly synchronizing individual log-commit operations. WALDIO mode reduces the IO volume to 1 / 6 compared against the WAL mode. We {{would like to thank}} the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and feedback.
