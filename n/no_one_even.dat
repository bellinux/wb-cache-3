The film By Mrityunjay Devvrat {{starring}} [...] Farooq Sheikh, Victor Banerjee, Raima Sen, among others {{is meant to}} [...] "send shivers down the viewers' spine.

500|$|When {{the first}} patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine {{recalled}} that the crowd—most {{of whom were}} homosexual—had grown to at least ten {{times the number of}} people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, [...] "Gay power!", someone began singing [...] "We Shall Overcome", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with [...] "growing and intensive hostility". An officer shoved a transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, [...] "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>even</b> has an attitude, but something's brewing." [...] Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>even</b> {{knew we were}} recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E

Berkeley Wellness Newsletter, {{sponsored}} by the University of California at Berkeley, said that [...] "Mangosteen marketers make farfetched and unsubstantiated claims for their products."

Any reported benefits in humans have been anecdotal. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>even</b> knows if the processed fruit juice and capsules retain the potentially beneficial compounds.

[...] There was no conversation about something 'worse' until eight years later. [...] There was no talk of a constitutional amendment, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>even</b> thought it was possible—and, of course, it turned out it wasn't really possible to happen. [...] So, {{the idea that people}} were swallowing DOMA in order to prevent a constitutional amendment is really just historic revisionism and not true.

The final product {{did not include}} Jay-Z. In mid-November 2009, Brothers revealed on Twitter that Canadian recording artist Drake will be featured on the album. Drake described the studio session with Keys as [...] "one of the best studio experiences of my life". He explained that [...] "I came in there and instead of being like, 'Here's the beat, get to work,' she was just like, 'Play me your favorite songs and lets battle'... It's almost like the transition from [...] great music to making a song — like, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>even</b> noticed it, because she started playing the keys and I just started writing the melodies." [...] Keys stated that due to the album being pushed back, {{she was able to}} record [...] "How It Feels to Fly", as well as to work with recording artists Drake and Beyoncé, which Keys described as [...] "the most exciting collaborations of my career yet".|$|E
2500|$|Blessed Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering {{said that}} in her mystical {{experiences}} Jesus Christ inspired her to build a shrine dedicated to his Sacred Heart. The imposing Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (also referred as Church of the Good Shepherd or Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) was built between 14 July 1957 and 21 April 1966, in the civil parish of Ermesinde in north Portugal, and consecrated to the Heart of Christ in fulfillment of the vow made by the nun. According to the writings of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus had made this promise: [...] "I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house , those who live here now, those who will live here after, and even to their relatives." [...] Jesus also promised her: [...] "Know this, My daughter, that by the charity of My Heart I desire to pour out floods of graces through your heart over the hearts of others. This is why people will come to you with confidence; {{it will not be}} your personal qualities which will attract them, but Me. <b>No</b> <b>one,</b> <b>even</b> the most hardened sinner, will leave your presence without having received, in one way or another, consolation, relief, or a special grace." ...|$|E
