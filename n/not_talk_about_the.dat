5|$|Madame Schmidt did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter {{even after}} the war. She died in 1954 {{at the age of}} 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was estimated by the Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000. Virtually all of the recordings have since been lost or destroyed due to their post-war unimportance. According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E

In the late 1980s, there was speculation he would be allowed to return to Vietnam to live out his last years, but this did not happen. In the last few years of his life, he lived in Pasadena, California, with his daughter, Mai Duong. He later needed a wheelchair for mobility. In exile, Minh kept his silence, did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> events in Vietnam, and did not produce a memoir.|$|E

25|$|During a 2015 {{visit to}} King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Gabriel {{launched}} an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer Raif Badawi and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice {{in a region}} in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past. He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi's case before his trip. His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and Islamic State militants, particularly given Germany’s status as Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports. While the U.S. State Department had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.|$|E
25|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} that Paulo Portas personally embezzled any funds from the submarines' purchase, and, since Portugal's 10-year statute of limitations for white collar crimes expired in 2014, he (or anyone else) can no longer be prosecuted even if incriminating evidence were to emerge some day. Still, the suspicions against Paulo Portas are unlikely to ever go away given the established facts that (i) he was the Minister in-charge at the time, which makes him the main figure in a controversial deal that, even if not tainted by his corruption, was disastrous for Portugal's finances; (ii) in contrast with his usual incisiveness on all other affairs of state, Paulo Portas has consistently been evasive about his role and any details of the submarines purchase; (iii) his CDS-PP party was shown to have been in close contact with one of the submarines' intermediaries (ESCOM) and to have received sizeable donations from fabricated sources shortly after (see Portucale case above); and (iv) Portas himself is on record saying he could <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> submarines deal on a cell phone for fear of being wiretapped, which suggests he might have had something to hide.|$|E

[...] Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama wrote, [...] "the {{narrative}} is inevitably filled with lots of glam-n-glitz moments. The fashion shows, the stunning models, the superb styling, the vibrant colours and the behind the scenes drama is worth every penny spent on the ticket." [...] A reviewer from Sify.com found the film's depiction of fashion industry [...] "superficial"; noting that the film does <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> clothing, the creativity, or the passion for work in the fashion industry. However, according to Bhandarkar the film was [...] "not about [...] fashion industry as such. It only has fashion as a backdrop. The film is more about the story of models, designers and people. And it is on aspects like the personal story, the individual story, their ups and downs, their journey that I tried to capture." [...] Critics also {{said that the}} film explores drug abuse, homosexuality and gay relationships. Designer Vineet Bahl complained about the male characters, most of whom are portrayed as [...] "gay designers and exploitative agency owners". He said, [...] "Bhandarkar could have done without gross generalisations. It makes the movie shallow and over-dramatic".|$|E

He was sentenced to 60 days at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Concord holding facility, which he served during the school summer break so it would not disrupt his schooling. O'Neal later described the experience as [...] "his worst nightmare". The act, which occurred when O'Neal was 16, would have been legal in most states, but Massachusetts lacks a close-in-age exception, and has an age of consent law of 16.

6000|$|As usually {{happens in}} the author's works, there is even more about Julius Cæsar in the preface than {{there is in the}} play. But in the preface I think the {{portrait}} is less imaginative and more fanciful. He attempts to connect his somewhat chilly type of superman with the heroes of the old fairy tales. But Shaw should <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fairy tales; for he does not feel them from the inside. As I have said, on all this side of historic and domestic traditions Bernard Shaw is weak and deficient. He does not approach them as fairy tales, as if he were four, but as [...] "folk-lore" [...] as if he were forty. And he makes a big mistake about them which he would never have made if he had kept his birthday and hung up his stocking, and generally kept alive inside him the firelight of a home. The point is so peculiarly characteristic of Bernard Shaw, and is indeed so much of a summary of his most interesting assertion and his most interesting error, that it deserves a word by itself, though it is a word which must be remembered in connection with nearly all the other plays.|$|E

Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.

6000|$|Of {{all those}} who had been amazed when Jethro Bass {{suddenly}} emerged from his retirement and appeared in the capital some months before, none were more thunderstruck than certain gentlemen who had been to Coniston repeatedly, but in vain, to urge him to make this very fight. The most important of these had been Mr. Balch, president of the [...] "Down East" [...] Road, and the representatives of two railroads of another state. They had at last offered Jethro fabulous sums to take charge of their armies in the field--sums, at least, that would seem fabulous to many people, and had seemed so to them. When they heard that the lion had roused and shaken himself and had unaccountably come forth of his own accord, they hastened to the state capital to renew their offers. Another shock, but of a different kind, was in store for them. Mr. Balch had not actually driven the pack-mules, laden with treasure, {{to the door of the}} Pelican House, where Jethro might see them from his window; but he requested a private audience, and it was probably accidental that the end of his personal check-book protruded a little from his pocket. He was a big, coarse-grained man, Mr. Balch, who had once been a brakeman, and had risen by what is known as horse sense to the presidency of his road. There was a wonderful sunset beyond the Capitol, but Mr. Balch did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sunset, although Jethro was watching it from behind the curtains.|$|E
