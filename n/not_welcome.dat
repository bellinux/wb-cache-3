5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 {{forced the}} zoo to close {{to protect the}} animals from {{possible}} infection. Since the zoo could <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> any visitors, it faced significant financial losses. Questions were posed about the zoo's future, though {{in the end the}} park was able to reopen after only five weeks. Further help {{came in the form of}} a £1.9 million donation from an anonymous former resident of the city in early April, just as the zoo reopened.|$|E
5|$|Black has {{the blood}} tested, and finds it {{free of any}} pathogen; meanwhile, the {{government}} center running the earlier briefing has vanished. Black realizes he was tricked into finding Zero for an ulterior motive, eventually learning that the organisation responsible is carrying out medical experiments on the homeless, and may be tied to the Millennium Group. Elsewhere a homeless man, acting similarly to Zero, attacks two policemen, and is killed in response. Black and fellow Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) investigate, but are clearly <b>not</b> <b>welcome.</b> Black manages to obtain a blood sample from the dead man, and finds a stretcher tag which he believes {{is connected to the}} United States Department of Energy.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E
5|$|Holst's {{works were}} played {{frequently}} {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of The Planets in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> this fame, and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a significant influence on a number of younger English composers, including Edmund Rubbra, Michael Tippett and Benjamin Britten. Apart from The Planets and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, McEwan's {{acquired}} {{the trade and}} goodwill of Alexander Melvin & Co of central Edinburgh. By 1914, McEwan's bottled beers were distributed across the United Kingdom. In December 1930, McEwan's merged with Edinburgh rival William Younger's Brewery to form Scottish Brewers in a defensive move after the Great Depression diminished revenues. Each entity was initially run separately, and only certain financial and technological resources were amalgamated. During this period the company became an early pioneer of container beer, largely due to its dependence on exports, particularly to the Royal Navy, where beer might be stored on board ships {{for up to a}} year. The NAAFI continued to be an important McEwan's customer throughout the century. In the early 1930s, Jardine Matheson approached the company regarding a potential brewing venture in China, but McEwan's did <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> the threat to their export business.|$|E

25|$|The álfablót or Elven blót {{was small}} scale and was celebrated at the {{homestead}} {{and led by}} its mistress. Not much is known about these rites, since they were surrounded by secrecy and strangers were <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> {{during the time of}} the rituals. However, since the elves were collective powers closely connected with the ancestors some assume that it had to do with the ancestor cult and the life force of the family.|$|E

25|$|The Talmudic {{tradition}} as written between c. 370 and 500 also interprets {{the sin of}} Sodom as lack of charity, with the attempted rape of the angels being {{a manifestation of the}} city's violation of the social order of hospitality; as does Jesus in the New Testament, for instance in Matthew 10:14–15 when he tells his disciples that the punishment for houses or towns that will <b>not</b> <b>welcome</b> them will be worse than that of Sodom and Gomorrah.|$|E
