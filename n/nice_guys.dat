However, Malick left the project to direct The New World and Gosling later dropped out with scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> and I hope that comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it and then it just kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E
500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{called it}} [...] "metaphorically ambivalent". Barbara Jaeger of The Bergen Record called Clayton's bassline [...] "ominous". Stokes {{described}} it as [...] "the antithesis of [...] bright, ringing, optimistic, inspirational selves, it was dirty, loud, discordant, repetitive, noisy, black. If the intention was to invoke a sense of evil abroad, then it was effective". Graham said [...] "'Exit' should have exploded the myth of U2 as the <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> of rock. Never had they shown such a vicious streak or produced such a withering track.... Far more than even 'Bullet the Blue Sky', [...] playing is scratching at the prison bars of polished good taste", describing it as the wild card of the album. Author John Luerssen contrasted it {{to the rest of}} the band's catalogue, saying [...] "Unlike most of the songs U2 had written up to this point, 'Exit' lacked any optimism." [...] Hot Press contributor Colm O'Hare felt the claims by Bardo evoked memories of Charles Manson's use of [...] "Helter Skelter", and contained [...] "even more sinister shades" [...] of the death of John Lennon. In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond argued it was [...] "awkward enough to remind you that not even Patti Smith could regularly pull off this sort of thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Affinity {{played their}} last gig in 1970 Foster decided {{that rather than}} being an over-educated but {{unemployed}} musician he needed to join another band. He placed a classified ad in Melody Maker magazine stating [...] "Bass Guitarist: ex-name group, wishes to join established Family/Colosseum/Traffic type group". He expected no response, but a music producer called Christos Demetriou (i.e. Chris Demetriou) unexpectedly called and offered him a job with ex-Manfred Mann singer Mike d'Abo's band. After touring with the band both in the US and in the UK, Foster's name started to get around. In 1971 he was hired to do a studio session for a Russ Ballard song, [...] "Can't Let You Go" [...] at Lansdowne Studios. [...] "I knew nothing about sessions and turned up with a flask and sandwiches because I didn't know how long I'd be there for. There was Clem Cattini on drums, Ray Cooper on percussion, Mike Moran on keyboards, Ray Fenwick on guitar, all fine players and <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> who must have thought my naiveté was amusing! That {{was the beginning of}} a word of mouth situation which gradually mushroomed." [...] The European disco scene was growing and session work was increasing and Mo was hired to play on a lot of the popular hits of the time including Jimmy Helms' [...] "Gonna Make You An Offer You Can't Refuse", Cerrone's hit [...] "Supernature".|$|E

If I should stand a lengthy spell {{in front of}} that {{first-class}} hotel, that to the drummers loves to cater, across from some big film theayter; if I should look around and buzz, and wonder in what town I was, I swear that I could never tell! For all the crowd would be so swell, in just the same fine sort of jeans they wear at home, and all the queens with spiffy bonnets on their beans, and all the fellows standing round a-talkin' always, I'll be bound, the same good jolly kind of guff, 'bout autos, politics and stuff and baseball players of renown that <b>Nice</b> <b>Guys</b> talk in my home town! ...|$|E

50|$|Glover's {{premise is}} that <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> have been {{conditioned}} by their childhoods and by society {{to believe that they}} will be successful only if they make everyone happy and never cause any problems for others. However, this desire for approval results in self-loathing. In other words, <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> want approval, but don't think they deserve it. This creates internal frustration, since <b>nice</b> <b>guys</b> never try to obtain what they want in life. In addition, the nice guy's desire to obtain approval from everyone (especially women), causes him to actually behave in very un-nice ways. This includes dishonesty (about themselves) and passive-aggressive behavior ("being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through...").|$|E
