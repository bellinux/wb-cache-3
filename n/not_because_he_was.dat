5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> one of the informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{libel case}} against John Murray, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the author, {{but because he}} was the {{publisher}} of a book that libelled Lecesne and Escoffery. The case was {{based on the fact that}} the book recorded that the politicians in Jamaica considered Lecesne and Escoffery guilty of a criminal conspiracy. This case was held in Britain in order that it should not be biased. If they were guilty of a conspiracy, then under the 1818 Alien Act they could be transported for life if they were born elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Garland {{insisted on}} {{being sent to}} Oklahoma City in the {{aftermath}} of that attack to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution. He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols. Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.|$|E
25|$|While Eliot was in Europe, he {{was again}} {{presented}} {{with the opportunity to}} enter the world of active business. The Merrimack Company, one of the largest textile mills in the United States, tendered him an invitation to become its superintendent. In spite of the urgings of his friends and the attractiveness of what for the time was the enormous salary of $5000 (plus a good house, rent free), Eliot, after giving considerable thought to the offer, turned it down. One of his biographers speculated that he surely realized by this time that he had a strong taste for organizing and administration. This post would have given it scope. He must have felt, even if dimly, that if science interested him, it was <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> first and last a lover of her laws and generalizations, not only because the clarity and precision of science was congenial, but because science answered the questions of practical men and conferred knowledge and power upon those who would perform the labors of their generation.|$|E
500|$|Gengler {{argued that}} King Hamad's {{empowerment}} of the Khawalid brothers was <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unaware of their anti-reform ideology and actions, {{nor was it}} due to him being a wolf in sheep's clothing. Instead Gengler wrote that King Hamad probably wanted to counter the influence of his uncle, the strong un-elected PM, Khalifa bin Salman who was an [...] "effective co-ruler" [...] between 1971 and 1999. Gengler concludes that {{the rise of the}} Khawalid brothers [...] "owes therefore to a combination of personal relationships, shared background in the military, and political expediency". Other explanations Gengler offered include that [...] " [...] simply never took an interest in ruling" [...] and instead occupied himself with [...] "recreation and hobbies" [...] or that he had begun the security approach in parallel with reforms as a [...] "precautionary measure" [...] in case they failed.|$|E

500|$|Warelwast {{may have}} been a clerk for King William I of England, as a {{confirmation}} charter from the time of King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154) records that a grant of churches in Exeter was given to Warelwast by [...] "Willelmus, avus meus", or [...] "William, my grandfather/ancestor"; Stephen was a grandson of William I, who reigned 1066–1087. [...] But this charter may be a forgery, or the Willelmus referred to {{may have been}} William II rather than William I. The charter itself is insufficient evidence to confidently assert that Warelwast served William I, even though most such grants were made as a reward for royal service. It may have been that Warelwast was awarded land by William I <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a royal servant but because he was a relative; certainly the late-medieval writer William Worcester claimed that Warelwast was related to the king.|$|E
500|$|Asquez, who {{provided}} an unsworn {{statement to the}} [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] team through an intermediary, which the journalists included in the programme, reluctantly appeared. He retracted the statements he made to [...] "Death on the Rock", which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (another [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] witness, who had sold the programme a video recording of {{the aftermath of the}} shootings). The British media covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused Asquez of lying for the television (and [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of encouraging him) in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. Nonetheless, Pizzarello asked Asquez if he could explain why his original statement mentioned the Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] donning berets, showing identity cards, and telling members of the public [...] "it's okay, it's the police" [...] after shooting Savage (details which were not public before the inquest); Asquez replied that he could <b>not,</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a bit confused".|$|E

On March 5, 1997 he gave a radio interview with The Dog House on KYLD in San Francisco. In the interview he stated that he had hired security since he feared for his safety; this {{was because he was}} a celebrity figure in general, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a rapper. Life After Death was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997. On January 8, 1997, Biggie Smalls and Sean [...] "Puffy" [...] Combs made a video for the song [...] "What's Beef", directed by Dave Meyers. On March 8, 1997, he presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 11th Annual Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles and was booed by some of the audience. After the ceremony, Wallace attended an after party hosted by Vibe magazine and Qwest Records at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Other guests included Faith Evans, Aaliyah, Sean Combs and members of the Bloods and Crips gangs.|$|E

500|$|William's actions at the Siege of Antioch {{are known}} from the Gesta Francorum, an {{anonymous}} chronicle written by an Italo-Norman eyewitness. The Gesta was very popular in Europe after the crusade, but was considered crudely written by more refined readers. It was later rewritten and expanded by more educated writers, including the French monks Robert and Guibert, {{both of whom were}} eager to add information about French crusaders like William. According to Robert, William [...] "acquired the name of 'Carpenter' because nobody wanted to take him on in battle—-there was no breastplate, helmet or shield which could withstand the shattering impact of his lance or sword." [...] Guibert says that he [...] "was called the Carpenter, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a craftsman in wood, but because he prevailed in battle like a carpenter, by cutting men down", and has Bohemond ask: [...] "what kind of Carpenter did we have, who, like a construction-worker with a pick-axe, hacked away, with lances and swords, at the backs of the Gentiles?" [...] Christopher Tyerman interprets this as William's [...] "skills as a battlefield butcher". Edward Gibbon, apparently misunderstanding Guibert, thought the nickname came [...] "from the weighty strokes of his axe".|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{also believe}} {{there is evidence that}} several members of Shakespeare's family were recusant Catholics. The strongest evidence is a tract professing secret Catholicism signed by John Shakespeare, father of the poet. The tract was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house which had once been John Shakespeare's, and was seen and described by the reputable scholar Edmond Malone. Malone later changed his mind and declared that he thought the tract was a forgery. Although the document has since been lost, Anthony Holden writes that Malone's reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English. Other research, however, suggests that the Borromeo testament is a 17th-century artefact (at the earliest dated from 1638), was not printed for missionary work, and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare. John Shakespeare was listed as one who did not attend church services, but this was [...] "for feare of processe for Debtte", according to the commissioners, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a recusant.|$|E

There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. <b>Not</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E
