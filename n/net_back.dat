500|$|In skilled hands, the net was {{a useful}} weapon. The retiariuss primary {{objective}} with {{it was to}} capture his opponent. A ewer found at Rheinzabern demonstrates the throwing technique: the retiarius held the net folded up {{in his right hand}} and cast it underhanded. He held his trident and dagger in his left hand, careful to keep the trident's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh. If the toss missed, the retiarius used the drawrope tied to his wrist to bring the <b>net</b> <b>back</b> in hand. On a successful cast, the gladiator tightened the drawcord around the net's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival. A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the retiarius straightaway. This was not certain, however, as a mosaic at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid shows: in the first panel, the retiarius Kalendio has caught his opponent, a secutor named Astyanax, in his net. In the later image, however, Kalendio lies on the ground, wounded, and raises his dagger to surrender.

50|$|Net sport may {{refer to}} any of several sports where a net is a {{standard}} part of the game. The term usually applies to sports where the net separates the opponents.

Players score points whenever the opponent fails to return the ball or bird back over the net. The criteria on what is considered a valid return varies between each sport (such as the number of times the ball may be touched or bounced on a player's side before it must go back over the net).|$|E

The final minigame concerns the recycling of discarded phones in Ghana, tasking the player with dividing components from the phone among workers that are salvaging the parts in unsafe ways.

Torres Strait {{seagrass}} provides {{critical habitat}} for commercial and traditional fishery species, {{and an important}} food resource for dugong and green turtle populations. 2.

The sampling methods applied were developed by the TropWATER Seagrass Group and CSIRO for seagrass habitat surveys of subtidal meadows; and TropWATER methods for port surveys and intertidal surveys in areas considered at high risk from shipping accidents in the Torres Strait. These included sampling by boat (free divers, underwater video camera, grabs, sled with <b>net</b> <b>backing),</b> helicopter, and walking. 4.

30|$|From 1985 to 2003, the EROIstnd in China {{has shown}} a declining trend, while after 2003, the EROIstnd started to {{increase}} due the development of NG, which may have a better energy return. Therefore, the government should take measures to increase gas production. We believe that the most significant measure would be to rationalize the domestic NG pricing mechanisms, which would improve the enthusiasm of enterprises to develop NG. Since the 1990 s, the Chinese government has implemented several NG price reforms. The pricing method for NG has evolved from government pricing to a two-track implementation to prices set with government guidance and finally to the current market <b>net</b> <b>back</b> value method (Kong et al. 2015). Although the pricing mechanisms have gradually improved, market-oriented pricing is still not used for China’s NG.|$|E
30|$|Spengler and Costa (2008) {{mentioned}} {{that due to}} mesh size {{and the opening of}} the cod-end, marine litter may be lost during the return of the <b>net,</b> <b>back</b> to the vessel and therefore the litter density can be underestimated. Moreover, the litter spatial distribution within the fishing grounds can be heavily modified by bottom trawling and a large amount of litter can be removed from the seafloor due to intense trawling. The use of ROVs in selected locations, where commercial trawlers were used for the assessment of benthic marine litter should be highly promoted in order to clarify that reflection. Nonetheless, ROVs cannot be applied for big transects, thus the careful plan of the experimental design is considered of major importance, in which randomness is an essential feature.|$|E

40|$|The stress, mass, and energy-dissipation {{budgets of}} Crary Ice Rise are {{analyzed}} using field data {{collected during the}} 1983 - 1985 austral summers and in previous field programs. In addition, the <b>net</b> <b>back</b> pressure and ice-discharge rate along the grounding lines of ice streams are calculated to assess {{the effect of the}} ice rise on the surrounding flow. Comparison of the ice-rise budgets with the analysis of grounding-line data confirms the influence of the ice rise on ice-sheet stability, and suggests that Crary Ice Rise may have formed recently in response to an acceleration of one of the ice streams. It is concluded that feedback between ice-stream acceleration and ice-rise formation may control the future evolution of the above ice stream and promote long-term grounding-line stability in the face of strong natural fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a system of}} interaction nets, a graphical paradigm of computation based on net rewriting, for linear logic. The two main features of the encoding are that the system of interaction is a finite one (meaning {{that there are a}} finite number of agents and interaction rules), and most importantly, for the multiplicative exponential fragment we obtain {{for the first time a}} strong result that nets in normal form correspond to cut-free proofs – thus we can trivially convert a <b>net</b> <b>back</b> into a proof without a complicated read-back algorithm. For the additives, we perform weak cut-elimination (without the additive commutative cut-elimination step), which is the most natural strategy for these connectives since it avoids unnecessary duplication of proofs. For proofs containing additives, our result is that nets in normal form correspond to cut-free proofs modulo additive commutative cuts. This implementation of linear logic is the most faithful and the most efficient of all the extant interaction net encodings of linear logic...|$|E
40|$|Grain size {{reduction}} in single phase alloys generally {{goes along with}} a loss of ductility associated to a decrease of the strain hardening capacity. The flow behaviour of fine grained dual phase steels produced by swaging was investigated in order to address the couplings between grain {{size reduction}} and incorporation of a second phase, and to optimize microstructures towards different objectives. A physically based grain size dependent strain hardening model has been developed for the ferrite, involving specific laws for the accumulation and saturation of dislocations along grain boundaries and for their <b>net</b> <b>back</b> stress contribution. The back stress increases with the dislocation density, reaches a maximum and finally decreases due to the screening of opposite dislocations located {{on the other side of}} the boundary. The overall behaviour of the ferrite – martensite composite is then calculated using a mean field homogenization method. A parametric study provides, for a given carbon content and grain size of the ferrite matrix, the optimum martensite volume fraction leading either to the maximum strength ductility product or to the maximum strength under the constraint of sufficient ductility for forming...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether the supply of grass silage or grass silage mixed with barley or CCM to organically raised gestating sows would allow a reduction of compound feed allowance without loss in animal performance. On average, sows fed grass silage or mixed silage were able to compensate for a pre-set reduction of 1 kg or 1. 5 kg compound feed, respectively. However, the variation in silage intake between individual sows was large, with a number of mainly young sows consuming less silage than the required amount. Consequently, these sows showed a <b>net</b> <b>back</b> fat loss during the experimental period from d 7 of gestation to weaning. Our results indicate that more feeder space than 1 for 8 sows is required to allow adequate silage intake in group housed sows. From this study we cannot derive whether that would be also allow young sows to realise an adequate silage intake. In conclusion, it seems possible to replace 1 kg compound feed by free access to grass silage and 1. 5 kg compound by mixed barley or CCM silage, provided that variation between sows is reduced and young sows would also be able to ingest an adequate amount of silage...|$|E
