40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThis paper {{describes}} {{a kind of}} Microwave Digital Frequency Synthesizer used for S-band telemetry receivers. As well known many modern electronic systems employ a Frequency Synthesizer whose spectral purity is critical. The characteristics of a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) Frequency Synthesizer, such as frequency resolution, phase <b>noise,</b> spurious <b>suppression</b> and switch time, should be compromised in our design. A heterodyne Frequency Synthesis is often considered as a good approach to solve the problem. But it is complicated in structure and circuit. A variable-reference-driven PLL Frequency Synthesizer was introduced which can give an improved trade-off among frequency resolution, phase <b>noise,</b> spurious <b>suppression.</b> In this paper the phase <b>noise</b> and spurious <b>suppression</b> characteristic of variable-reference-driven PLL Frequency Synthesizer is analyzed theoretically and {{compared with that of}} the heterodyne Frequency Synthesizer. For engineering application, a practical Microwave Digital Frequency Synthesizer used for telemetry receiver has been designed, which is characterized by simply structure, low phase noise and low spurious output. The output spectrum of experimental measurements is given...|$|R

Through experiments, {{it is found that}} the proposed equalizer does work well for improving hearing capability by 2 to 55 % of voice Recognition success ratio. According to the investigation of the frequency component analysis and formant detections, most of the voice sounds have the formant frequencies for the first to third frequencies within the range of 3445 Hz. Therefore, a nonlinear equalizing multiplier is better to enhance the frequency components for the first to third formants in particular.

40|$|Semiconductor lasers tend {{to suffer}} from the optical {{feedback}} (OFB) noise caused by {{the reflection of the}} output light at the surface of the optical disc or the optical fiber. Superposition of high frequency (HF) current is used as a technique to suppress the OFB noise.

This paper shows numerical simulations on the phenomena of the OFB <b>noise,</b> its <b>suppression</b> by the superposition of HF current and conditions at which the HF current is unable to suppress the noise.
