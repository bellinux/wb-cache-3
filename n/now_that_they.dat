5|$|The Treaty of Stettin made Denmark {{the supreme}} and {{dominating}} power in Northern Europe, yet failed {{to restore the}} Kalmar Union. Unfavourable conditions for Sweden led {{to a series of}} conflicts that only ended with the Great Northern War in 1720. Sweden agreed to turn over her possessions in Livonia in return for a payment by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II. Maximilian failed to pay the promised compensation, however, and thereby lost his influence on Baltic affairs. The terms of the treaty regarding Livonia were ignored, and thus the Livonian War continued. From Ivan's point of view, the treaty enabled the powers involved to form an alliance against him, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were no longer fighting each other.|$|E

5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were pushing largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{also another}} {{way in which}} the {{citizens}} will benefit. As a country becomes richer, it is able to build more schools and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the October Revolution. A better educated public leads to a more efficient workforce, and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in industry and manufacturing. These countries will also experience much less severe famine <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are able to trade successfully on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{companies}} also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. Between 30,000 and 40,000 unskilled African-American and Mexican American workers {{were brought to}} work in the mills. Company officials played on the racism of many white steelworkers by pointing out how well-fed and happy the black workers seemed <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had 'white' jobs. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km). Yalta is crowded in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation are very high. Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to the Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the various}} {{resulting}} 1984 spinoffs, only BellSouth actively used and promoted the Bell name and logo during its entire history, from the 1984 break-up to its merger {{with the new}} AT in 2006. Similarly, cessation of using either the Bell name or logo occurred {{for many of the}} other companies more than a decade after the 1984 break-up as part of an acquisition-related rebranding. The others have only used the marks on rare occasions to maintain their trademark rights, even less <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have adopted names conceived long after divestiture. Examples include Verizon, which still used the Bell logo on its trucks and payphones until it updated its own logo in 2015, and Qwest, formerly US West, which licenses the Northwestern Bell and Mountain Bell names to Unical Enterprises, who makes telephones under the Northwestern Bell name.|$|E
25|$|The union, {{faced with}} a {{challenge}} to its very existence, threatened to strike if the Mayor went through with this plan. With {{the support of the}} national CIO, the union was able to maintain its collective bargaining agreements and the right to represent the IRT and BMT employees after the City took over those systems in 1940. The union soon found itself struggling with the special problems of creating a civil service system for thousands of employees, while providing representation for thousands of workers who faced problems with meeting the City's new naturalization and medical requirements. But the union lost ground among its members, both in terms of actual numbers after it lost the closed shop and in terms of actual support, since many workers who may have remained members saw the union as less important <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had the seeming job security that civil service status promised and the union had lost the right to strike.|$|E
25|$|Even with Bulldozer released, Big Black drew {{very small}} crowds {{in their native}} Chicago. They began venturing outside of Illinois to play shows in Madison, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Muncie, {{transporting}} themselves and their equipment in a cramped car and sleeping on people's floors. Albini handled much of the band's logistics himself, setting up rehearsals, booking studio time, and arranging tours. With their reputation growing through small tours, {{he was able to}} set up a run of East Coast dates including performances in Washington, D.C. and Boston and at New York City's Danceteria, followed by a European tour on which they won acclaim in the United Kingdom's music press. Big Black simultaneously found themselves gaining popularity in their hometown, but felt embittered that the same locals who had snubbed them just months before were suddenly interested <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had built a reputation outside the city, and the band actually refused to play in Chicago for some time.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the cause}} of all this may {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from the first moment he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E
