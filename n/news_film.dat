25|$|In September 1938 HRH the Duchess of Kent {{accepted}} RML's {{invitation to}} launch Andes. However, there was unrest in Northern Ireland against high unemployment, and B Special police were on nightly patrols. In February 1939, {{on the advice}} of the Duke of Abercorn, then Governor of Northern Ireland, HRH the Duke of Kent and his wife postponed their visit to the province. Instead Viscountess Craigavon, wife of Northern Ireland's Prime Minister Lord Craigavon, agreed to sponsor the ship. She launched Andes on 7 March 1939, in high wind and heavy rain. A short, silent Pathé <b>News</b> <b>film</b> shows the event. After the launch, Lord Essendon complained that British re-armament had both increased shipbuilding costs and depressed the merchant shipping trade.|$|E

25|$|CTC was {{a pioneer}} of colour television, {{commissioning}} the first purpose-built colour production studio and film laboratory in Australia. The new facility in Watson, North Canberra opened in October 1974 costing over A$2,000,000 and boasted sales and administration, a full size production studio supplemented by two smaller studios for commercial recordings and on-air presentation. As the facility was fully equipped only with colour equipment over 80% of the broadcasts were in colour, five months before the official commencement date of 1 March 1975. Technically in breach of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board rules, CTC was the first television station in Australia to broadcast {{the majority of its}} output in colour. A rare piece of CTC colour <b>news</b> <b>film</b> from 21 October 1974 can be seen at the National Film and Sound Archive.|$|E

In February 1970, WBAP-TV debuted the first locally produced television newsmagazine, Texas '70s, a monthly half-hour program showcasing feature reports focusing on the culture of Texas.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, she {{appeared}} in Woman on Top in the lead female role as Isabelle, a world-class chef who has suffered from motion sickness since birth, her first American lead role. Lisa Nesselson of Variety magazine praised the performances of both Cruz and her co-star, Harold Perrineau, saying they [...] "burst off the screen", and added that Cruz has a charming accent. BBC <b>News</b> <b>film</b> critic Jane Crowther said that [...] "Cruz is wonderfully ditzy as the innocent abroad" [...] but remarked that [...] "it's Harold Perrineau Jr as Monica who pockets the movie". Annlee Ellingson of Box Office magazine wrote [...] "Cruz is stunning in the role—innocent and vulnerable yet possessing a mature grace and determined strength, all while sizzling with unchecked sensuality." [...] Also in 2000, she played Alejandra Villarreal, who is Matt Damon's love interest in Billy Bob Thornton's film adaptation of the western bestselling novel, All the Pretty Horses. Susan Stark of the Detroit News commented that in the film Thornton was able to guide Damon, Henry Thomas and Cruz to [...] "their most impressive performances in a major movie yet". However, Bob Longigo of The Atlanta Journal Constitution was less enthusiastic about Cruz and Damon's performance, saying that their [...] "resulting onscreen chemistry would hardly warm a can of beans".|$|E

500|$|Several {{photographs}} were {{taken of the}} lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank's nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank, they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license. In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing {{in front of the}} body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The Columbia State, which opposed the lynching, wrote: [...] "The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers." [...] Wood also writes that a <b>news</b> <b>film</b> of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank's body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood says {{there is no evidence that}} it was stopped in Atlanta.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of various cast members was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques. Michael Sheen's portrayal of Castor was particularly acclaimed by commentators, who—because of his flamboyance—drew parallels to the English singer-songwriter David Bowie, as well as fictional characters such as A Clockwork Orange lead character Alex. Dargis, Debruge, Puig, and Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer were among the journalists to praise his acting: Dargis ascribed Sheen's exceptional performance to a seemingly [...] "uninteresting" [...] cast. To Philadelphia Daily <b>News</b> <b>film</b> critic Gary Thompson, the film became humorous with the scenes involving Castor. Star Tribune critic Colin Covert believed that Sheen's campy antics were the [...] "too brief" [...] highlights of Tron: Legacy. With other cast members—particularly Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, and Jeff Bridges—commentary reflected diverse attitudes. The film received [...] "a little boost from" [...] Wilde, according to Rickey. The Boston Globe Wesley Morris called Hedlund a [...] "dud stud"; [...] "None of what he sees impresses," [...] he elaborated. [...] "The feeling is mutual. At an alleged cost of $200 million, that’s some yawn. If he can’t be thrilled, why should we?" [...] To Salon commentator Andrew O'Hehir, even Bridges—an individual he regarded as [...] "one of America's most beloved and distinctive" [...] actors—was [...] "weird and complicated" [...] rather than being the [...] "sentimental and alluring" [...] portrayer in the original Tron.|$|E
500|$|Crystal Bell of MTV {{wrote that}} the ballad [...] "gives Ariel a purpose, reveals her deepest desire — to be where the people are — and shows us {{a glimpse of her}} strengths, vulnerabilities, and {{individual}} quirks", while establishing Ariel as an outsider. Writing for The Atlantic, Akash Nikolas agreed that as the film's [...] "I Want" [...] song, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] follows Disney's trend of establishing the main character as an outcast [...] "set apart from society by some innate desire" [...] as Ariel literally longs to be belong to a different world. Film critic Theresa Basile identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a song that belongs to an adventurer who wants to explore new environments. Zaron Burnett III, writing for Thought Catalog, described the selection as a ballad in which [...] "a curious young woman ... who doesn’t fully understand the world she longs to be a part of, bravely dreams of how she can move into a new world, and reject the limitations of her father’s world (read: patriarchy)", identifying Ariel as [...] "a young feminist." [...] Meanwhile, the New York Daily <b>News</b> <b>film</b> critic Kathleen Carroll identified [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as a [...] "typically plaintive solo" [...] that helps establish Ariel as a Broadway ingenue. Distinguished from earlier [...] "wish songs" [...] that discuss searching for [...] "happiness in everyday life", [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is about longing to abandon normalcy in favor of seeking happiness elsewhere. Comparing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] from Cinderella, Entertainment Weekly writer Esther Zuckerman observed that the song proves how different Ariel is from Disney princesses by whom she was preceded. While Cinderella's [...] "A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] is a passive song performed in third person, Ariel's number [...] "is brimming with agency" [...] to demonstrate the character's thirst for knowledge. Zuckerman credits Ashman's lyrics with providing Ariel with a personality, something she believes Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora from Sleeping Beauty (1959) lacked, while giving Ariel a motive that is not romance-oriented. Additionally, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is delivered directly to the camera as opposed to an audience of woodland animals; Ariel appears as though she is speaking directly to young girls who are watching the scene.|$|E

Todd McCarthy, in his review for Variety, wrote, [...] "The deep-focus widescreen compositions possess an unusual clarity that adds details and endows the action and humor with exceptional vividness". [...] In his review for Time, Richard Schickel praised Rushmore as [...] "an often deft, frequently droll little movie turns into an increasingly desperate juggling act, first trying to keep too many dark and weighty emotional objects aloft, then trying to bring them back to hand in a graceful and satisfying way".|$|E
