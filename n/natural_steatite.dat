40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the setting time and {{pozzolanic}} activity of cement when ultra fine <b>natural</b> <b>steatite</b> powder (UFNSP) is used as replacement for cement. Initial setting time, final setting time, and mortar cube strength were studied, due to the replacement of ultra fine <b>natural</b> <b>steatite</b> powder with cement at 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % by mass of cement. The setting time of fresh cement-binder paste and compressive strength of mortar cubes are observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were applied to investigate the microstructural behaviour and chemical element distribution inside cement-binder matrix. Results indicate that the length of dormant period is shortened. The replacement of ultra fine <b>natural</b> <b>steatite</b> powder with cement reduces initial setting time, and final setting time and increases mortar cube compressive strength...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made on flow properties and compressive strength of self-compacting concrete (SCC) with ultrafine <b>natural</b> <b>steatite</b> powder (UFNSP) as replacement to cement. The tests were conducted on specimens with 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % of replacement of UFNSP to the weight of cement and compared to the control specimens. The flow properties of all specimens were tested and checked for their limit with the existing guidelines. The compressive strength test was done on all specimens for strength of 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, and 56 days. The hardened samples were tested for their microstructural behavior and the elements Mg, Ca, and Si were mapped. Through mapping, the formations of M-S-H along with C-S-H are observed. The {{results show that the}} addition of UFNSP influences the flow property, by reducing the flow, and increases the compressive strength till 20 % replacement. Further the addition of UFNSP increases the denseness of microstructure of the specimens thus resulting in the strength increment...|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} focuses on self-assembled composites. Self-assembled composites composed of vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanofibers (VA-MWCNF) combined with a graphitic layer (GL) arranged perpendicular to MWCNF axes‘ have been produced at low temperature (445 °C) using low pressure thermal chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze composite morphology, structure and quality. It is found that different composite morphologies and modification of the GL structure can be obtained by varying the nickel (Ni) catalyst underlayer materials, the catalyst pre-treatment method, the gas recipe, the gas flow rates and the pressure conditions of the LPCVD process. Pre-treatment of the catalyst with H 2 plasma or NH₃ gas was also investigated. It is found that even a short, one minute H 2 plasma pre-treatment of the catalyst results in a significant break-down of the VA-MWCNF/GL composite structure. On the other hand, a one or ten minute catalyst pre-treatment with NH₃ gas results in a structural modification of the GL but retains the VA-MWCNF/GL composite structure. An increase in time of NH₃ gas pre-treatment leads to reduced VA-MWCNF/GL composite height. A growth mechanism for VA-MWCNF/GL composites was proposed. The focus, of the second part of this dissertation, is on the analysis of natural chalks used in traditional old master drawings. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were performed on bulk samples of <b>natural</b> black chalk, <b>steatite</b> and calcite <b>natural</b> white chalks and on samples of these chalks applied to paper using various techniques. Critical information was obtained about the morphology and sub-micron features of the chalk particles, the chalk/paper interaction of each application technique and elemental composition of the bulk chalk samples. It was found that the particle size and morphology of the natural white chalks reduced their ability to hold to the paper. This information provides insight as to why black chalk is more resistant to abrasion than the natural white chalks which is important for the conservation of extant chalk drawings...|$|R
