5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. <b>Nonconsumable</b> <b>electrode</b> processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” Gas Tungsten Arc welding (GTAW) or Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) is an {{electric}} arc welding process, which produces an arc between a <b>nonconsumable</b> tungsten <b>electrode</b> and the work to be welded. TIG is used very commonly in areas, such as rail car manufacturing, automotive and chemical industries. Stainless steel is extensively used in industries as an important material, because of its excellent corrosion resistance. TIG welding {{is one of the}} welding processes, often used to weld similar and dissimilar stainless steel joints. In this paper, an attempt is made to review and consolidate the important research works done on GTAW of stainless steel in the past, by various researchers. It has been observed, that most of the works done, is on austenitic stainless steel, which is the most widely used type of stainless steel in the world. Major areas of research have been in characterization of weld, dissimilar metal welding, parameter optimization, process modeling, failure analysis and automation of TIG welding process. This paper is aimed at, to give a brief idea about the research works done in the past, on TIG welding of stainless steel by various researchers, by highlighting the important conclusions and results arrived at and thereby providing the right direction for fresh researchers for future research in this particular area...|$|R
