5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It was painted by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan was painted over a <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms of an {{ingrown nail}} include pain along {{the margins of}} the nail (caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the {{aforementioned}} margins), worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind, even the weight of bedsheets. Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail. By {{the very nature of the}} condition, ingrown nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean. Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling at the base of the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ingrowing side (though it may be both sides).|$|E

500|$|Tucson, Arizona based Big Splash Games {{was formed}} in late 2005 by three {{veterans}} of the videogame industry: Jon Blossom, Stephen Lewis and Michael Wyman. They came together to produce a prototype video game for the casual market. They worked on this {{for a few months}} when they were not working (they still held jobs within the industry to support themselves). This prototype was pitched to a few publishers in order to gain feedback. PlayFirst, though not interested in the prototype, issued the team a request for proposal for an economic simulation game, hoping that Big Splash could produce another proposal. The next morning, Big Splash co-founder Stephen Lewis remembered that he had been told that some people, in particular women, [...] "have an almost religious connection with chocolate". Taking this idea he quickly wrote a proposal and forwarded it to his two partners. After brainstorming the idea the team decided that it satisfied PlayFirst's request for proposal, forwarded a copy of the idea and received word from the publisher that they [...] "had hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head".|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul R. Brown was filmed in Burbank, California between March 9 and March 10, 2007. The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna be sort of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E

She worked with him on such plays as Happy Days (their third project) and Krapp's Last Tape at the Royal Court Theatre. Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: [...] "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head.

50|$|Primates {{generally}} have five digits on each limb (pentadactyly), with keratin <b>nails</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{end of each}} finger and toe. The bottom sides of the hands and feet have sensitive pads <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fingertips. Most have opposable thumbs, a characteristic primate feature, though not limited to this order, (opossums and koalas, for example, also have them). Thumbs allow some species to use tools. In primates, the combination of opposing thumbs, short fingernails (rather than claws) and long, inward-closing fingers is a relict of the ancestral practice of gripping branches, and has, in part, allowed some species to develop brachiation (swinging by the arms from tree limb to tree limb) as a significant means of locomotion. Prosimians have clawlike <b>nails</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second toe of each foot, called toilet-claws, which they use for grooming.|$|R
2500|$|Their skin {{varies in}} colour {{depending}} on the subspecies, with some having light or dark gray skin and others having pinkish or even reddish skin. The strong legs of the common ostrich are unfeathered and show bare skin, with the tarsus (the lowest upright part of the leg) being covered in scales: red in the male, black in the female. The tarsus of the common ostrich is the largest of any living bird, measuring [...] in length. The bird has just two toes on each foot (most birds have four), with the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> larger, inner toe resembling a hoof. The outer toe has no nail. The reduced number of toes is an adaptation that appears to aid in running, useful for getting away from predators. Common ostriches can run at a speed over [...] and can cover [...] in a single stride. The wings reach a span of about 2 metres (6ft 7 in), and the wing chord measurement of [...] is around {{the same size as}} for the largest flying birds.|$|E
2500|$|Robertson is {{credited}} as writer or co-writer {{of the majority}} of The Band's songs and, as a result, has received most of the songwriting royalties generated from the music. This would become a point of contention, especially for Helm. In his 1993 autobiography, , Helm disputed the validity of the songwriting credits as listed on the albums and explained that The Band's songs were developed in collaboration with all members. Danko concurred with Helm: [...] "I think Levon's book hits the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head about where Robbie and Albert Grossman and some of those people went wrong and when The Band stopped being The Band.... I'm truly friends with everybody but, hey—it could happen to Levon, too. When people take themselves too seriously and believe too much in their own bullshit, they usually get in trouble." [...] Robertson denied that Helm had written any of the songs attributed to Robertson, and his daughter Alexandra later remarked {{in a letter to the}} Los Angeles Times that Helm's solo work consists almost entirely of songs written by others.|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'.

6000|$|... "The lath boards," [...] {{continued}} Forester, [...] "are sometimes made narrow, and <b>nailed</b> <b>on</b> at {{a little}} distance from each other, and sometimes they are wide boards, split up, but not taken apart, and then the cracks, which are made in splitting them, are forced open when <b>the</b> boards are <b>nailed</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> way they do it, is this. They put the wide lath board down upon a plank, and make a great many cracks in it with an axe. Then they put it upon the wall, or ceiling, and nail one edge. Then they take a wedge and drive {{into one of the}} cracks, and force it open far enough to let the plastering in. Then they put in some more nails, in such a manner as to keep that crack open. Then they wedge open another crack, and nail again; and so on, until they have <b>nailed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whole board, so as to leave the cracks all open." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{speech and}} its ideas split the Conservative Party and its {{coalition}} ally the Liberal Unionist Party into two wings– the Free-Fooders, who supported free trade, and the Tariff Reformers, who supported Chamberlain's tariff reforms. Law was a dedicated Tariff Reformer, but whereas Chamberlain {{dreamed of a}} new golden age for Britain, Law focused on more mundane and practical goals, such as a reduction in unemployment. L.S. Amery said that to Law, the tariff reform programme was [...] "a question of trade figures and not national and Imperial policy of expansion and consolidation of which trade was merely the economic factor". Keith Laybourn attributes Law's interest in tariff reform {{not only to the}} sound business practice that it represented but also that because of his place of birth [...] "he was attracted by the Imperial tariff preference arrangements advocated by Joseph Chamberlain". Law's constituents in Blackfriars were not overly enthusiastic about tariff reform– Glasgow was a poor area at the time that had benefited from free trade. In Parliament Law worked exceedingly hard at pushing for tariff reform, regularly speaking in the House of Commons and defeating legendary debaters such as Winston Churchill, Charles Dilke and Herbert Henry Asquith, former Home Secretary and later Prime Minister. His speeches at the time were known for their clarity and common sense; Sir Ian Malcolm said that he made [...] "the involved seem intelligible", and L.S. Amery said his arguments were [...] "like the hammering of a skilled riveter, every blow hitting the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head". Despite Law's efforts to forge consensus within the Conservatives, Balfour was unable to hold the two sides of his party together, and resigned as Prime Minister in December 1905, allowing the Liberals to form a government.|$|E
2500|$|Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother's {{brother was}} the {{reformer}} Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') {{was a rare}} man among the aristocracy, [...] "a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached [...] "to country and to its hereditary constitution" [...] he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, [...] "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made [...] "a tolerable state accountant." [...] Walking [...] "in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue" [...] he would 'scold' those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics [...] "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily hit the <b>nail</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head." [...] The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a [...] "strange caricature" [...] of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in [...] "scholastic wisdom" [...] and appeared as [...] "this cloud-walker {{in the realm of}} abstract morals." [...] Yet like his ancestor, he began [...] "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In [...] "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." [...] As [...] "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party." [...] He never missed a senate meeting, and [...] "as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget." [...] Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than [...] "setting his face against every one who deviated" [...] from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this [...] "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" [...] proved the exhaustion of senate politics.|$|E
