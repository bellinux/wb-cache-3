25|$|The current {{literature}} on sex differences produced inconsistent results {{depending on the}} type of testing used. Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many point that there are <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> differences in g (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza & Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel & Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006). The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in intelligence in general (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in general intelligence (g factor). The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while g factor is a latent scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between g and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and g are synonymous (Lynn & Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to g factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since working memory ability correlate highest with g factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an n-back working memory task. The results found <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> differences in intelligence. The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory study have also been replicated in numerous other studies since.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes formal sex {{education}} is taught {{as a full}} course {{as part of the}} curriculum in junior high school or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad biology, health, home economics, or physical education class. Some schools offer <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> education, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT {{sex education}}, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, premarital sex, and sexual ethics).|$|E
25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally between family members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E

25|$|Buruli ulcer {{commonly}} affects {{poor people}} in remote rural areas with limited access to health care. The disease can affect all age groups, although {{children under the age}} of 15 years (range 2–14 years) are predominantly affected. There are <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> differences in the distribution of cases among children. Among adults, some studies have reported higher rates among women than males (Debacker et al. accepted for publication). No racial or socio-economic group is exempt from the disease. Most ulcers occur on the extremities; lesions on the lower extremities are almost twice as common as those on the upper extremities. Ulcers on the head and trunk accounted for less than 8% of cases in one large series.|$|E
25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males. Before puberty, there are nearly <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> differences in fat and muscle distribution; during puberty, boys grow muscle much faster than girls, although both sexes experience rapid muscle development. In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four. This may help explain sex differences in athletic performance.|$|E

In 1983, Benbow concluded that the study showed a large sex difference by age 13 and that it was especially pronounced at {{the high end of the}} distribution. However, Gallagher and Kaufman criticized Benbow's and others' reports, which found that males were over-represented in the highest percentages, on the grounds that they had not ensured representative sampling.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{researchers}} Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad {{conducted a}} large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests {{taken from the}} Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} difference on the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary Mental Abilities reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that g factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not g factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a nationally representative sample of 926 participants in the UK, <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} season, 16-year-old Peyton Sawyer is girlfriend to popular jock/star {{basketball}} player Nathan, but they soon break up when Peyton reasons that their relationship {{is more about}} sexual benefits than love, and that she is tired of his cruelty. In addition, she realizes that she no longer {{wants to be the}} star basketball player's girlfriend. She has a romantic interest in her ex's brooding half brother, Lucas. Through various interactions with Lucas, she finds that he is kind and thoughtful towards her. However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though <b>no</b> <b>sex</b> is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes home from the hospital, he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E
