5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had <b>never</b> <b>visited.</b> The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E

5|$|The parish {{continued}} largely if {{not wholly}} a sinecure for its rector, {{with the work}} actually done by a resident vicar; in Bradwardine's case he was concurrently prebend and the dean of Lincoln, and chaplain and confessor to the King, and probably <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> Llanbadarn Fawr.|$|E
5|$|George III (George William Frederick; 4 June 1738 – 29 January 1820) was King of Great Britain and King of Ireland from 25 October 1760 {{until the}} union of the two {{countries}} on 1 January 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death. He was concurrently Duke and prince-elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg ("Hanover") in the Holy Roman Empire before becoming King of Hanover on 12 October 1814. He was the third British monarch of the House of Hanover, but unlike his two predecessors, he was born in Britain, spoke English as his first language, and <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Most of Final Fantasy IV {{takes place}} on Earth, {{also known as the}} Blue Planet, which {{consists}} of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they believe their kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> in the game.|$|E

5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had <b>never</b> <b>visited,</b> and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was called for}} 17 September 1878. Fearful that Macdonald would be defeated in Kingston, his supporters {{tried to get him}} to run in the safe Conservative riding of Cardwell; having represented his hometown for 35years, he stood there again. In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by Alexander Gunn, but the Conservatives swept to victory. Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for Marquette, Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of Victoria, where the {{election was}} to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria, although he had <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> either Marquette or Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional cultural values, prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas that they had <b>never</b> <b>visited.</b> Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works. Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes {{that some of the}} most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E
50|$|A basic {{requirement}} for traversal is to visit every node. For infinite trees, simple algorithms often fail this. For example, given a binary tree of infinite depth, a depth-first search {{will go down}} one side (by convention the left side) of the tree, <b>never</b> <b>visiting</b> the rest, and indeed if in-order or post-order will <b>never</b> <b>visit</b> any nodes, as it has not reached a leaf (and in fact never will). By contrast, a breadth-first (level-order) traversal will traverse a binary tree of infinite depth without problem, and indeed will traverse any tree with bounded branching factor.|$|R

5|$|Mary was {{the only}} child of Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive to adulthood. Her younger {{half-brother}} Edward VI (son of Henry and Jane Seymour) succeeded their father in 1547 at the age of nine. When Edward became mortally ill in 1553, he attempted to remove Mary from the line of succession because he opposed her Catholicism. On his death, leading politicians tried to proclaim Lady Jane Grey as queen. Mary assembled a force in East Anglia and deposed Jane, who was ultimately beheaded. Mary was—excluding the disputed reigns of Jane and the Empress Matilda—the first queen regnant of England. In 1554, Mary married Philip of Spain, becoming queen consort of Habsburg Spain on his accession in 1556, but she <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> Spain.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{by train}} to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a marine biologist and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover {{that he had}} launched a mysterious new supertanker, the Liparus, nine months previously. As they leave the base, an unknown henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a Lotus Esprit from Q Branch – converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. The pair also encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the Liparus has <b>never</b> <b>visited</b> any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover (as shown {{at the beginning of}} the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.|$|E
