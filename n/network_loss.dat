In April 2010, government decided to support finance of national smart metering roll-out to facilitate power network technical and non technical loss decreasing as well as demand management. Deploying an AMI is an essential early step to grid modernization. AMI {{is not a single}} technology but it is an integration of many technologies such as smart meter, communication network and management system that provides an intelligent connection between consumers and system operators. AMI gives system operator and consumers the information they need to make smart decisions, and also the ability to execute those decisions that they are not currently able to do.IEEO is responsible for implementation and deployment of Smart Metering project (that is called FAHAM) in Iran. The IEEO follows promoting energy efficiency and load management, improve system reliability, and reduce operational costs by implementing smart metering project.|$|E

FAHAM transforms the meter from a simple measuring and counting device, to one element of an integrated system of hardware, software and people {{that can be used}} to better manage the electric service which customers find essential to their lives. FAHAM is not simply a tool to capture customer consumption of energy, but hardware and software architecture capable of capturing real-time consumption, demand, voltage, current and other information.Data can be provided at the customer level and for other enterprise level systems either on a scheduled basis or on demand. FAHAM will communicate this data to a central location, sorting and analyzing it for a variety of purposes such as customer billing, outage response, system loading conditions and demand side management. FAHAM as a two-way communication network, will also send this information to other systems, customers and third parties, as well as send information back through the network and meters to capture additional data, control equipment and update the configuration and software of equipments.|$|E

We assume that the service rate at the second queue is held fixed and that a maximum buffer space is globally available. For this model, we {{address the problem of}} optimally choosing the service rate at the first queue and the buffer space distribution over the two queues in order to minimize the steady-state total <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate. It is shown that a decrease of the service rate at the first queue can reduce the total <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate only if this lower service rate decreases the variability of the process feeding the second queue. Numerical results show that, when optimal values are assigned to the parameters of the model, a significant reduction of the <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate can be achieved, especially when the network load is moderate and when the service time distributions have a small variance. broad-band communication networks using asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) techniques is a potential field of application of these results...|$|E

The public support in photovoltaic (PV) technologies and increasing markets have resulted in extensive applications of grid-connected PV, in particular in the consumer side and electricity distribution grid. In this paper, {{the effects of a}} high level of grid connected PV in the middle voltage distribution network have been analyzed. The emphasis is put on static phenomena, including voltage drop, <b>network</b> <b>losses</b> and grid benefits. A multi-purpose modeling tool is used for PV analysis in Lisbon and Helsinki climates. All network types studied can handle PV without problems with an amount of PV equaling at least up to the load (1 kW(p) /household). The comb-type network showed the best performance. The PV is unable to shave the domestic load peak in the early evening hours but through orientating the PV panels both to east and west, the noon peak from PV can be reduced by 30 %. PV integration reduces <b>network</b> <b>losses</b> positively up to a 1 kW(p) /hh (100 % of annual domestic load) level.
