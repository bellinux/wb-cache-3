40|$|The {{research}} is aiming at finding how packaging characteristics affect the perceived product <b>net</b> <b>weight.</b> Packaging is the interface that connect customers and products, and perceived weight {{is one of}} the defining factors at the point of purchasing. Perceived weight also influences consumption rate of the product, which may bring opportunity to food manufacturers to make their product more appealing to the target customers, it might also help to increase sales revenue, reduce food waste and combat climate change. Three hypotheses were tested, (1) whether people perceive rigid packaging to contain more product than non-rigid packaging; (2) whether people perceive multi-pack packaging to contain more product than single-pack packaging; and (3) whether people with lower overall muscle strength tend to estimate products heavier. Five types of tomato sauce packaging and five types of milk packaging were selected in the study, 39 people participated in the study, in addition, data from 3 participants were dropped due to data loss and equipment failure. The result showed that the <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of multi-pack packaging milk is perceived to be heavier than single-pack packaging milk, however, there is no perceived weight difference in the case of tomato sauce. The result also showed that the <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of rigid packaging tomato sauce is perceived to be heavier than non-rigid packaging tomato sauce, while there is no perceived weight difference in the case of milk. And people with less muscle strength didn’t perceived product weight to be heavier than people with more muscle strength. Mixed effect was also investigated and consisted result was shown, as milk and tomato sauce with non-rigid multi-packs (NM) were perceived to have similar <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> <b>with</b> rigid single-packs (RS), while non-rigid single-packs(NS) were perceived to contain less product than non-rigid multi-packs (NM) and rigid single-packs (NM=RS 3 ̆eNS). The study provides a general direction for researchers and food manufactures to investigate deeper into the question that how packaging characteristics influence people’s weight perception. The application of the studies could potentially be lucrative for food manufacturers, retailers in the meantime reduce food waste...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — <b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> {{is a key}} {{technique}} in timing driven placement (TDP), which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submiron VLSI physical synthesis and timing closure. A popular way to assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> is based on its slack, such that the worst negative slack (WNS) of the entire circuit may be minimized.

This problem is called the two row fixed height planar routing (TFPR) problem [CPL 93]. The complexity of the TFPR problem was unknown up to now. An approximation algorithm for the TFPR problem was presented in [CPL 93]. In this paper we present a O(n 2 * h 2) time algorithm to solve the TFPR problem optimally, where n {{is the number of}} terminals and h is the height of the standard cells. Our algorithm can be used to improve the performance of several over-the-cell channel routers including the ones in [CPL 93] and [HSS 93]. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} deep neural net compression by quantization: given a large, reference net, we want to quantize its real-valued weights using a codebook with K entries so that the training loss of the quantized net is minimal. The codebook can be optimally learned jointly with the net, or fixed, as for binarization or ternarization approaches. Previous work has quantized the weights of the reference net, or incorporated rounding operations in the backpropagation algorithm, but this has no guarantee of converging to a loss-optimal, quantized net. We describe a new approach based on the recently proposed framework of model compression as constrained optimization Carreir 17 a. This results in a simple iterative "learning-compression" algorithm, which alternates a step that learns a <b>net</b> of continuous <b>weights</b> <b>with</b> a step that quantizes (or binarizes/ternarizes) the weights, and is guaranteed to converge to local optimum of the loss for quantized nets. We develop algorithms for an adaptive codebook or a (partially) fixed codebook. The latter includes binarization, ternarization, powers-of-two and other important particular cases. We show experimentally that we can achieve much higher compression rates than previous quantization work (even using just 1 bit per <b>weight)</b> <b>with</b> negligible loss degradation.

More advanced systems use a percussive-stun harvest system that kills the fish instantly and humanely with a blow to the head from a pneumatic piston. They are then bled by cutting the gill arches and immediately immersing them in iced water. Harvesting and killing methods are designed to minimise scale loss, and avoid the fish releasing stress hormones, which negatively affect flesh quality.|$|R
