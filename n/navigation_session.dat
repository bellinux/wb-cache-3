40|$|One of {{the main}} {{activities}} of web users, known as "surfing", is to follow links. Lengthy navigation often leads to disorientation when users lose track of {{the context in which}} they are navigating and are unsure how to proceed in terms of the goal of their original query. Studying navigation patterns of web users is thus important, since it can lead us {{to a better understanding of}} the problems users face when they are surfing. We derive Zipf's rank frequency law (i. e. an inverse power law) from an absorbing Markov chain model of surfers' behaviour assuming that less probable navigation trails are, on average, longer than more probable ones. In our model the probability of a trail is interpreted as the relevance (or "value") of the trail. We apply our model to two scenarios: in the first the probability of a user terminating the <b>navigation</b> <b>session</b> is independent of the number of links he has followed so far, and in the second the probability of a user terminating the <b>navigation</b> <b>session</b> i [...] ...|$|E

A <b>navigation</b> <b>session</b> {{across the}} web {{is a mix}} of forward linear traversals, cyclic paths and backtracks —which {{reflects}} the user’s exploratory navigation in finding relevant information for its particular interest. The user encounters two situations, both are about assessing the relevance of a linked document —before and after traversal —both involving some degree of cognitive overhead. This paper puts forward a concept which using semantic web technologies, tries to minimise not only this overhead, but also the overhead in assessing the necessity of backtracking after traversal. ...|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{that you}} are {{navigating}} in "hyperspace" and you have reached a web page with several outgoing links you could choose to follow. Which link should you choose in such an online scenario? When you are not sure where the information you require resides, you will initiate a <b>navigation</b> <b>session.</b> This involves pruning some of the links and following one of the others, where more pruning {{is likely to happen}} the deeper you navigate. In terms of decision making, the utility of navigation diminishes with distance until finally the utility drops to zero and the session is terminated. Under this model of navigation, we call the number of nodes that are available after pruning, for browsing within a session, the potential gain of the starting web page. Thus the parameters that effect the potential gain are the local branching factor with respect to the starting web page and the discount factor. We first consider the case when the discounting factor is geometric. We show that the distribution of the effective number of links that the user can follow at each navigation step after pruning, i. e. the number of nodes added to the potential gain at that step, is given by the erf function. We derive an approximation to the potential gain of a web page and show that this is numerically a very accurate estimate. We then consider a harmonic discounting factor and show that, in this case, the potential gain at each step is closely related to the probability density function for the Poisson distribution. The potential gain has been applied to web navigation where it helps the user to choose a good starting point for initiating a <b>navigation</b> <b>session.</b> Another application is in social network analysis, where the potential gain could provide a novel measure of centrality.

These expressions capture accurately the meaning of its navigation steps through the class (or property) subsumption and/or associations. Additionally, users can enrich the generated queries with filtering conditions on the attributes of the currently visited class while they can easily specify the resource’s class(es) appearing in the query result.
