2500|$|Charles Bonnet {{syndrome}} {{is the name}} given to visual hallucinations experienced by a partially or severely sight impaired person. The hallucinations can occur {{at any time and}} can distress people of any age, as they may not initially be aware that they are hallucinating, they may fear initially for their own mental health which may delay them sharing with carers what is happening until they start to understand it themselves. The hallucinations can frighten and disconcert as to what is real and what is not and carers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> support sufferers. The hallucinations can sometimes be dispersed by eye movements, or perhaps just reasoned logic such as, [...] "I can see fire but there is no smoke and there is no heat from it" [...] or perhaps [...] "We have an infestation of rats but they have pink ribbons with a bell tied on their necks." [...] Over elapsed months and years the manifestation of the hallucinations may change, becoming more or less frequent with changes in ability to see. The length of time that the sight impaired person can suffer from these hallucinations varies according to the underlying speed of eye deterioration. A differential diagnosis are ophthalmopathic hallucinations.|$|E
