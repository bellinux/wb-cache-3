5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, <b>neurostimulation,</b> or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
25|$|Transcranial {{direct current}} {{stimulation}} (tDCS) {{is a form}} of <b>neurostimulation</b> that uses constant, low direct current delivered via electrodes on the head; it can be contrasted with cranial electrotherapy stimulation which generally uses alternating current the same way.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neurostimulation</b> is {{currently}} being studied {{as a method of}} treatment; an implanted hypoglossal nerve stimulation system received European CE Mark (Conformité Européenne) approval in March 2012. Also being studied are exercises of the muscles around the mouth and throat through activities such as playing the didgeridoo.|$|E
25|$|Case studies aside, modern {{experiments}} {{have demonstrated that}} the relation between brain and mind {{is much more than}} simple correlation. By damaging, or manipulating, specific areas of the brain repeatedly under controlled conditions (e.g. in monkeys) and reliably obtaining the same results in measures of mental state and abilities, neuroscientists have shown that the relation between damage to the brain and mental deterioration is likely causal. This conclusion is further supported by data from the effects of neuro-active chemicals (such as those affecting neurotransmitters) on mental functions, but also from research on <b>neurostimulation</b> (direct electrical stimulation of the brain, including transcranial magnetic stimulation).|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that TMS {{can be used to}} manipulate the perception of authorship of a specific choice. Experiments showed that <b>neurostimulation</b> could affect which hands people move, even though the experience of free will was intact. An early TMS study revealed that activation of one side of the neocortex could be used to bias the selection of one's opposite side hand in a forced-choice decision task. Ammon and Gandevia found {{that it was possible to}} influence which hand people move by stimulating frontal regions that are involved in movement planning using transcranial magnetic stimulation in the left or right hemisphere of the brain.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane review {{suggests}} cannabinoids {{be reserved}} for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who have been evaluated by EEG-video monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and {{are not eligible for}} better established treatments such as surgery and <b>neurostimulation.</b> A second review described four placebo-controlled trials of cannabadiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small {{number of people in the}} trials. The drugs were well tolerated. A third review found that no reliable conclusions about the effect of cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} possible treatment {{option for}} those afflicted with the symptom is <b>neurostimulation.</b> Studies have begun, and in cerebral palsy patients affected with dystonia-choreoathetosis, {{it has been}} demonstrated that <b>neurostimulation</b> has been an effective treatment in lessening symptoms in patients. [...] There {{has not been a}} tremendous amount of experimentation, though, in this as a possible treatment option.|$|E
2500|$|It may be possible, then, {{that our}} intuitions {{about the role}} of our {{conscious}} [...] "intentions" [...] have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in <b>neurostimulation,</b> brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is [...] "intuitive": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues [...] "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion". Philosopher Walter Jackson Freeman III nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes [...] "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly {{trying to keep up with}} what we do." [...] To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.|$|E

50|$|Many failed back {{patients}} are significantly impaired by chronic {{pain in the}} back and legs. Many of these will be treated with some form of electrical stimulation. This can be either a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device placed on the skin over the back or a nerve stimulator implanted into the back with electrical probes which directly touch the spinal cord. Also, some chronic pain patients utilize fentanyl or narcotic patches. These {{patients are}} generally severely impaired and it is unrealistic to conclude that application of <b>neurostimulation</b> will reduce that impairment. For example, it is doubtful that <b>neurostimulation</b> will improve the patient enough to return to competitive employment. <b>Neurostimulation</b> is palliative. TENS units work by blocking neurotransmission as described by the pain theory of Melzack and Wall. Success rates for implanted <b>neurostimulation</b> has been reported to be 25% to 55%. Success is defined as a relative decrease in pain.|$|E

50|$|Most {{people with}} tension {{headaches}} experience increasing intensity with time, and report pain {{originating in the}} back of the head (occipital) moving to the front of the head (supraorbital). <b>Neurostimulation</b> is sometimes used to treat tension headaches that originate from the occipital nerve.|$|E
5000|$|By 2010 Lisanby had led two {{scientific}} societies {{focused on}} <b>neurostimulation</b> and had published 150 papers; {{at that time}} she moved back to Duke. [...] In 2013 {{she was involved in}} some of the early clinical studies of transcranial direct current stimulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurostimulation</b> {{technology}} {{can improve the}} life quality {{of those who are}} severely paralyzed or suffering from profound losses to various sense organs, as well as for permanent reduction of severe, chronic pain which would otherwise require constant (around-the-clock), high-dose opioid therapy (such as neuropathic pain and spinal-cord injury). It serves as the key part of neural prosthetics for hearing aids, artificial vision, artificial limbs, and brain-machine interfaces. In the case of neural stimulation, mostly an electrical stimulation is utilized and charge-balanced biphasic constant current waveforms or capacitively coupled charge injection approaches are adopted. Alternatively, transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial electric stimulation have been proposed as non-invasive methods in which either a magnetic field or transcranially applied electric currents cause <b>neurostimulation.</b>|$|E

50|$|Low field {{magnetic}} stimulation (LFMS) is {{an experimental}} form of non-invasive <b>neurostimulation</b> {{that aims to}} use broadly distributed, low field strength, oscillating magnetic stimulation to manipulate brain function, based on observations of mood changes in some people after they underwent certain kinds of magnetic resonance imaging; {{it is in the}} early stages of development.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} trigonitis is not known, {{and there is}} no solid treatment. Electrocautery is {{sometimes}} used, but is generally unreliable as a treatment, and typically does not have quick results. Several drugs, such as muscle relaxants, antibiotics, antiseptics such as Urised, have varied and unreliable results. Other forms of treatment include urethrotomy, cryosurgery, and <b>neurostimulation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{specific}} cases where treatment of chronic nausea and vomiting proves resistant to drugs, implantable gastric stimulation may be utilized. A medical device is implanted that applies <b>neurostimulation</b> to {{the muscles of}} the lower stomach to reduce the symptoms.

5000|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} using implantable devices {{came into}} modern usage in the 1980s and its techniques and applications {{have continued to}} develop and expand. The therapy employs the body's natural biological response by stimulating nerve cell activity that can influence populations of nerves by releasing transmitters, such as dopamine, or other chemical messengers such as the peptide Substance P, that can modulate the excitability and firing patterns of neural circuits. There may also be more direct electrophysiological effects on neural membranes as the mechanism of action of electrical interaction with neural elements. The end effect is a [...] "normalization" [...] of a neural network function from its perturbed state. Presumed mechanisms of action for <b>neurostimulation</b> include depolarizing blockade, stochastic normalization of neural firing, axonal blockade, reduction of neural firing keratosis, and suppression of neural network oscillations. Although the exact mechanisms of <b>neurostimulation</b> are not known, the empirical effectiveness has led to considerable application clinically.|$|E
