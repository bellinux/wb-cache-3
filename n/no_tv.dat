5|$|Current Electoral College rules {{effectively}} force {{candidates to}} focus disproportionately {{on a small}} percentage of pivotal swing states, while sidelining the rest. A study by FairVote reported that the 2004 candidates devoted three quarters of their peak season campaign resources to just five states, while the other 45 states received very little attention. The report also stated that 18 states received no candidate visits and <b>no</b> <b>TV</b> advertising. This means that swing state issues receive more attention, while issues important to other states are largely ignored.|$|E

25|$|The WWF had {{effectively}} {{doubled the}} size of its roster through its acquisition of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when <b>no</b> <b>TV</b> station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money.
