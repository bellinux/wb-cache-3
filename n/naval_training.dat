5|$|By 1914, Hydra and Psara {{had been}} reduced to {{secondary}} duties: Hydra became a gunnery training ship while Psara was used to train engine-room personnel. During World War I, Greece belatedly entered the war {{on the side of the}} Triple Entente and the Hydra-class ships served as coastal defense. They were already obsolete and were decommissioned immediately after the war, although their hulks survived as <b>naval</b> <b>training</b> facilities and accommodation space for a decade. All three ships were broken up for scrap in 1929.|$|E

5|$|The {{longtime}} {{association of}} San Diego with the U.S. military began in Point Loma. The southern {{portion of the}} Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set {{up a series of}} coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence in San Diego began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma. The Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was commissioned in 1921 and the San Diego <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Center in 1923, both in Point Loma; the <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Center was closed in 1997. During World War II the entire southern portion of the peninsula was closed to civilians and used for military purposes, including a battery of coast artillery. Following the war the area retained multiple Navy commands, including a submarine base and a Naval Electronics Laboratory; they were eventually consolidated into Naval Base Point Loma. Other portions of Fort Rosecrans became Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E

5|$|Musial {{enlisted in}} the United States Navy on January 23, 1945, during World War II. He was {{initially}} assigned to noncombat duty at the <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Station in Bainbridge, Maryland. In June 1945, {{he was assigned to}} Special Services in Hawaii, and was assigned to a ferry launch unit to bring back damaged ship crews entering Pearl Harbor where he was able to play baseball every afternoon in the naval base's eight-team league. After being granted emergency leave to see his ailing father in January 1946, he was briefly assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard before his honorable discharge from the Navy as a Seaman Second Class in March 1946.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November 1901, George {{was created}} Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. King Edward wished to prepare his son for his future role as king. In {{contrast}} to Edward himself, whom Queen Victoria had deliberately excluded from state affairs, George was given wide access to state documents by his father. George in turn allowed his wife {{access to his}} papers, as he valued her counsel and she often helped write her husband's speeches. As Prince of Wales, George supported reforms in <b>naval</b> <b>training,</b> including cadets being enrolled at the ages of twelve and thirteen, and receiving the same education, whatever their class and eventual assignments. The reforms were implemented by the then Second (later First) Sea Lord, Jacky Fisher.|$|E
5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, thanks in part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E

5|$|Hayward did {{his initial}} <b>naval</b> <b>training</b> at the Naval Station Newport at Newport, Rhode Island. He was {{encouraged}} by the Chaplain, Father John J. Brady, to try for admission to United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. Brady arranged for Hayward {{to be sent to}} the Naval Academy Preparatory School in Norfolk, Virginia, to study for the entrance exams. During World War I, some one-hundred presidential appointments to Annapolis had been set aside for enlisted sailors, but few had applied, and fewer still had passed the entrance exams. Of the 119 sailors who sat the exams in 1926, only 19 passed, one of whom was Hayward. He entered Annapolis in August 1926, and was commissioned as an ensign on graduation in June 1930, ranking 51st in his class of 406.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Feller {{left for}} combat, {{his father died}} of brain cancer in early January 1943. Five days later he married Virginia Winther whom he met while in Florida for spring training; she {{was a student at}} Rollins College. After the marriage, Feller {{returned}} to service as Gun Captain aboard the Alabama and kept his pitching arm in shape by throwing near a gun turret. Feller and the Alabama crew spent most of 1943 in the British Isles along with , but in August were reassigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. Feller's first taste of direct combat was at Operation Galvanic in November 1943. The Alabama also served during Operation Flintlock while primarily being used as an escort battleship in 1944. Feller participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea before his combat duty ended in January 1945; he {{spent the rest of the}} war at the Great Lakes <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Station as an instructor.|$|E
5|$|The 1940s, {{including}} World War II and its aftermath, brought {{big changes}} to BGSU. The war caused a drastic decrease in male enrollment and by 1943, the university canceled dances and formals, citing {{the lack of}} male students. The university continued expanding facilities including its first student union, The Falcon’s Nest, and new cottage-style dorms for social groups and learning-living communities, and dedication of the Wood County airport. Bowling Green was one of 240 colleges and universities {{to take part in}} the V-5 and V-12 Navy College Training Programs to supplement the lower enrollment during the war. The programs offered students a path to a Navy commission, enrolling cadets in regular college courses as well as <b>naval</b> <b>training.</b> Faculty were added to accommodate the military training programs. Student life adapted to the wartime era with efforts such as the War Relief Committee, blood drives and War Bonds initiatives.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} {{neighborhoods in the}} Point Loma peninsula. Most neighborhoods in Point Loma consist primarily of single family homes. The commercial and retail heart of the peninsula is called Point Loma Village. Its retail establishments serve local residents as well as yachting and sport fishing interests. The streets in Point Loma Village are lined with hundreds of jacaranda trees {{as a result of}} community beautification efforts. The newest commercial and retail area is found at Liberty Station, site of the former <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Center San Diego, which also has residential and educational sections. The Midway district at the northern end of the peninsula, adjacent to the San Diego River and the I-5 and I-8 freeways, is primarily commercial and industrial with a few small residential developments.|$|E
5|$|Brown was {{classified}} 1-A in 1944 and commissioned as a {{lieutenant in the}} U.S. Navy. He served at the Great Lakes <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Station outside Chicago as head coach of its Bluejacket football team, which competed against other service teams and college programs. The station was a waypoint for Navy recruits between training and active service in World War II, but its commanders took athletics seriously and saw winning as a morale-booster and a point of personal pride. Brown could have been called up for active duty – Tony Hinkle, his predecessor, was already serving in the Pacific – but the war began to wind down as Brown arrived. Brown had little time to institute his system, and instead adopted Hinkle's offensive scheme, borrowed from the Chicago Bears. He had a smattering of talented players, including defensive end George Young and halfback Ara Parseghian. In 1944, the team lost to Ohio State and Notre Dame, but finished with a 9–2–1 record and was among the top 20 teams in the AP Poll.|$|E
5|$|MD222 heads westfarmland, {{crossing}} Happy Valley Branch before {{passing the}} entrance to the former United States <b>Naval</b> <b>Training</b> Center, Bainbridge, which contains the Edward W. Haviland House and the original campus of the Tome School. The highway descends from a high bluff to the Susquehanna River, during which southbound MD 222 has a climbing lane. Upon entering the town limits of Port Deposit, MD222's name changes to Main Street and the highway makes a sharp turn to the north to parallel the river and Norfolk Southern Railway's Port Road Branch. The state highway intersects MD276 (Centre Street) in the center of Port Deposit. MD222 passes the Paw Paw Building and intersects Granite Avenue before crossing Rock Run and passing under a low railroad bridge to {{the west side of the}} tracks. The highway leaves the town of Port Deposit and continues north as Susquehanna River Road, closely paralleling the river and passing through a unit of Susquehanna State Park along the river. Soon after crossing Octoraro Creek, MD222 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with US1 (Conowingo Road) at the eastern end of Conowingo Dam. Following US1 northeast to the community of Conowingo leads to the southern terminus of US222 and the northern terminus of MD222Truck.|$|E
