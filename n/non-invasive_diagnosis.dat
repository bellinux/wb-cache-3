Short-lived positron emitting isotope, such as 18F, is incorporated with an organic substance such as glucose, creating F18-fluorodeoxyglucose, {{which can be}} used as a marker of metabolic utilization.

40|$|Aim: The {{presence}} of circulatory cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has found new applications in <b>non-invasive</b> risk-free prenatal <b>diagnosis.</b> Materials and Methods: We {{made use of}} a size separation approach along with real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{to evaluate the use}} of fetal DNA in the detection of the sex of the fetus. Cell-free fetal DNA was isolated from the plasma of 30 women (10 - 20 weeks gestation) using a size separation approach. We made use of Taq Man Chemistry and real time PCR using primers and probes for GAPDH and SRY. Results: Only 24 cases could be studied as there was no amplification in six cases. Fetal sex was accurately determined in all of the 24 cases wherein 19 women were carrying male fetuses and five women were carrying female fetuses. An increase in the amount of fetal DNA was observed with an increase in the gestational age. Conclusions: Real time PCR analysis is a highly sensitive and accurate tool for <b>non-invasive</b> prenatal <b>diagnosis,</b> allowing detection of the sex of the fetus as early as 10 weeks of gestation. <b>Non-invasive</b> prenatal <b>diagnosis</b> eliminates the risk of fetal loss associated with the invasive procedure...|$|R

Development of non-invasive methods for obtaining intact fetal cells would allow accurate prenatal diagnosis for aneuploidy and single gene disorders, without the attendant risks associated with invasive testing, and would increase the uptake of prenatal diagnosis by women at risk. Isolation of fetal erythroblasts from maternal blood should allow accurate <b>non-invasive</b> prenatal <b>diagnosis</b> of both aneuploidies and monogenic disorders.

The study of adenomyosis is greatly hampered by a lack of clear terminology and the absence of a consensus classification of the lesions.

Standard radiological methods: The common generally asymptomatic incidental findings of cystic lesions on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be classified on the basis of specific imaging features.

Due to the morphological overlap of many cystic lesions, conventional radiological methods are often insufficient.
