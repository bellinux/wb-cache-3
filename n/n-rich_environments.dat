40|$|Abstract. To {{investigate}} themechanisms {{of nitrogen}} (N) tolerance in lichens, {{we examined the}} physiological responses to increased N availability in different functional groups. Thalli of the nitrophytic Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fr. previously grown both in an N-poor environment (~ 2 kgNha– 1 year– 1) and in an N-rich environment (~ 52 kgNha– 1 year– 1) were compared with the oligotrophic species Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach. and Usnea sp. Lichens were submitted to ammonium treatments. Maximum PSII efficiency, redistribution of the ions between the intra- and extracellular compartments and potassium and magnesium concentrations were the parameters used to check {{for the effects of}} N supply. The buffering capacity of the lichenextractswas alsodetermined inuntreated lichen thalli to check if different lichenbehavioursweredue to their ability to maintain the pH. The results showed a more similar response between X. parietina from the N-poor environment and the N-sensitive species than between X. parietina from the N-poor and <b>N-rich</b> <b>environments,</b> suggesting that X. parietina achieved N-tolerance after long-term exposure to N-rich environment. These results are important in understanding the effects of chronic ammoniumpollution on one of themost sensitive components of the ecosystem, linking physiological response and ecological consequences...|$|E
40|$|Brachiaria species, {{particularly}} B. humidicola, can synthesize {{and release}} compounds from their roots that inhibit nitrification, {{which can lead}} to changes in soil nitrogen (N) dynamics, mainly in N-poor soils. This may be important in crop-livestock integration systems, where brachiarias are grown together with or in rotation with grain crops. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether this holds true in <b>N-rich</b> <b>environments</b> and if other Brachiaria species have the same effect. The soil N dynamics were evaluated after the desiccation of the species B. brizantha, B. decumbens, B. humidicola, and B. ruziziensis, which are widely cultivated in Brazil. The plants were grown in pots with a dystroferric Red Latosol in a greenhouse. Sixty days after sowing, the plants were desiccated using glyphosate herbicide. The plants and soil were analyzed on the day of desiccation and 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after desiccation. The rhizosphere soil of the grasses contained higher levels of organic matter, total N and ammonium than the non-rhizosphere soil. The pH was lowest in the rhizosphere of B. humidicola, which may indicate that this species inhibits the nitrification process. However, variations in the soil ammonium and nitrate levels were not sufficient to confirm the suppressive effect of B. humidicola. The same was observed for B. brizantha, B. decumbens and B. ruziziensis, thereby demonstrating that, where N is abundant, none of the brachiarias studied has a significant effect on the nitrification process in soil...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} if N tolerance in the N-tolerant lichen Xanthoria parietina {{is influenced by}} N level of its native environment. Physiological response of thalli of X. parietina grown in a N-poor environment (nitrogen emissions of ca. 2 kg/ha/y) was compared with the response of thalli of X. parietina grown in a <b>N-rich</b> <b>environment</b> (nitrogen emissions of ca. 52 kg/ha/y) and of the N-sensitive species Evernia prunastri and Usnea sp. Lichens were treated with ammonium solutions (concentrations: 0, 25 mM, 50 mM and 250 mM) for 5 hours per day during three days in a week. After each treatment, the maximal PSII efficiency was measured, while localization of ammonium ions and concentrations of K+ and of Mg 2 + were measured only after the third treatment. Buffering capacity of lichen extracts was determined. The results showed a more similar behavior between X. parietina from the N-poor environment and the sensitive species E. prunastri and Usnea sp. than between X. parietina from the N-poor environment and the same species from the <b>N-rich</b> <b>environment,</b> suggesting that lacking the original stimulus of high N atmospheric concentration, defense mechanisms are not induced in the resistant species...|$|R
40|$|We perform {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} that {{indicate that the}} relative stability of antiphase boundaries (APB) with armchair and zigzag chiralities in monolayer boron nitride (BN) {{is determined by the}} chemical potentials of the boron and nitrogen species in the synthesis process. In an <b>N-rich</b> <b>environment,</b> a zigzag APB with N-rich core is the most stable structure, while under B-rich or intrinsic growth conditions, an armchair APB with stoichiometric core is the most stable. This stability transition is shown to arise from a competition between homopolar-bond (B-B and N-N) and elastic energy costs in the core of the APBs. Moreover, {{in the presence of a}} carbon source we find that a carbon-doped zigzag APB becomes the most stable boundary near the N-rich limit. The electronic structure of the two types of APBs in BN is shown to be particularly distinct, with the zigzag APB depicting defect-like deep electronic bands in the band gap, while the armchair APB shows bulk-like shallow electronic bands.

40|$|Films of {{amorphous}} {{aluminium nitride}} (AlN) were prepared by conventional radio frequency sputtering of an Al + Cr target in a plasma of pure nitrogen. The Cr-to-Al relative area determines the Cr content, which {{remained in the}} similar to 0 - 3. 5 at% concentration range in this study. Film deposition was followed by thermal annealing of the samples up to 1050 degrees C {{in an atmosphere of}} oxygen and by spectroscopic characterization through energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry, photoluminescence and optical transmission measurements. According to the experimental results, the optical-electronic properties of the Cr-containing AlN films are highly influenced by both the Cr concentration and the temperature of the thermal treatments. In fact, thermal annealing at 1050 degrees C induces the development of structures that, because of their typical size and distinctive spectral characteristics, were designated by ruby microstructures (RbMSs). These RbMSs are surrounded by a <b>N-rich</b> <b>environment</b> in which Cr(3 +) ions exhibit luminescent features not present in other Cr(3 +) -containing systems such as ruby, emerald or alexandrite. The light emissions shown by the RbMSs and surroundings were investigated according to the Cr concentration and temperature of measurement, allowing the identification of several Cr(3 +) -related luminescent lines. The main characteristics of these luminescent lines and corresponding excitation-recombination processes are presented and discussed in view of a detailed spectroscopic analysis.

40|$|Large basis untruncated {{shell model}} {{calculations}} {{have been done}} for the A= 138 neutron -rich nuclei in the pi(gdsh) X nu(hfpi) valence space above the 132 Sn core. Two (1 + 2) -body nuclear Hamiltonians, viz., realistic CWG and empirical SMPN in this model space have been used. Calculated ground state binding energies, level spectra and other spectroscopic properties have been compared with the available experimental data. Importance of untruncated shell model calculations in this model space has been pointed out. Shell model results for the very neutron rich Sn isotope (138 Sn, N/Z= 1. 76) of astrophysical interest for which no spectroscopic information except beta -decay half life is available, have been presented. Shell structure and evolution of collectivity in the even-even A= 138 isobars have been studied {{as a function of}} valence neutron and /or proton numbers. Calculations done for the first time, reproduce remarkably well the collective vibrational states in 138 Te and 138 Xe. Comparison of some of the important two-body matrix elements of the empirical SMPN, CW 5082 and the realistic CWG interactions has been done. These matrix elements are important for ground state binding energies and low-lying spectra of nuclei in this region. Consideration of the predictability of the two interactions seems to suggest that, in order to incorporate the special features of the N-N interaction in such exotic <b>n-rich</b> <b>environment</b> above the 132 Sn core, the use of local spectroscopic information from the region might be essential.

40|$|Background and Aims In {{spite of}} the broad array of studies {{conducted}} on the ecology of bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) kuhn), there is currently only a limited understanding of how P. aquilinum alters the soil environment in which it succeeds. P. aquilinum {{is one of the}} worldâ��s most aggressive invasive species and is known to effectively invade conservation priority habitats such as Calluna vulgaris (L.) heathland. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate differences in soil properties between intact stands of C. vulgaris and neighboring P. aquilinum to assess how P. aquilinum alters soil N transformations in a manner that might promote its success. Methods Replicate plots in five independently paired stands of P. aquilinum and C. vulgaris were established on land in which P. aquilinum is actively invading. Soils under the two plant types were evaluated for total N, mineralisable N, net nitrification, nitrifier activity, denitrification enzyme activity, polyphenol N complexing capacity, and resin sorption of inorganic N. Results Soils under P. aquilinum were consistently higher in NO 3 - and NH 4 + concentrations compared to C. vulgaris. Extractable organic and inorganic N concentrations for soil under P. aquilinum were respectively 65 %, 77 % and 358 % greater in amino N NH 4 +-N and NO 3 [...] N compared to that under C. vulgaris. In-situ net nitrification (NO 3 - sorption to ionic resins) was found to be nearly 300 times greater under P. aquilinum than under C. vulgaris. Conclusions P. aquilinum alters the soil environment as to create an inorganic <b>N-rich</b> <b>environment</b> that is favorable to its growth and development...|$|R
40|$|This {{tutorial}} review describes recent {{progress in}} modeling the active sites of carboxylate-rich non-heme diiron enzymes that activate dioxygen {{to carry out}} several key reactions in Nature. The chemistry of soluble methane monooxygenase, which catalyzes the selective oxidation of methane to methanol, {{is of particular interest}} for (bio) technological applications. Novel synthetic diiron complexes that mimic structural, and, to a lesser extent, functional features of these diiron enzymes are discussed. The chemistry of the enzymes is also briefly summarized. A particular focus of this review is on models that mimic characteristics of the diiron systems that were previously not emphasized, including systems that contain (i) aqua ligands, (ii) different substrates tethered to the ligand framework, (iii) dendrimers attached to carboxylates to mimic the protein environment, (iv) two N-donors in a syn-orientation with respect to the iron–iron vector, and (v) a <b>N-rich</b> ligand <b>environment</b> capable of accessing oxygenated high-valent diiron intermediates.

40|$|Growing AlN layers {{remains a}} {{significant}} challenge {{because it is}} subject to a large volume fraction of grain boundaries. In this study, the nature and formation of the AlN growth mechanism is examined by ab initio simulations and experimental demonstration. The calculated formation enthalpies of the constituent elements, including the Al/N atom, Al-N molecule, and Al-N 3 cluster, vary with growth conditions in <b>N-rich</b> and Al-rich <b>environments.</b> Using the calculation results as bases, we develop a three-step metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy, which involves the periodic growth sequence of (i) trimethylaluminum (TMAl), (ii) ammonia (NH 3), and (iii) TMAl+NH 3 supply, bringing in hierarchical growth units to improve AlN layer compactness. A series of AlN samples were grown, and their morphological and luminescent evolutions were evaluated by atomic force microscopy and cathodoluminescence, respectively. The proposed technique is advantageous because the boundaries and defect-related luminescence derived are highly depressed, serving as a productive platform from which to further optimize the properties of AlGaN semiconductors. ? 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Macroalgal blooms {{may lead}} to {{dramatic}} changes in physicochemical variables and biogeochemical cycling in affected waters. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of macroalgal blooms on marine bacteria, especially those functioning in nutrient cycles. We measured environmental factors and investigated bacterial diazotrophs in two niches, surface waters that were covered (CC) and non-covered (CF) with massive macroalgal canopies of Ulva prolifera, in the Yellow Sea in the summer of 2011 using real-time PCR and clone library analysis of nifH genes. We found that heterotrophic diazotrophs (Gammaproteobacteria) dominated the communities and were mostly represented by Vibrio-related phylotypes in both CC and CF. Desulfovibrio-related phylotypes were only detected in CC. There were significant differences in community composition in these two environments (p < 0. 001) and a much higher abundance of nifH in CC (4. 55 x 10 (6) copies l(- 1)) than in CF (2. 49 x 10 (6) copies l(- 1)). The nifH copy number was inversely related to concentrations of ammonium and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and to the stoichiometric ratios of N:P and N:Si. This indicates that macroalgal blooms significantly affect diazotrophic abundance and community composition and that vibrios and Desulfovibrio-related heterotrophic diazotrophs adapt well to the (<b>N-rich</b> but P-limited) <b>environment</b> during blooming. Potential ecological and microbiological mechanisms behind this scenario are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
