40|$|We explored, using nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) metabolomics and fatty acids profiling, {{the effects of a}} common <b>nutritional</b> <b>complement,</b> Curcuma longa, at a nutritionally relevant dose with human use, administered in conjunction with an unbalanced diet. Indeed, traditional food supplements have been long used to counter metabolic impairments induced by unbalanced diets. Here, rats were fed either a standard diet, a high level of fructose and saturated fatty acid (HFS) diet, a diet common to western countries and that certainly contributes to the epidemic of insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, or a HFS diet with a Curcuma longa extract (1 % of curcuminoids in the extract) for ten weeks. Orthogonal pro-jections to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) on the serum NMR profiles and fatty acid composition (determined by GC/MS) showed a clear discrimination between HFS groups and controls. This discrimination involved metabolites such as glucose, amino acids, pyruvate, creatine, phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine, ketone bodies and gly-coproteins as well as an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and a decrease of n- 6 and n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).

40|$|Background: The Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} has generated worldwide concern on {{the risk of}} exposure to nuclear radiations. In Europe, health authorities had to issue statements {{about the lack of}} usefulness of iodine based preventive treatments within their borders. However a lack of confidence in official messages has developed in various European countries due to recent perceived failures in managing public health crises. The lay population preventive behaviors in this context are largely unknown. Consequently, {{to examine the effects of}} public health crisis on lay behaviors leading to pharmaceuticals purchases, we studied the sales of iodine-based products in France before, during and after the crisis. Methods: We focused our study on 58 iodine-based drugs available with and without a physician prescription. Our data came from a stratified sample of 3004 pharmacies in metropolitan France. Our study period was from January 2010 to April 2012, with a focus on March-April 2011. We differentiated sales of drugs prescribed by physicians from sales of drugs obtained without a prescription. We used a CUSUM method to detect abnormal increases in sales activity and cross-correlations to assess shifts in sales timing. Results: Sales of iodine-based <b>nutritional</b> <b>complements,</b> and later sales of iodine-based homeopathic remedies, substantially increased (up to 3 -fold) during a period of 20 days.

40|$|Context]: Supplemental {{feeding of}} large {{mammalian}} herbivores {{is a common}} management tool mainly aimed at promoting healthy populations and at increasing productivity and trophy sizes. Such management measure may indirectly affect herbivore effects on plant communities through altered foraging patterns. The quantification of the ecological effects of large herbivore management is important for designing holistic management and conservation programs. [Aims]: Here we aimed at quantifying the ecological effects of supplemental feeding of Iberian red deer, Cervus elaphus hispanicus, on the composition of and on the browsing effects on Mediterranean woody plant community. [Methods]: An experiment {{was set up in}} a hunting rangeland located in central Spain, where female deer were kept in enclosures with either exclusive access to natural forages or with additional ad libitum access to a nutritionally rich concentrate. The experiment also included a control area where deer were absent. [Key results]: We observed significant differences in browsing impacts among the supplemented, non-supplemented and control areas, and such effect varied for the different plant species. Plant species which <b>nutritional</b> content <b>complemented</b> that of fodder were more highly consumed, for instance, Erica spp., which digestible fibre content is higher and N content lower than that of provided fodder. The presence of deer and the concentrate supplied, instead, did not influence the relative abundances of shrub species. [Conclusions]: Artificial supplemental feeding provided to ungulates led to increased browsing on plant species which <b>nutritional</b> composition <b>complemented</b> that of the supplement provided. [Implications]: So as to alleviate herbivory impact on all shrubs, we suggest that composition of supplemental feeding should adjust both to the natural forage availability and quality and to ungulate requirements across seasons.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} factors that motivated increasing reliance on maize during the Basketmaker II period in the North American Southwest. Through the analysis of 44 human paleofeces from Turkey Pen Ruin, Utah, I investigate resource choice and nutritional supplementation of maize {{before the advent of}} bean horticulture. In order to discern what resources provided caloric and nutritional supplementation to maize, all paleofecal specimens were analyzed for pollen and macrofossil content, and 20 were further sampled for PCR analysis targeted at several select animal and plant species. Eight paleofecal specimens from various stratigraphic layers were directly AMS dated in order to better assess the chronology of the midden from which they were excavated, and to determine their cultural phase association. The resulting data allowed for the testing of three hypotheses based in human behavioral ecology, specifically applying diet-breadth and patch-choice models. The results of this project demonstrate that the diet of these early maize farmers was relatively broad, and included a high proportion of resources with lower caloric returns than maize. Furthermore, plants associated with field and disturbance settings, such as goosefoot (Chenopodium spp.) and purslane (Portulaca spp.), which provide excellent <b>nutritional</b> <b>complements</b> to maize, made large contributions to the diet. Overall, these findings indicate that people were pushed to increase their reliance on farming due to resource depression, and that the anthropogenic niche created by farming activities encouraged greater focus on the field as a patch of multiple types of resources, and not only as a location for growing maize. The discovery of corn smut (Ustilago maydis) spores in {{all but one of the}} specimens studied suggest that this parasitic fungus may also have made a noteworthy contribution to the diet, further supporting the emphasis on the field as a patch. In combination, these data and theoretical analyses help to explain the subsistence choices made by Basketmaker II people. In particular, these results clarify what motivated people to increasingly focus on farming, and highlight the wild resources used to augment maize-based nutrition prior to the incorporation of beans, which provided essential nutrients during later periods...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is a {{major problem}} in both developing and developed countries, and much of this can be attributed to insufficient dietary intake. Over the past decades several measures, such as supplementation and food fortification, have helped to alleviate this problem. However, their associated costs limit their accessibility and effectiveness, particularly amongst the financially constrained. A more affordable and sustainable option that can be implemented alongside existing measures is biofortification. To date, much work has been invested into staples like cereals and root crops—this has culminated in the successful generation of high iron-accumulating lines in rice and pearl millet. More recently, pulses have gained attention as targets for biofortification. Being secondary staples rich in protein, they are a <b>nutritional</b> <b>complement</b> to the traditional starchy staples. Despite the relative youth of this interest, considerable advances have already been made concerning the biofortification of pulses. Several studies have been conducted in bean, chickpea, lentil, and pea to assess existing germplasm for high iron-accumulating traits. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular workings behind these traits, particularly in a leguminous context, and biofortification via genetic modification (GM) remains to be attempted.

Although the administration of Curcuma longa did not prevent the observed increase of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, discriminating metabolites were observed between groups fed HFS alone or with addition of a Curcuma longa extract, namely some MUFA and n- 3 PUFA, glycoproteins, glutamine, and methanol, suggesting that curcuminoids may act respectively on the fatty acid metabolism, the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and alcohol oxidation. Curcuma longa extract supplementation appears to be beneficial in these metabolic pathways in rats.

The aims of this work are: geographical identification of existing apiaries in the central region of Portugal; identification and quantification of floral sources; characterization of honey (sensory and physico-chemical); construction of thematic maps supporting the new hives installation, predicting the honey characteristics. This methodology has been applied in a Portuguese studied area (Vila Velha de Ródão). A first identification of the apiaries allowed the establishment of the potential zones to future beekeepers installation (Lidónio et al., 2009) (Figure 1). In order to complete the previous information, it is in progress the identification and quantification of species for apiculture interest as well as the honey physical and chemical characterization. Potential apiculture development characterization has been mapped using the following attributes: surrounding area for 200 vegetation units (Forestry zones, agricultural zones and bush zones); slopes warm temperate (warm and very hot); the surrounding area, about 200 m, around the water lines and water points; surrounding feeding apiary area (50 m diameter); urban admissible legal boundary (100 m diameter for each apiary). It was also considered, the shading maps because of its importance on hive production and bee behaviour. Shading values considered favourable are between 0 and 127. A methodological procedure was developed, aiming the potential beekeeping map construction. Identification of favourable areas, for future beekeepers apiaries installation, will be possible in result of this study. In many Portuguese regions some beekeepers transport their hives, according to the floral sources development in order to reach regions where the production of some species is higher, allowing the improvement of some crop pollinization, for a specific month. Vila Velha de Rodão area, about 10885 ha, presents excellent conditions for proper development of beekeeping. It is well documented that the pollen quality and variability, influences the honey flavour and quality (Anjos et al., 2009). The studied region is limited by the major watercourses and their respective valleys and steep slopes. Predominantly those uncultivated land, presents high biodiversity with high beekeeping potential. Some of the most important species present in this region are, Lavandula pedunculata (Miller) Cav., Cistus ladanifer L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Erica umbellata L., Erica 13 th AGILE International Conference on Geographic Information Science 2010 Page 2 of 3 Guimarães, Portugal australis L., Erica lusitanica, Calluna vulgaris (L.)

40|$|Background. Research {{related to}} {{nutritional}} habits during the asymptomatic phase of HIV {{has not been}} well documented or is very scarce; this would include {{understanding the importance of}} nutritional status regarding disease progression and that suitable nutritional status may slow transition to symptomatic stages or AIDS stage. No studies have yet been carried out in Colombia describing nutritional habits in HIV-positive patients who have been receiving pharmacological treatment; no records have thus been kept and no advances have been made regarding this topic. Objective. Describing nutritional knowledge, attitudes and practice in asymptomatic patients diagnosed as suffering from clinical phase HIV infection receiving pharmacological treatment. Materials and methods. A descriptive exploratory study was carried out using a care and prevention (CAP) -based approach; the survey was voluntarily filled out by 108 patients who were attending outpatient consultation in two private institutions in Bogotá. Results. Three components were analysed in the 108 surveys. Knowledge. 58. 7 % of the patients referred to having received information about what their diet should have been like; 32. 3 % had their diet supplied by a nutritionist. Fibre was the main component taken into account when choosing food (65 %) and protein was considered to be the most beneficial nutrient (52 %). Attitude: 61. 8 % of the patients stated that their diagnosis hampered selecting and buying food {{due to a lack of}} information. Appetite had not undergone changes in 49. 5 % of the participants following reflecting on their diagnosis. Practice. 75 % of the patients recognised the importance of consuming nutritional supplements and complements; however, only 35. 7 % of them took them. When buying industrialised/processed food, 66. 4 % of the patients verified the products' expiry date and/or nutritional data on the label. Conclusions. The food customarily consumed by the patients was that forming part of the average Colombian population's basic weekly food basket; their habits did not significantly differ from those of the rest of the population. Dietary and nutritional information was being obtained from non-professional sources. General practitioners or specialists were referring patients to professional nutritionists; however, self-medication and dosage were common regarding the use and consumption of <b>nutritional</b> <b>complements</b> and supplements. Antecedentes.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{familial}} adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are {{at increased}} risk for the development of colorectal cancer. Surgery and chemoprevention are the most effective means to prevent cancer development. Thymoquinone (TQ) is considered the main compound of the volatile Nigella sativa seed oil and has been reported to possess anticarcinogenic properties. In this study we evaluated the chemopreventive properties of TQ in a mouse model of FAP. Methods: APC Min mice were fed with chow containing 37. 5 mg/kg or 375 mg/kg TQ for 12 weeks. H&E stained intestine tissue sections were assessed for tumor number, localization, size, and grade. Immunohistochemistry for β-catenin, c-myc, Ki- 67 and TUNEL-staining was performed to investigate TQ’s effect on major colorectal cancer pathways. TQ’s impact on GSK- 3 β and β-catenin were studied in RKO cells. Results: 375 mg/kg but not 37. 5 mg/kg TQ decreased the number of large polyps in the small intestine of APC Min mice. TQ induced apoptosis in the neoplastic tissue but not in the normal mucosa. Furthermore, upon TQ treatment, β-catenin was retained at the membrane and c-myc decreased in the nucleus, which was associated with a reduced cell proliferation in the villi. In vitro, TQ activated GSK- 3 β, which induced membranous localization of β-catenin and reduced nuclear c-myc expression. Conclusions: In summary, TQ interferes with polyp progression in Apc Min mice through induction of tumor-cell specific apoptosis and by modulating Wnt signaling through activation of GSK- 3 β.

40|$|Interest on food {{production}} systems {{based on the}} cultivation of vegetables for future planetary exploration missions is increasing as these units can help overcoming difficult and costly re-supply logistics. In addition to producing edible biomass by growing vegetable species, these systems {{can be used in}} closed loop configuration with bio-regenerative life support subsystems for water and CO 2 recycling and O 2 production. Aiming at this objective, the European Space Agency (ESA) undertook a feasibility study on Closed Loop Food Systems (CLFS) for Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Transit to Mars and Mars Surface scenarios. This paper describes the study's results. Firstly, candidate crops are selected based on nutritional characteristics and aspects like yield, cultivation surface and volume, and generated inedible biomass. A culture plan for these crops is then established. The design process of a Food Production Unit (FPU) begins with the definition of an On Ground Experimental Growth Unit (OGEGU), a ground reference system that is later adapted to the proposed Space scenarios. For Low Earth Orbit (LEO), two secondary structures options (racks and spiral), fitting a Columbus-sized module, are presented and their {{food production}} capabilities are analyzed. Similarly, design options for Transit to Mars and Mars Surface are described. Mass, power and volume budgets are determined and the Equivalent System Mass (ESM) methodology is used for trade-off study. For the LEO options process modeling and preliminary mechanical, thermal, safety and logistics analysis are done. Impacts on the International Space Station (ISS) due to potential FPU implementation are also studied. For the Mars surface scenario, an adapted FPU architecture is presented. Interface issues between FPU and bio-regenerative life support systems are also addressed. The study shows that FPU systems for LEO application could deliver ca. 12 % of the food requirements, which makes them a very interesting platform for both space agriculture research and <b>complementing</b> <b>nutritional</b> requirements. For the Mars Surface application provision of up to 40 % food requirements is shown possible. Finally, relevant technological gaps identified throughout the study are outlined.

A porcentagem de germinação era de 86 % e iniciou-se a partir do segundo dia após a embebição, com desenvolvimento dos brotos até o sexto dia. Após 48 h, para aumentar a síntese de etileno e melhorar a qualidade dos brotos produzidos, para criar estresse fisiológico, foram usados pesos sobre os brotos, os quais também foram submetidos a provas microbiológicas, cujos valores foram maiores que 1, 1 x 104 NMP g- 1 para coliformes fecais e com acidez de 2, 64 % e pH de 5, 48 (pouco ácido). Não houve crescimento de Salmonella e, para Escherichia coli, os níveis foram inferiores a 10 UFC g- 1. Em 100 g de brotos, foram encontrados 54, 34 g de carboidratos, 6, 24 g de fibra bruta e 25, 56 g de proteínas. Testes sensoriais foram realizados em comparação com brotos de alfafa e feijão, com provadores não-treinados. A aceitabilidade foi de 73, 3 %, com apenas 13, 3 % de rejeição e 13, 3 % de indiferença, valores inferiores aos do feijão, com 96, 7 % de aceitação e 3, 3 % de rejeição, e alfafa, com 83, 3 % de aceitação e 10, 00 % de rejeição. Pela baixa rejeição e indiferença, é possível sugerir que a variedade de lentilha em estudo pode ser utilizada para produzir brotos alimentícios, como complemento nutricional na dieta alimentar. This trial {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} a precocious variety of lentil (Lens esculenta), developed and grown in Argentina, named PRECOZ, {{to be used for}} sprout production, using a thermal polyurethane box with a lateral drain to allow the water to flow off. The process was carried out in darkness at room-controlled temperature. Germination began in the second day after the imbibing practice, while sprouts development came on until the sixth day, with 86 % germination percentage. Eight days after sowing, weights were put on sprouts to create a physiological stress as well as to increase ethylene synthesis and improve the quality of produced sprouts. They were also submitted to microbiological tests, whose values were superior to 1. 1 x 104 NMP g- 1 for fecal coliforms, with acidity of 2. 64 % and a pH of 5. 48, with low acidity. There was no growth of Salmonella or Escherichia coli, once the levels were lower than 10 UFC g- 1. The physiochemical analyses, in 100 grams of sprouts, presented 54. 34 g of carbohydrates; 6. 24 g of crude fiber and 25. 56 g of protein. Non-trained taster persons were submitted to sensory tests in order to compare, according to palatability, which was more acceptable – sprouts of alfalfa or beans. The acceptability of lentils was 73. 3 %, with only 13. 3 % of rejection and 13. 3 % of indifference; these results were inferior to beans, which had 96. 7 % of acceptability and 3. 3 % of rejection, as well as alfalfa, which had 83. 3 % of acceptability and 10. 00 % of rejection. According to the low rejection and indifference, it is possible to suggest that the studied variety of lentil can be used in the production of sprouts, as a <b>nutritional</b> nourishing <b>complement...</b>|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi avaliar a variedade precoce de lentilha, desenvolvida e cultivada na Argentina, chamada PRECOZ, para ser utilizada na produÃÃo de broto alimentÃcio. A porcentagem de germinaÃÃo avaliada foi de 86 % e as sementes foram entÃo submetidas Ã produÃÃo de brotos em uma caixa tÃrmica de poliuretano com dreno lateral para escoamento da Ãgua, sob ausÃncia de luz e temperatura controlada. A germinaÃÃo iniciou-se a partir do segundo dia apÃs a embebiÃÃo, e o desenvolvimento dos brotos ocorreu atÃ o sexto dia. ApÃs 48 horas de embebiÃÃo, foram usados pesos sobre os brotos para criar estresse fisiolÃgico, aumentar a sÃntese de etileno e melhorar a qualidade dos brotos produzidos. Os brotos obtidos foram submetidos a provas microbiolÃgicas, cujos valores foram maiores que 1, 1 x 104 NMP/g para coliformes fecais, provavelmente devido ao fato de apresentarem acidez de 2, 64 % e pH pouco Ãcido, com valores de 5, 48. NÃo houve crescimento de Salmonella, no entanto, para Escherichia coli, os nÃveis foram inferiores a 10 UFC/g. Em 100 gramas de brotos foram encontrados, 54, 34 g de carboidratos, 6, 24 g de fibra bruta e 25, 56 g de proteÃnas. ApÃs o desenvolvimento dos brotos, foram realizados testes sensoriais, em comparaÃÃo com brotos de alfafa e feijÃo, com provadores nÃo treinados. A aceitabilidade da lentilha ficou em 73, 3 % com apenas 13, 3 % de rejeiÃÃo e 13, 3 % de indiferenÃa; houve valores inferiores aos alcanÃados para brotos de feijÃo com 96, 7 % de aceitaÃÃo e 3, 3 % de rejeiÃÃo, enquanto para brotos de alfafa, os resultados foram 83, 3 % de aceitaÃÃo e 10, 00 % de rejeiÃÃo. Considerando a baixa rejeiÃÃo e tambÃm indiferenÃa apresentada na avaliaÃÃo sensorial, Ã possÃvel sugerir que a variedade de lentilha, em estudo, pode ser utilizada para a produÃÃo de brotos alimentÃcios, como complemento nutricional na dieta alimentar. This trial {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} the precocious variety of lentil, developed and grown in Argentina, named as PRECOZ, {{in order to}} be used on nutritive sprout production. Since the germination percentage was 86 %, the seeds were submitted to sprouts production into a thermal polyurethane box with a lateral drain so that water could flow off. The applied process was carried out in darkness and at room controlled temperature. The seedling began in the second day after the imbibing practice, then, sprouts development came on the sixth day. After 48 hours being imbibed, weights were put on sprouts to induce them to a physiological stress, as well as to increase ethylene synthesis and improve the quality of produced sprouts. The obtained sprouts were submitted to microbiological tests, whose answers were superior to 1. 1 x 104 NMP/g in relation to fecal coliforms, probably, due to their acidity (2. 64 %) and low acid pH (5. 48). There was no growth of Salmonella and Escherichia coli once the levels were inferior to 10 UFC/g. The analyses showed that, in 100 grams of sprouts, there were 54. 34 g of carbohydrate; 6. 24 g of crude fiber and 25. 56 g of protein. After the sprouts development, sensorial tests were carried out, to compare these ones with sprouts of alfalfa and beans, so non trained taster people were selected. The lentil acceptability answer was 73. 3 %, with only 13. 3 % of rejection and 13. 3 % of indifference; but these answers were inferior to the ones for beans sprouts with 96. 7 % of acceptance and 3. 3 % of rejection, as well as for alfalfa sprouts, whose answers were 83. 3 % of acceptability, and 10. 00 % of rejection. Taking into account the low rejection as well as the indifference registered at sensorial evaluation, it is possible to suggest that the studied variety of lentil can be used on sprouts production as a <b>nutritional</b> nourishing <b>complement...</b>|$|R
