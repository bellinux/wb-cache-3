25|$|Triads {{consist of}} three notes; the root or first note, the third, and the fifth. For example, the C major scale {{consists}} of the notes C D E F G A B: a triad can be constructed on any note of such a major scale, and all are minor or major except the triad on the seventh or leading-tone, which is a diminished chord. A triad formed using the note C itself consists of C (the root note), E (the third note of the scale) and G (the fifth note of the scale). The interval from C to E is of four semitones, a major third, and so this triad is called C Major. A triad formed upon the same scale but with D as the root <b>note,</b> <b>D</b> (root), F (third), A (fifth), on the other hand, has only three semitones between the root and third and is called D minor, a minor triad.|$|E

2500|$|Ligeti's {{earliest}} {{works are}} often {{an extension of}} the musical language of Béla Bartók. Even his piano cycle Musica ricercata (1953), though written according to Ligeti with a [...] "Cartesian" [...] approach in which he [...] "regarded all the music I knew and loved as being... irrelevant", has been described by one biographer as inhabiting a world very close to Bartók's set of piano works, Mikrokosmos. Ligeti's set comprises eleven pieces in all. The work is based on a simple restriction: the first piece uses exclusively one pitch A, heard in multiple octaves, and only {{at the very end of}} the piece is a second <b>note,</b> <b>D,</b> heard. The second piece then uses three notes (E, F, and G), the third piece uses four, and so on, so that in the final piece all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are present. Shortly after its composition Ligeti arranged six of the movements of Musica ricercata for wind quintet under the title 'Six Bagatelles for Wind Quintet'. The Bagatelles were performed first in 1956, but not in their entirety: the last movement was censored by the Soviets for being too 'dangerous'.|$|E

[...] "'What argument,'" [...] quotes Monck Mason from the tract issued in 1724 entitled, [...] "A Defence of the Conduct of the People of Ireland, in their unanimous refusal of Mr. Wood's Copper Money," [...] "'can {{be drawn from the}} badness of our former coinages but this, that because we have formerly been cheated by our coiners, we ought to suffer Mr. Wood to cheat us over again? Whereas, one reason for our so vigorously opposing Mr. Wood's coinage, is, because we have always been imposed upon in our copper money, and we find he is treading exactly in the steps of his predecessors, and thinks he has a right to cheat us because he can shew a precedent for it.'

60|$|I {{have said}} that he was dressed in the height of fashion, and such indeed was the {{impression}} which a glance would give. His face was thin and aristocratic, with a well-marked nose, delicate features, and gay careless expression. Some little paleness of the cheeks and darkness under the eyes, the result of hard travel or dissipation, did but add a chastening grace to his appearance. His white periwig, velvet and silver riding coat, lavender vest and red satin knee-breeches were all of the best style and cut, but when looked at closely, each and all of these articles of attire bore evidence of having seen better days. Beside the dust and stains of travel, there was a shininess or a fading of colour here and there which scarce accorded with the costliness of their material or the bearing of their wearer. His long riding-boots had a gaping seam in the side of one of them, whilst his toe was pushing its way {{through the end of the}} other. For the rest, he wore a handsome silver-hilted rapier at his side, and had a frilled cambric shirt somewhat the worse for wear and open at the front, as was the mode with the gallants of those days. All the time he was speaking he mumbled a toothpick, which together with his constant habit of pronouncing his o's as a's made his conversation sound strange to our ears. (<b>Note</b> <b>D</b> Appendix) Whilst we were noting these peculiarities he was reclining upon Dame Hobson's best taffatta-covered settee, tranquilly combing his wig with a delicate ivory comb which he had taken from a small satin bag which hung upon the right of his sword-belt.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, {{there is}} a {{difference}} between a major tone and a minor tone. In C major, the second <b>note</b> (<b>D)</b> will be 4 steps away. However, in A minor, where A is 6 steps below C, the fourth <b>note</b> (<b>D)</b> will be 9 steps above A, so 3 steps above C. So when switching from C major to A minor, one need to slightly change the <b>note</b> <b>D.</b> In a nutshell, the scale is tainted so that {{there is a}} noticeable difference between the matching major and minor scales.|$|E

Instead the probability closely follows Newcomb-Benford's law, namely P(d) =log(1 + 1 /d). The discrepancies between Newcomb-Benford's law and first-digits frequencies in turbulent data are analysed through Shannon's entropy. The data sets are obtained with direct numerical simulations for two types of fluid flow: an isotropic case initialized with a Taylor-Green vortex and a channel flow. Results are in agreement with Newcomb-Benford's law in nearly homogeneous cases and the discrepancies are related to intermittent events. Thus the scale invariance for {{the first significant}} digits, which supports Newcomb-Benford's law, seems {{to be related to}} an equilibrium turbulent state, namely with a significant inertial range.
