5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted hyenas vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted hyenas symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other <b>negative</b> <b>traits,</b> and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E

Regardless of race, religion, nationality, or gender, brats might identify more with other highly mobile children than with non-mobile ones. Military brats also graduate from college at a higher rate than the civilian population and divorce at a lower rate.|$|E

Shakespeare's anti-Catholic King John draws on The Troublesome Reign, offering a [...] "balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler". Anthony Munday's plays The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington demonstrate many of John's <b>negative</b> <b>traits,</b> but approve of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
500|$|The main {{character}} of each Persona {{game is a}} silent protagonist representing the player, with a manner described by the series' director as [...] "silent and cool". When the writer for new story content in Eternal Punishments PSP version wished for the {{main character}} to have spoken dialogue, this was vetoed as it went against the series tradition. Two recurring characters generated by the Collective Unconscious are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the respective representatives of the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>traits</b> of humanity. In Innocent Sin, the two reveal that they {{are engaged in a}} proxy contest as to whether humanity can embrace its contradictory feelings and find a higher purpose before destroying itself. Philemon makes appearances in later Persona titles as a blue butterfly. Many of the major antagonists in the series are personifications of death generated by the human subconscious. The central theme of the Persona series is exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves. The stories generally focus on the main cast's interpersonal relationships and psychologies. There is also an underlying focus on [...] "the human soul".|$|E

500|$|Popular {{representations}} of John {{first began to}} emerge during the Tudor period, mirroring the revisionist histories of the time. The anonymous play The Troublesome Reign of King John portrayed the king as a [...] "proto-Protestant martyr", similar to that shown in John Bale's morality play Kynge Johan, in which John attempts to save England from the [...] "evil agents of the Roman Church". By contrast, Shakespeare's King John, a relatively anti-Catholic play that draws on The Troublesome Reign for its source material, offers a more [...] "balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler". Anthony Munday's play The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington portrays many of John's <b>negative</b> <b>traits,</b> but adopts a positive interpretation of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church, {{in line with the}} contemporary views of the Tudor monarchs. By the middle of the 17th century, plays such as Robert Davenport's King John and Matilda, although based largely on the earlier Elizabethan works, were transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons and focusing more on the tyrannical aspects of John's behaviour.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the impact of affect as a state (positive affect state and negative affect state) and affect as a trait (positive affect <b>trait</b> and <b>negative</b> affect <b>trait)</b> on organizational citizenship behavior intentions. It was hypothesized that positive affect state and negative affect state would be significant predictors of OCB intentions after controlling for positive and <b>negative</b> affect <b>trait</b> respectively. It was also hypothesized that positive and <b>negative</b> affect <b>trait</b> would be significantly correlated with positive and negative affect state respectively and would thus be related to OCB intentions. 100 respondents employed in various organizations in the United States participated in a web-based survey as part of the study. The results showed that positive affect state accounted for significant variance in OCB intentions after controlling for positive trait and that positive and <b>negative</b> affect <b>trait</b> were significantly correlated with positive and negative affect state respectively. However, negative affect state did not account for significant variance in OCB intentions after controlling for <b>negative</b> affect <b>trait...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Eugene Wrayburn – who {{is seen as}} the novel's second hero, is a barrister, and {{a gentleman}} by birth, though he is roguish and insolent. He is a close friend of Mortimer Lightwood, and {{involved}} in a love triangle with Lizzie Hexam and Bradley Headstone. Both these characters act as foils to Wrayburn. Lizzie contrasts with Eugene's more <b>negative</b> <b>traits</b> and Headstone makes Eugene appear more virtuous. He is nearly killed by Headstone but, like Harmon/Rokesmith, [...] "reborn" [...] after his incident in the river. Though Wrayburn appears morally grey through most of the novel, by the end he is seen as a moral, sympathetic character and a true gentleman, after choosing to marry Lizzie in order to save her reputation, even though she is socially below him.|$|E
2500|$|PGD has the {{potential}} to screen for genetic issues unrelated to medical necessity, such as intelligence and beauty, and against <b>negative</b> <b>traits</b> such as disabilities. The medical community has regarded this as a counterintuitive and controversial suggestion. The prospect of a [...] "designer baby" [...] is closely related to the PGD technique, creating a fear that increasing frequency of genetic screening will move toward a modern eugenics movement. On the other hand, a principle of procreative beneficence is proposed, which is a putative moral obligation of parents in a position to select their children to favor those expected to have the best life. An argument in favor of this principle is that traits (such as empathy, memory, etc.) are [...] "all-purpose means" [...] in the sense of being of instrumental value in realizing whatever life plans the child may come to have.|$|E

30|$|To conclude, {{findings}} here {{show that}} individuals highly engaged with {{music for the}} purposes of cognitive and emotional regulation are more likely to use cognitive reappraisal as an emotion regulation strategy, and this in turn predicts positive mental health outcomes. Importantly, the prospective benefits of music use for cognitive and emotional regulation are sustained even after controlling for positive and <b>negative</b> <b>trait</b> affect, in the outcome measures of mental health and negative emotional states, respectively. This suggests that purposeful music use has the potential to elevate well-being indices beyond levels typically linked to positive trait affect, and lessen depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms from levels typically associated with <b>negative</b> <b>trait</b> affect. This study provides new evidence that purposeful music engagement may promote flourishing in life, by alleviating mental distress and enhancing well-being, through cognitive reappraisal, even after controlling for trait affect.|$|R
2500|$|Webster retains {{his high}} {{prestige}} in recent historiography. Baxter argues that his nationalistic {{view of the}} union as one and inseparable from liberty helped the union to triumph over the states-rights Confederacy, making it his greatest contribution. However Bartlett, emphasizing Webster's private life, says his great oratorical achievements were in part undercut by his improvidence with money, his excessively opulent lifestyle, and his numerous conflict of interest situations. Remini points out [...] that Webster's historical orations taught Americans their history before textbooks were widely available.Webster was godlike in his articulation of American nationalism, Remini agrees, but his <b>negative</b> <b>traits</b> ruined his presidential ambition. He lacked the necessary modesty and his overpowering desire for the White House, and his craving for money was unbecoming to a statesman of his caliber in a nation committed to republicanism and fearful of corruption.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Gerber {{claims that}} the Quran ascribes <b>negative</b> <b>traits</b> to Jews, such as cowardice, greed, and chicanery. She also alleges that the Quran {{associates}} Jews with interconfessional strife and rivalry (...) , the Jewish belief that they alone are beloved of God (...) , and that only they will achieve salvation (...) [...] According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, the Qur'an contains many attacks on Jews and Christians for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet. In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure. In numerous verses the Qur'an accuses Jews of altering the Scripture. [...] Karen Armstrong {{claims that the}}re are [...] "far more numerous passages in the Qur'an" [...] which speak positively of the Jews and their great |prophets, than those which were against the [...] "rebellious Jewish tribes of Medina" [...] (during Muhammad's time). Sayyid Abul Ala believes the punishments were not meant for all Jews, {{and that they were}} only meant for the Jewish inhabitants that were sinning at the time. According to historian John Tolan, the Quran contains a verse which criticizes the Christian worship of Jesus Christ as a God, amongst other critiques of Jewish and Christian practices and doctrines. Despite this, the Quran has high praise for these religions, regarding them as the other two parts of the Abrahamic trinity.|$|E
2500|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of Gordon that the first critical book by a British author was not published until 1908, when Baring [...] by this time raised to the peerage as Viscount Cromer [...] published his autobiography, which was notable as the first British book to portray Gordon in an unflattering manner, though Lord Cromer also tried {{to be fair and}} emphasised what he felt were Gordon's positive, as well as his <b>negative,</b> <b>traits.</b> About the charge that if only Gladstone had listened to Gordon the disaster would have been avoided, Cromer wrote that in the course of one month, he received five telegrams from Gordon offering his advice, each one of which completely contradicted the previous telegram, leading Cromer to charge that Gordon was too mercurial a figure to hold command. As a young man, Winston Churchill shared in the national consensus that Gordon was one of Britain's greatest heroes. During a meeting in 1898 in Cairo where Churchill interviewed Baring to gather material for his 1899 book The River War, Baring challenged Churchill about his belief that Gordon was a hero. After his conversation with Baring, Churchill wrote: [...] "Of course {{there is no doubt that}} Gordon as a political figure was absolutely hopeless. He was so erratic, capricious, utterly unreliable, his mood changed so often, his temper was abominable, he was frequently drunk, and yet with all that he had a tremendous sense of honour and great abilities".|$|E
40|$|Three {{studies show}} that social {{categorization}} is biased {{at the level of}} category allocation. In all studies, participants categorized faces. In Studies 1 and 2, participants overallocated faces with criminal features-a stereotypical negative trait-to the stigmatized Moroccan category, especially if they were prejudiced. On the contrary, the stereotype-irrelevant <b>negative</b> <b>trait</b> stupid did not lead to overallocation to the Moroccan category. In Study 3, using the stigmatized category homosexual, the previously used <b>negative</b> <b>trait</b> criminal-irrelevant to the homosexual stereotype-did not lead to overallocation, but the stereotype-relevant positive trait femininity did. These results demonstrate that normative fit is higher for faces with stereotype-relevant features regardless of valence. Moreover, individual differences in implicit prejudice predicted the extent to which stereotype-relevant traits elicited overallocation: Whereas more negatively prejudiced people showed greater overallocation of faces associated with <b>negative</b> stereotype-relevant <b>traits,</b> they showed less overallocation of faces associated with positive stereotype-relevant traits. These results support our normative fit hypothesis: In general, normative fit is better for faces with stereotypical features. Moreover, normative fit is enhanced for prejudiced individuals when these features are evaluatively congruent. Social categorization thus may be biased in itself...|$|R
40|$|Positive trait {{information}} is typically better recalled than <b>negative</b> <b>trait</b> information when encoded {{in reference to}} the self, but not when encoded in reference to someone else or when processed for general meaning.

2500|$|By {{examining}} the qualities associated with public figures whose images have been manipulated {{to make those}} figures either exaggeratedly positive or exaggeratedly negative symbols, scholars have developed a number of assumptions about the traits and political goals generally desired by various PRC governments. Figures whose images have been manipulated to make them positive symbols will be portrayed as: coming from proletarian or semi-proletarian backgrounds; being courageous, fair, straightforward, and honest in their treatment of subordinates and superiors; leading a simple and frugal life; demonstrating great concern for the [...] "masses"; achieving outstanding professional success; and, being impeccably loyal to the Party and to the communist cause. Figures whose images have been manipulated to make them negative symbols will be portrayed as: coming from backgrounds which have exposed them to [...] "bourgeoise" [...] thoughts and attitudes; adhering to all or most historical attempts to oppose political figures in the PRC who later became powerful, which are also vilified; being professionally inept, only succeeding temporarily or appearing to succeed through trickery or deception; participating in [...] "conspiracies" [...] against the correct leadership of the Party; cooperating with [...] "foreign countries" [...] (historically either the Soviet Union or the United States, depending on which is more threatening at the time); and, having numerous <b>negative</b> <b>traits,</b> such as opportunism or corruption.
