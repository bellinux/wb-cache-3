Samples of irrigation water, soil, and root and shoot parts of palak plants were analyzed to determine the concentration of heavy metals. Wastewater irrigation led to increases in the total and phytoavailable heavy-metal concentrations in the soil at all the sites. Heavy-metal concentrations in soil under wastewater irrigation were negatively and positively correlated with soil hydrogen potential (pH) and organic carbon (OC), respectively. The enrichment factor and metal pollution index were higher at wastewater-irrigated sites {{as compared to the}} clean water-irrigated ones. The study concludes that wastewater irrigation modified the physicochemical properties of the soil, leading to more availability of heavy metals in the soil and consequently to the plant...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a recent}} report nearly 42 per cent Indian kids are {{malnourished}} and stunted. The aim of our project was to develop nutraceutical products using alfalfa as one of the components to overcome undernourishment particularly among women and children. The seeds of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) contain more <b>nutritional</b> <b>property</b> when compared with other leguminous seeds. It contains 18. 9 % of protein when compared with egg (13. 1 %), milk (3. 3 %) and beef (16. 5 %). This paper reports the investigation results of phytochemical analysis of alfalfa seed extracts using the procedure of Sadasivam and Manickam (2009). The presence of proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, flavonoids etc. was observed in sprouted alfalfa seeds extracted by solvents such as ethanol, petroleum and chloroform. The presences of proteins, carbohydrates, saponins, alkaloids etc were confirmed by the present investigation.

40|$|The {{covalent}} cross-linking of vicilin-rich {{protein isolate}} from kidney bean (KPI) by microbial transglutraminase (MTGase; at an enzyme-substrate ratio of 5. 0 units per gram protein) {{was characterized by}} sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and size exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS). Effects of MTGase treatment on some functional properties and in vitro trypsin digestibility of KPI were evaluated. SDS-PAGE and SEC-MALLS analyses indicated that MTGase polymerized the vicilin component in KPI to form high molecular weight oligomers or biopolymers, and the cross-linking occurred among intermolecular and intramolecular subunits. MTGase treatment led to {{a significant decrease in}} total free SH content and an increase in surface hydrophobicity, suggesting unfolding of the vicilin molecules. Protein solubility, emulsifying activity index, and emulsion stability index of KPI were progressively decreased with increasing MTGase incubation time. Thermal stability and in vitro trypsin digestibility of the vicilin component were gradually and significantly increased. These results suggest that functional properties of vicilin-rich KPI could be negatively affected by the enzymatic cross-linking, while <b>nutritional</b> <b>property</b> might be markedly enhanced. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The heat-induced {{aggregation}} and the {{in vitro}} digestibility of vicilin-rich protein isolates from three Phaseolus legumes, including kidney bean, red bean and mung bean were investigated and compared, and their amino acid composition and free sulfhydryl (SH) group contents also evaluated. The {{results showed that}} the extent in the heat-induced aggregation varied with the type of the protein isolates, and the formation of new disulphide bonds (at the expense of free SH contents) was involved {{in the formation of the}} aggregates. The protein isolates with higher levels of hydrophobic and uncharged polar amino acids, and lower basic amino acid contents exhibited lower extent of their heat-induced aggregation. The in vitro pepsin plus trypsin digestibility was different for various native protein isolates. The digestibility was to a varying extent affected by the heat treatment. The influences of heating on the digestibility of these proteins were closely related to the extent of their heat-induced aggregation. The results suggest that the improvement of <b>nutritional</b> <b>property</b> of those vicilin-rich protein isolates by heat treatment is largely dependent upon their amino acid composition as well as the extent of heat-induced aggregation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} retention of essential amino acid profiles of products during the extrusion of proteins and reducing sugars. Animal proteins (egg and milk protein at 10 and 30 % levels) and reducing sugars (fructose and galactose at 0, 2, and 8 % levels), with pregelatinized wheat flour, were extruded at 110 and 125 °C product temperatures and feed moistures of 19 and 23. 5 % for egg protein and 13. 75 and 16 % for milk protein. The <b>nutritional</b> <b>property</b> analyzed was essential amino acid retention, and sugar retention was also considered to understand the relationship of sugars with retention of amino acids. Lysine showed the lowest retention (up to 40 %) of all the essential amino acids. Retention of other essential amino acids varied from 80 to 100 % in most situations. Apart from lysine,  tryptophan, threonine, and methionine {{were found to be}} significantly changed (P < 0. 05) with processing conditions. Increased protein and sugar levels resulted in a significant degradation of lysine. Greater lysine retention was found at a lower temperature and higher feed moisture. Results of sugar retention also showed similar patterns. The products made from fructose had greater lysine retention than products made from galactose with any type of protein. The outcomes of this research suggested that the combination of milk protein and fructose at a lower temperature and higher feed moisture is most favorable for developing high-protein extruded products. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} potential (AP) is {{an important}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>property</b> of foods, as increased oxidative stress is involved in most diet-related chronic diseases. In dairy products, the protein fraction contains antioxidant activity, especially casein. Other antioxidants include: antioxidant enzymes; lactoferrin; conjugated linoleic acid; coenzyme Q 10; vitamins C, E, A and D 3; equol; uric acid; carotenoids; and mineral activators of antioxidant enzymes. The AP of dairy products has been extensively studied in vitro, with few studies in animals and human subjects. Available in vivo studies greatly differ in their design and objectives. Overall, on a 100 g fresh weight-basis, AP of dairy products is close to that of grain-based foods and vegetable or fruit juices. Among dairy products, cheeses present the highest AP due to their higher protein content. AP of milk increases during digestion by up to 2. 5 times because of released antioxidant peptides. AP of casein is linked to specific amino acids, whereas beta-lactoglobulin thiol groups {{play a major role}} in the AP of whey. Thermal treatments such as ultra-high temperature processing have no clear effect on the AP of milk. Raw fat-rich milks have higher AP than less fat-rich milk, because of lipophilic antioxidants. Probiotic yoghurts and fermented milks have higher AP than conventional yoghurt and milk because proteolysis by probiotics releases antioxidant peptides. Among the probiotics, Lactobacillus casei/acidophilus leads to the highest AP. The data are insufficient for cheese, but fermentation-based changes appear to make a positive impact on AP. In conclusion, AP might participate in the reported dairy product-protective effects against some chronic diseases...|$|R

This study focused on bioactive milk polar lipids (PLs) recoveredfrom dietary sources that are of increasing interest. The chemical compositions of buttermilks and butterserums were determined and the modulation of the fatty acid composition of milk PLs was investigated. Butterserums contain a higher amount of milk PLs than buttermilks (88 vs. 13 – 18 g/kg dry matter), with a higherproportion of sphingomyelin (34 vs. 19 % of PLs, respectively) interestingly close to human milk PL profile. Butter serums are also interesting sources of choline, an important nutrient for infant brain development.
