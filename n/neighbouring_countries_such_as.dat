Nonetheless, the PLO and other Palestinian organisations have historically made great efforts to install institutions commonly associated with states in the Palestinian territories as well as in countries with large numbers of Palestinian residents. Examples include Jordan after the Six-Day War, where the installation of parallel structures of power and mechanisms for taxation and education led to largely independent Palestinian enclaves which formed a threat to the power and legitimacy of the monarchy, and Lebanon, where a similar process exacerbated ethnic and religious tensions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{secondary}} school mathematics curriculum of Turkey and Indonesia with respect to the paradigm embedded into them.

Methodologically, this is a comparative study with qualitative approaches. The main data collection tools are the curricula and mathematics textbooks of both countries so that document analysis is the methodological technique to be utilised in this research. The data is analysed by coding and presented by descriptive statistics. In the implementation of education system in both countries, Turkey and Indonesia have run into paradigm transformation which started from behaviourist and then changed to constructivist since 2005 and 2007 respectively. It seems the paradigm in two countries shifted from what to teach to how to teach, however the problem is preparedness for the policies and the related situations. We argue that Turkish and Indonesian governments may use the similarities and differences in the comparison for the sake of the need for improving the quality of education in the two countries...|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{situation}} of Palestinian refugees is still relevant till this day. There are around five million refugees living in <b>neighbouring</b> Arab <b>countries,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Egypt, as well as neighbouring areas in Palestine itself, like the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under very precarious conditions. Their situation is extremely unstable as any changes in the region can influence them directly. The need {{to address this issue}} is particularly important because Palestinian refugees (as well as internally displaced Palestinians) have been both historically and politically marginalised. In particular, I will argue for a need to gender the debate around the Palestinian refugees, because the distinct experience of women Palestinian refugees has been overlooked within this context. Most literature has focused on the Palestinian refugees as a holistic population, which assumes all refugees share the same struggle. However, understanding the position of women {{within the context of the}} refugees and the unique struggles they face is essential to understanding their particular experiences as refugees and in highlighting their differential needs; this is why a feminist perspective is needed within the field of refugee studies. This article is based on a feminist journey drawing on research interviews with female Palestinian refugees in camps in Jordan, and with Syrian Palestinian women in Turkey, Jordan and Europe. </p...|$|R

25|$|René {{has been}} viewed as {{a prime example of}} a benevolent dictator, leading his country {{to the point of being}} the most {{developed}} country in Africa— as measured by the Human Development Index— and helping build one of the continent's highest gross domestic products per capita. His supporters believe that he had solid social priorities, including his government's extensive funding of education, health care and the environment. Critical indicators, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> infant mortality, literacy rate, and economic well-being, are among the best in the continent. During his rule, the Seychelles avoided the volatile political climate and underdevelopment in <b>neighbouring</b> island <b>countries</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Comoros and Madagascar. His critics believe that he and his party are responsible for torture and other human rights abuses involving opponents of the government, allegedly including the death of a prominent dissident in London, Gérard Hoarau. After the 1977 coup, a significant portion of the population, including the deposed President Mancham, fled to the UK and South Africa due to political persecution and fear of the new government's alignment with the Soviet Union, Tanzania and North Korea. René also faced international pressure regarding his government's former requirement that all applicants to the country's secondary education system graduate a compulsory National Youth Service, which included traditional curricula, political education and, according to some critics, ideological indoctrination and paramilitary training. This requirement was abandoned after the transition to multiparty rule and the organisation was eventually abolished entirely. Critics of the René regime also call out perceived corruption and cronyism in his term.|$|R
