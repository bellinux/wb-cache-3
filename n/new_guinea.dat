5|$|On 12April 1944, Savige's ICorps {{headquarters}} {{moved up}} from Queensland to relieve that of Berryman’s IICorps at Finschhafen. The two staffs {{had hoped to}} exchange office equipment, thus saving on shipping, but Advanced LHQ ordered that each should move with all its stores. Instead, the designations of the two corps were exchanged, so that ICorps was still the corps in Australia and IICorps the one in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> On 20April, IICorps was ordered to assume the designation and function of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force and the existing headquarters of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force in Port Moresby was broken up. Savige therefore assumed command of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force, his new headquarters opening at Lae on 6May. At this time, no major combat operations were taking place and activities were winding down in Australian <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force's main role was rolling up the base installations and shipping units back to Australia. On 9 September 1944, MacArthur discarded the task force organisation. Henceforth the US Sixth Army and Eighth Army and Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee’s First Army reported directly to him. First Army headquarters arrived at Lae on 1October and assumed control of Australian troops in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> At midnight, <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force was discontinued, and Savige's headquarters became IICorps once more.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1943, Mackay {{once again}} assumed command of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force. This time, {{important}} operations were being {{undertaken in the}} Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay {{should have been more}} forceful, and should have enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Mackay left <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> in November 1943, handing over command of <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Force.|$|E

5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> {{crocodile}} {{was first}} {{described by the}} American herpetologist Karl Patterson Schmidt in 1928 as Crocodylus novaeguineae. At one time {{it was thought that}} there were two subspecies, C. n. novaeguineae, the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> crocodile native to Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> and Western <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> and C. n. mindorensis, the Philippine crocodile, native to several islands including Busuanga, Luzon, Masbate, Mindoro, Negros, Samar and Mindanao. Most authorities now consider that the Philippine crocodile is an entirely separate species. DNA sequencing data reported in 2011 showed that the Philippine crocodile is, in part, paraphyletic with regard to the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> crocodile, and that the latter may constitutes a population within the Philippine crocodile. Among their two samples for the <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> crocodile, one was part of the Philippine crocodile clade and the other was separate, estimated to have diverged 2.6–6.8 million years ago. Both samples were taken from captives (could potentially be misidentified or hybrids) and the result should therefore be treated with caution.|$|E

5|$|Detzner {{may have}} made {{attempts}} to reach West <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> which was then neutral Dutch <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> but his claims {{to have been the}} first outsider to enter the Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> highlands can be discounted. In 1915, and again in 1917, Detzner and some of his men tried to escape along the coast in two canoes. In 1917, they reached the vicinity of Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, which today is Madang. There lay anchored the Australian ship, HMAS Una, which earlier had been the German imperial yacht, the , designated for use by the German governor of the colony. The ship blocked any further travel, and ended any notions they had of a water escape to Dutch <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> On this escape attempt, Detzner also learned the Australians had orders to shoot him on sight. He made one further attempt to escape overland to Dutch <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> but had to be carried back suffering from an internal hemorrhage. He spent the remainder of the time investigating the island's inhabitants and its flora and fauna, particularly in the Huon peninsula and Huon gulf.|$|E

5|$|In mid-November, Allied forces {{attacked}} the Japanese at Buna-Gona in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> Japanese Combined Fleet naval leaders, headquartered at Truk {{and under the}} overall command of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, felt Allied advances in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> posed a greater threat {{to the security of}} the Japanese Empire than an Allied military presence in the southern Solomons. Therefore, Combined Fleet naval staff officers began to prepare plans for abandoning Guadalcanal and shifting priorities and resources to operations around <b>New</b> <b>Guinea.</b> At this time, the navy did not inform the army of their intentions in this regard.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, Burnet was a {{chairman}} of the Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. He was particularly interested in kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.|$|E

5|$|No. 71 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World WarII. It {{was formed}} in February 1943 at Milne Bay, Papua <b>New</b> <b>Guinea,</b> as part of No.9 Operational Group.

The wing's mainstay soon became the Beaufort, which eventually equipped five squadrons attached to the formation. No.71 Wing {{took part in the}} <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> campaign under the auspices of No.9 Group, before transferring to No.10 Operational Group for the Western <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> campaign during 1944. It then returned to the control of Northern Command (formerly No.9 Group) to support Australian ground forces in the Aitape–Wewak campaign, and completed its final combat mission only hours before the Japanese surrender in August 1945. No.71 Wing remained in <b>New</b> <b>Guinea</b> following the war and was disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
