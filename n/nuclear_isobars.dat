40|$|In this report, we briefly {{examine the}} current status of the study of the chiral {{magnetic}} effect including theory and experimental progress. We recommend future strategies for resolving uncertainties in interpretation including recommendations for theoretical work, recommendations for measurements based on data collected in the past five years, and recommendations for beam use in the coming years of RHIC. We have specifically investigated the case for colliding <b>nuclear</b> <b>isobars</b> (nuclei with the same mass but different charge) and find the case compelling. We recommend that a program of nuclear isobar collisions to isolate the chiral magnetic effect from background sources be placed as a high priority item in the strategy for completing the RHIC mission.

40|$|Introduction Since the {{beginning}} of nuclear physics, when {{the existence of the}} atomic nucleus was deduced by Rutherford from the famous experiments of ff-particle scattering on a gold foil by Geiger and Marsden up to the deep inelastic scattering experiments at Stanford by Friedman, Kendall and Taylor revealing the parton substructure of nucleons, the electromagnetic probe has always played an outstanding role in the study of nucleon and nuclear structure 1. One of the major goals of present day research in this field is to clarify the role of subnuclear degrees of freedom (d. o. f.) in the structure of nuclei as well as their relation to the underlying quark-gluon dynamics of QCD. In this talk I will concentrate on the manifestation of of meson and isobar degrees of freedom in electromagnetic processes where they contribute as two-body meson exchange currents (MEC) and via <b>nuclear</b> <b>isobar</b> configurations (IC). The latter are nuclear wave functio...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a nuclear interaction in chiral {{effective field theory}} with explicit inclusion of the delta-isobar degree of freedom at all orders up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We use pion-nucleon low-energy constants (LECs) from a Roy-Steiner analysis of pion-nucleon scattering data, optimize the LECs in the contact potentials up to NNLO to reproduce low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, and constrain the three-nucleon interaction at NNLO to reproduce the binding energy and point-proton radius of 4 He. Coupled-cluster calculations of doubly-magic nuclei up to 48 Ca exhibit accurate radii and much-improved binding energies compared to interactions without delta <b>isobars.</b> <b>Nuclear</b> matter saturates close to the empirical saturation point, and its symmetry energy is consistent with empirical estimates.
