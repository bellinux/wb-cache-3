500|$|Like many of They Might Be Giants' early releases, Flood {{features}} {{a range of}} stylistic eclecticism. The press release for the album notes the [...] "rock rave-up 'Twisting'... the [...] inflected 'Lucky Ball & Chain'... the existential oom-pah of 'Particle Man'", and [...] "tender <b>night-light</b> metaphor and melody" [...] of the lead single, [...] "Birdhouse in Your Soul". Jon Pareles wrote for The New York Times that the album [...] "shrug off most typecasting". He added that through releases like Flood, They Might Be Giants and {{a new wave of}} alternative musicians were gainsaying the standard practice of sticking to only one genre.|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} the urban heat island may be overstated. One study stated, [...] "Contrary to {{generally}} accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of urbanization {{could be found in}} annual temperatures." [...] This was done by using satellite-based <b>night-light</b> detection of urban areas, and more thorough homogenisation of the time series (with corrections, for example, for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation, and thus cooler, than urban areas). If its conclusion is accepted, then it is necessary to [...] "unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban in situ stations could show no contamination from urban warming." [...] The main conclusion is that microscale and local-scale impacts dominate the mesoscale impact of the urban heat island. Many sections of towns may be warmer than rural sites, but surface weather observations are likely to be made in park [...] "cool islands." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was always}} glad of the <b>night-light.</b> A germ hates light, preferring {{to do his}} scoundrelly work when it is so black that you can't see your {{hand in front of}} your face and the {{darkness}} presses down on you like a blanket. Occasionally a fear would cross his mind that the <b>night-light</b> might go out; but it never did, being one of Mr. Edison's best electric efforts neatly draped with black veiling.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} after Mr. and Mrs. Darling {{left the house}} the <b>night-lights</b> by the beds of the three {{children}} continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little <b>night-lights,</b> and one cannot help wishing {{that they could have}} kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.|$|R

6000|$|And now Richards and Cox were hurrying {{through the}} deserted streets, from {{opposite}} directions. They met, panting, {{at the foot}} of the printing-office stairs; by the <b>night-light</b> there they read each other's face. Cox whispered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} come from there--I could not stay. Something has {{occurred}} to my mind about this affair.' His strangely marked visage, now more noticeable from being worn with fatigue, had a spectral effect by the <b>night-light.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>night-lighting</b> {{brings out}} the {{architectural}} complexity of the site within an urban context. The illumination was designed by Sylvie Sieg and Pierre Nègre of the Atelier Lumière and won the Light Originator Price of the Lumiville Trophy 2007.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Mrs. Darling {{had put the}} children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their <b>night-lights.</b> They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, 'It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,' but Wendy was wiser.|$|R
50|$|This {{expansive}} park {{features a}} spacious community center, <b>night-lighted</b> basketball and volleyball courts, softball and soccer fields, skate park, six group picnic sites available for reservation, a disc golf course, a tennis center, an 18-hole golf course, playground equipment, and multiple duck ponds.|$|R
60|$|The {{household}} came to bed, the <b>night-light</b> was lit, {{the dormitory}} hushed. Sleep soon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy supremacy: contented sovereign over heads and hearts {{which did not}} ache--he passed by the unquiet.|$|E
6000|$|... "When are {{you coming}} to bed?" [...] he always replied, very brave but in a whisper, as if he feared the bears and wolves might have him. When little boys are in bed there is nothing between them and bears and wolves but the <b>night-light.</b>|$|E
60|$|Only a <b>night-light</b> {{was burning}} there. Mrs Fyne raised her up, took {{her over to}} Mr Fyne's little dressing-room {{on the other side}} of the landing, to a fire by which she could dry herself, and left her there. She had to go back to her guests.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>night-lighting</b> {{technique}} is routinely used to catch birds. We improved this technique using a thermal infrared camera to catch steppe birds {{such as the}} sandgrouse. Target birds were located by an observer using the thermal camera, and approached and dazzled by another observer carrying a spotlight attached to a helmet and a hand-held net together with a playback noise to camouflage {{the footsteps of the}} observer. Using this improved technique, we caught on average 1. 14 individuals per 3 -h capture session ([*]=[*] 81) and a total of 92 sandgrouse in 2007 - 2010 (86 pin-tailed sandgrouse and six black-bellied sandgrouse). Capture rate and success were negatively influenced by moonlight (lowest during full moon nights). Our <b>night-lighting</b> {{technique is}} a highly selective and harmless method to capture sandgrouse and can be used for other small/medium-sized open-land birds or mammals...|$|R
50|$|The ground {{features}} a small old grandstand of approximately 1−2000 capacity, with an encircling grassy hill. There are bricked up ticket windows and rundown, closed public toilets. There are <b>night-lights</b> that provide adequate lighting for training purposes only.

6000|$|I {{could just}} see her, by the dim <b>night-light</b> burning in a cornet to enable the surgeon or the nurse {{to find their way}} to her.

60|$|You {{will have}} for a <b>night-light</b> in the room we shall give you, the North Foreland lighthouse. That and the sea and air are our only lions. It is a very rough little place, but a very {{pleasant}} one, and you will make it pleasanter than ever to me.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless she {{was almost}} frightened to advance, for the big dark shadow right across the stuccoed wall awed her by its mysterious blackness.

50|$|We {{go through}} life with dark forces within us and around us, haunted by the ghosts of repudiated terrors and embarrassments, assailed by devils, but we are also {{continually}} guided by invisible hands; our darkness is lit by many little flames, from <b>night-lights</b> to the stars. Those who are afraid to look into their own hearts know nothing of the light that shines in the darkness.|$|R
5000|$|Doris Duke {{continued}} her involvement with her gardens throughout her life, bringing designers {{with her to}} modify them during the summer season when they were closed to tourists. In the 1970s she added extensive <b>night-lighting,</b> and introduced public tours of the gardens at night. A rediscovered image of the [...] "stunning nightlighting of the French Gardens" [...] https://www.flickr.com/photos/femme_makita/2513492712/ was used as one centerpiece of social protest against the closure.|$|R
60|$|Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest {{and most}} compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious {{distances}} between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.

That is why there are <b>night-lights.</b>|$|R
60|$|Noel {{went up to}} the nursery, {{and stole}} in. A <b>night-light</b> was burning, Nurse and baby were fast asleep. She tiptoed through into her own room.

6000|$|The Rev. D. W. G. Gwynne, M.D., was a {{physician}} in holy orders. In 1853 he lived at P--- House, near Taunton, where {{both he and}} his wife [...] "were made uncomfortable by auditory experiences to which they could find no clue," [...] or, in common English, they heard mysterious noises. [...] "During the night," [...] writes Dr. Gwynne, [...] "I became aware of a draped figure passing across {{the foot of the bed}} towards the fireplace. I had the impression that the arm was raised, pointing with the hand towards the mantel-piece on which a <b>night-light</b> was burning. Mrs. Gwynne at the same moment seized my arm, and the light was extinguished! Notwithstanding, I distinctly saw the figure returning towards the door, and being under the impression that one of the servants had found her way into our room, I leaped out of bed to intercept the intruder, but found and saw nothing. I rushed to the door and endeavoured to follow the supposed intruder, and it was not until I found the door locked, as usual, that I was painfully impressed. I need hardly say that Mrs. Gwynne was in a very nervous state. She asked me what I had seen, and I told her. She had seen the same figure," [...] "but," [...] writes Mrs. Gwynne, [...] "I distinctly saw the hand of the figure placed over the <b>night-light,</b> which was at once extinguished". [...] "Mrs. Gwynne also heard the rustle of the 'tall man- like figure's' garments. In addition to the <b>night-light</b> there was moonlight in the room." ...|$|E
