5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. A swirl of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into a swirl of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. <b>No</b> <b>impact</b> was reported.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Danielle was {{the first}} of several Cape Verde-type {{hurricane}}s to form during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Danielle was the fourth named storm and third hurricane of the season. Danielle formed on August13, 2004 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean and remained over the central Atlantic, peaking as a strong Category 2 hurricane on August16. Reaching cooler waters, Danielle began to weaken, becoming a remnant low on August21 and dissipating on August24. Danielle never approached land, although it briefly threatened the Azores as it made a northerly turn. As a result, there was <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> caused by the storm.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the entire country at 0000UTC on October12. It was discontinued about nine hours later. The Government of Belize suspended school classes, as the buildings were being used as storm shelters. Voluntary evacuations were recommended for residents of the coastal cayes. A small craft warning was declared along the coast and advised marines to take precautions. At Punta Negra, the National Guard of Belize evacuated residents on October13.

5|$|In late September, three {{tropical}} disturbances moved westward {{across the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica then gradually weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. <b>No</b> <b>impact</b> was reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{was also}} {{unable to stop}} those who came to hear him speak from desecrating the Sabbath, and his Yiddish sermons had <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> on the younger generation. In addition, he {{had to contend with}} a number of obstacles: he had no {{administrative}} experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a stroke suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas had <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> as a {{tropical}} cyclone, and impact {{from the low}} that absorbed the storm was limited to rainfall, gusty winds, and rough surf. Nicholas extended the above-average levels of tropical cyclone activity throughout the 2003 season, {{and was one of}} fourteen seasons to reach fourteen storms. The low that absorbed the storm nearly developed into {{a tropical}} cyclone, which would have been called Odette. However, moderate wind shear prevented further development.|$|E

5|$|<b>No</b> <b>impact</b> was {{reported}} in the Florida Keys. Strong winds in southwestern Louisiana damaged crops and toppled windmills. Offshore, boats and schooners suffered severe damage from wind-driven waves. Severe damage occurred in eastern Texas, with strong winds and storm surge damaging or destroying numerous buildings, houses, and crops in several cities, including Beaumont, New Sabine Pass, Orange, Sabine Pass, and Port Arthur. The storm was considered the worst in Orange since 1875. Overall, the storm caused at least 29fatalities in Texas, with six died at Port Arthur, three offshore, four in Sabine Pass, and sixteen others at Beaumont. Damage in the state reached approximately $150,000.|$|E
5|$|Operation Gisela did {{not achieve}} its {{intended}} outcome. It did not deliver the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for {{and it did}} not disrupt British bombing operations.

One source referred to Gisela as the swansong of the German night fighter force. During the course of the operation, the last German aircraft to be brought down over British soil crashed.|$|E
5|$|Recent extinctions can be {{directly}} attributable to human influences. The IUCN characterizes 'recent' extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the Père David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> on the ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of gray whales in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The Vaishnava {{movement}} in the Kannada-speaking regions found momentum after {{the arrival of the}} philosopher Ramanujacharya (1017–1137). Fleeing possible persecution from the Chola King (who was a Shaiva), Ramanujacharya sought refuge initially in Tondanur and later moved to Melkote. But this event had <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> on Vaishnava literature in Hoysala lands at that time. However, the teachings of Madhvacharya (1238–1317), propounder of the Dvaita philosophy, did have a direct impact on Vaishnava literature, in both the Sanskrit and Kannada languages. This body of writings is known as haridasa sahitya (haridasa literature).|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{proposed that}} the municipality buy shares for NOK150,000. When the issue was debated in the municipal council on 9 June, it met with resistance from representatives from Tranby in the west of Lier, who stated that they felt that the railway would have <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> on them, and that the municipality should only buy shares for NOK75,000. It resulted in a compromise where the municipality bought shares for NOK100,000. A year later, the municipality purchased shares for an addition NOK30,000. The other major shareholders were Drammen Municipality with NOK30,000, Buskerud County Municipality with NOK50,000 and private investors, who supplied NOK174,050.|$|E
5|$|Thermus aquaticus is a {{bacterium}} {{found in the}} Yellowstone hot springs that produces an important enzyme (Taq polymerase) that is easily replicated in the lab and is useful in replicating DNA {{as part of the}} polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The retrieval of these bacteria can be achieved with <b>no</b> <b>impact</b> to the ecosystem. Other bacteria in the Yellowstone hot springs may also prove useful to scientists who are searching for cures for various diseases. In 2016, researchers from Uppsala University reported the discovery of a class of thermophiles, Hadesarchaea, in Yellowstone's Culex Basin. These organisms are capable of converting carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and oxygen.|$|E
