5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E

25|$|Turkey {{continues}} to systematically disregard Greek national sovereign territory by violating air and sea borders. In March 2015 the Turkish forces {{had intended to}} carry out a military exercise in the Aegean disrupting international air traffic, and restricted traffic around two Greek national airports. Turkey subsequently withdrew the earlier <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> (NOTAM) reserving an extensive area of air space over the Aegean from March 2 to December 31, 2015. The Greek government lodged complaints with NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, and the International Civil Aviation Authority over this flashpoint and NATO was thought to have played a role de-escalating.|$|E
25|$|Combat Talon II 85-0012 was {{severely}} damaged during a landing accident at Mosul, Iraq, on December 29, 2004. The 15th SOS aircraft {{was on a}} resupply mission and struck a repair trench dug into the runway while still at 80 knots, shearing off part of its landing gear and partially separating its left wing from the fuselage. The trench {{was part of a}} U.S. Army construction project and a <b>Notice</b> <b>To</b> <b>Airmen</b> (NOTAM) warning had not been filed by the airfield or disseminated to the aircrew, despite a safety hazard report filed in the week previous by another aircrew. No fatalities occurred but the aircraft was destroyed by explosive demolition to prevent its classified equipment from being compromised.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, Coventry Airport {{was put up}} for sale. The owners {{outsourced}} security, {{and also}} air traffic control to Marshall Aerospace. On 1 December 2009, {{it was reported that}} a petition was made by HM Revenue & Customs in the High Court to wind up the company, to the concern of local businesses. A hearing was due to take place at London’s Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, 9 December 2009. On 8 December 2009, the CAA closed the airport with immediate effect, issuing a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> announcing the withdrawing of its operating licence. All commercial flying and flight training was suspended, although the Warwickshire & Northamptonshire Air Ambulance continued to use the airport as a base. The airport re-opened as an unlicensed airfield the following week, without air traffic control, to private traffic.|$|E

25|$|Waterlogging {{during the}} monsoon {{and the absence}} of proper runways for monsoon take-offs were serious {{drawbacks}} for Juhu aerodrome. The former problem was addressed by replacement of the bitumen runways with concrete runways in 1937, while proper runways, night flying facilities, hangars, etc. were provided in the following year. At least two airlines were based out of Juhu during this period; Air Services of India, Ltd. and Tata Sons, Ltd. The airport served as the city's sole airport till Santacruz airport, now Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA), was built in 1948. Santacruz airport is within a 2km radius of Juhu aerodrome and this proximity of the two airports often caused confusion among pilots, leading to a permanent <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>airmen</b> being issued by the Airports Authority of India cautioning that Santacruz's runway 09/27 {{should not be confused with}} runway 08/26 at Juhu. Juhu Aerodrome continued to be used however, such as by then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1948 as well as by the ailing Vallabhbhai Patel (then Deputy Prime Minister) who landed at Juhu in December 1950 to avoid large crowds that had gathered at Santacruz Airport to greet him.|$|E
25|$|At 14:34, {{the captain}} called Le Bourget {{and gave his}} E.T.A. as 14:40, with an {{endurance}} of only 45 minutes. At 14:45, Le Bourget suggested that the aircraft land at Cormeilles. Le Bourget had a thunderstorm at the time. The aircraft was not carrying any information about Cormeilles, although BOAC had been informed of the airfield's suitability as an alternative landing site in the Paris area in a translation of a French <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>airmen</b> dated 21 October 1946. The radio operator was unable to raise Cormeilles by radio, partly because he was using the wrong callsign of HTU (Morse ···· — ··— ·—) instead of HXA (Morse ···· — ··— ·). Cormeilles was handling a de Havilland Dragon Rapide at the time, and could only handle one aircraft at a time by radio. The Dragon Rapide was G-AGWC, which was on a flight from Basle Airport, Switzerland and was also short of fuel. At 15:07, Cormeilles tried {{to make contact with}} the aircraft. At 15:14, contact was established and the captain erroneously stated that his endurance was five minutes. At 15:15, a Q.D.M. was asked for from Cormeilles, which was given as 219°. Cormeilles reported that the Q.S.A. was 1. The report concluded that the aircraft had set course for England at or shortly after 15:00.|$|E

The aerial lighthouse at Saint-Inglevert was in operation again by 11 April, when a test flight was flown at night on the British part of the London – Paris air route. The aircraft flew as far as Saint-Inglevert before turning back and landing at Lympne, Kent.

500|$|The Anchorage VOR beacon was not {{operational}} because of maintenance. The crew received a NOTAM (<b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen)</b> of this fact, {{which was not}} seen as a problem, as the captain could still check his position at the next VORTAC beacon at Bethel, [...] away. The aircraft was required to maintain the assigned heading of 220 degrees, until it could receive the signals from Bethel, then it could fly direct to Bethel, as instructed by ATC, by centering the VOR [...] "to" [...] course deviation indicator (CDI) and then engaging the auto pilot in the VOR/LOC mode. Then, when over the Bethel beacon, the flight could start using INS mode to follow the waypoints that make up route Romeo-20 around {{the coast of the}} U.S.S.R. to Seoul. The INS mode was necessary for this route, since after Bethel the plane would be mostly out of range from VOR stations.|$|E
500|$|In January 1922, a [...] high mast for an {{anemometer}} {{was being}} erected {{at the south}} west corner of Lympne Aerodrome. On 13 February, the system of ground signals at Lympne was further extended to include information about the Saint-Inglevert Airfield, just across the English Channel in France. In July, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> said that all aircraft were to make at least one left-hand circuit before landing at Lympne. By November, the Instone Air Line were operating a service from Croydon to Cologne using de Havilland DH.18 aircraft, stopping at Lympne to refuel to full capacity. These aircraft then had the necessary range to fly direct from Lympne to Cologne. This arrangement did not last long, with the refuelling stop moved to Tirlemont, Belgium, {{by the end of}} the month. On 30 December a Dornier aircraft landed at Lympne.

500|$|It was {{notified}} {{that the road}} forming the eastern boundary of the airfield was to be marked {{by a series of}} posts [...] high, surmounted by vertical white discs [...] in diameter, in January 1921, and the following month, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> issued in the United Kingdom stated that radio communication with Saint-Inglevert was to be in French. As part of a series of trials to assess the viability of civil aviation in France, a Farman F.60 Goliath flew a [...] test flight carrying [...] of cargo on 1 May. Three laps of a circuit Paris – Orléans – Rouen – Saint-Inglevert – Metz – Dijon – Paris were flown. Saint-Inglevert was one of the designated landing places for the 1921 Coupe Michelin, an aerial circuit of France with a ₣20,000 prize. In November, a Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes aircraft called at Saint-Inglevert to collect a cargo of six 18-pounder and three 4.5–inch live shells for onward transmission to Croydon Airport in Surrey, United Kingdom. In a paper read to the Royal Aeronautical Society on 17 November, Colonel Frank Searle, managing director of Daimler Airway, criticized the organization of Saint-Inglevert and Le Bourget.|$|E
500|$|The North Sea Aerial and General Transport Co. used a Blackburn Kangaroo on its {{short-lived}} Leeds-Lympne-Amsterdam {{service from}} 6 March 1920. The customs facilities at New Holland had been withdrawn on 28 January, necessitating the roundabout route. It was {{estimated that the}} extra costs involved in taking this route amounted to one-third of the total costs. Flight called for customs facilities to be established to enable direct flights to be made from the north of England to the continent. Starting from 2 August, hourly weather forecasts were broadcast from Lympne and other airfields. A system of ground signals advising pilots of the weather conditions at Biggin Hill and Croydon was also introduced about this time. During August, Aircraft Transport and Travel took over air mail flights, using DH.9A aircraft. In November a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> was released announcing that searchlights would be in use at Lympne for two hours after sunset to assist pilots in landing their aircraft. Arrangements could be made in advance for this facility to be made available after the notified hours. In December, {{it was announced that}} an [...] "aerial lighthouse" [...] was to be installed at Lympne as the one installed at Croydon had proved to be of benefit to pilots arriving after dark.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, an {{airfield}} {{was established}} at Saint-Inglevert {{on a different}} site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed {{over the years to}} include two hangars, customs facilities and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a <b>Notice</b> <b>to</b> <b>Airmen</b> was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of ground signals at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A [...] arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a windsock and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{navigation}} is deciding where one wishes to go. A private pilot planning a flight under VFR will usually use an aeronautical chart of the area which is published specifically {{for the use of}} pilots. This map will depict controlled airspace, radio navigation aids and airfields prominently, as well as hazards to flying such as mountains, tall radio masts, etc. It also includes sufficient ground detail - towns, roads, wooded areas - to aid visual navigation. In the UK, the CAA publishes a series of maps covering the whole of the UK at various scales, updated annually. The information is also updated in the <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>airmen,</b> or NOTAMs.|$|R
50|$|The precise {{services}} offered by stations vary by country, but typical FSS services may include providing preflight briefings including weather and <b>notices</b> <b>to</b> <b>airmen</b> (NOTAMs); filing, opening, and closing flight plans; monitoring navigational aids (NAVAIDs); collecting and disseminating pilot reports (PIREPs) and airport surface weather observations; offering traffic advisories to aircraft {{on the ground}} or in flight; relaying instructions or clearances from air traffic control; relaying information from or about airborne aircraft to their home bases, military bases or homeland security, providing weather advisories to aircraft inflight, initiating search and rescue on missing VFR aircraft, and providing assistance in an emergency. In many countries, flight service stations also operate at mandatory frequency airports to help co-ordinate traffic in the absence of air traffic controllers, and may take over a control tower frequency at a controlled airport when the tower is closed.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} enumerates {{interventions to}} reduce the frequency of restricted airspace violations, particularly those associated with temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) and air defense identification zones (ADIZs), by more effectively providing pilots with the information necessary to avoid such violations.
