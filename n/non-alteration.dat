40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{signature}} scheme in which the ability to sign messages of a signer is limited to a fixed number k of signatures. It is an identity-based signature schemein whicheach signature canbe usedonly once. We called suchschemes "bounded life-span". It is based on mental games and it uses zero-knowledge tools. A validation center is needed to initialize this identity-based scheme. A credential center is used to insure the unicity and the bounded life-span aspects. It allows delegation and numerous practical applications. 1 Introduction There are a lot of situations where the receiver of a message needs assurances concerning its <b>non-alteration</b> (accidental or voluntary), i. e. the authenticity (integrity) of the message and of its origin. The sender must be able to "sign" a message in such a way that any alteration of the message will be immediately revealed by the "signature". Furthermore, if the signature cannot be forged then this will also authentic [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProgressive {{microcracking}} in brittle or quasi-brittle materials, {{as described}} by damage models, presents a softening behavior that in turn {{requires the use of}} regularization methods in order to maintain objective results. Such regularization methods, which describe interactions between points, provide some general properties (including objectivity and the <b>non-alteration</b> of a uniform field) as well as drawbacks (damage initiation, free boundary). A modification of the nonlocal integral regularization method that takes the stress state into account is proposed in this contribution. The orientation and intensity of nonlocal interactions are modified in accordance with the stress state. The fundamental framework of the original nonlocal method has been retained, making it possible to maintain the method’s advantages. The modification is introduced through the weight function, which in this modified version depends not only on the distance between two points (as for the original model) but also on the stress state at the remote point. The efficiency of this novel approach is illustrated using several examples. The proposed modification improves the numerical solution of problems observed in numerical simulations involving regularization techniques. Damage initiation and propagation in mode I as well as shear band formation are analyzed herein...|$|E
30|$|The <b>non-alteration</b> in peak jumping force {{during the}} two-legged jumping {{maneuvers}} {{can be explained}} by the submaximal nature of these maneuvers. Peak force as a multiple of body weight per leg during CMJ was half the relative peak force during m 1 LH. Thus, our results implicates that the submaximal force measured during CMJ can be maintained even under fatigued conditions. Accordingly, total impulse also remained constant. Although the sum of all impulses remained constant, I 2 (positive impulse) as well as I 1 and I 3 (negative impulses) were reduced. A clearly reduced countermovement magnitude (data not shown) led to a shorter and smaller I 1 and caused thereby the less steep rise of the force curve. Decreases in peak power and peak velocity could be detected during CMJ but not SJ. This specificity could be attributed to the different power production modes associated with the two distinct jumping maneuvers (stretch-shortening cycle vs. shortening muscle action). Therefore, we assume that the type of power production during the competition was responsible for the fatigue after the marathon, while the other type of power production was not influenced. Our finding coincides with the results of Petersen et al. (2007), who showed in highly trained runners that mean concentric power during CMJ was reduced after fatiguing exercise.|$|E
40|$|The goal {{set by the}} EU of quasi-zero energy {{buildings}} is {{not easy}} to reach for a country like Italy, as it holds a wide number of UNESCO sites {{and most of them are}} entire historical old towns. This paper focuses on the problem of the improvement of energy performance of historical Italian architecture through simple interventions that respect the building without changing its shape and structure. The work starts from an energy analysis of a building located in the historic center of Tivoli, a town close to Rome. The analysis follows the recommendations of the UNI TS 11300 -Part 1, which indicates how to evaluate the energy consumptions. The calculations were performed only on the building envelope, based on passive solutions and alternatives. Four passive strategies were examined and applied based on the location of the building and the <b>non-alteration</b> of the structure and the landscape. The obtained results impacted positively on the energy performance of the building: the annual energy saving reached a maximum value of 25 %. This work shows how it is possible to improve the energy performance of an existing building achieving a significant energy saving with the respect of the building architecture, shape, function and the surrounding landscape...|$|E
40|$|International {{efforts to}} address climate change by {{reducing}} tropical deforestation increasingly rely on indigenous reserves as conservation units and indigenous peoples as strategic partners. Considered win-win situations where global conservation measures also contribute to cultural preservation, such alliances also frame indigenous peoples in diverse ecological settings with the responsibility to offset global carbon budgets through fire suppression based on the presumed positive value of <b>non-alteration</b> of tropical landscapes. Anthropogenic fire associated with indigenous ceremonial and collective hunting practices in the Neotropical savannas (cerrado) of Central Brazil is routinely represented in public and scientific conservation discourse {{as a cause of}} deforestation and increased CO 2 emissions despite a lack of supporting evidence. We evaluate this claim for the Xavante people of Pimentel Barbosa Indigenous Reserve, Brazil. Building upon 23 years of longitudinal interdisciplinary research in the area, we used multi-temporal spatial analyses to compare land cover change under indigenous and agribusiness management over the last four decades (1973 – 2010) and quantify the contemporary Xavante burning regime contributing to observed patterns based on a four year sample {{at the end of this}} sequence (2007 – 2010). The overall proportion of deforested land remained stable inside the reserve (0. 6 %) but increased sharply outside (1. 5 % to 26. 0 %). Vegetation recovery occurred where reserve boundary adjustments transferred lands previously deforested by agribusiness to indigenous management. Periodic traditional burning by the Xavante had a larg...|$|E
30|$|The rodents {{were fed}} with diet {{comprising}} of products made of soy and corn, {{equivalent to a}} herbivorous diet. Identical animal feed was maintained throughout the study without the change of vendor or food variant, and the <b>non-alteration</b> of diet preserves the condition in the gut favoring the dominant E. coli strain (Blyton et al. 2013). Introduction of different diets would disturb the gut ecosystem leading to the colonization of a different E. coli strain (Grønvold et al. 2010). Sexually mature healthy rodents (Kempermann et al. 1997; Sengupta 2013) were selected because the dominant commensal E. coli strains would have successfully established stable colonization in the gut flora (Tenaillon et al. 2010) and good health ensured no shifting of host physiological condition (Grønvold et al. 2010), possibly displacing dominant E. coli strains in unhealthy animals. The isolation of commensal E. coli only from females in {{this study suggests that}} host gender could influence the distribution of E. coli and this was similar to human E. coli strains (Gordon et al. 2005), even though the number of rodent strains in this study was relatively small to draw a definite conclusion. In terms of the gut anatomy, E. coli is inclined to flourish in hosts (herbivores and omnivores) with intestinal tracts resembling a microbial fermentation chamber such as a caecum (Gordon and Cowling 2003; Gordon et al. 2005) and all rodents possess a caecum (Gordon and Cowling 2003). In addition, the likelihood of isolating E. coli increases with the body mass of animals (Gordon et al. 2005). This was not the case in our study however, where smaller mice contributed to > 80  % (11 / 13) of the isolated commensal E. coli strains.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT What is Transformative? An Explanatory Synthesis of the Convergence of Transformation and Predominant Purpose in Copyright Fair Use Law The {{transformative}} {{test has}} risen {{to the top of}} the agenda of the copyright academic community with no less than two major studies of copyright fair use and the impact of the transformative test released in 2011 by Professors Matthew Sag and Neil Netanel that follow up on three recent comprehensive studies of copyright fair use published since 2008. The lessons learned from these two 2011 statistical studies are significant, in that both studies confirm the importance of the transformative test in terms of its application by the courts as the dominant test of fair use and in the observation that a finding of transformation in a copyright fair use claim virtually assures a finding that the use is fair. Nevertheless, the two studies and those that preceded them have not made an empirical study of the entire body of appellate law on transformation with the specific intent of demonstrating the meaning and operation of the term “transformative”—in other words, how the term works—illustrated by a synthesis of the data set of appellate cases. This article seeks to address that need. This article analyzes the entire body of United States Supreme Court and United States Courts of Appeals case law applying the transformative test in copyright fair uses cases to present two points: first, that the transformative test modifies the first sentence (sometimes referred to as the preamble) of 17 U. S. C. § 107 —in particular, the terms, “the fair use of a copyrighted work”—rather than simply factor one of the four factor test. Second, the implementation of the transformative test by the courts indicates that the courts are to consider transformations in the content, context, and the predominant purpose of the original work and whether the alleged fair use changes the content, context, or predominant purpose in a manner that furthers the public policies reflected in the first sentence of section 107, namely the furtherance of the progress of the arts and the promotion of the creation of new, original expression. The transformative test has changed copyright law, and it has become the defining standard for fair use. My conclusions are that the data set of cases applying the transformative test to concrete legal situations producing final judgments in the cases highlights the importance of a change in the predominant purpose of the work rather than simply a change in the character (the form, the contents) of the work. It is evident from the record of cases that the courts take the “purpose” part of the analysis very seriously, for all of the approved fair uses in the appellate cases involved a change in the predominant purpose for the use of the work. Even if the works were not changed in form, function, or genre, the fair use works were transformed in predominant purpose either through alteration of the contents, or recontextualization of the copied material, or by the addition of significant creative expression so that the predominant purpose of the new work was significantly different from the original work. <b>Non-alteration</b> of the contents and expression of artistic and literary works still can be justified as fair use, but the function and purpose of the original works must be changed in the second works in a manner that fulfills fair use objectives that promote the progress of the arts and the creation of new, original expression that benefits the public, namely through research, comment and criticism, educational, archival, or historical-referential uses. Copyright law seeks first to promote new, original expression in the arts and literature, and second to allow other public interest activities such as education, research, archiving, news reporting, and comment and criticism of existing works. Transformation requires the copier to fulfill these objectives. The duplication of works just to show off their same creative, artistic, or literary virtues in a new time, a new place, a new mode or medium of communication, or for a new audience does not fulfill the goals of copyright. No new and original expression results from simple replication of the same communication and expression found in the original. The derivative works doctrine gives those rights to the original author or artist, not to the public at large. The lessons of the transformative test for those engaged in creative, artistic, or literary pursuits may be summed up in the following: if you copy an original work, use it for a different purpose than the purpose for which the original work was created. Modify the contents, function, and meaning of the original work through alteration of the original expression or the addition of significant new expression. Otherwise, you are making an unauthorized exploitation of the creative expression of the work for exactly the same reasons and purposes that the original author or artist created the work, and you are depriving the original author or artist of the derivative works right guaranteed by copyright...|$|E
