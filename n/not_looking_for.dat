25|$|Employment status {{effects are}} not {{confined}} to the individual. Being unemployed can have detrimental effects on a spouse's subjective well-being, compared to being employed or not working (and <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> work). Partner life satisfaction is inversely related to the number of hours their partner is underemployed. When both partners are underemployed, the life-satisfaction of men is more greatly diminished than women. However, just being in a relationship reduces the impact unemployment has on the subjective well-being of an individual. On a broad scale, high rates of unemployment negatively affect the subjective well-being of the employed.|$|E

When MacLeod tells Tessa that she is stronger than Anne, and that if something happened to him she would be fine, Tessa retorts, [...] "You only think so because it suits you."

500|$|The Undiscovered Countrys cast {{includes}} the final group {{appearance of the}} main actors from the original television series. Casting director Mary Jo Slater loaded the film with as many Hollywood stars as the production could afford, including a minor appearance by Christian Slater, her son, as an Excelsior officer; Cinefantastique considered the cameo a likely attempt to lure younger audiences. Meyer was interested in casting actors who could project and articulate feelings, even through alien makeup. Producer Ralph Winter said, [...] "We were <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> someone to say 'Okay, I'll do it', but people who were excited by the material [...] and would treat {{it as if it}} was the biggest picture ever being made." ...|$|E

The characters are <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are {{trying to find a way}} to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E

[...] Kirkus Reviews praised the book, writing, [...] "while making no attempt at depth of characterization, Whitehead audaciously blurs the line between social realism and fabulist satire." [...] The Library Journal praised the book, noting, [...] "in spare and evocative prose, Whitehead does Shakespeare one better: What's in a name, and how does our identity relate to our own sense of who we are?" [...] The New York Observer was critical of the book but noted, [...] "readers <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> direct emotional access to the characters may find it gratifying to solve the intellectual puzzle set here by Colson Whitehead." ...|$|E

500|$|Veteran {{character}} actor Mark Metcalf appeared in heavy prosthetic make-up {{for the role}} of the Master, belying his iconic performance in the film National Lampoon's Animal House (1978) as Douglas C. Neidermeyer. In 2011, Metcalf recognized his role on Buffy as one of his favorites. Many actors auditioned for the part, but Whedon felt Metcalf played it with more complexity, bringing a [...] "sly and kind of urbane" [...] sensitivity and a charm to the villainy of the character. Kristine Sutherland was cast as Buffy's mother Joyce. Sutherland, who disliked the horror genre, was <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> acting jobs when her agent called her with the opportunity to play Joyce. Sutherland auditioned the same day as David Boreanaz, and was impressed with how naturally she felt at ease with the material in the scripts. Bob Flutie, Sunnydale High School's principal, was originally played by Stephen Tobolowsky in the unaired pilot. Ken Lerner was cast as Flutie in the broadcast version.|$|E
500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from critics, with some reservations over the resolution and character interactions. Dan Martin of The Guardian gave a positive review, {{believing that the}} episode [...] "moves along the bigger, 50-year story and effectively reboots the show". He particularly praised it for being simplistic, {{as well as the}} visuals of all history running together at once. Rachel Tarley, writing for Metro, praising the [...] "gripping race" [...] against time and noting that the script was [...] "snappy and witty throughout, but the episode had its eerie and touching moments where necessary, too". The A.V. Club Keith Phipps gave the episode an A, calling it [...] "pretty close to a perfect season finale" [...] for those <b>not</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> all of the answers. Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "As a piece of Saturday night entertainment, it works— packed full of strong performances, stunning visuals and sharp dialogue. And as the resolution to a series-long arc, it's mostly satisfactory— though the episode poses as many questions as it answers." ...|$|E

According to Minami, PlatinumGames only made games that the development team were passionate about. Inaba described the studio as a [...] "loud", as every one on the development team is allowed to express their opinions on their projects and their visions will not be compromised. The studio also invites employees who {{are not involved in}} game design, such as artists and programmers, to provide creative input to their projects. Seito added that every game that company developed has a [...] "Platinum taste". While the company developed an expertise in action games, Saito claimed that the studio learned from every project and will apply this knowledge to their new games and genres. The company also hopes to innovate by introducing new elements in both original titles or licensed games. According to PlatinumGames, a good action game should be [...] "passive" [...] and feature an [...] "unique selling point", replay value that allows players to hone their skills, and a strong leading character. In addition, it should not follow conventional design philosophy.|$|E
