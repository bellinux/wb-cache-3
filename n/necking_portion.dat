The grip {{section of the}} crept specimen was characterised by a lath martensite structure, which hardly changed during the test. In contrast, quite different microstructure developed in the necking porti on of the specimen. The structural changes were characterized by the evolution of relatively large equiaxed subgrains with remarkably l owered density of interior dilocations at places of initial martensite laths. The development of the well-defined subgrains in the <b>necking</b> <b>portion</b> was accompanied with a coarsening of second phase precipitations.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn hip {{fracture}} patients, studies about relevance between localized proximal femoral {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) and the fracture sites of hip are very rare. We compared T-scores of each femoral <b>neck</b> and trochanteric <b>portion</b> in a femoral neck fracture patients group (NFP) {{and in an}} intertrochanteric fracture patients group (IFP). Our hypothesis is that the T-score of <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> {{is lower than the}} T-score of trochanteric portion in NFP and vice versa. We evaluated how the FRAX® probability is meaningful in hip fracture patients. Methods 180 hip fracture patients were included and evaluated by BMD. We compared the average of T-scores between <b>neck</b> and trochanteric <b>portion</b> in each group. Differences between the regional T-score of <b>neck</b> and trochanteric <b>portion</b> were calculated in each patient and compared between two groups. We calculated the FRAX® probability in each patient and compared between two groups. ResultsFor the two groups, the average of the T-scores in <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> was lower than the T-scores in trochanteric portion. In NFP, the average of difference between the regional BMD of <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> and trochanteric portion was greater than that of IFP. FRAX® probability of hip fracture in NFP was higher than that in IFP. 77. 3 % of NFP and 80. 8 % of IFP were classified as high risk group for hip fracture. ConclusionThe localized femoral BMD data supports that localized femoral T-scores are relevant to the fracture sites of the hip.

Recent proteome analysis of the closely-related apicomplexan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, revealed a panel of novel proteins (RONs) located at the <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the rhoptries. Three of these proteins, RON 2, RON 4, and RON 5 have been shown to form a complex with the microneme protein Apical Membrane Protein 1 (AMA 1). This complex, termed the Moving Junction complex, localizes at the interface of the parasite and the host cell during the invasion process. Here we characterized a RON 2 ortholog in Plasmodium falciparum. PfRON 2 transcription peaked at the mature schizont stage and was expressed at the <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the rhoptry in the merozoite. Co-immunoprecipitation of PfRON 2, PfRON 4 and PfAMA 1 indicated that the complex formation is conserved between T. gondii and P. falciparum, suggesting that co-operative function of the rhoptry and microneme proteins is a common mechanism in apicomplexan parasites during host cell invasion. PfRON 2 possesses a region displaying homology with the rhoptry body protein PfRhopH 1 /Clag, a component of the RhopH complex. However, here we present co-immunoprecipitation studies which suggest that PfRON 2 is not a component of the RhopH complex and has an independent role. Nucleotide polymorphism analysis suggested that PfRON 2 was under diversifying selective pressure. This evidence suggests that RON 2 appears to have a fundamental role in host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites, and is a potential target for malaria intervention strategies...|$|R

50|$|The {{first major}} form relates to an {{abnormality}} {{of the brain}} called an Arnold-Chiari malformation.

A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord.

This structure hardly changed under creep conditions in grip portion of crept sample.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundKnowledge of {{spermiogenesis}} in reptiles, {{especially in}} lizards, is very limited. Lizards found in Arabian deserts {{have not been}} considered for detailed studies due to many reasons and the paucity of these animals. Therefore, we designed {{a study on the}} differentiation and morphogenesis of spermiogenesis, at an ultrastructural level, in a rare lizard species, Scincus scincus. ResultsThe spermiogenesis process includes the development of an acrosomal vesicle, aggregation of acrosomal granules, formation of subacrosomal nuclear space, and nuclear elongation. A role for manchette microtubules was described in nuclear shaping and organelle movement. During head differentiation, the fine granular chromatin of the early spermatid is gradually replaced by highly condensed contents in a process called chromatin condensation. Furthermore, ultrastructural features of sperm tail differentiation in S. scincus were described in detail. The commencement was with caudal migration toward centrioles, insertion of the proximal centriole in the nuclear fossa, and extension of the distal centrioles to form the microtubular axoneme. Subsequently, tail differentiation consists of the enlargement of <b>neck</b> <b>portion,</b> middle piece, the main and end pieces.

30|$|One of {{the pitfalls}} in using narrow {{implants}} {{is the risk}} of fracture to the fixture or abutment. The thickness of the fixture titanium wall is important. Where the fixture titanium is too thin around the abutment, the tendency is to lose bone upon loading. Therefore, {{it is important to}} secure sufficient fixture titanium around the abutment. A previous study showed that reinforcing the neck region is necessary in reduced-diameter Straumann® tissue level implants [25]. Quaresma et al. reported that a conical-connection implant produces lower stress on the alveolar bone and prosthesis and greater stress on the <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the abutment-prosthesis complex [26]. It has a weak point at the <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the abutment, especially when it is used in the posterior region. Herein, we observed no abutment fracture cases. We presumed that narrow fixtures were generally used in the narrow width of the bone because patients with a narrow bone width may have a weaker occlusal force than patients with normal- or wide-width bones [6]. Interestingly, the Ankylos® system design generates the same abutment for 3.5 -mm-, 4.5 -mm-, 5.5 -mm-, and 7 -mm-diameter implant fixtures. Thus, the crown margin position is only determined by the abutment, and after healing, several millimeters of play are available to define the final emergence profile; further, the same connection size between fixture and abutment can be used for all regions in the mouth. If the bone width is wide enough for installation of a wide implant, there is no reason not to use wider implants. However, {{it should also be noted}} that sufficient bone housing around the implants may be more important than implant diameter. The premise should be biomechanical stability. In Asian patients, who usually have narrow ridges and thin gingival biotype, using narrow implants enables bicortical installation in the posterior region. However, when treating patients with severe bruxism, heavy masticatory forces and oral habits, a narrow implant is not advised. We observed one case of cement loss in a bruxing patient. The loading history of the implant and the time required for the functional adaptation of the bone to implants may be more important than the implant itself. Development of better biomechanical properties in implants will facilitate narrow implant use in the posterior region. No statistically significant association between the variables and bone loss were detected herein given the combination of the factors described above, such as platform switching and conical connection. A single factor does not produce implant treatment success. Streckbein et al. also reported that low levels of bone strain are observed where a platform switch compensates for a small cone angle in the Ankylos® system [27]. For the PTV value, the groups with a loading period over 3  years is smaller than the group with a loading period of over 1 or 2  years, which is likely related to bone remodeling completion.|$|R
