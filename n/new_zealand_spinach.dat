40|$|<b>NEW</b> <b>ZEALAND</b> <b>spinach</b> (Tetragonia expansa) is a {{comparatively}} {{new kind of}} market greens. Its particular advantage is in its being heat tolerant. In the hot summer months when spinach and some other green vegetables cannot be grown, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach,</b> {{which is not a}} variety of spinach (S'pinada olerÃ¡cea),is easily grown as a truck crop and furnishes succulent greens for months. Furthermore it is being grown as a winter crop in some eastern greenhouses. The tender, rather fleshy leaves have a distinct flavor more pleasing to some than that of common, mild spinach. The nutritive value of any vegetable used as a salad or for greens is dependent largely on its mineral and its vitamin contents. The few re ferences to <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach</b> in the literature (3, 7) show it to be high in minerals, especially iron. No references were found to its vitamin content. Its appearance, flavor and composition, as found in our experimental work, are recommendation enough. It is compared with spinach only because this has previously been shown to be exceptionally rich in minerals and potent in vitamins. The use of spinach has been advocated {{to such an extent that}} recognition of other vegetables with different flavors is needed before unfavorable reaction towards eating spinach becomes too great. MINERALCONTENT Raw and cooked samples were analyzed for moisture, total ash, calcium, phosphorus and iron. Leaves alone were used for analysis because much of the stem, particularly in older plants, is tough and fibrous. Samples of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach,</b> as gathered in the college greenhouse or garden, showed no dirt visible to the eye and washing yielded a negligible amount of foreign matter. Therefore, the raw vegetable was analyzed without washing. It was weighed as soon as possible after picking and put into a vacuum oven, * Spinach and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach</b> were grown and furnished through the courtesy of Dr. E. S. Haber.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{intercropping}} is {{a production}} system {{that aims to}} provide increased yield with less environmental impact, due to greater efficiency {{in the use of}} natural resources and inputs involved in the production process. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the agronomic viability of kale and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach</b> intercropping {{as a function of the}} spinach transplanting time. (0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84 and 98 days after transplanting of the kale). The total yield (TY) and yield per harvest (YH) of the kale in intercropping did not differ from those obtained in monoculture. The spinach TY was influenced by the transplanting time, the earlier the transplanting, the higher the TY. The spinach YH was not influenced by the transplanting time, but rather by the cultivation system. In intercropping, the spinach YH was 13. 5 % lower than in monoculture. The intercropping was agronomically feasible, since the land use efficiency index, which was not influenced by the transplanting time, had an average value of 1. 71, indicating that the intercropping produced 71 % more kale and spinach than the same area in monoculture. Competitiveness coefficient, aggressiveness and yield loss values showed that kale is the dominating species and spinach is the dominated...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: Dentre os fitoquicos de maior interesse por proporcionarem beneficios à saude humana estão os carotenoides. O Brasil possui o maior banco de dados sobreos teores mas faltam estudos da biodisponnibilidade. O Capitulo 1 apresenta uma revisao bibliografica descrevendo o mecanismo de digestao, transporte e absorçao dos carotenoides, os fatores que podem afetar a biodisponibilidade e os metodos in vivo e {{in vitro}} utilizados para determina-la. Metodos in vitro tem sido desenvolvidos para determinar a bioacessibilidadedos carotenoides de maneira mais rapida e barata, porem, não houve uma avaliaçao comparativa dos diferentes metodos. O Capitulo 2 apresenta a comparaçao dos resultados obtidos por uma metodologia de determinação da bioacessibilidade in vitro e com algumas modificaçoes sugeridas para melhor simular a fisiologia humana. A bioacessibilidade dos carotenoides de cenoura, tomate e espinafre cru e cozido foi, no geral, significativamente maior utilizando-se o metodo de Reboul et al. (2006). A fase oral proposta para integrar a digestao in vitro antes da fase gastrica nao alterou a bioacessibilidade dos carotenoides nas amostras estudadas, porem, a adiçao delipase e carboxil ester lipase aumentou a bioacessibilidade dos carotenoides. O tempo de homogeneizaçao da amostra tambem afetou significativamente a porcentagem de micelarizaçao dos carotenoides. O Capitulo 3 apresenta a bioacessibilidade dos carotenoides de vegetaisfolhosos comerciais e de folhas nativas além de avaliar o efeito do cozimento na bioacessibilidade. Dentre as amostras cruas analisadas, o espinafre obteve a maior bioacessibilidade para o ß-caroteno (14 %) e para a luteina (46 %), correlacionadocom seu baixo teor em fibras (2, 1 g/ 100 g). A folha nativa ¿caruru¿, mais rica em fibras (4, 5 g/ 100 g) apresentou a menor bioacessibilidade para o ß-caroteno (2, 3 %) epara a luteina (6, 9 %). O cozimento aumentou a bioacessibilidade do ß-caroteno (3. 3 para 16 % e 14 para 15 %) e da luteina (18 para 38 % e 46 para 59 %) em couve e espinafre respectivamente. A bioacessibilidade dos carotenoides de frutas e seus derivados processados foi estudada no Capitulo 4. Entre as frutas cruas, o mamao `Solo¿ teve a maior bioacessibilidade para ß-caroteno (36 %) e ß-criptoxantina (39 %) e a pitanga teve a menor bioacessibilidade para esses carotenoides. A porcentagem de micelarizaçao dos carotenoides foi maior nos produtos processados. Em manga, a biocessibilidade do ß-caroteno aumentou de 19 % na fruta crua para 57 % no suco, e na goiaba, a bioacessibilidade do licopeno da goiaba aumentou de 1, 4 % para 27 % na goiabada. No Capitulo 5 encontra-se o estudo da bioacessibilidade das frutas amazonicas buriti, tucumã e pupunha (crua e cozida). Além de otimas fontes de carotenoides pro-vitaminicos A (150 µg/g, 147 µg/g, 48 µg/g de ß-caroteno para o buriti, o tucuma e a pupunha, respectivamente), todas as frutas analisadas apresentaram bioacessibilidade do ß-caroteno maior que a das frutas analisadas no capitulo anterior, sendo que a pupunha cozida teve a maior pocentagem (40 %). O Capitulo 6 forneceu informaçoes sobre o efeito da bioacessibilidade na microencapsulaçao da polpa de pitanga microencapsulada em diferentes materiais de parede para proteger os carotenoides da degradaçao oxidativa. O licopeno apresentou baixa bioacessibilidade (1 %) em todas as amostras analisadas. A luteina foi o carotenoide mais bioacessivel em todas as amostras (6 a 21 %). A microencapsulaçao com maltodextrina diminuiu substancialmente a bioacessibilidade de todos os carotenoides, enquanto que as perdas de bioacessibilidade foram menores com goma arabica. O amido modificado teve um efeito intermediarioAbstract: Carotenoids {{are among the}} phytochemicals of greater {{interest}} {{in terms of human}} health benefits. Brazil has the largest database on carotenoid concentrations, but studies on bioavailability are lacking. Chapter 1 is {{a review of the literature}} describing the mechanism of digestion, transport and absorption of carotenoids, the factors that can affect bioavailability and the in vivo and in vitro methods used for determining bioavailability. In vitro methods have been developed to determine bioaccessibility of carotenoids rapidly and inexpensively, but comparative evaluation of the different methods has not been carried out. Chapter 2 presents a comparison of the results obtained by a methodology for the determination of bioaccessibility in vitro and with modifications suggested to simulate human physiology better. The bioaccessibility of the carotenoids of carrot, tomato, and raw and cooked <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach</b> was, in general, significantly greater when the method of Reboul et al. (2006) was used. The oral phase proposed to integrate the digestion in vitro before the gastric phase did not alter the bioaccessibility of the carotenoids of the samples studied, but the addition of lipase and carboxyl ester lipase increased the bioaccessibility. The homogeneization time also affects significantly the percent micelarization of the carotenoids. Chapter 3 presents the bioaccessibility of commercial and native leafy vegetables, aside from the evaluation of the effect of cooking on bioaccessibility. Among the raw samples analyzed, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach</b> had the highest bioaccessibility for ß-carotene (14 %) and lutein (46 %), correlating with its low fiber content (2. 1 g/ 100 g). The native leaf ¿caruru¿, richer in fiber (4. 5 g/ 100 g) had the lowest bioaccessibility for ß-caroteno (2. 3 %) and for lutein (6. 9 %). Cooking increased the bioaccessibility for ß-carotene (3. 3 to 16 % and 14 to 15 %, respectively) and lutein (18 to 38 % and 46 to 59 %, respectively) in kale and <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>spinach.</b> The bioaccessibility of carotenoids in fruits and their processed derivatives was studied in Chapter 4. Among the raw fruits, the papaya `Solo¿ had the highest bioaccessibility for ß-carotene (36 %) and ß-cryptoxanthin (39 %) and pitanga had the lowest bioaccessibility for these carotenoids (6. 3 % e 10 %, respectively). The percent micelarization of carotenoids was higher in the processed products. In mango, the bioaccessibility for ß-carotene increased from 19 % in the raw fruit to 57 % in the juice, and in guava, the bioaccessibility of lycopene increased from 1. 4 % to 27 % in ¿goiabada¿. Chapter 5 deals with the bioaccessibility of the Amazonian fruits ¿buriti¿, ¿tucuma¿ and pupunha (raw and cooked). Aside from being excellent sources of provitamin A carotenoids (150, 142, 48 µg/g of ß-carotene for ¿tucuma¿, ¿buriti¿ and ¿pupunha¿, respectively), all three fruits presented greater bioaccessibility of ß-carotene than those of the fruits analyzed in the previous chapter, the cooked¿pupunha¿ having the highest percentage (40 %). Chapter 6 provides inforrmation about the bioaccessibility of pitanga pulp and pitanga microencapsulated with different wall materials to protect the carotenoids from oxidative degradation. Lycopene had low bioaccessibility (1 %) in all samples analyzed. Lutein was the most bioaccessible carotenoid in all samples (6 a 21 %). Micelarization with maltodextrin substantially decreased the bioaccessibilitiy of all the carotenoids, while there was practically no loss of bioaccessibility with gum Arabic.
