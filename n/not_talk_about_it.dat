500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I am tormented enough," [...] he {{admitted}} meaningly. But <b>it</b> was <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> that tormented him. It {{was thinking of}} it. And to sit {{and look at it}} was worse for him than it possibly could have been for her to go and give herself up, bad as that must have been.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Yankees <b>talk</b> a lot <b>about</b> {{what they}} do and have done," [...] Tudor said, [...] "and are looked down upon by the English as braggarts. But the Yankee is only a child. He does not know effectually how to brag. He <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> you see. But the Englishman goes him one better by <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The Englishman's proverbial lack of bragging is a subtler form of brag after all. It is really clever, as you will agree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} only let the matter be settled {{by those who}} {{understand}} it, and <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just at present, {{it would be so}} much better." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{read her}} the placard, {{and let her}} lead {{me away from the}} subject. I could <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to any one, and how I longed for Eustace! ...|$|E
6000|$|MARTHA--I'm a woman, remember; so {{that one}} means at least six. Ugh! Let's <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Do you know, it really fills me with a queer panic sometimes? ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> won’t {{make the}} problem go away. In fact, the {{continuing}} lack of acknowledgement and/or {{discussion about the}} incidence of suicide in the Black community is responsible for a disturbing trend. Alvin Poussaint, M. D., a Harvard psychiatrist, says the stigma is even stronger in the Black community. One problem, he says, is the stigma associated with depression itself. More than 60 percent of Black individuals don’t see depression as a mental illness, which makes it unlikely they will seek help for it...|$|R

60|$|EILEEN (sadly). Yes, I was forgetting--you {{were going}} right away. (Dully). Then nowhere, I suppose--never. (Glancing towards the dining-room.) They're all getting up. Let's <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> any more--now.|$|E
60|$|It {{was taken}} in the family as an intimation that she would <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and while she {{supposed}} that the children drew no conclusions, they thought the more.|$|E

2500|$|While Flynn {{acknowledged}} {{his personal}} attraction to de Havilland, assertions by film historians {{that they were}} romantically involved during the filming of Robin Hood were denied by de Havilland. [...] "Yes, we did {{fall in love and}} I believe that this is evident in the screen chemistry between us", she told an interviewer in 2009. [...] "But his circumstances [...] at the time prevented the relationship going further. I have <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> a great deal but the relationship was not consummated. Chemistry was there though. It was there." ...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{easing the}} social {{situation}} in Bahrain {{is the fact}} that the Bahá'ís believe in the truth message of the Prophet Muhammad, and the health and Quran, and in all texts dealing with the Prophet Muhammad as holy, a Manifestations of God, and this is reflected in the Mtbaih, a cultural behavior. Followers of the religion do <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> do <b>not</b> intervene in political affairs as it is something forbidden in the religion, and that they deal with the wider community peacefully, respectful of their prayer times and days of fasting.|$|R

60|$|In {{a moment}} he {{was alone in the}} turret-room. As for the shopkeepers, they had a kind of idea that they had dreamed {{something}} odd; but, as it went no further, of course they did <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and nobody was any the wiser.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush! {{you must}} <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> There {{are some things}} we cannot bear to hear. Oh! it is late to begin, but I may yet live a few years. I can never wipe out the past, but perhaps a brief space in the future may yet be mine." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hemraj {{had spoken}} {{of a threat}} to his life before his death. The police {{suspected}} that he knew about Rajesh's alleged extra-marital affair, and Rajesh had threatened him <b>not</b> to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Horrible," [...] Petroff said; [...] "but {{it is just}} as well <b>not</b> to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the streets. Come along, we {{will take}} you to our place; we were just {{thinking}} of going back." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Joshua Davis of Wired.com, {{the area}} has seen the {{emergence}} of a Roundup resistant variety of the coca plant known as [...] "Boliviana Negra" [...] that is <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> because <b>it</b> might [...] "put an end to American aid money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't well at all. I am {{very far}} from well. If you don't mind I'd rather <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just at present. When I can see Hampstead, then, perhaps, things can be settled." [...] As there was nothing further to be said George Roden took his leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have done}} with all {{eleventh}} commandments; for I find it quite hard work {{enough to keep the}} ancient ten. But I find it, Mellot, in the deepest abyss of all; in the very depth from which the commandments sprang. But we will <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> my dear," [...] replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly; [...] "for if Miss Elliot were {{to hear how}} soon we came to an understanding, {{she would never be}} persuaded that we could be happy together. I had known you by character, however, long before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{stay where}} you are," [...] said Mr. Quince, sharply, [...] "and, mind, you are <b>not</b> to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to anybody. Farmer Rose ’ud like {{nothing better than to}} see us upset <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I ain’t done with him yet. You wait." ...|$|R
5000|$|About {{making the}} album, Antonoff said, [...] "I {{spent the past}} year working on the music but <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and {{eventually}} it became this psychotic alter-ego situation, where it was second nature to have this {{part of me that}} no one knew about. Except for a small group of people, most of which happened to be members of my immediate family, no one was aware that this music, or this album even existed ... even though it existed so deeply to me." [...] Antonoff also stated that Bleachers was never meant to be a departure from his position in Fun., and that he will remain in the band.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is better for us <b>not</b> to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at all," [...] Ruth said, quietly; [...] "I don't think it right and proper, {{and it will be}} quite time enough to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Miss Margaret's affairs when we know she is engaged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} appeal {{to me like}} that," [...] he continued. [...] "So long as I am manager for Dowling & Spence, I feel these things personally. However, that does not matter. I am afraid it is a disagreeable subject for you, and we will <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> any longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now," [...] Reuben said quietly. [...] "I said then, and I say now, that I knew {{the people who}} did it and, strange as the {{circumstances}} have already been, you may think them stranger still, some day, if I bring one of them before you, alive or dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't bear {{to think}} of you in that miserable village--a {{position}} so unworthy of your talents and your claims! And you tell me I must <b>not</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Would {{you have said that}} to Emily, if she was as anxious as I am to see you in your right place in the world?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{thought you}} were sure to hear sooner or later. I saw all the hands in the mill had got to know <b>about</b> <b>it</b> somehow or other, and I was sure it would soon get over the place; and I would rather that I could say, if any one asked me, that I had <b>not</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to any one, and {{was in no way}} {{responsible}} for the absurd stories which had got about. I have been <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> enough in Marsden, goodness knows, and it is disgusting that just as I should think they must be getting tired of the subject here is something fresh for them to begin upon again." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Exclaim!, guitarist Rasyid stated: Dirge is much more punk and noise, in terms of production, sound of the band and composition. It's faster than Abuse, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> BPMs; <b>it's</b> unfriendly, less accessible. There's less death metal riffage and more punk chords.|$|R
