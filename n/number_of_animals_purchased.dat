40|$|Local {{persistence}} of infection {{is a key}} feature of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) among cattle herds in the Republic of Ireland. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the relative importance of ‘neighbourhood’, specifically farm-to-farm spread and spread from wildlife, in the {{persistence of}} bTB by investigating herds having a bTB episode in 2006. A case–control study was conducted on the association between the occurrence of a bTB episode in 2006 and the occurrence of bTB in previous years among neighbouring herd(s) within 1 km, while controlling for each herd’s bTB history and other risk factors. Neighbouring herds were grouped into three zones, based on distance, and bTB incidence measures summarised within each zone and by calendar year (2001 – 2005). The incidence of bTB was associated with an increased animal incidence in two subsets of neighbouring herds: (i) herds directly contiguous during the previous 2 years (attributable fraction = 0. 20), and (ii) herds at a distance of > 25 m in the previous year (attributable fraction = 0. 19). Other predictors of bTB in a herd in 2006 included the occurrence of a bTB episode within that herd in any of the previous 5 years, herd size, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>purchased</b> at age greater than 12 months. An infected wildlife source best explains the existence of a “neighbouring herd risk” for bTB at distances greater than 25 m. Further studies will be necessary to determine to what extent neighbouring herd risk within 25 m may be confounded by the same wildlife (badger) source...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{prevalence}} of Escherichia coli O 157 on cattle farms has been examined extensively, the relationship between this pathogen and farm type has been established only rarely. A large-scale {{study was designed to}} determine {{the prevalence}} of E. coli O 157 in the Flemish region of Belgium on farms of dairy cattle, beef cattle, mixed dairy and beef cattle, and veal calves. The effect of various factors on the occurrence at the pen level also was evaluated. In 2007, 180 farms were randomly selected based on region, farm size, and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>purchased</b> and were examined using the overshoe sampling method. When possible, overshoes used in areas containing animals in three different age categories (30 months) were sampled on each farm. In total, 820 different pens were sampled and analyzed for the presence of E. coli O 157 by enrichment, immunomagnetic separation, and plating on selective agar. Presumptive E. coli O 157 colonies were identified using a multiplex PCR assay for the presence of the rfb(O 157) and fliC(H 7) genes. The statistical analysis was carried out with Stata SE/ 10. 0 using a generalized linear regression model with a logit link function and a binomial error distribution. The overall farm prevalence of E. coli O 157 was 37. 8 % (68 of 180 farms). The highest prevalence was found on dairy cattle farms (61. 2 %, 30 of 49 farms). The prevalences on beef, mixed dairy and beef, and veal calf farms were 22. 7 % (17 of 75 farms), 44. 4 % (20 of 45 farms), and 9. 1 % (1 of 11 farms), respectively. A significant positive correlation between age category and E. coli O 157 prevalence was found only on mixed dairy and beef farms and dairy farms. No influence of farm size or introduction of new animals was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Semen quality {{assessment}} {{is a crucial}} task in artificial insemination processes, both for humans and animals. Animal artificial insemination allows farmers to save time and money (e. g. working with a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals).</b> They <b>purchase</b> semen samples to companies devoted to their production and commercialization, but they need these samples to be optimal for fertilization. As a result, semen production centers have to carry out rigorous quality control procedures to guarantee good standards A semen sample with {{a high proportion of}} (i) dead spermatozoa, or (ii) sperm heads with damaged acro-somes ∗ will have low fertilization potential. Therefore, sperm vitality and acrosome integrity are two of the parameters evaluated by veterinaries in semen quality control processes. Currently, both are assessed manually, by means of a visual process which entails expensive equipment, such as stains and fluorescence microscopes. Moreover, they may be a source of errors, as any manual process is. The goal is to develop an automatic system to estimate the proportions of damaged acrosomes and dead spermatozoa using just a computer and a digital camera connected to a phase contrast microscope, which is affordable by any laboratory. The contributions made on this PhD thesis in the fields of Image Processing and Machine Learning [1] can be helpful for this goal. Concretely, several texture description approaches have been evaluated for this task. Furthermore, a new intelligent segmentation process, an adaptive texture description method, and two robust approaches for estimating class proportions of unlabeled datasets have been proposed. All these methods are applied to automatic boar semen quality estimation. ...|$|R

This article discusses when the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> to be used can best be estimated from previous experience and when a simple power and sample size calculation should be performed. Even complicated experimental designs requiring sophisticated statistical models for analysis can usually be simplified to a single key or critical question so that simple formulae {{can be used to}} estimate the required sample size. Approaches to sample size estimation for various types of hypotheses are described, and equations are provided in the Appendix.

[...] Russell and Burch suggested {{a reduction in}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used could be achieved in several ways. One general way in which great reduction may occur is by the right choice of strategies in the planning and performance of whole lines of research. A second method is by controlling variation amongst the animals used in studies, and a third method is careful design and analysis of studies.With the advent, development and availability of computers since the original 3Rs, large data-sets can be used in statistical analysis, perhaps most notably meta-analysis, thereby reducing the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used. In some cases, by using previously published studies, the use <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> can be totally avoided by avoiding unnecessary replication. Modern imaging techniques also allow reductions in the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> used, for example by providing greater information from each animal used.|$|R
