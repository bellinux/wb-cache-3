40|$|It {{is shown}} that photon shot noise and radiation-pressure back-action noise are the sole forms of quantum noise in {{interferometric}} gravitational wave detectors that operate near {{or below the}} standard quantum limit, if one filters the interferometer output appropriately. No additional noise arises from the test masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due to measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle associated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are central to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number flux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different times in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t') ] = 0, and thus {{can be regarded as}} classical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position and momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured photon flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering [...] e. g., in most interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging freqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered output <b>N(t)</b> <b>make</b> a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t') ]. That contribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and radiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation of commutators is responsible for {{the fact that it is}} possible to derive an interferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and independently from photon-noise considerations. These conclusions are true for a far wider class of measurements than just gravitational-wave interferometers. To elucidate them, this paper presents a series of idealized thought experiments that are free from the complexities of real measuring systems.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] {{of the benefits}} from conservation tillage are attained by maintaining crop residues on the soil surface. However, the effectiveness of crop residues depends on their persistence in time and maintenance of sufficient residue cover can become difficult, especially when a long-fallow period is involved. In this study, we evaluate the effects of conventional tillage (CT) and two conservation tillage systems (reduced tillage, RT, and no-tillage, NT), under both continuous cropping (CC) and cereal-fallow rotation (CF), on the dynamics of surface barley residues during four fallow periods in a dryland field of semiarid Aragon. The CC system involves a summer fallow period of 5 - 6 months and the CF rotation a long-fallow of 17 - 18 months. Results indicate {{that the lack of}} residue-disturbing operations in <b>NT</b> <b>makes</b> this practice the best strategy for fallow management. With this tillage system, the soil surface still conserved a residue cover of 10 - 15 % after long-fallowing and percentages of standing residues ranging from 20 % to 40 % of the total mass after the first 11 - 12 months. In both CT and RT, primary tillage operations had the major influence on residue incorporation, with percentages of cover reduction of 90 - 100 % after mouldboard ploughing (CT) and 50 - 70 % after chiselling (RT). Two decomposition models were tested, the Douglas-Rickman and the Steiner models. Our data indicate that the Steiner model described more accurately the decline of surface residue mass over the long-fallow period in the NT plots. Measured and predicted data indicate that, under NT, 80 - 90 % of the initial residue mass is lost at the end of fallow and that 60 - 75 % of this loss occurs during the first 9 - 10 months. Finally, the mass-to-cover relationship established in this study for barley residues could be used to predict soil cover from flat residue mass through the fallow period by using a single Am coefficient (0. 00208 ha kg- 1).

In this presentation, we will dwell on the experiences gathered in developing a generic spatial Decision Support System for integrated environmental policy-making at the regional level. The experiences are taken from a two year EC-project, MODULUS.

The present study proposes to evaluate intertemporal prefere nces in MCI patients as compared to healthy controls. Method : Fifty-five patients with MCI and 57 h ealthy controls underwent neuropsy- chological evaluation and a delay discounting questionnaire, which evaluates three para- meters: hyperbolic discounting (k), the percentage of choices for delayed and later rewards (%LL), and response consistency (Acc). Results : No significant differences were found in the delay discounting questionnaire between MC I patients and controls for the three reward sizes considered, small, medium, and large, using both k and %LL parameters. There were also no differences in the response consistency, Acc, between the two groups. Conclusions : Patients with MCI perform similarly to healthy controls in a delay discounting task.

It was observed that the limit flames are very thick and that heat losses to the w alls caused extensive cooling of t he product gases within 0. 05 m behind the propagating flame. Analysis of all data from well synchronized measurements {{as well as the}} results of following to them numerical calculations made pos sible to understand in detail physical picture of he at transfer from the hot gases to the cold walls. It is a unique way for explanation of heat transf er phenomenon. Measurements and calculations were used to prepare heat balance in a flammability tube. In the next step measurements were carried out in a rotating cylindr ical combustion chamber. This chamber was treated as a model of piston engine combustion chamber with sw irl. Temperature changes on a surface of the rotating combustion chamber were transmitted t owards motionless data acquisition system. The temperat ure measurements were carried out with the use of special thermocouples l ocated at the front wall of the chamber. Influence of rotation velocity on heat transfer was investigated in the range from 1000 rpm to 5000 rpm. For a constant mixture concentration maximum temperature rise depended on the rot ation velocity. Increased rot ation velocity initially intensified heat transfer t o the wall, with f ollowing to it increase of peak temperature, but furt her rise of rot ation velocity resulted in local flame extinction near the side walls, decreased volume of combustion gases, {{and as a result of}} these, decreased value of peak temperature at the wall surface.

For a closed NT we find for γ a simple polynomial expression in terms of the ratio of the height h of the tube to its radius R, which for h/R< 40 reduces to a frequently quoted formula of γ. For an open single-wall NT we find that γ is three times greater than that of a single-wall NT of the same h/R. As the thickness of the wall increases this difference diminishes.

T males observed in social groups had agonistic interactions predominantly with neighboring T males of the opposite color, and yellow morphs initiated significantly more aggressive interactions. When agonistic preference was tested experimentally, T males had significantly more agonistic interactions toward males of the opposite color, and yellow T males became territorial in the majority of those interactions.

40|$|International audienceAchieving {{molecular}} recognition of NADPH binding sites {{is a compelling}} strategy to control many redox biological processes. The NADPH sites recognize the ubiquitous NADPH cofactor via highly conserved binding interactions, despite differences in the regulation of the hydride transfer in redox active proteins. We recently developed a photoactive NADPH substitute, called nanotrigger NT synchronizing the initiation of enzymatic catalysis of the endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) with a laser pulse. Spatial and temporal control of enzymatic activity by such a designed light-driven activator would benefit from achieving molecular selectivity, i. e. activation of a single NADPH-mediated enzyme. In this work, we probe the ability of NT to discriminate between two NADPH sites with light. The selected NADPH sites belong to dihydrofolate reductase dihydrofolate reductase enzyme (DHFR) and endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS). Ultrafast kinetics showed that NT could not activate DHFR catalysis with a laser pulse {{in contrast with the}} observed trigger of eNOS catalysis leading to NO formation. Homology modelling, molecular dynamics simulations showed that NT discriminated between the two NADPH sites by different donor to acceptor distances and by local steric effects hindering light activation of DHFR catalysis. The data suggested that the narrow NADPH site required a tight fit of the nanotrigger at a suitable distance/angle to the electron acceptor for a specific activation of the catalysis. The ability of the nanotrigger to activate eNOS combined with a low reactivity in unfavourable NADPH sites <b>makes</b> <b>NT</b> a highly promising tool for targeting eNOS in endothelial cells with a laser pulse.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} project is the design and construction of a football trainer. A football trainer {{is a system that}} is able to determ inate the strength of the impact of a football into a target. This system can be used to train and practice the kick of football players or as a game. To do that, the idea is to use an acceleration sens or, also called accelerometer. This device outputs an electrical signal that is proportional t o the acceleration applied on it. That means that it can detect any movement that has changes in its velocity. This definition includes any kind of vibrations, which is what an impact produce s in the target. By knowing the “quantity” of vibration {{it would be possible to}} know the strength of that impact. To build the system I will use an accelerometer fro m Analog Devices. This manufacturer provides an Evaluation Board to test the accelerome ter and learn how does it works. In the Evaluation Board the accelerometer interfaces to a low cost microcontroller which captures and converts the data from the sensor. Then the dat a is sent to the computer via serial communication. The idea is to use the design of the Evaluation Boa rd as a reference to build the acceleration sensor. Some changes will be made to adapt it to th e objective application, the football trainer. The most important change is to add a large memory capacity, so the information of the accelerometer could be stored on it and sent back t o the computer in a different moment. So it would be possible to record the data and store it i n the same board. That makes necessary to use and program a microcont roller to communicate with the external memory chip. So a microcontroller with a large numb er of input/output pins is needed, as the address and data ports have to be implemented. It w ill also need to communicate via RS 232 with a computer, so a communication interface is re quired.

This will be determin ed by analysing the results. Finally, to complete the system, a computer softwar e will be needed.

40|$|There are two aims of {{this work}} focused across {{northern}} Australia (north of the tropic of Capricorn). First is to identify adaptive strategies to deal with climate change in each jurisdiction. Second the work identifies issues for adaptation in water resource management across the region in light of potential impacts and local conditions. Over half of Australia‘s annual runoff occurs in the north Australian region from November to April. The region is relatively undeveloped and sparsely populated compared to southern Australia. Almost 30 % of the land base is owned under Indigenous tenure. Drought and over-allocation of water resources in southern Australia has focused attention on the potential for expanding irrigated agriculture in the north. With an outlook for increased drought in southern Australia the pressure to look north is likely to increase. While rainfall projections in northern Australia are identified as stable to increasing, our research highlights that the outlook for water availability remains uncertain under climate change scenarios across the north. Work by CSIRO and BOM (2007 a) and CSIRO (2009 a) predict that to 2030 and 2070, northern Australia is likely to experience hotter temperatures, more intense rainfall and more intense cyclonic events. It must be stated that climate change impacts are likely to vary across the region and impacts may be highly localized. There may be {{an increased risk of}} saltwater inundation and erosion in coastal areas. While inland areas may experience more extreme high temperatures, drought, flooding, dust storms and bushfires (CSIRO, 2009 a; Green, 2006). Although northern Australia produces over half of Australia‘s runoff, it is considered to be water limited for two main reasons. First there is high evaporation and evapotranspiration for most of the year (CSIRO, 2009 a). Second the potential for water storages is constrained (NAWLT, 2009; Petheram et al, 2008). There may be consequences for water resources from climate change (as well as infrastructure) which combined with increased population growth (especially in Darwin, <b>NT)</b> could <b>make</b> water stress more acute, particularly during the dry season. As water stress increases the need for a robust and adaptive framework to manage water becomes more important. Climate models may allow policy makers to anticipate particular events in setting design standards for water infrastructure (Hallegatte, 2009). Reference has been made in water plans to climate change in each jurisdiction. There is also recognition in climate adaptation strategies that water resources will be impacted by climate change. Adaptation for water resource managers and policy makers is not new. But the effects from climate change may impose new and perhaps unforeseen challenges on water management regimes. This is particularly true across tropical northern Australia, a region already difficult to manage and deliver services to because of its size, remoteness and relatively poor infrastructure base. It is recommended in literature that adaptation for water resources should consider basins in an integrated way and address issues such as flood and drought protection, managing water demand, and maintaining and protecting infrastructure. Water markets are a demand side strategy to adapt to climate change. Markets have enabled irrigators in southern Australia the flexibility to cope with drought and maintain productivity during water shortages. Water markets may enable adaptation to the effects of climate change by allowing re-allocation among users and flexibility to users through trading. Markets can also encourage water use efficiency which is important where climate change reduces water availability. The use of water markets are at a formative stage across the north Australian region, with little to no trading at the time of writing. Despite no trading, northern jurisdictions generally allow water trading to occur in areas subject to a water plan (competition for water tends to be higher in these areas and necessitates a plan). Water plans seek to identify a sustainable level of consumptive extraction by using best available science and community consultation to support economic, ecological and social outcomes. It is acknowledged across the north that data relating to water resources and climate is limited. This is particularly true for groundwater resources for which there is a strong reliance across much of the north. There is considerable risk for the extraction on groundwater resources on groundwater dependent ecosystems, and on the customary values of Indigenous Australians. The Northern Territory has in place one water allocation plan in the region, the Tindall aquifer plan. Queensland has the Gulf and Mitchell resource operation plans. Western Australia has the Ord River water management plan. The Tindall plan in the NT is the only groundwater plan completed in the region. In Queensland and the NT plans are enshrined in statute and last 10 years (though in the NT the plan is reviewed within 5 years). While in WA the Ord plan is for 3 years. An important tool for adapting to climate change in water plans is the ability to reduce water allocations to entitlement holders in line with reductions in water availability. This is often done according to the level of security provided to an entitlement holder (high, medium and low security). The economic value of entitlements is linked to its level of security. In the Northern Territory, the Tindall aquifer water allocation plan provides that all water licenses may have their allocation reduced to zero in serious drought (commencing with low then up to high security). In times of critical water shortage the Water Controller in the NT has the power to impose restrictions on stock and domestic use as well. In the Ord there is greater security afforded to users because of the storage capacity in Lake Argyle (101 GL). Allocations in the Ord are determined based on water storage levels in the dam, and restrictions can be imposed on allocations if water reaches  ̳critical levels‘. It is expected that in only 5 years out of every 100 will water reach  ̳critical levels‘ and allocations be reduced. Hence entitlement holders will get their full allocation 95 % of the time. Plans are reviewed and new information may be integrated and entitlements amended to reflect any changes in water availability. Most work on climate change and hydrology research has been focused on metropolitan centres in WA and Queensland. There has been relatively little work across the north to understand the effect of climate change on water resources. Uncertainty and lack of knowledge serve to constrain planning efforts. Adapting to climate change in water resource management requires an integrated approach, coordinating efforts across government and collaborating with stakeholders to be effective- it will be important to to support socio-economic outcomes over the long term. The impacts from climate change will not be distributed equitably and will have implications for Indigenous groups (who are disadvantaged), with consequences for health, wellbeing and livelihoods (Green, 2006). Industry will be affected by the impacts of climate change in northern Australia. For example, the pastoral industry which covers almost 90 % of land use could be negatively affected by reduced feed quality and water availability. These impacts can be mitigated by proactive planning, as well as collaborative and stakeholder focused planning activities. Planning will require particular effort to include and engage Indigenous groups, where consultation efforts have in the past fallen short of expectations in water management...|$|R
