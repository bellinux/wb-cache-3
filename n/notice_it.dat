5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to <b>notice</b> <b>it</b> as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to punishing soldiers, tightening dismissal regulations {{and reducing the}} number of Vietnamese servicemen in France, the French decided to improve the military intelligence service. This was to be achieved by strengthening military intelligence through closer coordination with the Sûreté, and by raising internal standards. An inquiry into the mutiny at showed that cooperation between Resident Massimi and Commandant Le Tacon did not exist despite multiple requests, and that it was partly responsible for the uprising. The relationship between the civilian and military authorities were traditionally poor, but Yen Bay stood out in the total lack of military-civilian cooperation. Further VNQDĐ conspiracies to foment mutinies in other garrisons, such as Kiến An, were detected and scotched at late <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> was decided that the teamwork with the Sûreté had to be raised to greater heights to prevent future Yen Bay style rebellions. The rebellion allowed the civilian authorities an opportunity to involve themselves in military matters.|$|E
5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll <b>notice</b> <b>it</b> is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' was a really good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to <b>notice</b> <b>it</b> in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E

25|$|The {{island was}} the site of an {{important}} Australian High Court case, Nagle v Rottnest Island Authority, which arose after a man dived off a rock on Rottnest Island and became a quadriplegic.

25|$|Due to Mexican {{government}} regulations, these stations, {{like all}} {{radio stations in}} Mexico, must air La Hora Nacional ("The Mexican National Hour") on Sunday evenings at 10pm and Himno Nacional Mexicano (the Mexican National Anthem) at midnight and 6 am. In addition, they must also give station identification in Spanish. This is usually done softly or during commercial breaks so the listeners on the American side won't usually <b>notice</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|October 1980 saw the acrimonious {{departure}} of Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware {{from the original}} line-up of the Human League at very short <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> was decided that Philip Oakey would retain the title of The Human League. Oakey also {{would be responsible for}} honouring the band's commitments to Virgin Records. One of these commitments included an imminent European tour, and the promoters threatened to sue Oakey if it was not completed as scheduled. With a hostile music press writing off The Human League, Oakey hastily set about finding replacement group members for the tour that was due to start in less than a week.|$|E

25|$|On 21 March, Patton {{ordered his}} XII Corps {{to prepare for}} an assault over the Rhine on the {{following}} night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was certainly short <b>notice,</b> <b>it</b> did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment, and other supplies forward from depots in Lorraine {{where they had been}} stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of just such an opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters to tell them what it meant.|$|E
25|$|Juba's Greek {{physician}} Euphorbus {{wrote that}} a succulent spurge {{found in the}} High Atlas was a powerful laxative. In 12 BC, Juba named this plant Euphorbia after Euphorbus, in response to Augustus dedicating a statue to Antonius Musa, Augustus's own personal physician and Euphorbus' brother. Botanist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus assigned the name Euphorbia to the entire genus in the physician's honor. Euphorbia was later called Euphorbia regisjubae ("King Juba's euphorbia") to honor the king's contributions to natural history and his role in bringing the genus to <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> is now Euphorbia obtusifolia ssp. regis-jubae. The palm tree genus Jubaea is also named after Juba.|$|E
25|$|Clementine {{gave birth}} to her fourth child, Marigold Frances Churchill, on 15 November 1918, four days after the {{official}} end of the First World War. In the early days of August 1921, the Churchills' children were entrusted to a French nursery governess in Kent, Mlle. Rose. Clementine travelled to Eaton Hall to play tennis with Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, and his family. While still under the care of Mlle. Rose, Marigold had a cold but was reported to have recovered from the illness. As the illness progressed with hardly any <b>notice,</b> <b>it</b> turned into septicaemia. Rose sent for Clementine, but the illness proved fatal on 23 August 1921, and Marigold was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery three days later.|$|E

25|$|Because April 7 was {{the second}} day of the far bloodier Battle of Shiloh, the {{campaign}} for Island No. 10 soon fell from public <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> has become memorable principally for the run of USS Carondelet past the batteries, whose passage marked the introduction of a new tactic in warfare. The use of steam for driving ships meant that they no longer had to slug it out with fixed forts. The tactic later became commonplace in the Civil War, being employed by Farragut at New Orleans, Port Hudson, Vicksburg, and Mobile, and by David D. Porter at Vicksburg. Consequently, the value of fixed fortifications was much diminished. The South did not learn this lesson, continuing to rely on forts until the end of the war, but the restored nation had to consider it when designing its defense system from 1865 on.|$|E
25|$|In England, the {{squadron}} went through an intensive training {{program with the}} Royal Air Force. On 17 October 1942, it was assigned Spitfire PR Mk XIs, and late in January 1943, it received its first A-20 Havoc. During those months {{the squadron}} participated in several maneuvers and became a very efficient organization. On 8 July, the unit was re-designated the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter). A little later, on 13 July, a reorganization took place and the A-20s, gunners, liaison pilots, {{and most of the}} observers of the squadron were transferred to the 153rd Liaison Squadron. The 12th was then equipped with P-51 Mustangs and F-6 Reconnaissance Mustangs. Late in October, the 12th Squadron was transferred from the VIII Air Support Command to the IX Fighter Command. The unit became highly mobile and proficient at changing airfields on short <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> would fly from eight English bases before moving to the Continent.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Sutherland {{was invited}} to sing Lucia di Lammermoor at the Royal Opera House in a {{production}} conducted by Tullio Serafin and staged by Franco Zeffirelli. The role of Edgardo was sung by her fellow Australian Kenneth Neate, who had replaced the scheduled tenor at short <b>notice.</b> <b>It</b> was a breakthrough for Sutherland's career, and, upon {{the completion of the}} famous Mad Scene, she had become a star. In 1960, she recorded the album The Art of the Prima Donna, which remains today one of the most recommended opera albums ever recorded: the double LP set won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Vocal Soloist in 1962. The album, a collection consisting mainly of coloratura arias, displays her seemingly effortless coloratura ability, high notes and opulent tones, as well as her exemplary trill. The album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry in 2011.|$|E
