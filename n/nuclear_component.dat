Gary Kofford, the county commissioner for Emery County in 2008, stated that talk of building a nuclear plant near Green River was just speculation after TPD had been searching for a site for over a year. An editorial in nearby Grand Junction, Colorado expressed tentative support for the project, especially in light of coal and gas plants being shut down despite growing energy demands. The Utah State Legislature approved a joint resolution endorsing nuclear power as a viable option in March 2009.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{population}} of radio galaxies is completely dominated by low-luminosity, low-excitation objects. These do not show strong nuclear emission lines [...] broad or narrow [...] they have optical continua which appear to be entirely jet-related, and their X-ray emission {{is also consistent with}} coming purely from a jet, with no heavily absorbed <b>nuclear</b> <b>component</b> in general. These objects cannot be unified with quasars, even though they include some high-luminosity objects when looking at radio emission, since the torus can never hide the narrow-line region to the required extent, and since infrared studies show that they have no hidden nuclear component: in fact there is no evidence for a torus in these objects at all. Most likely, they form a separate class in which only jet-related emission is important. At small angles to the line of sight, they will appear as BL Lac objects.|$|E

40|$|The bulge {{contribution}} to the inner density profile of a galaxy is well traced by the bulge's NIR surface brightness profile. We map the surface brightness profiles of bulges using HST/NICMOS imaging. Most bulges show <b>nuclear</b> <b>components</b> of 20 - 200 pc scales, and frequently also unresolved nuclear star clusters (< 20 pc). These <b>nuclear</b> <b>components</b> are the densest parts of bulges, and gave bulges the 'reputation' of having high stellar concentration. Actually, the Sérsic r 1 /n bulges typically have low concentrations, 1 <n< 2. 5. We cannot confirm the bi-modal distribution of bulge profile slopes reported by others, and suggest that the alleged bi-modality is related to selectively excluding/including <b>nuclear</b> <b>components</b> in low/high-n bulges...|$|R

50|$|The {{product of}} this gene is a {{component}} of the nuclear factor of activated T cells DNA-binding transcription complex. This complex consists of at least two components: a preexisting cytosolic component that translocates to the nucleus upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and an inducible <b>nuclear</b> <b>component.</b> Proteins belonging to this family of transcription factors {{play a central role in}} inducible gene transcription during immune response. The product of this gene is an inducible <b>nuclear</b> <b>component.</b> It functions as a major molecular target for the immunosuppressive drugs such as ciclosporin. Five transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been identified for this gene. Different isoforms of this protein may regulate inducible expression of different cytokine genes.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of several million pore complexes in the oocyte nuclear membrane {{and the fact}} that they appeared to admit many different molecules (insulin, bovine serum albumin, gold nanoparticles) led to the view that the pores are open channels and nuclear proteins freely enter the nucleus through the pore and must accumulate by binding to DNA or some other <b>nuclear</b> <b>component.</b> In other words, there was thought to be no specific transport mechanism.|$|E
