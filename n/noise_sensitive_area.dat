40|$|Although air trafficâ€™s {{growth rate}} has slowed in the U. S. and Europe, a {{significant}} rise is forecasted for upcoming decades. This increases {{the pressure on}} airport operators and air navigation service providers {{to find new ways}} of reducing noise levels in the vicinity of airports without adversely influencing airport capacity. Especially for airports in densely populated areas, the implementation of curved or segmented approach procedures is promising. Considering an approach scenario at which aircraft approaching into one runway inevitably overfly a <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> an alternative segmented routing that guides aircraft around these areas is advantageous. From a capacity perspective, independent runway operations are desirable and capacity-beneficial for airports with a parallel runway system. Nowadays, those independent runway operations, however, can be conducted only by utilizing straight precision approaches. Consequently, segmented approach procedures are not covered by current guidelines and have strong adverse effects on capacity as they do not allow independent runway operations. This would imply that if the noise beneficial segmented routing is utilized, the runway system could no longer be operated independently thus decreasing its capacity substantially. To tackle this issue, a concept is presented in this article to help pave the way towards capacity and noise-beneficial segmented independent parallel approach procedures...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} already a major {{constraint}} at many airports. Increase in airport capacity can often only be achieved if noise abatement measures are taken to protect people living around the airport. For active noise abatement basically two means of noise reduction exist. On the one hand, noise generated by airframe and engine can be reduced. On the other hand, noise impact can be decreased by increasing {{the distance between the}} aircraft generating the <b>noise</b> and <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> on the ground. The latter can be achieved either by lateral avoidance of such areas or by a higher vertical flight profile. The paper deals with a steeper approach profile to increase altitude of the aircraft during approach. To allow a standard 3 Â° landing and thus a higher rate of applicability the vertical approach profile is divided into 2 segments. It starts at about 8000 ft AGL with a 4, 5 Â° slope. At about 1500 ft AGL the approach slope transitions into a standard 3 Â° slope, intercepting the glide slope from above. The flyability of this approach has been tested in different fullflight training simulators of TUIfly, Condor and Lufthansa. It has been successfully tested with the following aircraft types: Airbus A 320 - 200, Airbus A 330 - 300, Airbus A 340 - 600, Airbus A 380 - 800, Boeing B 737 - 800, Boeing B 747 - 8, and Boeing B 767 - 300.

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that noise levels in hospitals are typically higher than the guidelines. This research aims to systematically investigate the sound field in critical care environment, develop the prediction models, and explore the acoustic effects on patients and staff. The Critical Care Units at two local NHS hospitals have been selected for case studies. Three core categories with plenty of interactions were identified by means of grounded theory for the acoustic environment, namely 'time-dependant sounds', 'role-dependant people' and 'departmental-dependant space', and the improvement strategies are limited but possible. Through a series of acoustic measurement, a diffuse field could be approximately assumed in the single-bed and multi-bed wards. The sound levels measured in the wards for each night are {{in excess of the}} WHO guided values by at least 20 d 8 A. For both wards and U-shaped long corridor, if the relevant simulation parameters were set up appropriately, the agreement between measured and simulated RT as well as SPL is satisfactory, suggesting the feasibility of computer simulation for such spaces. A database comprised of quadratic equations was established with a good accuracy (Â± 2. 5 d 8) to predict the sound propagation along the U-shaped long space applicable to various geometric sizes. An effective observation method was designed for noise behaviour in the healthcare environment. Amongst the observed noise sources, talking was identified with the largest number of occurrences, shortest interval and the longest duration, followed by the monitor's alarm. Lognormal distribution was determined as the most appropriate statistical distribution for noise behaviours. Finally, an agent-based acoustic model was developed to integrate noise behaviours with the acoustic parameters. It is capable of replicating the complex and dynamic acoustic environment (Â± 2 dBA) as well as conducting what-if analysis.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of the air traffic {{movements}} and the population of people living around airports, the number of awakenings due to aircraft noise has increased. ICAO has defined four research fields to reduce noise {{and one of them is}} implementation of noise abatement operational procedures. This includes different trajectory optimization methods, one of which is rerouting of trajectories around <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> Research has proven that rerouting has a positive effect on reducing the number of people getting disturbed while keeping the fuel consumption as low as possible. Until now these trajectory optimization problems focused on either a departure or an arrival trajectory. When implementing these optimized routes, it may result in a conflict with other existing routes and this is the problem that is the main focus of this research. Within this research trajectories will be combined and optimized for number of awakenings and fuel consumption while assessing the effect of terminal operations. The model that combines trajectories is based on existing models, including a point-mass model and a noise model. These are combined in a multi-objective evolutionary algorithmwhere the objectives are the number of awakenings and the fuel consumption. The results of the optimization problems are presented as Paretooptimal solutions. To contribute to the field of noise abatement terminal operations, two trajectories are combined in an optimization problem. To assure enough distance between the two trajectories the minimum separation constraint is used. When a loss of separation happens, the flight path angle of one of the trajectories is adjusted. The designed model is used to optimize four trajectory optimization problems. The first being a departure trajectory, this is the current Spijkerboor standard instrumental departure that departs from runway 24 at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The second problem is the current night standard terminal arrival route starting at sea and landing on runway 18 R at Schiphol. For the third optimization problem the two trajectories of the previous optimization problems are combined with keeping the minimumseparation constraint in mind. The final case study was used to focus more on the effect of the minimum separation constraint. From the departure optimization problem can be concluded that there is a big diversity in the vertical and horizontal trajectory between the minimum fuel andminimumawakening solution. For the arrival optimization problem the difference between these two solutions is not significant. The vertical trajectory is for both solutions almost the same, the main difference is caused by the ground trajectory. When combining the trajectories the results of the objective functions for the combined problemare the sum of the arrival and departure objective functions. This results in a bias to the departure trajectory because these numbers are atleast twice the value compared to the arrival trajectory. This also results in the arrival trajectory always being created around the departure trajectory. From the final case study can be concluded that when designing the trajectories the influence of the minimum separation constraint is mostly on the vertical profile of the departure trajectory. Also can be observed that small rerouting of the trajectories sometimes is needed to give both trajectories enough space to cross each other.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{performance}} of our A 320 during novel advanced required navigation performance (RNP) procedures which contain a fixed radius turn that delivers the aircraft onto a short ILS precision final. The approaches were flown automatically with guidance and autothrust as computed by the flight management system. Main areas of interest of these flight trials were the impact of the use of the described ARINC 424 coding options onto (a) the performance of the speed profile for arrival time optimization (b) the vertical path during the RNP part of the procedure and (c) the performance of the autoland capability after a curved transition onto an ILS final. Most recently, the aviation community recognized the potential for exploiting additional benefits from precise area navigations systems and introduced Performance Based Navigation (PBN) through ICAO Doc 9613 for new kinds of en-route, departure and approach procedures. RNP is part of the PBN concept. Within the PBN concept exists the possibility to incorporate turns with a precise ground track. These turns are called fixed radius transitions and are coded as radius-to-fix (RF) path terminators in the ARINC 424 database. They offer the advantage of repeatable ground tracks during the turn and thus more freedom for the procedure designer when route planning in dense traffic, high terrain or environments witch obstacles. Moreover, socio-economic factors can be included - such as circumnavigating <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> with guaranteed track keeping performance precluding stray aircraft. Additionally, ARINC 424 allows specifying altitude constraints at waypoints and vertical path angles for each RNP segment terminating at such a waypoint. Whilst offering these benefits, such advanced RNP approach operations are still non-precision procedures and automatic landings cannot be performed after their successful completion. Hence, to enable automatic landings and to extract maximum benefits from RNP operations, they must transition into a precision final approach segment provided by any precision landing system (ILS, GLS, MLS). This is often called RNP to xLS (or RNP 2 xLS). Moreover, the vertical path angle feature is currently largely unused and unexplored, except for the final approach segment of an RNP approach. The approaches were entirely flown using the auto flight guidance in managed mode and with auto-thrust activated. We show supporting evidence that RNP 2 ILS approaches can be safely flown all the way to an automatic landing using the flight management guidance computer and the auto flight control system. In order to fly the desired path with vertical path angle during the RNP initial and intermediate approach, a separate mode (such as LNAV/VNAV) different from the singular approach mode would need to be implemented in the aircraft. Additionally, operators currently apply stabilization criteria following which the aircraft must be established on a straight final with the correct sink rate, fully configured at 1000 ft above aerodrome level. For landings in low visibility conditions, more stringent criteria are often applied. An operational implementation of RNP 2 ILS approaches with a curved final intercept would require a rephrasing of the criteria to include a concept, such as RNP established...|$|R

It is firstly shown that, in continuous-time domain, what the conventional repetitive learning algorithm does is equivalent to adapting all {{the values of the}} periodic uncertainties over one period. Such an endeavor means very high bandwidth of the learning algorithm as an infinite number of parameters need to be adapted, which puts a great demand on microprocessor memory in implementing the algorithms. At the same time, such a formulation also makes the algorithm very <b>sensitive</b> to <b>noise</b> as it treats the values of the periodic uncertainties over the same period totally independent from each other, just like a random noise. Based on this {{new perspective}} on the <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> problem of repetitive algorithm, a simple remedy is provided for the recently proposed adaptive robust repetitive control (ARRC) design by recognizing the physical dependence of the values of the periodic uncertainties over the same period and using certain known basis functions to capture these physical dependence.

The net results are that, not only the number of the parameters to be adapted is reduced drastically, but also the <b>noise</b> <b>sensitive</b> problem of the conventional learning algorithm is overcome. The precision motion control of a linear motor drive system is used as an application example.
