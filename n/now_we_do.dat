6000|$|... "I {{also have}} had {{faith in their}} amiability," [...] rejoined Young; [...] "but some of us, I fear, have tried them too severely. I don't like the looks they {{sometimes}} give us <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> wrong at the first in treating them as servants." ...|$|R

6000|$|Not {{always was}} the Kangaroo as <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> behold him, but a Different Animal with four short legs. He was gray {{and he was}} woolly, and his pride was inordinate: he danced on an outcrop {{in the middle of}} Australia, and he went to the Little God Nqa at six before breakfast, saying, [...] "Make me {{different}} from all other animals by five this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{seemed a}} great deal at the time. We were in want of the money--it was a good while ago, when we first married. Our means were very small then, but {{fortunately}} that has changed rather for the better. We had the chance; it really seemed a big sum, and I am afraid we jumped at it. My husband had expectations which have partly come into effect, so that <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> well enough. But meanwhile the picture went.' ...|$|E

"They {{know that}} it has been here always," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "but they most of them think that it is blocked up <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> try to, Andrew and I, but the masonry gave way.

The black broad-cloth and silk hose will pass, but why have you not a sword at your side?" ...|$|E
60|$|About a mile {{distant from}} the spot on which those {{sleepers}} rested, there grew another small bush, and under its sheltering boughs, in the snuggest conceivable hole, nestled a grouse, or prairie hen, also sound asleep, with its head lost in feathers, and its whole rotund aspect conveying the idea of extreme comfort and good living. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not draw the reader's attention to that bird because of its rarity, {{but because of the}} fact that it was unwittingly instrumental in influencing the fortunes of the two sleepers above referred to.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{deny that}} there is by this act given, or that under this act there can be given, to the {{government}} of India, a power of dividing its unity into two parts, each of which shall separately be a unity and possess the power given to the whole. Yet, my Lords, an agreement was made between him and Mr. Wheler, that he (Mr. Hastings) should have every power, civil and military, in the upper provinces, and that Mr. Wheler should enjoy equal authority in the lower ones.|$|E

"For a {{very long}} time, we've {{wanted to do a}} {{collaboration}} album where we could include people we're close with or friends with and who we gel with musically and socially. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> that and it's pretty seamless. Axe to Falldoesn't feel like a big rock record where the guest vocalists come out and a spotlight is being thrown on them. It's much more involved than that. It's much more refined."

[...] "He has to stay there 'cause his father and mother's dead, an' perhaps I'd been there, 'cept for Uncle Dan'l.

6000|$|Just {{after he}} had rushed out of the nursery, Junkie burst in. The boy was in his element <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not mean {{that he was a}} {{salamander}} and revelled in fire and smoke, but he had read of fires and heard of them till his own little soul was ablaze with a desire to save some one from a fire--any one--somehow, or anyhow! Finding, like the rest, that he could scarcely breathe, he made but one swift circuit of the room. In doing so he tumbled on the chair on which the cause of all the mischief still sat smoking, but undeniably [...] "dood!" ...|$|E

But I do not see that it would do any good <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not know who the men were who were plotting or whom they were plotting against. But one thing is pretty certain, they will not try to carry out their plans now, for they cannot tell how much of their conversation was overheard, and their fear of discovery will put an end for the present to this scheme of theirs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Logano said {{in victory}} lane that his win [...] "feels so good. I've never felt this good about a win before. There {{was so much}} on the line and {{everyone}} brings their A-game when it comes to winning championships and this team did it. Man, this feels so good. I had a good restart there at the end and holding off Kyle to try to get this thing into Miami.

60|$|<b>Now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> talk {{first about}} the disease in cases of bodily breakdown; and that for an {{excellent}} reason. Because, though there may be doubt about {{the way in which}} the body broke down, there is no doubt at all about the shape in which it should be built up again. No doctor proposes to produce a new kind of man, with a new arrangement of eyes or limbs. The hospital, by necessity, may send a man home with one leg less: but it will not (in a creative rapture) send him home with one leg extra. Medical science is content with the normal human body, and only seeks to restore it.|$|E
60|$|<b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} whether we have made it obvious to the reader that Lawrence Armstrong's kindliness of nature embraced not only the human race but the whole animal kingdom. At all events {{it is true that}} {{wherever}} he came in contact with the lower animals he managed by some species of fascination to gain their affections. The mode of fascination began, no doubt, with their stomachs, but this does not alter the fact. Among other creatures Lawrence had gained the affections of Quashy's steed, and also of Manuela's and Pedro's horses, as well as his own, by means of sugar. With this simple appliance he went into the hollow, and held out his hand.|$|E

After all, he is your father in the flesh, {{and it was not}} for you to raise your hand against him. 'Tis what you have felt, and I am glad you should have felt it, for it proves your worthiness.

30|$|Now, if you {{consider}} our national values, cultural values, historical friendship, let’s say brotherhood, the basic reason that we are assisting the Syrians at the moment starts from here and goes on up to politics at higher levels including the Prime Minister [then Erdoğan]. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> have these basic values. It is difficult to explain our alms-giving institution abroad. Everyone gives money to their poor without expecting anything in return. Isn’t that so? Economically, in fact, this is not rational. <b>Now,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> something under these circumstances and they came. This is our basic justification: people should not suffer (ML focus group interview, Ankara, February 2014).|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>now</b> {{turned our}} {{attention}} to the whale, which had dived again. As it was <b>now</b> loose, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> not know, of course, where it would come up, so we lay still awhile. Very soon up he came, not far from us, and as fierce as ever.|$|R
60|$|So far we {{have been}} praying to our Heavenly Father, first as a Father, then as a King, then as an Inspirer, then as a Giver; and next we pray to Him as a Forgiver--'Forgive us our trespasses.' We have been confessing in these four {{petitions}} what God's goodwill to man is; what God wishes man to be, how man ought to live and believe. And then comes the recollection of sin. We must confess what God's law is before we can confess that we have broken it; and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> confess that we have broken it. We know that God is our Father. How often have we forgotten that He is a father; how often have we forgotten to be good fathers ourselves.|$|E
60|$|We {{should read}} history as little {{critically}} as {{we consider the}} landscape, and be more interested by the atmospheric tints and various lights and shades which the intervening spaces create, than by its groundwork and composition. It is the morning now turned evening and seen in the west,--the same sun, but a new light and atmosphere. Its beauty is like the sunset; not a fresco painting on a wall, flat and bounded, but atmospheric and roving or free. In reality, history fluctuates as {{the face of the}} landscape from morning to evening. What is of moment is its hue and color. Time hides no treasures; we want not its then, but its <b>now.</b> <b>We</b> <b>do</b> not complain that the mountains in the horizon are blue and indistinct; they are the more like the heavens.|$|E

Well, it is settled in his own fashion, and <b>now</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not yield up this woman, our prisoner, save on your royal promise that no harm shall come to her in body. As for the rest, it is your business. Make a cook-maid of her if you will, only then I think her tongue would clear the kitchen.
