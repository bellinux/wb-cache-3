5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara's {{stint as}} Juventus manager, however, {{proved to be}} unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table {{at the end of}} January 2010, leading to the {{dismissal}} of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport Alessio Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.|$|E

Shortly after Ross enlisted in his brother's company as a private, Governor Edward Clark requested he instead proceed immediately to the Indian Territory to negotiate treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes so they would <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Union Army.

Upon reaching the Washita Agency, he discovered the Confederate commissioners had already signed a preliminary treaty with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> cause of his employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm {{thought that they were}} a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E

5|$|According to {{his manager}} at the time, Harry Redknapp, Carrick's {{difficulty}} {{at the start of}} his career was mainly physical and he lost almost two seasons to injuries because of his rapid growth. He made his debut for West Ham in a 1–1 away draw with Jokerit in the UEFA Intertoto Cup on 24 July 1999. His league debut came five weeks later on 28 August, when he replaced Rio Ferdinand in a 3–0 victory over Bradford City at Valley Parade. In November 1999, Carrick was sent on a one-month loan to Swindon Town and made his first appearance for them in a 0–0 draw at home with Norwich City. He scored his first ever professional career goal in a 2–1 defeat at home to Charlton Athletic on 23 November. He scored once more during his loan spell, netting in a 1–1 draw at home to Walsall on 4 December. Although he impressed during his spell he could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> team find a much-needed win during his 6 outings, playing his final game for them in a 3–0 defeat at Manchester City on 18 December. In February 2000, he was sent on loan again, this time to Birmingham City, making just two appearances for the Blues. Carrick returned to Upton Park and scored his first goal for West Ham United, scoring the first in a 5–0 home win over Coventry City on 22 April. During his first season he was voted as West Ham United's Young Player of the Year.|$|E

One conservation priority is to maintain habitat between marsh patches in order to promote gene flow and preserve genetic diversity.|$|E

25|$|A {{block to}} the west of the {{proposed}} subway line, the Manhattan section of the Third Avenue Elevated, the only other elevated line in the area, closed on May 13, 1955, and was demolished in 1956.

25|$|The Ottomans {{entered the}} Krbava field through the lowest and narrowest local {{mountain}} pass of Gorica, unlike {{two years earlier}} through the Vrpile pass where they suffered a huge defeat. Before the battle, Hadım Yakup Pasha ordered the execution of Christian captives near Jelšani (present-day Jošan) {{so that they could}} <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Croatians in the midst of battle. After a meeting with the commanders, he sent a part of his army, around 3,000 cavalrymen, to set up an ambush in the forest near the Krbava field.|$|E
25|$|Bülow {{was also}} {{disappointed}} with Wintzingerode whose 18,000 soldiers remained completely inert in Germany.

25|$|Long term {{consequences}} of the Crusade also includes increased Islamic fanaticism and no more clearly is this seen then in the numerous Beyliks set up in Western Anatolia after 1204, particularly the Beylik of the Ottomans, Osman I's domain. Later, the Crusades of Nicopolis in 1396 and Varna in 1444 designed to aid the Byzantines made Constantinople appear as a magnet for Frankish Knights to launch their zealous attacks — this did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines in the long run.|$|E
25|$|No {{official}} {{attempts to}} create an orthography have been made, nevertheless there are countless short stories, poems and songs written in Erzgebirgisch. The Sächsischer Heimatverein guidelines to writing in Erzgebirgisch were established in 1937, but are by and large not respected {{by the majority of}} authors. This means that linguistic analysis of this dialect has to be done in a field work setting with native speakers. An additional threat to Erzgebirgisch is the popular misconception that Erzgebirgisch was a hillbilly variety of Saxonian, which does <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|He was {{renowned for}} his generosity, {{answering}} all pleas {{for help from}} poor Roman families with large cash gifts from his private revenues. When he was short on money, those who would be admitted to an audience would often be instructed by prelates not to mention their financial woes, as Benedict would inevitably feel guilty that he could <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> needy at the time. He also depleted the Vatican's official revenues with large-scale charitable expenditure during World War I.

25|$|Reilly {{would have}} an even greater success in January 1904, when he and Chinese {{engineer}} acquaintance Ho Liangshung allegedly stole the Port Arthur harbour defence plans for the Japanese Navy.

Yet the stolen plans did <b>not</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Japanese much. More than 31,000 Russians ultimately perished defending Port Arthur, but Japanese losses were much higher, losses that nearly undermined their war effort.|$|E
