25|$|On August 4, 2010, the defendant-intervenors filed a <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> to the Ninth Circuit. Imperial County, {{which was}} {{denied the right}} to {{intervene}} as a defendant, appealed that denial and Walker's decision. In January 2011, the Ninth Circuit dismissed the Imperial County appeal for lack of standing. Walker cast doubt on whether the defendant-intervenors had legal standing to appeal. If they lack standing, only the named defendants could appeal, and the principal named defendants, Governor Schwarzenegger and Attorney General Brown, refused to participate in the defense. A California Court of Appeals dismissed an emergency request by the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal organization, to force Schwarzenegger and Brown to defend the case on appeal without a hearing, followed by the California Supreme Court on September 8, 2010, who denied without explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{requirements}} <b>of</b> filing <b>notices</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> and the proof-of-service requirements of Illinois Supreme Court Rule 12 (b) (3). Illinois Supreme Court Rule 12 (b) (3) has what can only be called “curious, perjurious requirements. ” They are curious because, in conjunction with Rule 373, they require an affiant to state under penalty of perjury that he or she has personal knowledge of events that have not yet occurred. They are perjurious because they require the affiant to state under penalty of perjury they already performed an act when in fact they did not and could not. In order to understand the perjurious requirements of Rule 12 (b) (3) several factors must first be considered separately: the Rule itself, the nature of affidavits, and the statutory definition of perjury. When combined, it is clear that the Rule is tantamount to requiring an affiant to commit perjury...|$|R

40|$|Should a court vacate either its own {{decision}} or {{the decision of}} a lower court at parties 2 ̆ 7 request so that, with such 2 ̆ 2 vacatur on consent, 2 ̆ 2 settlement will occur?

Nor is it happenstance that state and federal case law addressing this question has suddenly mushroomed and that the United States Supreme Court has agreed to hear cases with various iterations of this issue.
