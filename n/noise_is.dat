5|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> used {{as basic}} tonal {{material}} in electronic music.|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
5|$|In music, <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> {{variously}} {{described as}} unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. <b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> {{an important component}} of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|Use of <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> {{central to}} the {{development}} of experimental music and avant-garde music in the mid 20th century. <b>Noise</b> <b>was</b> used in important, new ways.|$|R
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{electronic}} {{white noise}} machines became commercially available. These are used alone {{to provide a}} pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise, a similar role to conventional background music. This usage can have health applications {{in the case of}} individuals struggling with over-stimulation or sensory processing disorder. Also, white <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals.|$|E
5|$|Right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> {{heard that}} sounds like {{somebody}} knocking at a door. It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in which subjects judged aircraft noises in the presence of road traffic background noise. Two different techniques for presenting the background <b>noises</b> <b>were</b> evaluated. For one technique, the background <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> continuous over the whole of a test session. For the other, the background <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> changed with each aircraft noise. A range of aircraft noise levels and traffic <b>noise</b> levels <b>were</b> presented to simulate typical indoor levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Acoustical noises or {{background}} noises {{degrade the}} quality and intelligibility of the speech signal. The background <b>noises</b> <b>are</b> random in nature {{and it is important}} to classify such noises. Hence background <b>noises</b> <b>are</b> characterised based on statistical properties like mean, variance,co-variance etc. The autocorrelation function which is a time invariant function is used for classifying such noises. The SNR for various <b>noises</b> <b>is</b> estimated...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine subjective response to aircraft noise in different road traffic backgrounds. In addition, two laboratory techniques for presenting the aircraft noise with the background <b>noise</b> <b>were</b> evaluated. For one technique, the background <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> continuous over an entire test session; for the other, the background <b>noise</b> level <b>was</b> changed with each aircraft noise during a session. Subjective response to aircraft <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> found to decrease with increasing background noise level, {{for a range of}} typical indoor noise levels. Subjective response was found to be highly correlated with the Noise Pollution Level (NPL) measurement scale...|$|R
5|$|Titan's {{components}} are air-cooled by heat sinks, {{but the air}} is chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> so loud that hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{visit the}} Area 51 {{installation}} in Nevada {{after receiving a}} tip from an inside source concerning alien spacecraft. As they drive on the highway, the agents are surrounded by Jeeps carrying soldiers led by a Man in Black named Morris Fletcher (Michael McKean). A rumbling <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> heard as a mysterious craft flies overhead and a bright light from the object passes over them. Mulder and Fletcher find that their minds have been swapped into each other's bodies, but nobody else present is aware of this. Fletcher and Scully depart, watched by the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> found to contain a grainy image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E

5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|Phase {{truncation}} spurs can {{be reduced}} substantially {{by the introduction of}} white gaussian noise prior to truncation. The so-called dither <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC noise floor tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Protein {{structures}} have to {{be represented}} in some coordinate-independent space to make them comparable. This is typically achieved by constructing a sequence-to-sequence matrix or series of matrices that encompass comparative metrics: rather than absolute distances relative to a fixed coordinate space. An intuitive representation is the distance matrix, which is a two-dimensional matrix containing all pairwise distances between some subset of the atoms in each structure (such as the alpha carbons). The matrix increases in dimensionality {{as the number of}} structures to be simultaneously aligned increases. Reducing the protein to a coarse metric such as secondary structure elements (SSEs) or structural fragments can also produce sensible alignments, despite the loss of information from discarding distances, as <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> also discarded. Choosing a representation to facilitate computation is critical to developing an efficient alignment mechanism.|$|E

In the first part, existence and uniqueness problems are investigated, and relationships between the studied <b>noises</b> <b>are</b> analysed. Moreover, a new algorithm for their simulation is proposed and validated. Finally, new asymmetric bounded <b>noises</b> <b>are</b> proposed. In the second part of this work, we numerically investigated the effects of the statistical fluctuations affecting parameters of some pharmacokinetic models by modeling these stochastic parametric oscillations by means of the above-mentioned symmetric and asymmetric bounded noises...|$|R

25|$|White <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> {{a random}} signal (or process) {{with a flat}} power {{spectral}} density. In other words, the signal contains equal power within a fixed bandwidth at any center frequency. White <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> considered analogous to white light which contains all frequencies.|$|E

25|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>is</b> a term {{often used}} to refer to an {{unwanted}} sound. In science and engineering, <b>noise</b> <b>is</b> an undesirable component that obscures a wanted signal. However, in sound perception it can often be used to identify the source of a sound and is an important component of timbre perception (see above).|$|E

40|$|Simultaneous {{switching}} <b>noise</b> <b>was</b> {{calculated for}} a number of CMOS drivers switching together. CMOS receiver noise immunity and the feed through of simultaneous switching noise from a D. C. "ON" driver were studied. The effects of skewing output driver switching on the simultaneous switching <b>noise</b> <b>were</b> explained. The performance trade-offs in using a damping resistor to minimize switching <b>noise</b> <b>were</b> analyzed. A distributed lumped equivalent model has been developed to model signal propagation over noisy reference planes, and thereby to accurately predict the overall noise levels in a system.
