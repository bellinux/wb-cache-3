5000|$|There are {{actually}} two engagement times {{to consider in}} an electromagnetic coupling. The first one is {{the time it takes}} for a coil to develop a magnetic field, strong enough to pull in an armature. Within this, there are two factors to consider. The first one is the amount <b>of</b> <b>ampere</b> <b>turns</b> in a coil, which will determine the strength of a magnetic field. The second one is air gap, which is the space between the armature and the coil shell or rotor. Magnetic lines of flux diminish quickly in the air. The further away the attractive piece is from the coil, the longer it will take for that piece to actually develop enough magnetic force to be attracted and pull in to overcome the air gap. For very high cycle applications, floating armatures can be used that rest lightly against the coil shell or rotor. In this case, the air gap is zero; but, more importantly the response time is very consistent since there is no air gap to overcome. Air gap is an important consideration especially with a fixed armature design because as the unit wears over many cycles of engagement the armature and the rotor will create a larger air gap which will change the engagement time of the clutch. In high cycle applications, where registration is important, even the difference of 10-15 milliseconds can make a difference, in registration of a machine. Even in a normal cycle application, this is important because a new machine that has accurate timing can eventually see a [...] "drift" [...] in its accuracy as the machine gets older.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Synchronous {{reluctance}} {{machine with}} simple salient rotor {{is known to}} have poor power factor because of its poor reactance ratio. This study presents the use of an auxiliary winding attached to a balanced capacitor to improve the effective reactance ratio as well as the performance characteristics of synchronous reluctance machine. A unique feature of this configuration is that although the machine runs at synchronous speed, the effective reactance ratio of the machine can be improved by appropriate sizing of the capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding, with the constraint <b>of</b> the <b>ampere</b> <b>turn</b> rating <b>of</b> the auxiliary winding. The operational characteristics of a simple salient rotor synchronous reluctance machine equipped with this configuration were investigated and shown to have a desirable performance. How the effective reactance ratio, power factor and airgap flux distribution depend on the size of capacitor attached to the auxiliary winding is determined using a simplified mathematical model of the system. Analytical results and experimental measurements are in good agreement, and demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the configuratio...|$|R
