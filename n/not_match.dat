Beauchamp's shoe did <b>not</b> <b>match</b> a track found outside Sharp's house the morning of the murder.

5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did <b>not</b> <b>match</b> Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.|$|E
