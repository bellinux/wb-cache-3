5|$|Pest {{control is}} at least as old as agriculture, as {{there has always been a}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 500 AD in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were {{introduced}} into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed about any of the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the base operating {{during a time of}} war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|All sharks <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for}} them to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People must remember {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> track of multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; {{it is no longer}} always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea {{with the exception of one}} or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their skin damp.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming {{that many of those}} first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to retain moisture. In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but they also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most {{able to do this}} of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have}} been simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, gold {{is added to the}} stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip is related to the distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more gold is earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E

5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|In Fallout Shelter, players {{build and}} {{manage their own}} Vault as an Overseer – the leader and {{coordinator}} of their Vault. Players guide and direct {{the citizens of the}} Vault, and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them happy through meeting their needs such as power, food, and water. They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their ability to generate different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks. The number of dwellers can be increased by waiting for new dwellers from the wasteland to arrive or by pairing a male and a female dweller in living quarters to produce babies.|$|E
5|$|Jacqui, {{along with}} Rhys then {{gets a new}} job at Chez Chez, a new bar that is owned by Cheryl and her brother Brendan Brady (Emmett J Scanlan). Jacqui and Rhys unknowingly meet on an {{internet}} dating website and fall for each other. Horrified when they find out, they kiss. Jacqui's cousin Bart McQueen (Jonny Clarke) moves into the McQueen household and causes a rift when he steals money from her. This causes Jacqui {{to move in with}} Rhys. Jacqui meets gangster Danny and they begin dating despite her feelings for Rhys. She cheats on Danny with Rhys, leaving Danny furious. Jacqui tells Rhys they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their affair secret. However she ends their relationship as Jacqui catches Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) and Rhys having sex. Revengefully, Jacqui gets intoxicated and beds Gilly. She later tells Rhys that Gilly has sexually assaulted her, reports him to the police and he is charged.|$|E

5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E
5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, black men and women were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> and display records.|$|E
