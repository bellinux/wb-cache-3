Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|Tungusic, Korean and Japonic {{languages}} {{but this}} view is <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as obsolete.

5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until {{they were willing to}} commit suicide by drowning; however he is <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{the long}} term, however, the British backed Iraq and {{rejected}} an international {{inquiry into the}} killings, fearing that this may provoke further massacres against Christians. They also did not insist on punishing the offenders, who were <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as heroes by Iraqis. The official British stance was to defend the Iraqi government for its perseverance and patience {{in dealing with the}} crisis and to attribute the massacres to rogue army units. A report on the battle of Dirabun blames the Assyrians, defends the actions of the Iraqi Army, and commends Sidqi as a good officer.|$|E

5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of running the show, given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{since the}} trans-Neptunian region was first charted {{have shown that}} the region now called the Kuiper belt is not the point of origin of short-period comets, but that they instead derive from a linked population called the scattered disc. The scattered disc was created when Neptune migrated outward into the proto-Kuiper belt, which at the time was much closer to the Sun, and left in its wake a population of dynamically stable objects that could never be affected by its orbit (the Kuiper belt proper), and a population whose perihelia are close enough that Neptune can still disturb them as it travels around the Sun (the scattered disc). Because the scattered disc is dynamically active and the Kuiper belt relatively dynamically stable, the scattered disc is <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as the most likely point of origin for periodic comets.|$|E
5|$|The militant suffragettes, {{who were}} at one point public enemies, were <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as fierce {{nationalist}} and patriots. Old foes became allies and vice versa. Lloyd George was now referred to as 'that great Welshman' while Labours' Kier Hardie, the WSPU's staunchest defender before the war, was lambasted for his pacifist stance. There were still those in the suffragette movement who wished to keep pushing the agenda of emancipation. Some members of the WSPU broke away to form the Suffragettes of the WSPU (SWSPU), amongst their members were Conway-born Helena Jones, who continued to campaign for women's votes and was a columnist in the Suffragists News Sheet.|$|E

5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of good works and prayers for the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected burial inside the church, which were <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of burial aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for burial and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired place of burial. From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and the virtues of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus casuarius {{is one of}} a few lambeosaurines, {{along with}} Lambeosaurus lambei, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri and H. altispinus, to have had {{surviving}} fossilized juveniles assigned to it. Juveniles are harder to assign to species, because at a young age they lack the distinctive larger crests of adults. As they age, lambeosaurine crests tend to grow and become more prominent come maturity. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, over fifty articulated specimens have been found, coming from many different genera. Among them, juveniles are hard to identify at the species level. Earlier, four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation's area, when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa. The smallest specimens were identified as Tetragonosaurus, <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> as a synonym of Procheneosaurus, and the largest skeletons were called either Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus; an adult was identified as Parasaurolophus. Small lambeosaurines from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation were referred to Cheneosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Free traders, {{independent}} of the Hudson's Bay Company and outside its jurisdiction, developed extensive commerce with the United States, making Saint Paul the principal entrepôt and link {{to the outside world}} for the Selkirk Settlement. The trade developed by and along the trails connecting Fort Garry with Saint Paul stimulated commerce, contributed to the settlement of Minnesota and North Dakota in the United States, and accelerated the settlement of Canada {{to the west of the}} rugged barrier known as the Canadian Shield. For a time, this cross-border trade even threatened Canada's control of its western territories. The threat diminished after completion of transcontinental trade routes both north and south of the border, and the transportation corridor through which the trails once ran declined in importance. That corridor has <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> a resurgence of traffic, carried by more modern means of transport than the crude ox carts that once travelled the Red River Trails.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} arc, Air, Yukito's final wish to save Misuzu's life is heard. The {{timeline}} of the Dream arc has been reset, {{although it is}} <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> through the viewpoint of a crow Misuzu finds and names Sora. New things are revealed that were not seen following Yukito in the Dream arc. After Misuzu finds Sora and brings him back home, her condition worsens and eventually she forgets even who Haruko is. Misuzu's father, Keisuke Tachibana, shows up during this arc wanting to take Misuzu back to his home, but Haruko pleads with him to grant her more time, and they agree on extending the time for three more days. After the three days pass, Keisuke comes back and sees the love between Misuzu and Haruko; he decides to let them stay together. The remainder of this arc has Misuzu and Haruko spending time together like mother and daughter, culminating in Misuzu's death.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's frankness and {{indifference}} for rank, so admired by Anne earlier in their friendship, was <b>now</b> <b>seen</b> to be intrusive. Unlike most {{women of the}} time—many of whom did not have influence with their own husbands—Sarah had a powerful intimacy with the two most powerful men in the country, Marlborough and Godolphin. Godolphin, though a great friend of Sarah's, had even considered refusing high office after Anne's accession, preferring to live quietly {{and away from the}} political side of Sarah, who was bossy, interfering, and presumed to tell him what to do when Marlborough was away. Sarah, although a woman in a man's world of national and international politics, was always ready to give her advice; express her opinions; antagonize with outspoken censure; and insist on having her say on every possible occasion. However, she had a charm and vivaciousness which was admired by many; and she could easily delight those she met with her wit.|$|E
