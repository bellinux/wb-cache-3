5|$|The Mongols {{executed}} Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan nobles {{with the}} traditional Mongol caveat reserved for royalty and nobility: without shedding blood. Mstislav and his nobles were buried and suffocated under the Mongol general's victory platform at the victory feast. Meanwhile, Mstislav the Bold managed to reach {{the western side of}} the Dnieper with what remained of his army. To stop the Mongols from crossing to the western side of the Dnieper, Mstislav destroyed all the boats he could find.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 122* Hector Hugh Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 84. After the battle, the people of Rus trembled in fear of this unknown scourge who had emerged from the frontier and destroyed the flower of their army. However, the Mongols were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> conquer, and merely marched east after plundering.|$|E

25|$|Taft is {{mentioned}} in the 2015 novel The Madagaskar Plan, an alternative history in which the United States remains isolationist allowing Nazi Germany to conquer Europe and Africa. In the novel Taft wins the 1952 Presidential Election. Without a European war, Dwight Eisenhower does not become a revered general and thus is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> defeat Taft for nomination.|$|E

6000|$|That was all; but {{it meant}} a good deal, for the voices were kind, and the eyes met full of that affection which makes words of little consequence.

25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially sensitive issue for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women are <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> be looked at. Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E

Bedford Falls is named Pottersville and is a less congenial place.

25|$|Xerxes {{was pleased}} with her advice and while he already held her in great esteem he now praised her further. Despite this, he gave orders to follow {{the advice of the}} rest of his commanders. Xerxes thought that at the naval battle of Artemisium his men acted like cowards because he was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> watch them. But this time he would watch the battle himself to ensure they would act bravely.|$|E
25|$|In fall 1958 {{she served}} an {{internship}} at the United Nations as secretary for Leo Rosenthal, a UN photographer. Her {{experience at the}} UN showed her {{that many of the}} ambassadors were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> solve the world’s problems but rather were engaged in power politics and manipulation of the world’s economies. Leaving after three months made her depressed, with the opinion that to solve the world’s problems people would need to change their concept of themselves and of God.|$|E
25|$|The British press {{criticized the}} relief force for {{arriving}} two days late, {{but it was}} later argued that the Mahdi's forces had good intelligence, and if the camel corps had advanced earlier, the final attack on Khartoum would also have come earlier. Finally, the boats sent were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> relieve Gordon, who was not expected to agree to abandon the city, and the small force and limited supplies on board could have offered scant military support for the besieged in any case.|$|E

And together Hikari and Mao will show the world that their newfound love for each other is what makes them true champions.|$|E
25|$|Excessive {{intervention}} by a tribunal is {{a breach of}} the fair hearing requirement. The principle behind this rule was elucidated succinctly by Justice Yong Pung How. He stated that since Singapore's justice system is adversarial and not inquisitorial, when hearing evidence a tribunal may seek clarification on points in the evidence which are not clear, but must at all times avoid descending into the arena and joining in the fray. The tribunal is there to judge as best it can and is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> supplement the prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Fifty years later, Doro {{returns to}} the seed village. His {{relationship}} with Anyanwu has deteriorated, {{and one of the}} only things keeping him from killing her is her successful marriage to Isaac. He has come home because he senses that Anyanwu’s daughter, Nweke, is fully coming into her powers. During her transition, Nweke attacks Anyanwu. Trying to protect Anyanwu, Isaac accidentally kills Nweke and suffers a heart attack. Anyanwu realizes she is too weak to heal Isaac and he dies. Afraid that Doro will kill her now that Isaac is <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> protect her, Anyanwu transforms into an animal and runs away.|$|E

25|$|The colonists did {{not object}} that the taxes were high; they were {{actually}} low. They objected {{to the fact that}} they had no representation in the Parliament, and thus no voice concerning legislation that affected them. Benjamin Franklin testified in Parliament in 1766 that Americans already contributed heavily to the defense of the Empire. He said that local governments had raised, outfitted, and paid 25,000 soldiers to fight France—as many as Britain itself sent—and spent many millions from American treasuries doing so in the French and Indian War alone. London had to deal with 1,500 politically well-connected British Army soldiers. The decision was to keep them on active duty with full pay, but they had to be stationed somewhere. Stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable, so the decision was made to station them in America and have the Americans pay them. The soldiers had no military mission; they were <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> defend the colonies because there was no threat to the colonies.|$|E
25|$|Uhura recognizes Curate Prime as Gary Mitchell, {{a friend}} of James T. Kirk, who had been granted {{formidable}} mental power after passing through the galactic barrier forty years earlier. Insanely believing himself a living god, Mitchell was defeated by Kirk in the real timeline; in the altered timeline, with Kirk <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> stop him, Mitchell was able to kill {{the captain of the}} Enterprise – in this case, Christopher Pike – and take control of the United Federation of Planets, refounding it as the Galactic Order. As they escape into the ship, a fleet of Kittrick's allies, led by Captain Galt (Herbert Jefferson, Jr.) of the free ship Liberty, engages the Conqueror, with Curate Prime leading a fleet of his own to destroy Kittrick and his rebellion. While Chekov and Harriman take control of the Conqueror, Uhura transports to the surface. Mitchell follows her, believing her to be Chekov/Kittrick, and tortures her, demanding his location. Charlie Evans steps in to protect her, using his Thasian-granted powers to battle the godlike Mitchell. Beaten, Mitchell transports Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) – the first woman Evans had ever met, when he was taken aboard the Enterprise – to distract him, letting off one last burst of energy before escaping to his flagship. Angered and weakened, Mitchell orders the firing of his ship's Omega device, which will destroy both the captured Conqueror and the planet.|$|E
25|$|With the South African tour {{cancelled}} {{a new one}} {{was arranged}} to Ceylon and Pakistan, which was in political turmoil {{that resulted in the}} fall of President Ayub Khan and imposition of martial law by his successor General Yahya Khan. After a few easy-going matches in Ceylon the tour match against the West Pakistan Governor's XI saw play abandoned after 25 overs, there were no other tour matches and all the Tests were affected by political demonstrations against the military regime. In the First Test at Lahore Cowdrey won the toss and made exactly 100, his 22nd Test century to match Wally Hammond's England record. England made 309, dismissed Pakistan for 209 and Cowdrey declared the second innings at 225/9 to give them 326 to win, but Pakistan made 203/5 for a draw. Saeed Ahmed won the toss in the Second Test at Dacca in East Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, where there was rioting and gunfire around the team hotel. Pakistan made 246, which was matched by England's 274, thanks to D'Oliveira's 114 not out. Pakistan took 101 overs to make 196/5 and a token declaration left England to make 33/0. Cowdrey won the toss again in the Third Test at Karachi, but there were riots on the first two days by fans who wanted Hanif Mohammad as captain instead of Saeed. England piled up 502/7, with Colin Milburn making 139 and Tom Graveney 105, but the match was abandoned after demonstrators wrecked the stadium {{on the morning of the}} third day, leaving Alan Knott stranded on 96 not out. Cowdrey was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> see it as he left on the second day after his father-in-law died, leaving Graveney in charge. The team followed on the third day, with manager Les Ames abandoning the Test and the rest of the tour to save the team.|$|E

Charlie refuses, but is shocked to discover that his father had agreed to this plan before he died, presumably because Charlie was <b>not</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> run it.
