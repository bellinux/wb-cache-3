50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of funding, very little was {{actually}} achieved. Between 1974 and 1990, only a single metro station was finished under the railway station. In 1984, the first <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> to the north took place - the tracks reached the new XXX-Lecia district (currently Krowodrza Górka). Despite the crisis, the authorities decided to close down the tracks to Dworzec Główny Wschód (Railway Station East) as a preparation for the next part of the metro construction. The new balloon loop in Krowodrza Górka was also prepared for the further network extensions, but the actual works never started.|$|E

In 2006 and 2007, Dworzec Towarowy was connected with an existing network through a new link on Pawia Street and the total network length reached 84 km.

50|$|Thus the {{combination}} of the topology variations and different network architectures, e.g. sub-ordinated or neighboring control systems with consistent synchronization, enables numerous possibilities. Additional switches are not required.The physics of Ethernet allow a cable length of up to 100 m (300 ft) between two nodes, so the E-bus (LVDS) is only intended for use as the physical layer for modular devices. For each cable path, the signal variant can be chosen individually. For higher distances, or the complete galvanic isolation between two slaves, fiber optic cables are used. With single-mode fiber, distances up to 20 km between two nodes can be bridged. Since a total of 65,535 nodes per network segment can be connected, the <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> is nearly unlimited.|$|E
50|$|The first horse tram, 2.8 km {{line was}} opened in 1882. It used narrow gauge tracks (900 mm) and {{ran from the}} railway station to Podgórski bridge. It was financed, {{constructed}} and operated by National Bank of Belgium. In 1901 the tram network was electrified and the formal opening of the first line took place on 16 March. The new SW1 class cars were produced by Sanocka Fabryka Wagonów. At the end of 1902, the system consisted of five electrified, narrow gauge lines. However, the network owners were primarily interested in the income generated by the existing lines, not in building new ones, which caused conflicts {{between them and the}} city council. The electrification and <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> was forced thanks to the Austro-Hungarian law changes favourable to the city. It stated that a railroad or a tram line could be operated only by a local company, registered in Austria. The private owners from Belgium were forced to create such a company, named Krakowska Spółka Tramwajowa, and transferred the agreement with the city to it. This took place in 1898.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies how entrepreneurs construct, manage, and mobilize their networks, and {{how such}} a process is related to performance of entrepreneurial firms under severe institutional and social constraints. Extant theories of network effects on entrepreneurial performance tend to be structure oriented and static. This study brings agency back into the picture by exploring how entrepreneurs employ existing network relationships and create new ones in pursuit of better performance. Through qualitative fieldwork and statistical analysis of 100 high technology entrepreneurial firms in Zhongguancun Science Park [...] -China 2 ̆ 7 s Silicon Valley, this study shows that Chinese hi-tech entrepreneurs have used their network ties not only for access to resources, but also for creation of new ties with potential resource holders. Specifically, these entrepreneurs have sought to expand and change their networks {{through the process of}} <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> [...] -expansion of a network by addition of new ties resulting from successful introductions made by existing contacts. I argue that <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> represents a key mechanism by which entrepreneurial networks affect performance, especially in emerging economies characterized by weak market-supporting institutions, high uncertainty, low trust, and high velocity. The more effective an entrepreneur is at managing the process of <b>network</b> <b>extension,</b> i. e., generating more successful introductions from existing network contacts, the better the performance of the entrepreneurial firm. ^ This study also explores the interaction dynamics of <b>network</b> <b>extension.</b> In particular, I identify a set of antecedents of <b>network</b> <b>extension</b> including tie strength, entrepreneur 2 ̆ 7 s prior employment, entrepreneur 2 ̆ 7 s university alumni affiliation, and entrepreneur 2 ̆ 7 s social absorptive capacity. Additionally, from an institutional perspective, I propose that overseas experience in developed economies moderates the effect of tie strength on the degree of <b>network</b> <b>extension.</b> On the whole, this study puts forward a theoretical framework which specifies the network mechanisms that lie beneath the link between entrepreneurial networks and performance on the one hand, and identifies the key factors that give rise to such networks on the other hand, thus providing an integrative account of network processes and network effects. Statistical modeling and results provide substantial support to the proposed theoretical model. ...|$|E
