40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a quantified method for determining the mental workload imposed on train control officers (TCOs) and to express this mental workload by means of an index that is objective and can stand up to the tests of validity and reliability. The method addresses an existing operational shortcoming in Spoornet train control operations and could be used as a tool for predicting the mental workload imposed on operators at particular train control centres. The method could be applied to manage and improve operational safety in the rail transport environment. A participative systems approach was followed in the development of the measuring methodology. A work group comprising expert users of the specific train control system was involved in identifying task factors and assigning weights for task and moderating factors. The newly developed Mental Workload Index (MWLI) consists of three task factors and eleven moderating factors, each with a different weight in terms of its contribution to overall mental workload. The work group performed several iterations to reach final consensus on the following task factors and their respective contributions to the MWLI: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> data transactions, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorisations,</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> communications via telephone and radio. The systems approach used in the development process is discussed, and the final index with the task and moderating factors is presented. In conclusion, the value and possible application of the MWLI are discussed. The MWLI is shown to provide an objective method for the assessment and prediction of mental workload in the train control environment. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Hospitals {{and care}} homes are {{making use of}} new {{measures}} designed to protect people unable to give consent for their care. The Mental Capacity Act Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards were introduced by law on 1 April 2009 to provide a legal framework for depriving someone of their liberty where {{they are unable to}} give informed consent regarding their care. The statistics presented here provide the first official information about authorisations to legally detain a person using the legislation. The safeguards apply to people aged 18 and above who suffer from a mental disorder of the mind (such as dementia or a profound learning disability) and who lack capacity to give consent to the arrangements made for their care and / or treatment. The safeguards cover people in all hospitals and care homes in the statutory, independent and voluntary sectors. A rigorous, standardised assessment and authorisation process is used to ensure only appropriate use is made of the safeguards. Key facts?The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorisation</b> requests were: 1, 772 in quarter 1 1, 681 in quarter 2 and, 1, 869 in quarter 3. ?Of the total assessments completed in each quarter, a higher proportion were for females than for males ?For each quarter, around three out of four assessments were made by local authorities while the remaining ones were made by primary care trusts. ?The percentage <b>of</b> <b>authorisations</b> granted leading to someone being deprived of their liberty varied between 33. 5 per cent and 50. 7 per cent across quarters 1 to 3. ?At 31 December 2009 1, 074 people were subject to such <b>authorisations.</b> Quarterly analysis <b>of</b> Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 1 (0. 31 MB) Quarterly analysis of Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 2 (0. 31 MB) Quarterly analysis of Mental Capacity Act 2005, Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards Assessments (England) Quarter 3 (0. 31 MB) Have your say - give us your comments on this publication�...|$|R

40|$|Competitive {{advantage}} of make-to-order manufacturing companies is {{highly dependent on}} their capability to offer short delivery times and on time delivery. This calls for effective production and materials flow control – a core part of production logistics. This paper applies discrete simulation to study the delivery performance of a make-to-order manufacturing system configured as a general flow shop, when operated under two card-based material flow control mechanisms: CONWIP and GKS. The influence of two lot splitting strategies {{on the performance of}} these mechanisms is also evaluated. Results show that GKS clearly outperforms CONWIP and that splitting strategies {{have a positive impact on}} the performance of both mechanisms. GKS also showed to be particularly robust to the variation <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> production <b>authorisation</b> cards used. This, together with the fact that the card-based mechanisms require little data handling and simplify production control, makes GKS attractive for practical application in make-to-order companies.

40|$|XACML {{has become}} the defacto {{standard}} for enterprise- wide, policy-based access control. It is a structured, extensible language that can express and enforce complex access control policies. There have been several efforts to extend XACML to support specific authorisation models, such as the OASIS RBAC profile to support Role Based Access Control. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> proposals for <b>authorisation</b> models that support business processes and workflow systems have also appeared in the literature. However, there is no published work describing an extension to allow XACML {{to be used as}} a policy language with these models. This paper analyses the specific requirements of a policy language to express and enforce business process authorisation policies. It then introduces BP-XACML, a new profile that extends the RBAC profile for XACML so it can support business process authorisation policies. In particular, BP-XACML supports the notion of tasks, and constraints at the level of a task instance, which are important requirements in enforcing business process authorisation policies...|$|R
