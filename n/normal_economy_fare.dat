40|$|The {{deregulation}} of aviation in the United States and intercity bus transport in the United Kingdom initially resulted in substantial fare reductions associated with new market entry. Many new market entrants subsequently left {{the market and}} fares increased. International aviation in Europe has been operated by national airlines with price collusion and capacity sharing and a ban on new entrants. The <b>normal</b> <b>economy</b> <b>fares</b> charged on air services within Europe are {{the highest in the}} world. Therefore, there is significant scope for fare reductions when the European Community (EC) internal market comes into operation in 1993. Deregulation of market access will, however, leave unaddressed other barriers to contestability in the deregulated European aviation market. The structural barriers to contestability include hub airport dominance by the incumbent airlines, ground handling monopolies, and computer reservation system (CRS) bias. The paper proposes measures to ensure access to major airports for new entrant airlines on equal terms with incumbent airlines and the {{deregulation of}} the market for airport ground handling. The EC code of conduct for the neutral operation of CRS for incumbent and new entrant carriers is an important precedent. The strategic obstacles to contestability in a deregulated European airline industry are anticompetitive mergers and predatory pricing. In recent years national airlines have acquired several independent airlines in important European markets. It is recommended that such takeovers be prohibited because of their anticompetitive implications in the absence of competition between national airlines. The large networks of national airlines allow them to pursue policies of geographical price discrimination with reduced fares on contested routes and higher fares on uncontested routes. Price surveillance is recommended to explain fare differences between contested and uncontested routes. It is recommended that the EC competition policy exemption for price consultations between airlines be ended. Without measures to tackle the structural and strategic obstacles to competition in European aviation, its liberalization may have no impact on the present high-cost system. ...|$|R

30|$|The Spanish <b>economy</b> <b>fares</b> rather unsatisfactorily {{in these}} three outcomes.

By the same token, given their large turnover, temporary workers may lack the right incentives to improve on their job performance by acquiring better productive capabilities. Hence, since these skills and OJT are important components of multifactor productivity, this mechanism may have played a relevant role in explaining the unsatisfactory development of TFP growth in Spain and other EU countries with highly segmented labor markets (see Bassanini et al. 2009; Dolado et al. 2016).|$|R
2500|$|During {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Six was the airline industry's leading lower-fare advocate.

He later pioneered a number of other low or discount fares which made air travel available to many who could not previously afford it. One of Continental's early innovations was a system-wide <b>economy</b> excursion <b>fare</b> which cut the standard coach fares by more than 25%. Continental took delivery of the first of five 707-124s in spring 1959, and started Chicago-Los Angeles nonstop on June 8.

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the end came when Pan Am, a transatlantic competitor, decided in October 1981 to drop its lowest <b>economy</b> <b>fares</b> where it was in competition with Skytrain by up to 66%. Laker retaliated by introducing a cut-price premium cabin branded Regency Class. Following the end of the 1981/2 winter peak, there was insufficient traffic to support four airlines competing across the North Atlantic between January and March. At this point, state-owned British Airways and TWA, Laker's other transatlantic competitors, dropped their fares by a similar amount. As a result, Laker's loads and cash inflow halved between October 1981 and February 1982.

40|$|Abstract: This paper applies a continuous-time {{model to}} study the {{equilibrium}} of an <b>economy</b> consisting one <b>normal</b> agent and one constrained agent who has to maintain his intermediate wealth above a stochastic benchmark whose value is determined endogenously. After characterizing the optimization problems, I use the martingale approach to derive the equilibrium market dynamics in closed-form to compare with the <b>normal</b> <b>economy.</b> In the benchmarking economy before the constraint date, asset price, volatility and risk premium are higher {{than those in the}} <b>normal</b> <b>economy</b> for risky benchmarks. When the benchmark is relatively safe, asset price is higher but volatility, risk premium and the optimal fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset are decreased. 2 This paper studies the effect of a portfolio benchmarking constraint on the equilibrium market dynamics. The <b>economy</b> has a <b>normal</b> agent with log utility over continuous con-sumption and a constrained agent (also with log utility) whose intermediate wealth must be no less than a stochastic benchmarking constraint. Using the martingale approach, I solve this continuous-time consumption-based general equilibrium model explicitly to get the equilibrium assets prices, risk premium, volatility, optimal strategy and compare the...|$|R

The combined Central Pacific Railroad and Union Pacific Railroad carried traffic from the East into California, and the Virginia and Truckee Railroad carried traffic from Reno to Virginia City.

40|$|There is a {{very real}} danger that the {{transition}} from the Construction Boom in 2009 to a rapidly growing sustainable <b>normal</b> <b>economy</b> in Aceh will not happen unless both preventive and effective constructive measures are implemented during the coming two years.

In order to successfully make this transition to a rapidly growing <b>normal</b> <b>economy,</b> the following conditions must be fulfilled: 1) The provincial minimum wage rate (PMWR) in Aceh must not be further increased in 2008 and 2009 because this will prevent the highly inflated wage rates caused by the construction boom from falling back to normal levels {{with the end of the}} construction boom in 2009.
