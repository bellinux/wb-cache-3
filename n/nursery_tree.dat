2500|$|A plant nursery is an {{agricultural}} operation where (non-bonsai) plants are propagated and grown to usable size. Nursery stock {{may be available}} directly from the nursery, or may be sold in a garden centre or similar resale establishment. Nursery stock is usually young but fully viable, and is often potted with sufficient soil to allow plants to survive a season or two before being transplanted into a more permanent location. Because the <b>nursery</b> <b>tree</b> is already pot-conditioned, it can be worked on as a bonsai immediately. The large number of plants that can be viewed in a single visit to a nursery or garden centre allows the buyer to identify plants with better-than-average bonsai characteristics. According to Peter Adams, a nursery visit [...] "offers the opportunity to choose an instant trunk". One issue with nursery stock is that many specimens are shaped into popular forms, such as the standard or half-standard forms, with several feet of clear trunk rising from the roots. Without branches low on the trunk, {{it is difficult for}} a source specimen to be trained as bonsai.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Citrus {{gummosis}} is {{an important}} disease because it causes the death of young plants, resulting in their replacement, a costly operation. Its causal agents are different species of Phytophthora. Dissemination of these microorganisms occurs mainly by contaminated <b>nursery</b> <b>trees.</b> Differences in aggressiveness, competitiveness and response to fungicides varied among species of this pathogen. Therefore, this study aimed to examine diversity among citrus isolates of Phytophthora from two different origins in São Paulo State. Thirty isolates from citrus <b>nursery</b> <b>trees</b> from 13 municipalities and 11 from seven commercial orchards were analyzed. Interspecific diversity was performed by species-specific primers and sequencing of the ITS region. Subsequently, intraspecific diversity was carried out with 16 RAPD primers and clustering analysis of UPGMA, using the Dice coefficient. Our data identified only P. nicotianae from either substrates or commercial fields. Isolates clustered into two genetically distinct populations. Genetically similar isolates were also found. The existence of these clonal lineages among isolates from geographically distinct <b>nursery</b> <b>trees</b> suggests an efficient dissemination mechanism. This was the first study to examine the diversity of Phytophthora in citrus from substrates of <b>nursery</b> <b>trees</b> in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Nursery {{trees of}} stone fruits (Prunus spp.) are {{traditionally}} produced by union of two distinct genotypes - the rootstock and the scion - which, by grafting, form a composite plant {{that will be}} maintained throughout of all plant life. In Brazil, the rootstocks are predominantly seed propagated and therefore usually results in heterogeneous trees for vigor and edaphic adaptation. However, with advances in rootstock breeding programs that released cultivars and certification in several countries (notably in Europe), the system will come gradually evolving for vegetative propagation (cuttings and tissue culture) and use of seeds of selected rootstocks with specific characteristics and potted nursery trees production. For scion cultivar propagation, the budding system (with its many variations) has predominantly been adopted in major producing countries.

Real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) and dynamic measurement unit (DMU) sensors {{were used to determine}} the position and orientation of the robot, while a laser range finder was used to locate the tree positions within a selected range. The RTK-GPS error was modeled by a second-order autoregressive model, and error states were incorporated into extended Kalman filter (EKF) design. Through EKF filtering, the mean and standard deviation of error in the easting direction decreased from 4. 05 to 2. 21 cm and from 8. 27 to 1. 89 cm, respectively, while in the northing direction, they decreased from 4. 64 to 1. 81 cm and from 11 to 2. 16 cm, respectively. The geo-referenced tree positions along the navigational paths were also recovered by using a K-means clustering algorithm, achieving an average error of tree position estimates of 4. 4 cm. The developed sensor fusion algorithm was proven to be capable of recognizing and reconstructing the navigational environment of a simulated tree plantation, which offers a great potential in improving the applicability of an autonomous robot to operate in <b>nursery</b> <b>tree</b> plantations for operations such as intra-row mechanical weeding...|$|E

40|$|The {{setting of}} the problem. For a number of years, avocado growers in Southern California {{have been trying to}} find a quicker and cheaper method of {{bringing}} an avocado tree into bearing than the five years usually required. Because the initial cost of the <b>nursery</b> <b>tree</b> {{is one of the largest}} single costs, nurserymen have been experimenting with different methods of propagation to find a method that will raise the tree faster and cheaper so the initial cost to the grower of nursery stock can be reduced. The question then arises as to whether the trees developed by a new method make as good a showing after three years in the grove as those produced by the conventional method. If this can be demonstrated, then a return on investment in land, trees, irrigation system, taxes, and cultural costs such as planting, fertilizing, irrigating, and mulching can be realized sooner. The conventional method of propagation consists of sprouting the seeds in the seed bed and leaving them there until the top of the seedling has three or four mature leaves on it. They are then lined out in the nursery row, and when they are large enough, they are budded. By the time they are ready to ball out a period of eighteen to twenty-fou...|$|E

Three growth media based on perlite (100 %), peat (50 %) + perlite (50 %), and fine sawdust (100 %) were tested using soil as a control. Plants were grown in trough culture from the day of planting cuttings up to the uproot point of fig nursery trees, during eight months, and they were not transplanted into another medium during the growing period. To observe the effect of substrates on the nursery fig trees, some morphological and biochemical characteristics were determined. The use of peat + perlite and perlite led to increased plant growth and quality of fig nursery trees grown in high-tunnel...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2001 – 2012 next to Wrocław (southwestern Poland). The purpose of this research was to assess the influence of type of nursery trees of pear cvs ‘Carola’ and ‘Dicolor’ budded on quince S 1 rootstock on growth and cropping, as well as fruit quality of two pear cultivars. The trees were planted in the spring of 2001 in 4 replications with 5 trees per plot. Trees were planted in rows with spacing 1. 2 × 3. 5 m (2381 trees per hectare). Three types of nursery trees, all without feathers, were planted: two-year-old (3 years in a nursery), one-year-old maidens (2 years in a nursery) and annual grafts (only 1 year in a <b>nursery).</b> <b>Tree</b> canopies were formed as a spindle and were trained in the Güttingen-V system. Until the twelfth year after planting, growth and yield were significantly affected by the type of nursery trees. One-year-old maidens were characterized by the strongest vigor in orchard, while pears planted as two-year-old trees grew rather weak (especially with ‘Dicolor’ cv.). Planting two-year-old trees didn’t have any clear positive influence on tree cropping in the orchard. The final results of the study proved that trees planted as annual grafts, irrespective of cultivar, yielded significantly worse. The type of nursery trees had no clear influence on mean fruit weight...|$|E
40|$|Ethephon {{alone and}} in a mixture with {{inorganic}} defoliants was used to defoliate apple <b>nursery</b> <b>trees</b> of three cultivars: Yellow Transparent, McIntosh and Jonathan. The mixture of ethephon with copper sulphate or magnesium chlorate defoliated the trees better than ethophon or inorganic defoliants used seperately in twice as high concentrations as in a mixture. The tress defoliated with the mixtures of defoliants suffered less from frost injury than those treated with only the inorganic defoliants...|$|R

40|$|MH as {{a single}} spray in {{concentrations}} 700 - 1500 mg/l was used in July to induce premature offshoots in <b>nursery</b> <b>trees.</b> The trees of pear, plum and of 3 apple cultivars showed little or no response to MH treatment Due to this treatment, however, the trees of 7 other apple cultivars formed 3 - 5 branches longer than 20 cm, possessing large crotch angles. The growth of the main axis was only temporarily inhibited by the MH treatment...|$|R
