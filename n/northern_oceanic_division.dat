Horizontal distribution of surface zooplankton biomass showed high abundance over a relatively extensive area east of Prydz Bay, including the Polar Frontal Zone and Antarctic Zone (90 - 110 °E, 45 - 65 °S). The mean biomass of the Antarctic Zone varied annually.

Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sections—including the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.|$|R

Larvae of Euphausia frigida and E. triacantha (particularly) were restricted to the <b>northern,</b> <b>oceanic</b> part of the region. Larvae of E. superba were most abundant and were found at the shelf and slope areas, where waters of high-latitude origin and waters of the frontal zone were distributed. Larvae of Thysanoessa macrura were found in all types of waters. Within the intermediate (confluence) zone, these larvae were most scanty and younger than those found anywhere. In distinction from the last two species, larvae of E. crystallorophias were abundant only at the southwestern inshore region. There was a notable decrease of the larval abundance of all species and a strong contrast of age composition in the Palmer Archipelago region. Larvae are older to the north-east than to the south-west of this area. In the oceanic zone (ACC), T. macrura begins to spawn after E. frigida.

40|$|International audienceAlbatrosses {{are among}} the world's most {{endangered}} seabirds. Threats during the nonbreeding period have major impacts on their population dynamics, but for most species, detailed information on distribution and ecology remains essentially unknown. We used stable isotope values (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) in feathers to infer and compare the moulting (nonbreeding) habitats of 35 populations that include all the 20 species and subspecies (444 individuals) of albatrosses breeding within the Southern Ocean and in fringing subtropical waters. Isotopic values together with a review of available information show that the 20 albatrosses can be categorized into three groups depending on their favoured moulting grounds: 12 (60 %) taxa forage primarily in warm neritic waters, six (30 %) in <b>northern</b> <b>oceanic</b> waters and two (10 %) in oceanic waters of the Southern Ocean. Stable isotopes indicate that habitat preferences during the nonbreeding period vary much less among different breeding populations in some species (wandering, Salvin's, grey-headed and light-mantled sooty albatrosses), than others (black-browed, Indian yellow-nosed and sooty albatrosses). The major finding of our isotopic investigation is that {{the great majority of}} albatrosses spend the nonbreeding period outside the Southern Ocean, with only three species (and in the sooty albatross, just one of the breeding populations) favouring oceanic subantarctic waters at that time. Hence, the study highlights the overwhelming importance of subtropical waters for albatrosses, where the birds are known to interact with human activities {{and are more likely to}} be negatively affected by the diverse range of fisheries operating in both neritic and oceanic waters...|$|R

A survey was made at each of forty ISLAS ORCADAS stations to determine the relative number and species of dinoflagellates present. A total of sixty-four species were identified, including three possibly new species and three species not previously reported in the research area. Through scanning electron microscopic observations more information regarding thecal pores, surface texture, sutural texture, apical pores, cingular and sulcal lists and some cingular and sulcal plates was detailed. Species diversity as determined by number of species was also recorded and found to be highest in the Drake Passage and at the more <b>northern</b> <b>oceanic</b> stations north of South Georgia Island. Protoperidinium and Dinophysis had the most species diversity. Distribution of genera is plotted on a three-dimensional bar graph by station and season.

Four communities were identified. Three of these communities were dominated respectively by Euphausia crystallorophias (neritic), copepods-chaetognaths (main oceanic), and salpshyperiids-small euphausiids (<b>northern</b> <b>oceanic</b> community). The fourth community was characterized by the high abundance and dominance of the Antarctic krill, E. superba, and also by the paucity of zooplankton. This community was mainly located along the outer shelf edge, usually between the main oceanic and neritic communities. Chlorophyll a abundance and temperature explained much {{of the variation in}} community distribution patterns. The annual recession of ice, pack-ice cover, and salinity also explained some of the variation. Water circulation seemed to have only a clear effect on community distributions at the end of summer in March, when distributional patterns exhibited a distinct longitudinal zonation compared to the strong latitudinal pattern seen through most of the summer. In January 1984, 1985 and March 1987, net sampling surveys were carried out on the distribution and abundance of euphausiid larvae, primarily E. superba, in the Prydz Bay region. E. superba occurred in low abundance in January, probably due to sampling preceding the main spawning period, but occurred in very high abundance in the east of the region in March 1987. Thysanoessa macrura occurred throughout the study area in consistently high abundance. E. crystallorophias was marginally more abundant within its restricted range. Distinct north-south variations in larval age and developmental stages of T. macrura were observed indicating regional differences in spawning. Euphausia frigida was mainly confined to the upper 200 m of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. E. superba larvae produced north of the shelf break, between 70 to 83 ° E, moved north-east into the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Larvae originating on the shelf moved rapidly west in the East Wind Drift. E. crystallorophias had the same westward dispersion, but some larvae appeared to return eastward via the Prydz Bay Gyre and remain in the region.

40|$|Attenuation {{of ground}} motion amplitudes with {{distance}} is recognised {{as a significant}} issue by researchers. Of particular interest is the attenuation or propagation of seismic waves from long distant sources. Regions like Sri Lanka have experienced tremors from events as far as 1500 km. However a comprehensive study of the region {{with respect to the}} propagation or attenuation of seismic waves has been generally lacking. With the availability of new archival data of 65 events recorded at Pallekelle Broadband station, the authors have estimated Lg-coda Q values for the <b>Northern</b> Indian <b>Oceanic</b> region surrounding Sri Lanka. Multiple linear regression analysis of recorded data yields a relatively higher Q value which is comparable to similar older crustal regions such as Western Australia and Central Europe. Source spectra for recorded events have also been accounted by correcting the observed amplitude for geometric and anelastic attenuation. This results in typical stress drop values of about 100 bars which is consistent with Brune&# 039;s source spectra. Based on the estimated values, stochastic modelling of a recent 8. 6 Mw event experienced in the region has been undertaken. Initial results are promising.

In a transect in east-central Turkey extending from Baskil (Elazig) to Divrigi (Sivas) to the north, and from Copler (Erzincan) to Horozkoy (Nigde) to the SW, these magmatic rocks vary in time, spatial distribution, and composition. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages supplemented by a few U–Pb ages geochronology from major plutons demonstrate a general younging of magmatism in the transect from c. 83 Ma in the south (Baskil) to c. 69 Ma in the north (Divrigi-Keban), followed by a c. 44 Ma scattered magmatic complex now found along a NE trending arcuate belt between Copler and Horoz. In general, trace element and rare earth element (REE) geochemistry in the magmatic rocks suggest two main sources for the melts: (1) a mantle-wedge and subducted oceanic lithosphere producing arc-type magma; and (2) meta-somatized lithospheric mantle modified by subduction producing magmatic rocks with more metasomatized mantle and within plate signatures.

Emission of exhaust is simulated by the daily initialization of air parcels along a flight path on the 500 K isentropic surface. Parcels are tracked {{during the first three}} weeks of each January from 1980 to 1994 {{in order to determine the}} interannual variability in the spatial distribution of the exhaust and the likelihood of exposure to cold temperatures. Few parcels emitted along these flight paths at this time of year had experienced nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) formation temperatures, except for the particularly cold Januarys 1986, 1987, and 1992. Large zonal fluctuations in the distribution of the emissions are typical for this time year and are strongly dependent on flight path. An extended 6 -month (January-June) run in which parcels were released daily along the New York-London route shows that emissions in the flight corridor increase at a time-averaged rate which is nearly twice the rate at which the zonal average increases. In addition, local fluctuations of pollutant density can be several times higher than the zonal average and can persist for several weeks. A rapid buildup of emissions occurred during the summer months.
