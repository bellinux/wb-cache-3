5|$|For {{many years}} Burger King has sold beer {{in several of}} its {{international}} locations, such as Germany, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> home territory. The company began to sell beer at its BK Whopper Bar limited service concept restaurants in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles in 2010. The company is selling products from SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch, including Budweiser, Bud Lite, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful neighbor in this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> best interest, and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|Twin Books {{appealed the}} decision, and in March 1996 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit {{reversed}} the original decision, {{stating that the}} novel was a foreign work in 1923 that was <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> home country's public domain when published, therefore the original publication date {{could not be used}} in arguing American copyright law. Instead, the 1926 publication date, the first in which it specifically declared itself to be copyrighted in the United States, is considered the year when the novel was copyrighted in America. As such, Anna Wyler's renewal was timely and valid, thereby upholding Twin Books' ownership of the copyright.|$|E

5|$|Unusual in many aspects, the 1846Havana {{hurricane}} was {{the most}} intense of its time. Though atmospheric pressure readings in Cuba reached as low as 916mbar (27.06inHg), the meteorological historian Jose Fernandez-Partagás re-evaluated several possible pressure records, concluding that the cyclone's minimum pressure was likely closer to 938mbar (27.70inHg); even so, it maintained the title of having the lowest recorded pressure measurement until 1924, 78years later. Although no reliable wind measurements were available at the time, a separate study also estimated that it produced Category5-strength winds, making it the first known storm to strike Cuba at such an intensity. As {{a result of the}} tropical cyclone's extreme intensity, ecological and geographical features were permanently altered in many areas. Sand Key, which completely submerged {{during the course of the}} hurricane, wholly re-emerged by December of that year, albeit <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> original position; meanwhile, ecological damage remained evident for decades in Key West.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> video games to be accessible in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E
5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, the shutters would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E

25|$|The book sold well, {{and quickly}} {{went to a}} fourth edition (1836). Babbage {{represented}} his work as largely a result of actual observations in factories, British and abroad. It was <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> first edition, intended to address deeper questions of political economy; the second (late 1832) did, with three further chapters including one on piece rate. The book also contained ideas on rational design in factories, and profit sharing.|$|E
25|$|To summarise, {{based on}} this view a {{function}} is computable if: (a) given an input from its domain, possibly relying on unbounded storage space, it can give the corresponding output by following a procedure (program, algorithm) that is formed by {{a finite number of}} exact unambiguous instructions; (b) it returns such output (halts) in a finite number of steps; and (c) if given an input which is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> domain it either never halts or it gets stuck.|$|E

25|$|The {{grammar of}} the Otomi {{language}} displays {{a mixture of}} elements of synthetic and analytic structures. Particularly the phrase-level morphology is synthetic, whereas the sentence-level is analytic. Simultaneously, the language is head-marking {{in terms of its}} verbal morphology, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> nominal morphology, which is more analytic. Otomi recognizes three large open word classes of nouns and verbs, and particles. There is a small closed class of property words, variously analyzed as adjectives or stative verbs.|$|E
25|$|Just as {{temperature}} may undefined for {{a sufficiently}} inhomogeneous system, so also may entropy be undefined {{for a system}} <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, 'the temperature of the solar system' is not a defined quantity. Likewise, 'the entropy of the solar system' is not defined in classical thermodynamics. It has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy, as a simple number for a whole system, in a clearly satisfactory way.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic markers are {{stable and}} {{potentially}} heritable {{modifications to the}} DNA molecule that are <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> sequence. An example is DNA methylation at CpG sites, which {{has been found to}} influence gene expression. Histone modifications are another example. The current generation of sequencing technologies rely on laboratory techniques such as ChIP-sequencing for the detection of epigenetic markers. These techniques involve tagging the DNA strand, breaking and filtering fragments that contain markers, followed by sequencing. Third generation sequencing may enable direct detection of these markers due to their distinctive signal from the other four nucleotide bases.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural style. The International Style, with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure, {{had been in}} vogue in urban settings since the 1930s. It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all {{institutions of higher education}} to abandon historical styles. By the 1960s, it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion {{and at the same time}} give the campus a new image. Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> form or materials.|$|E
25|$|Situs inversus {{is found}} in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, situs inversus totalis, it {{involves}} complete transposition (right to left reversal) {{of all of the}} abdominal organs. The heart is <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as dextrocardia (literally, right-hearted). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with situs inversus have no medical symptoms or complications, although they should wear a medical identification tag to warn emergency medical staff that the patient's internal organs are reversed from normal so they can act accordingly, e.g. by listening for a heartbeat on the right rather than left side of the chest.|$|E
25|$|Despite the film's {{supposedly}} historically grounded approach, much artistic licence {{is taken}} regarding historical figures, peoples, events, religion, wardrobe and weaponry. The film places {{the story of}} Arthur <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>its</b> better-known medieval setting, but in the (still plausible) earlier times of antiquity, the early dawn of the Middle Ages – as did the earliest versions of the Arthur story. It {{would appear that the}} Arthur depicted in the film is based most closely upon Ambrosius Aurelianus, the Romano-Briton who fought against the Saxons in the 5th century, and was probably the leader of the Romano-British at the Battle of Mons Badonicus (Mount Badon). Nevertheless, Arthur's full name in the film is Artorius Castus, referring to Lucius Artorius Castus, a historical Roman active in Britain in the 2nd or 3rd century. It is specified Arthur was given the ancestral name of a legendary leader.|$|E
