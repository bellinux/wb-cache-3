40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirically testable two-sector dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} for the United States economy that admits technology and non-technology shocks. Long-run identification restrictions further distinguish the impact of each shocks over the originating sector (i. e. as a sector- specific), and over other sectors different from the originating one (i. e. as a cross-sector shock), also exploring the shocks transmission mechanism across sectors. There are three main results. First, business cycle are mainly generated, in each sector, by technology shocks (mainly described by sector-specific shocks), but they are transmitted across sectors along the sectors' demand side, i. e. passing through non-technology shocks. Second, technology and non- technology shocks almost equally share the responsibility of fluctuations in the aggregate manufacturing sector. Third, the dynamic behavior of the durable good sector may be well represented by a standard Real Business Model; the <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> sector, on the other hand, would not be consistent with that predictions. Overall, due to a size effect, the aggregate dynamics {{is driven by the}} relatively larger sector, which is the <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> one.

We extend the two-sector New Keynesian model with flexible durable good prices and sticky <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> prices by (i) labour search and matching frictions and (ii) internal habit formation in non-durable consumption. Search and matching frictions generate comovement and increase the persistence of sectoral outputs, whereas habit formation helps to appropriately distribute {{the impact of a}} given shock over the two sectors. As a result, our estimated model closely replicates the amplitude and the curvature of the empirical impulse responses in both sectors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{effectiveness}} of a specific type of guilt appeal. The literature suggests that there are three types of guilt appeals. However the effectiveness of each type of guilt appeal is unclear. This study will investigate the effectiveness of one type of guilt appeal, namely anticipatory guilt appeal using a <b>non-durable</b> consumer <b>good</b> advertisement. The study explores the relationships between anticipatory guilt, attitude towards the brand, inferences of manipulative intent and purchase intentions. Results show no significant relationship between anticipatory guilt and purchase intentions. However, attitude towards the brand increased the likelihood of purchase intentions. The research suggests that anticipatory guilt appeals are inappropriate for the <b>non-durable</b> consumer <b>goods</b> advertisements. It raises an interesting question why so many advertisers are utilising this type of guilt appeal to target consumers.

The seller posts a single price offer each period, which the buyer either accepts or rejects. Only two types of price paths emerge in equilibrium: either prices are constant, or they have persistent cycles between a low and a high value. In both cases, however, prices are ''sticky'' in the sense that changes in price are less frequent than changes in the economy's fundamentals...|$|R

40|$|This paper adds to two {{strands of}} the {{economics}} literature, {{the literature on}} product durability and on technical change, {{in a small way}} by introducing the possibility that an uncertain invention may be exogenously durable.

The effect of a change in the probability of the durable innovation is shown to depend on the degree of appropriability. The consideration of the effect of changes in the probability of durable innovation is unique to the literature. The effects of change in R&D competition are ambiguous and in line with earlier findings. Two special cases are considered and policy implications discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|The third {{consideration}} {{is how the}} overall transition from an agriculture-based economy to an urban, industrial economy. In the South, industrial growth started with labor-intensive, unskilled industries; for example, manufacturing employment increased from 14.5% in 1930 to 21.3% in 1960, but the increase was largest for <b>non-durable</b> <b>goods</b> (Nicholls 1964:26-27). For black males, in the South, agricultural employment dropped from 43.6% in 1940, to 4.9% in 1980; in that same time period, manufacturing employment rose from 14.2%, to 26.9% (Heckman & Payner 1989:148). There was also more pressure for African American women to work outside the home, often for low wages in the domestic service sector; for example, in the late 1930s, female domestics earned $3-8 per week, sometimes a bit less in the South (Thernstrom & Thernstrom 1999:35).|$|E
50|$|A July 2012 {{survey of}} balance sheet {{recession}} research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by household leverage levels. Both durable and <b>non-durable</b> <b>goods</b> consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the subprime mortgage crisis. In other words, according to the accounting equation, as {{the value of their}} primary asset (homes) fell, mortgage debt initially remained fixed, so equity also fell, causing the ratio of debt to equity (a measure of leverage) to rise. This sudden increase in leverage, causing consumers to shift from spending to paying down debt, can account for a significant decline in employment levels, as employers cut back due to concerns of lower consumer demand. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.|$|E

50|$|Control of the dowry {{belongs to}} the bride in theory, {{although}} in practice control often transfers to the husband and in-laws, and grooms sometimes extort large dowries. In rural Pakistan, dowry values are still relatively low, around 12% of a household's annual (<b>non-durable</b> <b>goods)</b> expenses. Also, in rural Pakistan it is standard for the bride to maintain control over her dowry after marriage, rather than control of the dowry being given to the in-laws. A recent survey in January 2017 by Gallup Pakistan showed that 56% of the population expects the girl to bring dowry to marriage. The pressure among some Pakistanis to provide a large dowry results in some brides' families going into debt, including debt servitude; some brides build up their dowry with their own earnings if they work outside the home. The debt trap created by providing large dowries puts pressure on parents aspiring to arrange a marriage for their daughter(s) into a better social class. It is also cited {{as a reason for}} the current trend toward delayed marriages. Arranged marriages among first cousins are common, since they provide a way of keeping dowries within an extended family.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the collection of}} customer data and its potential use in price discrimination. I survey the current literature on behavior-based price discrimination to understand its implications to firms’ profitability. Focus is given to homogenous, <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> duopolies to investigate the competitive effects of customer recognition. As {{the objective is to}} understand why firms invest in the collection of customer data, welfare analysis is left outside the scope of the thesis. The thesis also discusses two constraints that may have significant impact on the firms’ ability to discriminate. Firstly, customers’ view of fairness may provoke strong objection against behavior-based pricing. Secondly, the ability to anonymize or hide true identity creates arbitrage similar to second-hand markets. Profitability of behavior-based price discrimination is strongly dependent on the assumptions of the models. With symmetric information about symmetric demands, firms are shown to be strictly worse off compared to uniform price regime. As both firms have unilateral incentive to implement behavior-based price discrimination, the model represents a classic prisoner’s dilemma. However, less strict symmetry assumptions enable more diverse outcomes. This thesis discusses separately the importance of asymmetric demand and asymmetric information. The aforementioned appears to foster the ability to generate profitable discrimination, but results are ambiguous and leave still much to answer. The latter is the most recent field of research in behavior-based price discrimination. Again, the results are not conclusive and there is much to examine. I believe this direction to foster the most fruitful research in the coming years...|$|R
40|$|The {{buffer stock}} theory” {{derived from the}} intertemporal utility {{maximization}} predicts that an increase in wealth will dampen the motive for precautionary savings and therefore reduce consumption’s over-sensitivity with respect to income changes. Since over {{the last forty years}} Taiwan has more than once experienced sharp rises in the values of stock market and real estate, the goal {{of this paper is to}} examine whether the prediction of the buffer stock theory holds in Taiwan. The empirical model we propose is a trivariate two-state Markov regime-switching model that is originated from Euler equation for consumption growth. The three macro variables we consider are the real <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> consumption growth, the real GDP growth, and the real growth in stock market total value. It is assumed that these three variables are subject to the same Markov regime-switching variable in determining their two states. Our empirical results using Taiwan’s quarterly data suggest a high growth state and a low growth one: the former includes 1973 Q 3, 1973 Q 4, 1978 Q 3, 1987 Q 2 – 1990 Q 1, 1991 Q 2, and 1991 Q 3. The main finding of this paper is as follows: It is indeed the precautionary savings motive that causes the aggregate consumption in Taiwan to be overly sensitive to income changes, just as the buffer stock theory has predicted. When wealth in Taiwan, symbolized by the values of stock market, increased substantially under the high growth state, consumers’ precautionary savings motive weakened and the over-sensitivity phenomenon to a large extent disappeared. 消費過度敏感現象, 預防性儲蓄動機, 財富效果, 三變量結構轉換模型...|$|R
40|$|Household debt in South Korea is {{high and}} still rising. Household debt to GDP ratio had risen at the similar pace with that in the US until 2007 but it has still been rising whereas it has been falling since 2017 in the US. As a result, it is now higher in South Korea than in the US. There was a {{dramatic}} growth in household debt in the US preceding the recent Great Recession and high level of household debt was viewed to amplify the severity of economic recession in the US constraining consumer spending. In this context, high and continuously rising household debt could be a potential risk factor for the South Korean economy. Macroprudential policy, which indicates policy aims to reduce financial systemic risk pre-emptively, is a crucial measure {{to slow down the}} pace of household debt growth in South Korea. However, there is no established tool to analyse or evaluate its effects and relationship to monetary policy. The second chapter presents the trend and distribution of household debt in South Korea, and brief history of policy responses to continuously increasing household debt. The third chapter shows how macroprudential policy works by using a simple heterogeneous DSGE model with collateral constraint. The model is based on so-called borrower-saver model. Despite of its simplicity, the model can clearly explain how macroprudential policy affects household debt and related variables in South Korea. In addition, dynamics of this model imply increasing amortisation rate is superior measure to decreasing LTV ratio because it induces less volatility in economy. The collateral constraint in this thesis is designed to distinguish household debt (stock) and borrowing (flow). As a result, it is more realistic than the one mostly used in literature. This collateral constraint setting contributes to the better results especially when we analyse the phase of tightening household credit conditions. Furthermore, it enables us to see how amortization rate affects the South Korean economy. The fourth chapter extends the model mainly to see how credit tightening and monetary policy work differently and how they interact. Habit formation in <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> consumption, price rigidity in <b>non-durable</b> <b>good</b> producers, fixed cost in intermediate good production and monetary policy are added in the model. Not only the newly added elements themselves but also inflation make model's responses different from those in the previous chapter. Nominal and real rigidities make dynamics last longer and more realistic. Due to the structure of collateral constraint, a rise in inflation can reduce the level of real household debt whereas there is no inflation effect on real household debt with the common type of collateral constraint. This also influences responses to monetary policy shock. The results demonstrate credit tightening is better than monetary policy in slowing down the growth rate of household debt. Among all policy measures considered, decreasing amortization rate is the most effective and increasing LTV ratio is the second. These implies that ongoing policy efforts to slow down the growth rate of household debt in South Korea is on the right track. The fifth chapter shows welfare effects of macroprudential policy. The results illustrate it is impossible to get social welfare gains in a situation given in South Korea when discretionary macroprudential policy comes into effect. If government adopts countercyclical macroprudential rule, it is possible to improve social welfare but it requires welfare loss either of borrower or saver...|$|R
