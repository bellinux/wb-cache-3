5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E

Huth {{had met with}} Los Angeles police detectives for 90 minutes. In rejecting the case, prosecutors evaluated the charge Cosby would have faced in 1974. Prosecutors took into account legislative changes that extend {{the statute of limitations}} for certain crimes but found <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Cosby could be legally prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} gone to war to defend Finland, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they would do it for Norway.|$|E

Bleichrodt was accused of sinking the ship with the full knowledge that it had been transporting evacuees. He reaffirmed the German position that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he or the crew of the submarine could have known who was on board. It was upheld and he was acquitted. However, Bleichrodt refused to apologise to the survivors, despite several crew members of U-48, including the radio operator, expressing their shock and regret once the facts became known.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation might benefit future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others lose out, {{there is no guarantee that}} the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out, there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} before World War II, the British were {{concerned}} with finding the balance between a centralised state and maintaining {{the power of the}} Sultans in Malaya. There were no moves to give Malaya a unitary government, and in fact in 1935 the position of Resident-General of the Federated States was abolished, and its powers decentralised to the individual states. With their usual tendency to racial stereotyping, the British regarded the Malays as amiable but unsophisticated and rather lazy, incapable of self-government, although making good soldiers under British officers. They regarded the Chinese as clever but dangerous—and indeed during the 1920s and 1930s, reflecting events in China, the Chinese Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang) and the Communist Party of China built rival clandestine organisations in Malaya, leading to regular disturbances in the Chinese towns. The British saw <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Malaya’s disparate collection of states and races could become a nation, let alone an independent one.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark to the {{imagination}} until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E
500|$|The falsification {{principle}} {{has been}} developed as an alternative theory by which {{it may be possible}} to distinguish between those religious statements that may potentially have meaning, and those that are meaningless. It proposes that most religious language is unfalsifiable because there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it could be empirically proven false. In a landmark paper published in 1945, analytic philosopher Antony Flew argued that a meaningful statement must simultaneously assert and deny a state of affairs; for example, the statement [...] "God loves us" [...] both asserts that God loves us and denies that God does not love us. Flew maintained that if a religious believer could not say what circumstances would have to exist for their statements about God to be false, then they are unfalsifiable and meaningless.|$|E

Peter Chapman of The Independent stated that Jacques was [...] "blessed with remarkable grace, delicacy and warmth, giving her an almost unique comic appeal". Sunday Life said that for decades she was [...] "Britain's favourite silly, sexually frustrated, fat woman". Nina Wadia of Goodness Gracious Me considers Jacques along with Joan Sims and Barbara Windsor to have [...] "paved the way for younger comediennes in Britain today", remarking that [...] "if {{it had not been}} for women like Hattie and Barbara, there is <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> younger actresses would have any role model, or probably the ambition to do what they do".|$|E
500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you another look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E

According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going to have to be honest with her.|$|E

[...] Mark Bunker characterized the film as a recruitment tactic for the Church of Scientology, stating, [...] "It's designed to introduce L. Ron Hubbard to a whole new generation of kids. It's there to plant a favorable seed in children's minds." [...] Bunker criticized the promotional methods of the film—instead of granting interviews about the film to the press, John Travolta went on a book tour and signed copies of L. Ron Hubbard's novel. Bunker stated, [...] "When Michael Caine goes around to promote The Cider House Rules, he doesn't tour bookstores and sign copies of John Irving's novel… Through the movie tie-in with the book, kids will send in the card to get their free poster, and eventually be introduced to Dianetics." [...] Scientologist Nancy O'Meara, at the time treasurer of the Foundation for Religious Freedom and currently treasurer of the Scientology-run New Cult Awareness Network, responded to Bunker's statement: [...] "Gimme a break… That's like saying people are going to go see Gladiator and then suddenly find themselves wanting to explore Christianity." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, but in a way that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E
