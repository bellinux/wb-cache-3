The device is mounted infrared temperature sensor, by using PLC-controlled synchronous tracking technology it can track the hand module in the production line, so it can ensure the infrared temperature sensor and hand module synchronously measure its temperature correctly. By using configuration software kingview, we have developed mold temperature monitoring online measurement interface, real-time monitoring of the mold temperature opponents. After analysis of experimental results we concluded that the device work stable, acquisition of temperature reliably, so it has a promotional value. In the <b>nitrile</b> <b>glove’s</b> production line, the hand module move along a straight line driven by the chain, the speed of the hand module’s movement is 120 - 140 cells/min. The hand module’s surface temperature is a very important parameter in the production process, which directly affects the quality of the plastic dipping process [1]. Therefore, the surface temperature of the module need to be real-time monitored all the moment. This paper studies a synchronous tracking device, the infrared temperature sensor is fixed onto the device, and we can detect moving objects through the photoelectric sensor, by this way the speed difference is fed back to the computer control system and then control the servo motor drive mechanism acceleration and deceleration to achieve infrared synchronized motion sensor alignment measured target for a moment, by this way we ensure there is enough time for the sensor to response, and we enable the computer to collect and record the correct temperature parameter.

The rubbers were then blended with virgin nitrile rubber (NBR) at various ratios and the curing characteristics and physical properties of the blends were evaluated. The results showed the maximum torque (MH) decreases while the minimum torque (ML) increases with increasing level of SP 50 rubber. Using higher concentrations of SP- 50, the results showed slight reductions in the cure (t 90) and scorch time (ts 2), respectively.

5000|$|Due to the {{increasing}} rate of latex allergy among health professionals, and in the general population, gloves made of non-latex materials such as polyvinyl chloride, nitrile rubber, or neoprene have become widely used. Chemical processes may be employed {{to reduce the amount}} of antigenic protein in Hevea latex, resulting in alternative natural-rubber-based materials such Vytex Natural Rubber Latex. However, non-latex gloves have not yet replaced latex gloves in surgical procedures, as gloves made of alternative materials generally do not fully match the fine control or greater sensitivity to touch available with latex surgical gloves. (High-grade isoprene gloves are the only exception to this rule, as they have the same chemical structure as natural latex rubber. However, fully artificial polyisoprene—rather than [...] "hypoallergenic" [...] cleaned natural latex rubber—is also the most expensive natural latex substitute available.) Other high-grade non-latex gloves, such as <b>nitrile</b> <b>gloves,</b> can cost over twice the price of their latex counterparts, a fact that has often prevented switching to these alternative materials in cost-sensitive environments, such as many hospitals. Nitrile is a synthetic rubber. It has no latex protein content and is more resistant to tearing. Also it is very resistant to many chemicals and is very safe for people who are allergic to latex protein. <b>Nitrile</b> <b>gloves</b> are the most durable type of disposable gloves. Although <b>nitrile</b> <b>gloves</b> are known for their durability, extra care should be taken while handling silver and other highly reactive metals because those substances can react with sulfur, an accelerant in <b>nitrile</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|E

Two commercially available chemically protective gloves (the Canadian NBC butyl rubber glove, Ansell TNT ® <b>nitrile</b> <b>glove)</b> were also assessed. Twenty-four healthy male subjects {{participated in the}} study. Subjects completed two questionnaires, one on the priority of glove functions and the second on glove specific fit and fuctionality. Subjects completed either the weapon assembly/disassembly task or the Purdue pegboard task. The results from both these tasks were consistent for all gloves and {{in agreement with the}} reponses recorded on the questionnaires. The Ansell TNT glove tended to provide the best dexterity scores followed by the Nomex flying, Canadian butyl and Australian butyl gloves. The Ansell TNT glove tended to be the most tactile glove followed by the Candian Butyl, Nomex flying and Australian butyl. Subjects felt their performance in the Australian Butly rubber glove could be enhanced through training and by adopting seamless liners similar to those used in the Canadian system. Overall subjects preferred single layered, seamless gloves that had a low impact on task-dependant dexterity and tactility.

40|$|Introduction. Dental {{professionals}} may be {{at increased}} risk of developing occupational allergic diseases specially to methacrylates that can permeate protective disposable gloves. Case report. We presented a case of occupational allergic contact dermatitis in a 28 -year-old dental technician. The patient had complained of itching and cracking of fingers for 6 months. The dermatitis improved over weekends. Skin erythema and scaling were present with primarily involvement of the fingertips. Patch testing with dental series gave positive vesicular reaction to methyl methacrylate. Follow-up after 6 months of allergen avoidance showed a complete regression of dermatitis. Conclusion. Methacrylates serve as bases for acrylic resins which are used in prosthetics. Methyl methacrylate as a small molecular acrylate can permeate thin protective disposable gloves. Using adequate personal protective equipment, like <b>nitrile</b> rubber <b>gloves,</b> {{is the most important}} preventive measure in this occupation.
