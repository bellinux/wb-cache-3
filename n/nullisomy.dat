50|$|<b>Nullisomy</b> {{is caused}} by {{non-disjunction}} during meiosis that causes two of the gametes to have no chromosomal material, leaving the other two gametes to have double the amount of chromosomal material (disomic).

50|$|Deletions: A {{deletion}} is {{the loss}} of genetic material. The deletion can be heterozygous (copy number of 1) or homozygous (copy number of 0, <b>nullisomy).</b> Microdeletion syndromes are examples of constitutional disorders due to small deletions in germline DNA. Deletions in tumor cells may represent the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, and may have diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic implications.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia [CLL] {{is the most}} common adult leukemia and is heterogeneous in clinical presentation. CLL cases present with various chromosomal aberrations, including 11 q 23, 14 q 32, 17 p, and trisomy 12, with the most common abnormality being deletion of 13 q 14 [1]. Although monoallelic deletion of 13 q 14 is common, there is a subset of patients who have complete <b>nullisomy</b> at 13 q 14, a locus that has been hypothesized to contribute to CLL pa thogenesis [2] due to loss of tumor suppressors [DLEU and miR - 15 a / 16 - 1]. We hypothesized that deletion of both copies of 13 q 14 would lead to uncontrollable proliferation of CLL cells and a poor prognosis. We examined our 13 q 14 <b>nullisomy</b> for survival, treatment-free survival, lymphocyte doubling time, and the presence of lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, we compared the gene expression profiles between patients with 13 q 14 monosomy, <b>nullisomy,</b> or normal karyotype. Our results suggest that patients with 13 q <b>nullisomy</b> have a higher incidence of bulky lymphadenopathy [16. 6 % compared to 10 % of monosomy patients], a higher frequency of lymphocyte doubling time [27. 7 % compared to 7. 4 % of monosomy patients], and a higher rate of needing treatment [50 % compared to 18. 5 % of monosomy patients]. We observed deletion of DLEU 1 and HTR 2 A, consistent with a gene dosage effect, and observed PRE-binding sites on DLEU 1. Patients with homozygous deletion of 13 q 14 had a worse prognosis compared to heterozygotes. Lastly, the DLEU 1 locus is a possible “second hit” loss for CLL progression. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Normal cell {{division}} is coordinated by a bipolar mitotic spindle, ensuring symmetrical segregation of chromosomes. Cancer cells, however, occasionally divide into {{three or more}} directions. Such multipolar mitoses have been proposed to generate genetic diversity and thereby contribute to clonal evolution. However, this notion has been little validated experimentally. Principal Findings: Chromosome segregation and DNA content in daughter cells from multipolar mitoses were assessed by multiphoton cross sectioning and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} in cancer cells and non-neoplastic transformed cells. The DNA distribution resulting from multipolar {{cell division}} was found to be highly variable, with frequent <b>nullisomies</b> in the daughter cells. Time-lapse imaging of H 2 B/GFP-labelled multipolar mitoses revealed that the time from the initiation of metaphase to the beginning of anaphase was prolonged and that the metaphase plates often switched polarity several times before metaphase-anaphase transition. The multipolar metaphase-anaphase transition was accompanied by a normal reduction of cellular cyclin B levels, but typically occurred before completion of the normal separase activity cycle. Centromeric AURKB and MAD 2 foci were observed frequently to remain on the centromeres of multipolar ana-telophase chromosomes, indicating that multipolar mitoses were able to circumvent the spindle assembly checkpoint with some sister chromatids remaining unseparated after anaphase. Accordingly, scoring the distribution of individual chromosomes i...|$|R
40|$|Telomere {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} associated with chromosomal instability in colorectal carcinoma, but the consequences of telomere-dependent instability for chromosome integrity and clonal evolution have been little explored. We show here that abnormally short telomeres lead to a wide spectrum of mitotic disturbances in colorectal cancer cell lines, including anaphase bridging, whole-chromosome lagging, and mitotic multipolarity. These abnormalities were found in both the presence and absence of microsatellite instability. The mean telomere length varied extensively between cells from the same tumor, allowing the establishment of tumor cell subpopulations with highly different frequencies of mitotic disturbances. Anaphase bridging typically resulted in either inter-centromeric chromatin fragmentation or centromere detachment, leading to pericentromeric chromosome rearrangements and loss of whole chromosomes, respectively. There was a strong correlation between anaphase bridges and multipolar mitoses, and the induction of dicentric chromosomes by gamma irradiation and telomerase inhibition led to an elevated frequency of multipolar mitotic spindles, suggesting that multipolarity could result from polyploidization triggered by anaphase bridging. Chromatid segregation in multipolar mitoses was close to random, resulting in frequent <b>nullisomies</b> and nonviable daughter cells. In contrast, there was a high clonogenic survival among cells having gone through anaphase bridging in bipolar mitoses. Bridging of telomere-deficient chromosomes could thus be a major mutational mechanism in colorectal cancer, whereas mitotic multipolarity appears to be a secondary phenomenon that rarely, if ever, contributes to clonal evolution...|$|R
40|$|Previously we {{described}} a BRCA 1 carrier with a neuronal migration defect and postulated {{that the brain}} abnormality was caused by functional <b>nullisomy</b> for BRCA 1. 1 We now describe another family in which a similar type of neuronal migration defect has occurred in one of female identical twins with a BRCA 1 gene mutation (MIM 113705). One twin developed unusually early onset multiple primary breast cancers while the second twin remains cancer free over a decade later. The second twin had long standing epilepsy and focal subcortical heterotopia.

40|$|In vitro-matured {{metaphase}} II (MII) oocytes with corresponding first polar bodies (I pb) {{from two}} indigenous cattle (Bos taurus) breeds {{have been investigated}} to provide specific data upon the incidence of aneuploidy. A total of 165 and 140 in vitro-matured MII oocytes of the Podolian (PO) and Maremmana (MA) breeds, respectively, were analyzed by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} using Xcen and five chromosome-specific painting probes. Oocytes with unreduced chromosome number were 13. 3 % and 6. 4 % in the two breeds, respectively, averaging 10. 2 %. In the PO, out of 100 MII oocytes I pb analyzed, two oocytes were nullisomic for chromosome 5 (2. 0 %) and one disomic for the same chromosome (1. 0 %). In the MA, out of 100 MII oocytes I pb, one oocyte was found nullisomic for chromosome 5 (1. 0 %) and one was disomic for the X chromosome (1. 0 %). Out of 200 MII oocytes I pb, the mean rate of aneuploidy (<b>nullisomy</b> disomy) for the two chromosomes scored was 2. 5 %, of which 1. 5 % was due to <b>nullisomy</b> and 1. 0 % due to disomy. By averaging these data with those previously reported on dairy cattle, the overall incidence of aneuploidy in cattle, as a species, was 2. 25 %, of which 1. 25 % was due to <b>nullisomy</b> and 1. 0 % due to disomy. The results so far achieved indicate similar rates of aneuploidy among the four cattle breeds investigated. Interspecific comparison between cattle (Xcen- 5 probes) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica) (1 – 10 probes) also reveal similar rates. Further studies are needed that use more probes to investigate the interchromosomal effect. Establishing a baseline level of aneuploidy for each species/breed could also be useful for improving the in vitro production of embryos destined to the embryo transfer industry as well as for monitoring future trends of the reproductive health of domestic animals in relation to management errors and/or environmental hazards...|$|E

A four-chromosome multicolor sperm fluorescence in-situ hybridization assay that simultaneously evaluates chromosomes 18, 21, X, and Y was applied to semen provided by four healthy men and to repeated samples of eight Hodgkin's disease patients before treatment, 35 - 50 days after treatment {{to examine the effects of}} treatment on male meiotic cells, and 1 - 2 years after treatment to measure the persistence of damage. There were chromosome-specific variations in baseline frequencies and significant inductions of all of the detectable types of sperm aneuploidies: XY sperm (14 -fold increase), disomy 18 (7 -fold), <b>nullisomy</b> sex (3 -fold), disomy 21 (3 -fold), and disomy X and Y (similar to 2 -fold each). Disomy 21 was about twice as frequent as disomy 18, and neither showed a preferential segregation with a sex chromosome. Extrapolating across the genome, similar to 18 % of sperm carried a numerical abnormality after NOW treatment of meiotic cells. Induced effects did not persist to 1 - 2 years after treatment, suggesting that persistent spermatogonial stem cells were not sensitive to NOW. These findings establish the hypothesis that conception shortly after certain chemotherapies can transiently increase the risks of fathering aneuploid pregnancies that terminate during development or result in the birth of children with major human aneuploidy syndromes...|$|E

Although the exact function of this gene is unknown to date, the structural overlap of its encoded patched domain-containing protein 1, the transmembrane protein involved in the sonic hedgehog pathway, and its expression in human cortex and cerebellum as well as in mice and drosophila brain suggests a causative role of its <b>nullisomy</b> in the developmental phenotype of our family.

40|$|Objective: In many stimulated {{infertility}} treatment cycles some oocytes {{are collected}} immature {{and can be}} matured in vitro (IVM). However, their safe clinical use is questionable because of their apparently low morphologic and genetic quality. We investigated {{the influence of the}} IVM duration on the type and frequency of chromosome abnormalities in germinal vesicle stage (GV) oocytes from stimulated cycles. Design: In-vitro maturation of GV oocytes (from stimulated cycles) for 24 (Group-A) or 36 (Group-B) hours and subsequent fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (FISH) of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22. Results: After maturation, chromosomes were undoubtedly analyzable in 102 oocyte-first polar body pairs. Aneuploidy rates in both groups did not differ statistically. However, within Group-B a significantly higher rate of hyperhaploidy over hypohaploidy was observed. Also, there was a significantly higher frequency of disomy than <b>nullisomy</b> in both groups, and the aneuploidy rate of chromosomes 18 and 22 was significantly increased in Group-B. Conclusion: The observed preferential excess over the loss of genetic material and the increase in chromosome non-disjunction in the oocytes from Group-B, indicate a negative influence of prolonged IVM on chromosome segregation or conversely, suggests that GV oocytes which attain maturity later, possess more intrinsic abnormalities that result in aneuploidy.

Twenty-one patients {{ranging in age from}} 28 to 68 years were divided into five-year groups for comparison with 16 cancer-free individuals matched for age. The medical records of all patients were examined to obtain clinical and histopathological data. None of the patients had undergone radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgery. In all groups, the frequency of Y-chromosome loss was higher among patients than among normal reference subjects (P < 0. 0001) and was not age-dependent.

Although the rate of chromosomally abnormal sperm cells is low and usually does not exceed 1 %, there is no clear indication of fertilizing potential of such gametes. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the type and incidence of numerical chromosomal aberrations in spermatozoa produced by fertile boars used in artificial insemination (AI). We used the protocol of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on sperm interphase nuclei with molecular probes for porcine chromosome pairs 1 and 10. Altogether 12 348 sperm cells were examined. Disomy was observed in spermatozoa of all seven AI boars whereas only one diploid cell was identified in all screened sperm cells. The average rate of chromosomally unbalanced sperm was 0. 105 % (13 / 12 348) with an inter-individual variation from 0. 048 % to 0. 194 %.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization and genomic analyses mapped the deletion region to between exon 1 of COL 4 A 5 and exon 12 of ACSL 4.

Analysis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of lymphoblastoid cell line RNA from an affected male in the family revealed a stable chimeric transcript with the ACSL 4 exons 13 - 17 replaced by a cryptic exon from intron 1 of the COL 4 A 5 gene. A truncated 54 kDa protein was predicted from this transcript but Western blot analysis and ACSL 4 enzyme assay both showed functional <b>nullisomy</b> of ACSL 4.

We {{report the}} case of a de novo reciprocal balanced translocation X; 2 (q 23;q 33) presenting phenotypic alterations highly suggestive of Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) syndrome, a genodermatosis with abnormal skin pigmentation and neurological failure, segregating as X-linked dominant disorder. Through molecular studies, we demonstrated that the altered phenotype could not be ascribed to chromosome microdeletions or to XIST-mediated inactivation of Xq 24 -qter. Interestingly, we found that the Xq 24 -qter region, which translocated downstream of the heterochromatic band 2 q 34, undergoes epigenetic silencing mediated by DNA methylation and histone alterations. Among the downregulated genes, we found the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG/NEMO), the causative gene of IP. We hypothesize that a mosaic functional <b>nullisomy</b> of the translocated genes, through a Position Effect Variegation-like heterochromatization, might be responsible for the proband's phenotypic anomalies. Partial silencing of IKBKG may be responsible for the skin anomalies observed, thereby mimicking the IP pathological condition. In addition to its clinical relevance, this paper addresses fundamental issues related to the chromatin status and nuclear localization of a human euchromatic region translocated proximally to heterochromatin. In conclusion, the study provides new insight into long-range gene silencing mechanisms and their direct impact in human disease...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Meiotic {{segregation}} {{of the sex}} chromosomes was analysed in sperm nuclei from a man with Klinefel-ter’s karyotype by three-colour FISH. The X- and Y-spe-cific DNA probes were co-hybridized with a probe spe-cific for chromosome 1, thus allowing diploid and hyper-haploid spermatozoa to be distinguished. A total of 2206 sperm nuclei was examined; 958 cells contained an X chromosome, 1077 a Y chromosome. The ratio of X:Y bearing sperm differed significantly from the expected 1 : 1 ratio (χ 2 = 6. 96; 0. 001 < P < 0. 01). Sex-chromosomal hyperhaploidy was detected in 2. 67 % of the cells (1. 22 % XX, 1. 36 % XY, 0. 09 % YY) and a diploid constitution in 0. 23 %. Although the frequency of 24,YY sperm {{was similar to that}} detected in fertile males, the frequencies of 24,XX, 24,XY and diploid cells were significantly in-creased. A sex-chromosomal signal was missing in 4. 26 % of the spermatozoa. This percentage appeared to be too high to be attributed merely to <b>nullisomy</b> for the sex chro-mosomes and was considered, at least partially, {{to be the result of}} superposition of sex-chromosomal hybridization signals by autosomal signals in a number of sperm nuclei.

The objective of the present review was to summarize results to date of studies examining pesticide effects on human sperm. Outcomes evaluated included sperm parameters, DNA damage and numerical chromosome aberrations (aneuploidy (disomy, <b>nullisomy)</b> or diploidy). Studies investigating sperm in men environ-mentally and/or occupationally exposed to any types of pesticides were included in the review. The targeted literature search over the last 15 years showed a range of pesticide classes have been investigated including pyrethroids, orga-nophosphates, phenoxyacetic acids, carbamates, organochlorines and pesticide mixtures. None of the studies involved acute exposure events such as chemical accidents. There were 20 studies evaluating semen quality, of which 13 studies reported an association between exposure and semen quality; 6 studies evaluating DNA damage, of which 3 reported an association with exposure; and 6 studies assessing sperm aneuploidy or diploidy, of which 4 reported an association with exposure.

40|$|X-linked nonspecific mental {{retardation}} (MRX) has a frequency of 0. 15 % {{in the male}} population and is caused by defects in several different genes on the human X chromosome. Genotype-phenotype correlations in male patients with a partial <b>nullisomy</b> of the X chromosome have suggested {{that at least one}} locus involved in MRX is on Xp 22. 3. Previous deletion mapping has shown that this gene resides between markers DXS 1060 and DXS 1139, a region encompassing ∼ 1. 5 Mb of DNA. Analyzing the DNA of 15 males with Xp deletions, we were able to narrow this MRX critical interval to ∼ 15 kb of DNA. Only one gene, VCX-A (variably charged, X chromosome mRNA on CRI-S 232 A), was shown to reside in this interval. Because of a variable number of tandem 30 -bp repeats in the VCX-A gene, the size of the predicted protein is 186 – 226 amino acids. VCX-A belongs to a gene family containing at least four nearly identical paralogues on Xp 22. 3 (VCX-A, -B, -B 1, and -C) and two on Yq 11. 2 (VCY-D, VCY-E), suggesting that the X and Y copies were created by duplication events. We have found that VCX-A is retained in all patients with normal intelligence and is deleted in all patients with {{mental retardation}}.

Aneuploidy in germ cells is {{the main cause of}} infertility, abortions and congenital diseases. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), is the most efficient cytogenetic molecular technique to date to analyse numerical alterations of chromosomes in spermatozoa. We investigated the frequencies of aneuploidy and diploidy in individuals occupationally exposed to styrene and in healthy unexposed controls. We performed multicolour FISH, using DNA probes specific for the centromeric regions of sex chromosomes and chromosome 2, in decondensed sperm nuclei of samples with normal semen parameters for a total of 18 styrene-exposed subjects and 13 unexposed controls of the same age range. Exposed individuals had worked for at least 2 years during the last 5 years, and continuously for 6 months, in factories producing reinforced plastics. The incidence of aneuploidy and diploidy for the tested chromosomes did not show a statistically significant difference between workers and controls. The {{exposure to}} styrene was associated with increased frequencies of <b>nullisomy</b> for sex chromosomes in the group of non-smokers, although {{only a limited number of}} subjects belonged to this sub-group. Considering the whole study population, age was associated with an increased frequency of XX disomy, whereas smoking was associated with meiosis II non-disjunction of sex chromosomes.

40|$|The {{variability}} in the morphology, modal number of chromosomes, TCR expression and functional reactivity of a CII-specific T-cell hybridoma at continuous subcultivation have been investigated. As the number of passages increased, besides the oval semiadherent cells (normal phenotype), fibroblast-like cells (transformed phenotype) were also observed. The two cell subpopulations differed in their karyotype characteristic, {{as well as in}} their functional reactivity. The cell population with a normal phenotype was characterized by a tetramodal number of chromosomes (30, 40, 48 and 70) and trisomies of chromosomes 6 and 14, while the cell population with a transformed phenotype was characterized by a trimodal number of chromosomes (11, 68 and 74) and trisomy of chromosome 12. A <b>nullisomy</b> of sex chromosomes was established in both types of cells. In the initial passages of subcultivation, 73. 04 % of the cells with a normal morphological phenotype expressed TCR-CD 3 complexes on their surface and possessed high functional reactivity. After a two-week subcultivation, the values of these indices went down considerably: 46. 11 % of the cells expressed functional TCR-CD 3 complexes, as a result of which their functional reactivity decreased. Only 2. 71 % of the cells with a transformed morphological phenotype expressed functional TCR-CD 3 complexes on their surface.

The achieved results show that at continuous subcultivation the T-cell hybridomas are unstable, and with {{the increase in the number}} of passages there appear chromosome rearrangements, leading to loss of their functional reactivity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although X-linked mental {{retardation}} (XLMR) affects 2 %- 3 % {{of the human}} population, {{little is known about}} the underlying molecular mechanisms. Recent interest in this topic led to the identification of several genes for which mutations result in the disturbance of cognitive development. RESULTS: We identified a novel gene that is interrupted by an inv(X) (p 21. 1;q 22) in a male patient with a syndromic form of {{mental retardation}}. Molecular analysis of both breakpoint regions did not reveal an interrupted gene on Xp, but identified a novel nuclear RNA export factor (NXF) gene cluster, Xcen-NXF 5 -NXF 2 -NXF 4 -NXF 3 -Xqter, in which NXF 5 is split by the breakpoint, leading to its functional <b>nullisomy.</b> The predicted NXF 5 protein shows high similarity with the central part of the presumed mRNA nuclear export factor TAP/NXF 1. Functional analysis of NXF 5 demonstrates binding to RNA as well as to the RNA nuclear export-associated protein p 15 /NXT. In contrast to TAP/NXF 1, overexpression studies localized NXF 5 in the form of granules in the cell body and neurites of mature hippocampal neurons, suggesting a role in mRNA transport. The two newly identified mouse nxf homologs, nxf-a and nxf-b, which also map on X, show highest mRNA levels in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: A novel member of the nuclear RNA export factor family is absent in a male patient with a syndromic form of mental retardation. Although we did not find direct evidence for the involvement of NXF 5 in MR, the gene could be involved in development, possibly through a process in mRNA metabolism in neurons. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptional {{silencing}} of X chromosome {{starts in}} the early embryogenesis of female mammals and randomly inactivates either the maternally or the paternally derived X chromosome, which thereafter shows a late replicating behavior. We studied the X inactivation pattern {{in a case of}} reciprocal balanced translocation: 46,XX,t(X; 2) (Xpter->Xq 23 :: 2 q 3 -> 2 qter; 2 pter-> 2 q 34 ::Xq 24 ->Xqter) de novo, presenting with a phenotype suggestive of hypomelanosis of Ito: mild mental retardation, short stature, obesity, hypo-pigmented cutaneous patches, facial dysmorphisms, myopia, hemi-hypertrophy of limbs, brachydactily. CGH by Affymetrix SNP array 6. 0 excluded microdeletions, microduplications and loss of heterozygosity at the breakpoints. Methylation analysis at the androgen receptor locus showed completely skewed X inactivation in the proband lymphocytes. Fluorescent BrdU assay, combined with in situ hybridization using whole chromosome 2 painting, demonstrated that the normal X chromosome was late replicating in 100 % of the metaphases from lymphocytes, thus excluding autosome inactivation. The same analysis, performed in skin fibroblasts, showed a late replication also in part of the Xq region translocated to chromosome 2 q, in 60 % of the metaphases, suggesting gene silencing in this region. Analysis of histone H 3 lysine methylation confirmed the partial inactivation of the translocated Xq region in fibroblasts. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated downregulation of some genes mapping to Xq 24 qter in the proband fibroblasts. As the altered phenotype can be ascribed neither to chromosome microdeletions nor to inactivation of the translocated chromosome 2 region, we hypothesize that a mosaic functional <b>nullisomy</b> of genes mapping to Xq 24 qter, through a position-effect variegation mechanism, might be responsible for the phenotypic anomalies of the proband...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} {{availability of}} drugs for impotence and advanced reproductive technologies {{for the treatment}} of subfertility, more men are fathering children at advanced ages. We conducted a study of the chromosomal content of sperm of healthy men aged 24 – 57 years to (a) determine whether father’s age was associated with increasing frequencies of aneuploid sperm including XY, disomy X, disomy Y, disomy 21, and sperm diploidy, and (b) examine the association between the frequencies of disomy 21 and sex-chromosomal aneuploidies. The study group consisted of 38 fathers of boys with Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) recruited nationwide, and sperm aneuploidy was assessed using multicolor X-Y- 21 sperm FISH (∼ 10, 000 sperm per donor). Paternal age was significantly correlated with the sex ratio of sperm (Y/X; P=. 006) and with the frequency of XY sperm (P=. 02), with a clear trend with age by decades (P<. 006). Compared with fathers in their 20 s (who had an average frequency of 7. 5 XY sperm per 10, 000), the frequencies of XY sperm were 10 % higher among fathers in their 30 s, 31 % higher among those in their 40 s, and 160 % higher among those in their 50 s (95 % CI 69 %– 300 %). However, there was no evidence for age effects on frequencies of sperm carrying <b>nullisomy</b> sex; disomies X, Y, or 21; or meiosis I or II diploidies. The frequencies of disomy 21 sperm were significantly associated with sex-chromosomal aneuploidy (P=. 04) —in particular, with disomy X (P=. 004), but disomy 21 sperm did not preferentially carry either sex chromosome. These findings suggest that older fathers produce higher frequencies of XY sperm, which may place them at higher risk of fathering boys with Klinefelter syndrome, and that age effects on sperm aneuploidy are chromosome specific...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{carrying}} a chromosomal rearrangement (CR) {{have an increased}} risk for chromosomally unbalanced conceptions. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) may avoid the transfer of embryos carrying unbalanced rearrangements, therefore increasing the chance of pregnancy. Only 7 - 12 loci can be screened by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} whereas microarray technology can detect genome-wide imbalances at the single cell level. We performed PGD for a CR carrier with karyotype 46,XY,ins(3; 2) (p 23;q 23 q 14. 2),t(6; 14) (p 12. 2;q 13) using array comparative genomic hybridization. Selection of embryos for transfer was only based on copy number status of the chromosomes involved in both rearrangements. In two ICSI-PGD cycles, nine and seven embryos were analysed by array, leaving three and one embryo(s) suitable for transfer, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of single cell arrays was 100 and 88. 8 %, respectively. In both cycles a single embryo was transferred, resulting in pregnancy following the second cycle. The embryo giving rise to the pregnancy was normal/balanced for the insertion and translocation but carried a trisomy 8 and <b>nullisomy</b> 9 in one of the two biopsied blastomeres. After 7 weeks of pregnancy the couple miscarried. Genetic analysis following hystero-embryoscopy showed a diploid (90 %) /tetraploid (10 %) mosaic chorion, while the gestational sac was empty. No chromosome 8 aneuploidy was detected in the chorion, while 8 % of the cells carried a monosomy for chromosome 9. In summary, we demonstrate the feasibility and determine the accuracy of single cell array technology to test against transmission of the unbalanced meiotic products that can derive from CRs. Our findings also demonstrate that the genomic constitution of extra-embryonic tissue cannot necessarily be predicted from the copy number status of a single blastomere. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Finding a {{positive}} association between paternal {{age and the}} incidence of aneuploidy is not difficult. A cursory analysis however reveals that any association is indirect, brought about by a close correlation between paternal age and maternal age. Approaches for dissecting out the confounding age effects of the mother {{has led to a}} lively exchange among epidemiologists, with perhaps a consensus for the absence of a paternal age effect, at least for trisomy 21. Molecular studies revealed the relatively minor contribution of paternal errors to trisomy, but even research on the paternally derived trisomies alone has been inconclusive; thus studies focussed directly on the sperm heads. Human-hamster fusion assays were superseded by FISH for establishing any possible link between age and the proportion of disomic sperm in an ejaculate. Despite innumerable microscope hours however, although convincing studies suggesting an age effect for disomies 1, 9, 18 and 21 and the sex chromosomes are in the literature, others failed to notice any association for these or other chromosomes. It is biologically plausible that chromosomal non-disjunction errors should increase with age. Male reproductive hormone production, testicular morphology and semen parameters all decline slowly with age and paternal age is implicated in congenital birth defects, such as achondroplasia and Apert syndromes and also linked to compromised DNA repair mechanisms. Despite several decades of epidemiological and molecular cytogenetic studies, however, we are still not close to a definitive answer of {{whether or not there is}} a paternal age effect for aneuploidy. In this review we conclude by questioning the efficacy of FISH because of difficulties in detecting <b>nullisomy</b> and because of evidence that the centromeres (from which most sperm-FISH probes are derived) cluster at the nuclear centre. Array-based approaches may well supersede FISH in addressing the question of a paternal age effect; for now, however, the jury is still out...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: An {{explosive}} growth in Y chromosome long arm (Yq) microdeletion testing demand for male infertility {{occurred in the}} past few years. However, despite the progresses in the biology of this chromosome, a number of molecular and clinical concerns are not supported by definitive data. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to provide information on the type and prevalence of microdeletions in infertile males, indication for testing, genotype-phenotype correlation, sperm aneuploidies, and genetic counseling. DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed a prospective study from January 1996 to December 2005 in an academic clinic. PATIENTS: We studied 3073 consecutive infertile men, of which 625 were affected by nonobstructive azoospermia and 1372 were affected by severe oligozoospermia. Ninety-nine patients with microdeletions are described here. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Yq microdeletions, seminal analysis, reproductive hormones, testicular cytology/histology, and sperm sex chromosomes aneuploidies were used as outcome measures. RESULTS: The prevalence of microdeletions was 3. 2 % in unselected infertile men, 8. 3 % in men with nonobstructive azoospermia, and 5. 5 % in men with severe oligozoospermia. Only 2 of 99 deletions were found in men with more than 2 million sperm/ml. No clinical data are useful to identify a priori patients with higher risk of Yq microdeletions. Most deletions are of the AZFc-b 2 /b 4 subtype and are associated with variable spermatogenic phenotype, with sperm present in 72 % of the cases. Complete AZFa and AZFb (P 5 /Proximal P 1) deletions are associated with Sertoli cell-only syndrome and alterations in spermatocyte maturation, respectively, whereas partial deletions in these regions are associated with milder phenotype and frequent presence of sperm. Men with AZFc-b 2 /b 4 deletions produce a higher percentage of sperm with <b>nullisomy</b> for the sex chromosomes and XY-disomy. CONCLUSIONS: This extensive clinical research expands the knowledge on genotype-phenotype relationships and confirms that the identification of Yq microdeletions has significant diagnostic and prognostic value, adding useful information for genetic counseling in these patients...|$|E
