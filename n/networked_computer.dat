40|$|Abstract. Currently it is {{difficult}} to use a single <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> application server to meet the demand of concurrent access to a large number of users. It is an ideal way to introduce in the cluster technology in the <b>network</b> for a <b>computer</b> system to solve this problem. In this paper, <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> server cluster {{on the basis of the}} existing <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system is designed and key issues are studied. <b>Network</b> <b>computer</b> system With the development of computing technology, personal computing provides users with an increasingly rich personalized graphics interface and application, but costs of personal computer installation, deployment, maintenance and management continue to increase, the PC calculation mode put forward a huge challenge for users, especially for business users. <b>Network</b> <b>computer</b> system not only allows the user to use the applications and personalized settings of the server by service agreement, but also allows multiple users to share the application computing and storage resources, thus greatly reduces the installation, deployment, maintenance and management costs. The calculation mode that provides users with remote service <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> through <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> is becoming increasingly popular; its products are increasingly rich. Basic principle The so-called <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system generally consists of three parts: the application server, the client and the application service agreement. The design of the application service agreement is the core of the <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system. The application of the service agreement here refers to the mechanism of interaction between the client and server in particular. In <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> systems, multiple clients communicate with the server system through application service agreement thus be able to shared server the application service. Application logic, including window systems are running on the server side, the client only has a simple input and output capacity. Compared with the traditional mode of application, application mode based on <b>network</b> <b>computer</b> system has some typical features...|$|R

For example, in one embodiment, users can identify other users {{based on their}} affiliations with particular schools or other organizations. The system also provides a mechanism for a user to selectively establish contact relationships or connections with other users, and to grant permissions for such other users to view personal information of the user. The system may also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their respective contacts. In addition, the system may automatically notify users of personal information updates made by their respective contacts.|$|E

Viewers can use a web browser or specialised applications to discuss a program with other viewers, while it is being broadcast, while content providers may use the second screen to interact with viewers in real time. For example, the latter facility allows content providers to conduct real-time polls or to collect comments about the program, that can be displayed as text on the main television screen. Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
