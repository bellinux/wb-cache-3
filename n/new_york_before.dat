5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in Europe and the middle east, all three returned to <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>before</b> moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding on 21 May 1902 and was {{launched}} on 5 April 1904. She was commissioned for active service on 7 May 1906. Captain Seaton Schroeder was the ship's first commander. Virginia began a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, to Newport, Rhode Island, then to Long Island, <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>before</b> arriving in Bradford, Rhode Island on 9 August. Sea trials followed off Rockland, Maine, before proceeding to Oyster Bay, Long Island, where she was reviewed by President Theodore Roosevelt from 2 to 4 September. The ship returned to her shakedown cruise. In the mean time, a revolution had begun in Cuba against President T. Estrada Palma, who requested United States intervention to protect his government. Virginia was sent on 15 September to protect Havana from attack; she remained there from 21 September to 13 October, {{when she returned to}} Sewell's Point, Virginia.|$|E

He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. As attorney general, Beshear issued an opinion that copies of the Ten Commandments would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms {{in the wake of the}} U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Stone v. Graham. He also clashed with first lady Phyllis George Brown when he opposed the practice of charging an admission fee for visitors to view the renovated governor's mansion. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor Martha Layne Collins. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac {{hurricane}} {{was among}} the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern United States. Advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August23 with winds of about 90mph (150km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>before</b> losing tropical characteristics on August25. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August28.|$|E
5|$|Vermont then steamed to Newport before {{proceeding}} to Hampton Roads no 22 August where more target practice followed from 25 to 27 September. She {{and several other}} ships from the Atlantic Fleet then visited <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>before</b> some minor repairs were effected at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. By this time, the ship had been transferred to the 3rd Division. On 1 November, Vermont and several other ships of the Atlantic Fleet crossed the Atlantic for a visit of several western European ports, including Gravesend from 16 November to 7 December and Brest. The ships left Brest on 30 December to recross the Atlantic, bound for Cuban waters. From 13 January 1911 to 13 March, Vermont {{and the rest of}} the ships conducted maneuvers off Cuba. Further exercises followed off the Virginia Capes and in the Chesapeake Bay. A brief stop at Hampton Roads, where she carried target materials, followed on 8 April, though she left later that day for another period in the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs.|$|E

5|$|While {{over the}} western Atlantic Ocean {{as a major}} hurricane, forecasters {{predicted}} Isabel would pass through the central portion of the state. Successive forecasts shifted the track slightly further to the west, though its track into Ohio was not anticipated. Hours before it entered the state, the National Hurricane Center continued to predict Isabel would traverse {{the entire length of}} the state from south to north and later entering <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>before</b> crossing Lake Ontario into Canada. Around 3% of those who evacuated in North Carolina and in the Eastern Shore of Virginia stayed in Pennsylvania during the storm. The threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out of the state. To compensate, Delta Air Lines allowed those flying to or from Philadelphia, Allentown, and Harrisburg to reschedule to a later date. American Airlines offered a similar option. United Airlines and United Express opted to waive charging fees for travelers in and out of the state.|$|E
