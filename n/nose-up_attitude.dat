25|$|No {{mechanical}} defects, {{other than}} the inoperative fuel pump, were reported. The aircraft {{was found to be}} in a high <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> at impact.|$|E
25|$|Eyewitnesses (including a Mr Russell) {{state that}} at 3:05pm the Avro Tudor was {{approaching}} runway 28 of Llandow aerodrome at an abnormally low altitude with the undercarriage down. The pilot attempted {{to correct the}} descent by increasing {{the power of the}} engines and brought the plane up. The aircraft rose steeply to 100m (300ft) attaining a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> of 35 degrees to the vertical, and then the aircraft stalled.|$|E
25|$|By 16:10:32 (122 seconds), the leading-edge devices had stowed {{fully into}} the wing. The speed was , and height {{above the ground}} was , with the {{aircraft}} still held into its usual climb attitude. Key continued to hold the <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> {{when there was a}} second stick shake and stick push in the following two seconds. A third stick push followed 127 seconds into the flight but no recovery was attempted. One second later, the stall warning and recovery system was over-ridden by a flight crew member.|$|E
50|$|During this phase, {{there was}} a sharp <b>nose-up</b> pitch <b>attitude</b> change, with the {{aircraft}} at low altitude, seeming to be losing speed. It then dived with a slight angle {{to the right and}} crashed. The landing gear was extended.|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} an advanced lifting ejector system {{incorporated into a}} full-scale, powered, fighter aircraft model were measured at statically and at transition airspeeds in the 40 - by 80 - and 80 - by 120 -Foot Wind Tunnels at NASA-Ames. The ejector system was installed in an ejector-lift/vectored thrust STOVL (Short Take-Off Vertical Landing) fighter aircraft configuration. Ejector thrust augmentation ratios approaching 1. 6 were demonstrated during static testing. Changes in the internal aerodynamics and exit flow conditions of the ejector ducts are presented {{for a variety of}} wind-off and forward-flight test conditions. Wind-on test results indicate a small decrease in ejector performance and increase in exit flow nonuniformity with forward speed. Simulated ejector start-up at high speed, <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitudes</b> caused only small effects on overall vehicle forces and moments {{despite the fact that the}} ejector inlet flow was found to induce large regions of negative pressure on the upper surface of the wing apex adjacent to the inlets...|$|R
5000|$|At around 7:05 p.m., {{while on}} {{approach}} to Runway 33 at Johnstown-Cambria County Airport, the plane descended below the lowest safe approach slope, then stalled, {{at which point}} the pilots lost control. The plane clipped the top of a bank of elevated approach lights, soared over a highway (U.S. Route 219) and, while in a <b>nose-up,</b> wings-level <b>attitude,</b> slammed into the top of a steep embankment approximately 100 yards short of the runway. [...] "It was a matter of five feet, and he would have been clear," [...] Warren Krise, an Air East official, said afterward.|$|R
25|$|The Camel {{proved to}} have better {{manoeuvrability}} than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane. Its controls were light and sensitive. The Camel turned more slowly to the left, {{which resulted in a}} <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> due to the torque of the rotary engine, but the torque also resulted in being able to turn to the right quicker than other fighters, although that resulted in a tendency towards a nose-down attitude from the turn. Because of the faster turning capability to the right, some pilots preferred to change heading 90° to the left by turning 270° to the right.|$|E
500|$|In late 1963 {{the project}} was named Tagboard; the Q-12 was re-designated D-21 while the A-12 version {{launcher}} became M-21 (D- for [...] "daughter" [...] and M- for [...] "mother"). Two of the original 18 A-12 aircraft were designated as M-21s with serial numbers 60-6940 and 60-6941. The M-21 was a two-seat version of the A-12, with a pylon on the fuselage centerline between the vertical stabilizers to carry the drone in a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b>|$|E
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer nose undercarriage leg, featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E
40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2015, NASA Langley Research Center {{conducted}} three full-scale crash tests of Cessna 172 (C- 172) aircraft at the NASA Langley Landing and Impact Research (LandIR) Facility. The first test represented a flare-to-stall emergency or hard landing onto a rigid surface. The second test, which {{is the focus of}} this paper, represented a controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) with a nose-down pitch attitude of the aircraft, which impacted onto soft soil. The third test, also conducted onto soil, represented a CFIT with a <b>nose-up</b> pitch <b>attitude</b> of the aircraft, which resulted in a tail strike condition. These three crash tests were performed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) and to generate impact test data for model validation. LS-DYNA finite element models were generated to simulate the three test conditions. This paper describes the model development and presents test-analysis comparisons of acceleration and velocity time-histories, as well as a comparison of the time sequence of events for Test 2 onto soft soil...|$|R
2500|$|The {{plane was}} too badly damaged to {{determine}} a definite cause. Canadian aircraft {{were not required to}} carry voice cockpit recorders or flight data recorders at this point, complicating the investigation into the crash of TCA Flight 831. [...] The official report released in 1965 pointed to problems in the jet's pitch trim system (the device that maintains a set <b>nose-up</b> or -down <b>attitude)</b> as a possibility, since a pitch trim problem caused the similar crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 304, another DC-8, three months later in 1964. [...] Other possible causes were put forward that could not be ruled out: 1) Icing of the pitot system; and 2) Failure of the vertical gyro.|$|R
40|$|Although downbursts {{have been}} {{identified}} as the major cause of a number of aircraft takeoff and landing accidents, only the 1985 Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) and the more recent (July 1994) Charlotte, North Carolina, landing accidents provided sufficient onboard recorded data to perform a comprehensive analysis of the downburst phenomenon. The first step in the present analysis was the determination of the downburst wind components. Once the wind components and their gradients were determined, the degrading effect of the wind environment on the airplane's performance was calculated. This wind-shear-induced aircraft performance degradation, sometimes called the F-factor, was broken down into two components F(sub 1) and F(sub 2), representing the effect of the horizontal wind gradient and the vertical wind velocity, respectively. In both the DFW and Charlotte cases, F(sub 1) was found to be the dominant causal factor of the accident. Next, the aircraft in the two cases were mathematically modeled using the longitudinal equations of motion and the appropriate aerodynamic parameters. Based on the aircraft model and the determined winds, the aircraft response to the recorded pilot inputs showed good agreement with the onboard recordings. Finally, various landing abort strategies were studied. It was concluded that the most acceptable landing abort strategy from both an analytical and pilot's standpoint was to hold constant <b>nose-up</b> pitch <b>attitude</b> while operating at maximum engine thrust...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the flight}} voice {{recorder}} {{revealed that the}} co-pilot and a third pilot on the flight deck had made relatively subtle suggestions to the pilot– once the stick-shaker warning commenced– that he must {{deal with the fact}} that the plane was still in a speed-draining <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> protocols and training were reinforced to establish a greater willingness of junior flight-deck staff to be more forceful in similar situations. [...] (In the Birgenair crash, it had even been revealed that the co-pilot chose not to use his own, active, stick to counter the pilot and try to bring the nose down.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was descending through {{an altitude of}} [...] when the stick shaker activated and sounded for 3 seconds. After 1.5 seconds, the stick shaker sounded again. The aircraft continued to descend below the glide slope until it collided with a stand of trees in a high <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude.</b> It came to rest upright in a commercial building, [...] short of the runway. After the impact, a fire started {{in or near the}} left engine, which spread {{to the rest of the}} aircraft. At least four of the passengers survived the crash, however, only three escaped before the {{aircraft was}} fully engulfed in flames.|$|E
2500|$|Feighnter was {{assigned}} as the Navy's project pilot for the Vought F7U Cutlass, a carrier-based jet fighter-bomber with swept wings and an unusual tailless design. From July 23 to August 14, 1951, he performed carrier suitability {{tests of the}} Cutlass on board the USS Midway. Feightner survived a number of near-fatal incidents in the Cutlass. During a test using the NAS Patuxent River air field catapult, an engine exploded and caught fire on takeoff. Unable to eject at such a low altitude, Feightner made use of a low spot in the river bank to turn the aircraft and return safely to the field where firefighters extinguished the burning engine. On July 23, 1951, he performed the first (and only) carrier takeoff and landing of the dash-1 variant on the aircraft carrier [...] Landing the Cutlass was hazardous due to the extreme <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> that restricted visibility forward and below. Feightner was unable to see the flight deck and relied on the Landing Signal Officer (LSO) to provide the indication to reduce engine power. Despite assistance from the LSO, Feightner landed short of the desired position and nearly struck the ramp. Although the fleet received the improved F7U-3, the Cutlass did {{not live up to}} its potential and remained in service less than four years.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 July 1908 the airship was reinflated {{with fresh}} {{hydrogen}} to ensure maximum lift for the planned 24-hour endurance trial, {{which was to}} be a return flight to Mainz. Shortly after setting off the next morning a fan broke on the forward engine and it had to turn back. The following day it was damaged while being manoeuvered out of its hangar: repairs were not completed {{until the end of the}} month. [...] The trial flight finally started on 4 August, when LZ4 lifted off at 06:22 in the morning, carrying 12 people and sufficient fuel for 31hours of flight. The flight to Zürich had excited considerable public interest, and large crowds gathered along the route to witness the flight, which took it over Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Basel and Strasbourg. [...] Shortly after passing Strasbourg the forward engine had to be stopped since the fuel tank in the engine gondola had been exhausted, and needed to be refilled. At this point the airship was flying light due to the heat of the sun having caused the hydrogen to expand, and was being held at a low altitude by dynamic downforce generated by flying in a nose-down attitude: with the loss of the power of one engine, it rose to an altitude of , venting gas from the relief valves as it did so. At 1:58 p.m the aft engine had to be stopped for refuelling: this time the airship rose to , with a further loss of hydrogen. Two further engine stoppages caused further loss of gas: by now LZ4 was only being kept in the air by dynamic lift generated by flying with a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> the resultant drag reducing its speed to , and at 5:24 pm a landing was made on the Rhine near Oppenheim, [...] short of Mainz. [...] All superfluous items and five crew members were unloaded, and the flight was resumed at 10:20. Mainz was reached half an hour later, and the ship turned to begin its return journey. Further engine problems followed: a crank bearing in the forward engine melted at 1:27 am, reducing airspeed to about [...] and it was decided to land to have the engine repaired by engineers from the Daimler works at Untertürkheim. Accordingly, LZ4 was set down at 7:51 am at Echterdingen.|$|E

50|$|The captain {{noticed the}} {{reduction}} in engine power, {{but he did not}} realize the source of the problem. Therefore, he started a rapid descent as a precaution. At that time, the airspeed was already near stall speed, and the autopilot had kept a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> to maintain a constant height. When the airliner was pummeled by a sudden updraft, it finally entered a stall condition and the crew mishandled it. Although the cockpit voice recorder picked up the first officer correctly diagnosing the situation as a stall and attempting twice to communicate this to the captain, the captain was likely confused by the unusual behaviour of the engines, due to the anti-ice system and probably the air flow disruption caused by the updraft. The captain thought he was struggling with an engine flameout, which he told the first officer to communicate to the ground controller, and did not recognise the deep stall situation; he then mishandled the stall by maintaining <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> which further decreased speed and deepened the stall until the plane eventually crashed.|$|E

50|$|According to the {{official}} investigation report, the crash {{was a result of}} pilot error, arising from a lack of skill to recover from an excessive <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> during a go-around procedure. The pilots’ deficiencies were caused by a deficiency in the airline's safety management and a lack of regulatory oversight. One member of the commission filed an alternative opinion report, however, claiming that the commission had ignored the possible malfunction of the aircraft's elevators' controls.|$|E
50|$|It {{was badly}} damaged on February 14, 1902 when {{superheating}} {{of the hydrogen}} caused the airship, already in a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> to pitch up even further, causing some of the wires supporting the gondola to break.

50|$|After takeoff, White Knight and SpaceShipOne {{ascended to}} the launch altitude, {{planned to be}} around 14 km. At 08:09 SpaceShipOne was released, glided for 6 s, then went into <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> and the rocket motor was ignited. The rocket motor was capable of burning for {{approximately}} 87 s, having been upgraded since the previous flight. It was planned to shut off the motor {{at an altitude of}} 345,000 feet (105 km), presumably to avoid pushing the envelope too far.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle started encountering more {{significant}} air density {{in the lower}} thermosphere at about 400000 ft, at around Mach 25, 8200 m/s. The vehicle was controlled {{by a combination of}} RCS thrusters and control surfaces, to fly at a 40-degree <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude,</b> producing high drag, not only to slow it down to landing speed, but also to reduce reentry heating. As the vehicle encountered progressively denser air, it began a gradual transition from spacecraft to aircraft. In a straight line, its 40-degree <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> would cause the descent angle to flatten-out, or even rise. The vehicle therefore performed a series of four steep S-shaped banking turns, each lasting several minutes, at up to 70 degrees of bank, while still maintaining the 40-degree angle of attack. In this way it dissipated speed sideways rather than upwards. This occurred during the 'hottest' phase of re-entry, when the heat-shield glowed red and the G-forces were at their highest. By {{the end of the last}} turn, the transition to aircraft was almost complete. The vehicle leveled its wings, lowered its nose into a shallow dive and began its approach to the landing site.|$|E

While both had given good service, they were no longer modern, and they suffered from a common set of flaws: a tailwheel landing gear which gave them a <b>nose-up</b> <b>attitude</b> when at rest complicating cargo stowing, restrictive side-loading doors and limited payload.|$|E
