25|$|The {{campaign}} website <b>Nothing</b> <b>To</b> <b>Hide</b> contained both videos {{complete with}} bloopers {{and behind the}} scenes {{most of which are}} still on YouTube. On YouTube the in-flight safety video gathered over 7 million views by the start of 2013. The campaign was reported by international networks such as CNN and the BBC.|$|E
2500|$|Women Strike for Peace {{played a}} crucial role in {{bringing}} down the House Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC). From the beginning of the WSP in 1961 the FBI had the group under surveillance due to fear that communism had spread to the mothers of America. WSP approached the committee hearings differnetly than those summoned before them. In November of 1962 the leaders of the group were subpoenaed to the HUAC. After the subpoenas were distributed to the women WSP released the information the media before the HUAC could issue a press release, as the committee used the news media to discredit the organizations. When under question the women used their status as mother to argue their moral high ground, as mothers arguing for peace were the most loyal American. Another strategy that differed from those before them was the use of a large quantity of WSP members to volunteer to tesitfy at the hearings, effectively showing that the group had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hid.</b> Political theorist Jean Bethke Elshtain determined that the WSP's performance at the HUAC was a success due to the [...] "deconstructive power of a politics of humor, irony, evasion, and ridicule". The use of motherhood and family as a tool for the attack on the congressional hearings show the [...] "familial-cold war consensus" [...] would soon crumble.|$|R
50|$|Letters in {{the archive}} {{correspondence}} of Chaim Weizmann, {{first president of}} Israel, hint that, in his profession as a distinguished organic chemist, Weizmann had stumbled on a method for the cheap synthesis of petroleum. Now, decades later, a world buffeted by oil shocks and perpetually rising prices would welcome such a chemical miracle. But Weizmann's laboratory notebooks must be found first, and an unseen and powerful enemy will stop at <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> keep them <b>hidden.</b>|$|R
60|$|Two well-assorted {{travellers}} use The highway, Eros and the Muse. From {{the twins}} is <b>nothing</b> <b>hidden,</b> <b>To</b> the pair is naught forbidden; Hand in hand the comrades go Every nook of nature through: Each for other they were born, Each can other best adorn; They know one only mortal grief Past all balsam or relief, When, by false companions crossed, The pilgrims {{have each other}} lost.|$|R
25|$|Extrajudicial {{prisoners of}} the United States, {{in the context}} of the early twenty-first century War on Terrorism, refers to foreign {{nationals}} the United States detains outside of the legal process required within United States legal jurisdiction. In this context, the U.S. government is maintaining torture centers, called black sites, operated by both known and secret intelligence agencies. Such black sites were later confirmed by reports from journalists, investigations, and from men who had been imprisoned and tortured there, and later released after being tortured until the CIA was comfortable they had done nothing wrong, and had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, {{police were}} not able to develop any {{evidence}} from this material that might have helped them locate Bethany. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as a person of interest. Emile Decker later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his client has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Bethany had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of what she might look like near the end of a pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|On occasions, Eyschen's {{principles}} got {{the better}} of him. [...] On 13 October 1914, a Luxembourgish journalist named Karl Dardar was arrested by the German army for publishing anti-German stories. [...] He was then taken to Koblenz, and tried and sentenced by court-martial to three months imprisonment. [...] Eyschen was outraged that the Germans had kidnapped a Luxembourgish citizen and tried him for an extraterritorial offence, and Eyschen did <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> his indignation. [...] Eyschen told the German minister in Luxembourg that the action was a 'direct injury to the Grand Duchy's national sovereignty'.|$|E
50|$|Take Five This is {{the most}} craziest of all. Aged mothers {{and women of the}} 75, 80 and 90 bracket are {{prepared}} to bare topless and go on that road and refuse to leave until the Federal Ministry of Works and its allied agencies do something drastically and immediately. It will be an abomination for such elderly peeved mothers to show the entire world and go viral on the social network their flattened and flabby breasts after all they have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> lose and <b>hide.</b>|$|R
40|$|The preaching of anti-violence now {{requires}} {{a point of}} leverage {{in order to bring}} to the fore just concerns and reduce the arrogance of the powerful. In certain contexts, in certain conditions, it is opportune not to make use of all the force that one has. It is necessary, however, to have it available, if one does not want others to take it: one does not give up one’s own force without succumbing to others. Measuring out the usage of the force one has forms part of the strategy of political action, not as any old option but as necessary knowledge. Although force and violence are very different from each other, to separate them by definition achieves <b>nothing</b> except <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> an aspect that cannot be eliminated of human reality...|$|R
50|$|Lily {{has hired}} an art dealer to redecorate the {{apartment}} and asks her to buy a nude photo that Mapplethorpe once did of her. The art dealer finds {{it has already been}} bought by Bart. She and Lily assume it is a present but when Bart returns home he reveals he only bought it so no-one could see it and use it against them. Lily is shocked he got a private investigator to do a file on her past and claims she has <b>nothing</b> she wants <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> from her children...until Bart shows her {{one of the things he}} dug up.|$|R
500|$|Finkelstein was {{questioned}} {{after his arrival}} at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv and detained for 24 hours in a holding cell. After speaking to Israeli attorney Michael Sfard he was placed on a flight back to Amsterdam, his point of origin. In an interview with Haaretz, Finkelstein stated [...] "I {{did my best to}} provide absolutely candid and comprehensive answers to all the questions put to me. I am confident that I have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide...</b> no suicide missions or secret rendezvous with terrorist organizations." [...] He had been travelling to visit friends in the West Bank and stated he had no interest in visiting Israel. Sfard said banning Finkelstein from entering the country [...] "recalls the behavior of the Soviet bloc countries".|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} dominated {{television and}} newspapers; Ferraro was besieged by {{questions regarding the}} finances as well as criticism for ethnic stereotyping. As she later wrote, [...] "I had created a monster." [...] Republicans saw her finances as a [...] "genderless" [...] issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might {{have to leave the}} ticket. The Philadelphia Inquirer went even further in its investigations, seeking to link Zaccaro to organized crime figures, but most publishers avoided this topic and law enforcement officials did not treat the allegations with much seriousness. A week after her previous statement, Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, which was done on [...] The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant's error. Ferraro said the statements proved overall that she had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, but the disclosures hurt Ferraro's image as a rags-to-riches story.|$|E
2500|$|Essam Fathy, an ICM member, said: [...] "We have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> We do {{not have}} a hidden agenda. We're not {{affiliated}} with anyone. Where is the tolerance?" [...] The mosque's imam, Ossama Bahloul, said that he had told a child that the hatred faced by the center was [...] "just a misunderstanding, miscommunication. I told him to love the people because one day they can love you, too." ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 12, 2006, {{she filed}} as a Republican gubernatorial {{candidate}} {{in the state of}} Nevada, under her birth name Melody Damayo, saying one of her priorities would be anti-stalking legislation. [...] "I have <b>nothing</b> left <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> everybody has seen all of me already", she said. One of her slogans was [...] "I'm bare and honest at all times." [...] Her candidacy came three years after fellow adult film star Mary Carey's campaign for Governor of California in the 2003 recall election. On May 16, 2006, her campaign was endorsed by the liberal blog Wonkette. She was criticized for running for such a position, given her past profession. She faced four other Republican candidates in the primary held on August 15, 2006 and was defeated by a wide margin by Jim Gibbons. After her loss in the primaries, she joined the Libertarian Party.|$|R
6000|$|He met Edith under {{circumstances}} {{that did not}} in any way recall his lost Mary. He met her, as people say, [...] "socially"; Mary, on the other hand, had been a girl at Newnham while he was a fellow of Pembroke, and there had been something of accident and something of furtiveness in their lucky discovery of each other. There had been a flush in it; there was dash in it. But Edith he saw and chose and had to woo. There was no rushing together; there was solicitation and assent. Edith was a Bachelor of Science of London University and several things like that, and she looked upon the universe under her broad forehead and broad-waving brown hair with quiet watchful eyes that had <b>nothing</b> whatever <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> a thing so incredible to Mr. Britling that he had loved and married her very largely for the serenity of her mystery. And for a time after their marriage he sailed over those brown depths plumbing furiously.|$|R

May God relieve us all from this {{difficulty}} if it is his Holy will. Amen." ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the third}} anniversary of Bethany's disappearance, Nelson {{challenged}} Roldan {{to take a}} lie detector test. [...] "I {{would like to hear}} what happened," [...] she told Washington-area news radio station WTOP-FM. [...] "I'd like him to join the polygraph list {{like the rest of us}} did. If you have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> you have nothing to worry about." [...] Geloo in response repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed.|$|E
2500|$|On July 5, 2015, the Twitter {{account of}} the company was {{compromised}} by an unknown individual who published an announcement of a data breach against HackingTeam's computer systems. The initial message read, [...] "Since we have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> we're publishing all our e-mails, files, and source code …" [...] and provided links to over 400 gigabytes of data, including alleged internal e-mails, invoices, and source code; which were leaked via BitTorrent and Mega. [...] An announcement of the data breach, including {{a link to the}} bittorrent seed, was retweeted by WikiLeaks and by many others through social media.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of buzzing in {{with the}} correct questions, contestants either give horribly {{incorrect}} responses or say things {{that have nothing to}} do with the game, frustrating Trebek who does <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> his contempt for the celebrities' performance. Trebek's mood is also exacerbated by Connery's pranks and antics, which include making sexual jokes at Trebek's expense and implying that he has had sexual relations with the host's mother. Connery tends to misread categories and turn them into sexually suggestive phrases (such as [...] "Catch These Men", a category about people on the FBI's Most Wanted list, which he turns into [...] "Catch the Semen"), or even change them altogether by vandalizing or covering up their headers.|$|E
5000|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer {{opined that}} Benji [...] "might well be this {{difficult}} artists most direct work, {{possibly the most}} devastating this career melancholic has ever penned" [...] and noted that Kozelek [...] "has <b>nothing</b> left <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> or lose: the effect is utterly riveting." [...] Ian Cohen, reviewing Benji for Pitchfork, awarded the album a [...] "Best New Music" [...] accolade, described it as [...] "astonishing" [...] before noting that [...] "its actually Kozelek’s least depressing and most life-affirming record: when faced with an album that exposes {{so much of the}} beauty, truth, ugliness, humor, and grace inherent in simply existing in this world, the only response is to go out and live." [...] Juan Edgardo Rodriguez, writing for No Ripcord, felt that Kozelek had produced his [...] "most intimate work yet, thoroughly documenting definitive moments that marked his past and continue to haunt his present" [...] and noted that Kozeleks choice [...] "to approach it with such openness is his greatest gift to us" [...] before giving the album a score of nine out of ten.|$|R
5000|$|... "The use of pen registers, I believe, {{constitutes}} such {{an extensive}} intrusion. To hold otherwise ignores the vital role telephonic communication plays in our {{personal and professional}} relationships, see Katz v. United States, 389 U.S., at 352 , {{as well as the}} First and Fourth Amendment interests implicated by unfettered official surveillance. Privacy in placing calls is of value not only to those engaged in criminal activity. The prospect of unregulated governmental monitoring will undoubtedly prove disturbing even <b>to</b> those with <b>nothing</b> illicit <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> Many individuals, including members of unpopular political organizations or journalists with confidential sources, may legitimately wish to avoid disclosure of their personal contacts. See NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 463 (1958); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 695 (1972); id., at 728-734 (STEWART, J., dissenting). Permitting governmental access to telephone records on less than probable cause may thus impede certain forms of political affiliation and journalistic endeavor that are the hallmark of a truly free society. Particularly given the Government's previous reliance on warrantless telephonic surveillance to trace reporters' sources and monitor protected political activity, I am unwilling to insulate use of pen registers from independent judicial review. U.S. 735, 752" ...|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of 33 chapters, Brown depicts his {{experiences}} {{with each of the}} 23 prostitutes he has visited, giving each at least a chapter of her own. [...] He gives details of their physical features and sexual performances, while obscuring their faces and ethnicities and giving them false names. [...] He [...] "becomes an expert" [...] and goes into the details of the trade, learning how to solicit and tip, and what the abbreviations in johns' reviews at the Toronto escort review board mean. [...] At first he uses the pseudonym [...] "Steve McDougal" [...] in his encounters, but, feeling he has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> soon reverts to using his real name.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1778, rumours began {{spreading}} that Lady Derby {{was having}} an affair with John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, [...] "the most notorious rake of the day." [...] His descendant Victoria Sackville-West later claimed that Sackville would disguise himself as a gardener at the Derby country estate of Knowsley Hall and climb through the Countess' window at night, though another descendant, Robert Sackville-West, 7th Baron Sackville, believes this improbable. By May 1778, rumours of the affair were appearing in the press. That year, Lady Derby's mother – unsuccessfully attempting to put down the rumours and show everyone there was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> – accompanied her daughter to the theatre. By August 1778, the Countess was openly living apart from her husband in the country amidst gossip that she was suing for divorce.|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the trial}} focused on {{material}} evidence, notably bullets, guns, and the cap. Prosecution witnesses testified that Bullet III, the [...]32-caliber bullet that had fatally wounded Berardelli, was from a discontinued Winchester [...]32 Auto cartridge loading so obsolete that the only bullets similar to it that anyone could locate to make comparisons were {{those found in the}} cartridges in Sacco's pockets. Prosecutor Frederick Katzmann decided to participate in a forensic bullet examination using bullets test-fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt Automatic after the defense arranged for such tests. Sacco, saying he had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide,</b> had allowed his gun to be test-fired, with experts for both sides present, during the trial's second week. The prosecution matched bullets fired through the gun to those taken from one of the slain men.|$|E

50|$|On the {{run from}} Robert of Babestoche, the man who will stop at <b>nothing,</b> even murder, <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> his secret, Janna takes refuge at Wiltune Abbey.

Who is the {{newcomer}} asking questions about Janna? Who stabbed the lord Hugh at St Edith's fair? Was the knife meant for Janna, or will Hugh's friendship with the beautiful Emma have disastrous consequences for them all? Who is destroying a precious manuscript and who is leaving lilies at the shrine of St Edith? The civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda has reached a crucial point, and Janna meets the empress when she comes to the abbey, a meeting that will open her eyes to a whole new world and further discoveries about her identity.|$|R

2500|$|The Sarawak {{government}} defended its logging {{policy by}} stating that revenue from timber sales is needed to feed more than 250,000 of the state population. Sarawak chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud said, [...] "It is hoped that outsiders will not interfere in our internal affairs, especially people like Bruno Manser. The Sarawak government has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> Ours is an open liberal society." [...] Sarawak Minister of Housing and Public Health, James Wong said that [...] "We don't want them [...] running around [...] like animals. No one has the ethical right to deprive the Penans {{of the right to}} assimilation into Malaysian society." [...] The Sarawak government tightened the entry of foreign environmentalists, journalists, and film crews into the state. Sarawak government also allowed logging companies to hire criminal gangs to subdue the indigenous people.|$|E
2500|$|On April 18, as Israeli troops began {{pulling out}} of Jenin and Nablus, UN envoy Terje Roed-Larsen entered the camp. He told reporters that the devastation was, [...] "horrific beyond belief," [...] and relayed his view that it was [...] "morally repugnant" [...] that Israel had not allowed {{emergency}} workers into the camp after the battle with Palestinian gunmen had ended. On April 19, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1405 to send a fact-finding mission to Jenin. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, that Israel would welcome a UN official [...] "to clarify the facts", saying [...] "Israel has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> regarding the operation in Jenin. Our hands are clean". Abed Rabbo said the mission was, [...] "the first step toward making Sharon stand trial before an international tribunal".|$|E

The spokesperson of the Egyptian Armed Forces, Colonel Ahmed Ali, later denied the rumors that Morsi was badly treated, saying that they had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>hide.</b> The Egyptian Army later gave Catherine Ashton the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy for the European Union the permission to meet Morsi. Ashton later stated that Morsi is doing well, saying [...] "Morsi was keeping up with the latest developments in the country through television and newspapers.
