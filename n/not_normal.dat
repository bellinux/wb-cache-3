5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
5|$|The {{invisible}} rail {{is thought}} to be monogamous, but little else is known of its courtship behaviour prior to nesting. A report of 4–5 striped chicks was long thought to be incorrect, since such a plumage is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> for rails. In this family, chicks are typically precocial, downy and black, with any ornamentation confined to the head, bare flesh, or specially modified plume feathers.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car. At the office, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sneaks in{{to the women}}'s bathroom and discovers a plush waiting room. The other men soon join him.|$|E
5000|$|The Tychonoff plank is {{a compact}} Hausdorff space and is {{therefore}} a normal space. However, the deleted Tychonoff plank is non-normal.

25|$|F-statistic {{tries to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that all coefficients (except the intercept) are equal to zero. This statistic has F(p–1,n–p) distribution under the null hypothesis and normality assumption, and its p-value indicates probability that the hypothesis is indeed true. Note that when errors are <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> this statistic becomes invalid, and other tests such as Wald test or LR test should be used.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> for {{test results}} {{to give a}} base-by base list of results. Instead, results are {{normally}} compared to the CRS, which is the mitochondria of a European {{who was the first}} person to have their mtDNA published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). Differences between the CRS and testers of European origin are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one's raw results for each base pair.|$|E

5000|$|A {{product of}} <b>normal</b> spaces is <b>not</b> {{necessarily}} <b>normal.</b> This fact was first proved by Robert Sorgenfrey. An {{example of this}} phenomenon is the Sorgenfrey plane. Also, a subset of a <b>normal</b> space need <b>not</b> be <b>normal</b> (i.e. <b>not</b> every <b>normal</b> Hausdorff space is a completely normal Hausdorff space), since every Tychonoff space is a subset of its Stone-Čech compactification (which is normal Hausdorff). A more explicit example is the Tychonoff plank. The only large class of product spaces of normal spaces known to be normal are the products of compact Hausdorff spaces, since both compactness (Tychonoff's theorem) and the [...] axiom are preserved under arbitrary products.|$|R
25|$|Salvinorin A {{is capable}} of {{inhibiting}} excess intestinal motility (e.g. diarrhea), through its potent k-opioid-activating effects. The mechanism of action for salvinorinA on ileal tissue {{has been described as}} 'prejunctional', as it was able to modify electrically induced contractions, but not those of exogenous acetylcholine. A pharmacologically important aspect of the contraction-reducing properties of ingested salvinorinA on gut tissue is that it is only pharmacologically active on inflamed and <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> tissue, thus reducing possible side-effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} commentators do {{not necessarily}} explain mohar this way. Rashi understands mohar {{as a form of}} ketubah, an agreement to pay a certain amount upon divorce, and Nachmanides understands it as sovlanut, a sort of dowry or engagement present. Rashi understands Rachel and Leah's complaint to Jacob ("we are considered strangers to him for he has sold us") as saying that it was <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> for a father to sell his daughters, at least not without also giving them a dowry.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} example, if a null {{hypothesis}} {{is assumed to}} follow the standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is <b>not</b> <b>normal,</b> {{depending on the type}} of test performed. However, supposing we manage to reject the zero mean hypothesis, even if we know the distribution is normal and variance is unity, the null hypothesis test does not tell us which non-zero value we should adopt as the new mean.|$|E

25|$|Bustamante was a well-behaved {{teenager}} who suddenly {{at the age}} of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar {{at the age of}} twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> and spared him from the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Quakes are not {{uncommon}} in the state, so there are monitoring stations in Peñamiller, Extoraz, Peña Blanca and 10 in the Sierra Gorda, including Jalpan de Serra, Landa de Matamoros, Arroyo Seco, Pinal de Amoles and San Joaquín. More are planned for Tolimán and Cadereyta. In January 2011, about 70 small quakes caused some damage in the Peñamiller area, in the north, causing {{a certain amount of}} panic in the area, because the tremblers continued, with an average strength of 3.5 on the Richter magnitude scale. This is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> for this area. The quakes are believed related to mining in the area, but the government denies this.|$|E
25|$|While Einstein's {{result is}} the same as Bradley's {{original}} equation except for an extra factor of , it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, {{in the sense that it}} gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E

25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is <b>not</b> <b>normal.</b> The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E
25|$|Between 1974 and 1985 Persinger {{pursued the}} {{properties}} of brain mast cells and their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. He considered brain function {{to be the result}} of a matrix of anatomical structures. During the 1980s and 1990s he studied the relationships between changes in behavior and multi-focal brain anomalies associated with complex partial and limbic epilepsy and the emergence of sensitivities to stimuli typically not detected. Linda St-Pierre and he showed that the interaction between specific psychotropic drugs and limbic epilepsy in rodents contributed significantly to obesity. Nicolas Rouleau and he demonstrated that fundamental electrophysiological properties of the human brain were still evident in chemically fixed, post-mortem samples when appropriate neurochemicals were added or if the tissues were electrically stimulated. After 2000 he, Blake T. Dotta, Nirosha J. Murugan, and Lukasz M. Karbowski pursued the mechanisms by which temporally complex magnetic fields with specific point durations tuned to proton properties slowed the growth of cancer cells but <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> cells, a continuation of the original research by Carly A. Buckner and Robert M. Lafrenie.|$|E
