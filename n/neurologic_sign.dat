40|$|Abstract. Hypernatremia {{resulting}} in neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma, and with un-derlying lesions of cerebral hemorrhage and thrombosis, {{has been reported}} in human beings. Herein we report two cases of cerebral infarction with venous thrombosis in cynomolgus monkeys. Both animals were severely hypernatremic because of water deprivation, with serum sodium levels of 185 and 193 meq/liter, respectively. At necropsy, there were bilateral multiple hemorrhagic and malacic areas visible {{on the surface of the}} cerebrum and extending into the parenchyma, primarily involving the occipital lobes. These lesions were interpreted microscopically as infarcts because, in addition to hemorrhage and necrosis, multiple thrombi were present in small and medium-sized veins of gray matter and meninges. The pathogenesis of hypernatremia-induced cerebral lesions is believed to involve cellular dehydration that caused shrinkage of the brain. Because the vasculature of the brain is tightly adherent to the skull, this shrinkage results in tearing of blood vessels, with consequent hemorrhage and thrombosis.

40|$|Cerebral malaria is {{the most}} severe {{neurologic}} complication in {{children and young adults}} infected with Plasmodium falciparum. T-cell activation is required for development of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) –induced experimental cerebral malaria (CM). To characterize the T-cell activation pathway involved, the role of protein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ) in experimental CM development was examined. PKC-θ–deficient mice are resistant to CM development. In the absence of PKC-θ, no <b>neurologic</b> <b>sign</b> of CM developed after blood stage PbA infection. Resistance of PKC-θ–deficient mice correlated with unaltered cerebral microcirculation and absence of ischemia, as documented by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography, whereas wild-type mice developed distinct microvascular pathology. Recruitment and activation of CD 8 + T cells, and ICAM- 1 and CD 69 expression were reduced in the brain of resistant mice; however, the pulmonary inflammation and edema associated with PbA infection were still present in the absence of functional PKC-θ. Resistant PKC-θ–deficient mice developed high parasitemia, and died at 3 weeks with severe anemia. Therefore, PKC-θ signaling is crucial for recruitment of CD 8 + T cells and development of brain microvascular pathology resulting in fatal experimental CM, and may represent a novel therapeutic target of CM...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the clinical manifestations, genetic mutations, treatment responses to L-dopa, and long-term neurologic outcomes in Taiwanese infants with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. From 1999 to May 2011, we enrolled six infants {{who had been}} diagnosed with tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency by identifying point mutations on the tyrosine hydroxylase gene. Two patients manifested fetal distress during the perinatal period. Four patients exhibited generalized tremor as their first observed <b>neurologic</b> <b>sign</b> at age 3 months. All presented brisk reflexes, hypokinesia, rigidity, distal chorea, and athetosis. We identified a novel missense mutation, 13821, and report on the first patient, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, with a homozygous R 153 X nonsense mutation. Five of six patients responded to L-dopa at a dose of 4. 2 - 34. 7 mg/kg/day combined with biperiden or selegiline or both. Long-term neurologic outcomes (median follow-up, 5 years and 10. 5 months) revealed two patients demonstrated slightly low intelligence quotients, three demonstrated mild to moderate psychomotor retardation, and one died of respiratory failure. A higher dose of L-dopa, together with alternative therapies, may lead to improvements in motor function. However, several years of observation may be needed to reach definitive conclusions about neurologic outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this study the role of brain- CT scan without contrast was evaluated for neonates with seizures. This was a cross-section descriptive study on 80 neonates with seizure admitted in NICU of Ekbatan hospital Hamadan during 2002 - 2003. The brain Ct-scan without contrast was done for all of them, the radiologic reports were recorded on special forms, and evaluated with statistically methods. 65 % of neonates had abnormal CT : Intracranial hemorrhage in 19 cases (23. 7 %), Local ischemic lesions in 18 cases (22. 5 %), Hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy in 15 cases (18. 7 %), Brain dysgenesis in 8 cases (10 %) and combined forms in 18 cases (22. 5 %). In this study abnormal CT scan findings were noticeable, most of the seizure occurred at 24 - 72 hrs after birth and association with difficult labor was statistically meaningful (P< 0. 05). Because the difficult delivery and hypoxia are participating factors of neonatal seizures, perhaps the proper or inappropriate delivery and perinatal intervention is a factor for interpretation of findings of this study...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA Th 1 {{response}} {{is required for}} the development of Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) -induced experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). The role of pro-Th 1 IL- 12 in malaria is complex and controversial. In this study, we addressed the role of IL- 12 Rβ 2 in ECM development. C 57 BL/ 6 mice deficient for IL- 12 Rβ 2, IL- 12 p 40, or IL- 12 p 35 were analyzed for ECM development after blood-stage PbA infection in terms of ischemia and blood flow by noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, T cell recruitment, and gene expression. Without IL- 12 Rβ 2, no <b>neurologic</b> <b>sign</b> of ECM developed upon PbA infection. Although wild-type mice developed distinct brain microvascular pathology, ECM-resistant, IL- 12 Rβ 2 -deficient mice showed unaltered cerebral microcirculation and the absence of ischemia after PbA infection. In contrast, mice deficient for IL- 12 p 40 or IL- 12 p 35 were sensitive to ECM development. The resistance of IL- 12 Rβ 2 -deficient mice to ECM correlated with reduced recruitment of activated T cells and impaired overexpression of lymphotoxin-α, TNF-α, and IFN-γ in the brain after PbA infection. Therefore, IL- 12 Rβ 2 signaling is essential for ECM development but independent from IL- 12 p 40 and IL- 12 p 35. We document a novel link between IL- 12 Rβ 2 and lymphotoxin-α, TNF-α, and IFN-γ expression, key cytokines for ECM pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Pituitary macroadenoma/macroadenocarcinoma (PMA; tumor size {{greater than}} or equal to 1 cm in diameter) was {{diagnosed}} in 13 dogs after 0. 5 to 24 months of mitotane treatment for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH). The diagnosis of PDH was established on the basis of results of common tests of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis in conjunction with results of x-ray computed tomography or necropsy. Initial clinical findings and clinicopathologic test results were typical of PDH. Signs referable to the CNS developed in 7 of the 13 dogs. The most common <b>neurologic</b> <b>sign</b> was stupor. Pituitary macroadenoma/macroadenocarcinoma was an unexpected finding in the other 6 dogs, because none had clinical signs of disease referable to the CNS at the time that pituitary tumor was documented. In the 13 dogs, strong correlation existed between tumor volume, compression/invasion of the surrounding nervous tissue, and development of neurologic signs, ie, neurologic signs were most frequently associated with larger tumors. The size of the tumor, however, was not always an indication of whether neurologic signs would be observed. All 7 dogs with neurologic signs were euthanatized because of the deleterious effects of the PMA. Of the 6 dogs without neurologic signs, 2 died of unrelated cause. Alternative treatment (ie, hypophysectomy, 60 Co-teletherapy) was used successfully in 2 other dogs. Alternative treatment would seem indicated if PMA is documented in a dog with PDH. However, identification of PMA is dependent on evaluation of x-ray computed tomographic images. Signalment, history, physical examination, and alterations in routine clinicopathologic findings in these 13 dogs of our study were similar to previously reported findings in dogs with PDH but apparently without large pituitary tumors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{present a}} case of sudden {{bilateral}} profound deafness and vertigo, without any accompanying <b>neurologic</b> <b>signs,</b> secondary to bilateral infarctions of the cochlear and vestibular nuclei. METHODS: Vertigo, vomiting, tinnitus, and bilateral profound deafness suddenly developed in a 65 -year-old woman without any accompanying <b>neurologic</b> <b>signs.</b> In particular, she did not present dysarthria, numbness, cranial nerve palsies, or visual or cerebellar signs. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed 2 fresh infarctions of 8 to 10 mm symmetrically localized in the posterolateral bulbopontine junction. Angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the basilar artery, with a well-represented backward flow of its distal portion from the carotid artery via posterior communicating arteries. Excluding a transient ischemic attack that occurred 16 days after the acute episode, the patient had had no other neurologic events at 8 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Acute vertigo and sudden deafness in a patient with known cerebrovascular occlusive disease may represent the warning signs of an impending brain stem or cerebellar infarction, even when other <b>neurologic</b> <b>signs</b> are absent.
