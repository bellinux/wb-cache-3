5|$|The early Buddhist texts {{describe}} meditative {{practices and}} states, {{some of which}} the Buddha borrowed from the śramaṇa tradition. The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate {{for the purposes of}} controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, {{there is no mention of}} the tongue being inserted into the <b>nasopharynx</b> as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to even modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the <b>nasopharynx,</b> via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear {{and the inner}} ear. It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the <b>nasopharynx</b> via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
25|$|The base of {{the skull}} may be {{affected}} by metastases from cancer of the bronchus, breast or prostate, or cancer may spread directly to this area from the <b>nasopharynx</b> (fig. 2), and this may cause headache, facial paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain, or cranial nerve dysfunction– the exact symptoms depend on the cranial nerves impacted.|$|E
25|$|A nasobuccal {{membrane}} {{separates the}} mouth from the nose; respectively, the inferior oral cavity (the mouth) and the superior nasal cavity (the nose). As the olfactory pits deepen, said development forms the choanae, the two openings that connect {{the nasal cavity}} and the <b>nasopharynx</b> (upper part of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). Initially, primitive-form choanae develop, which then further develop into the secondary, permanent choanae.|$|E
25|$|Because MTs play an {{important}} role in transcription factor regulation, defects in MT function or expression may lead to malignant transformation of cells and ultimately cancer. Studies have found increased expression of MTs in some cancers of the breast, colon, kidney, liver, skin (melanoma), lung, <b>nasopharynx,</b> ovary, prostate, mouth, salivary gland, testes, thyroid and urinary bladder; they have also found lower levels of MT expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and liver adenocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} caused by rubella virus, a {{togavirus}} that is enveloped and has a single-stranded RNA genome. The virus is transmitted by the respiratory route and replicates in the <b>nasopharynx</b> and lymph nodes. The virus {{is found in the}} blood 5 to 7 days after infection and spreads throughout the body. The virus has teratogenic properties and is capable of crossing the placenta and infecting the fetus where it stops cells from developing or destroys them. During this incubation period, the patient is contagious typically for about one week before he/she develops a rash and for about one week thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is often}} performed for mechanical ventilation of hours to weeks duration. A tube is inserted {{through the nose}} (nasotracheal intubation) or mouth (orotracheal intubation) and advanced into the trachea. In most cases, tubes with inflatable cuffs are used for protection against leakage and aspiration. Intubation with a cuffed tube is thought {{to provide the best}} protection against aspiration. Tracheal tubes inevitably cause pain and coughing. Therefore, unless a patient is unconscious or anaesthetized for other reasons, sedative drugs are usually given to provide tolerance of the tube. Other disadvantages of tracheal intubation include damage to the mucosal lining of the <b>nasopharynx</b> or oropharynx and subglottic stenosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{the upper}} {{portion of the}} nose, the paired nasal bones attach to the frontal bone. Above and to the side (superolaterally), the paired nasal bones connect to the {{lacrimal}} bones, and below and to the side (inferolaterally), they attach to the ascending processes of the maxilla (upper jaw). Above and to the back (posterosuperiorly), the bony nasal septum is composed of the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone. The vomer bone lies below and to the back (posteroinferiorly), and partially forms the choanal opening into the <b>nasopharynx,</b> (the upper portion of the pharynx that is continuous with the nasal passages). The floor of the nose comprises the premaxilla bone and the palatine bone, {{the roof of the}} mouth.|$|E
25|$|It is {{most common}} that mucous {{membrane}} lesions {{of the oral}} cavity are presented first. They can involve the oropharynx, <b>nasopharynx,</b> tongue, and vermilion (red portion) of the lips. They are also known to develop in the conjunctiva of the eye, anogenital (perineum) region, and esophagus. Cutaneous lesions tend to follow the onset of mucosal lesions. The blisters often erupt in waves, usually affecting the upper trunk, head, neck, and proximal extremities. Pemphigoid-like lesions are seen more often on the extremities. Lichenoid lesions are more common among children, presenting on the trunk and limbs, ranging from small red scaly papules to extensive violet to brown papules extending to the face and neck. Within the spectrum of lichenoid presentations are wounds that have features of erythema multiforme and graft-vs.-host disease. Scaly lesions on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet have been noted {{to coincide with the}} lichenoid lesions. Lesions of varying morphology may present simultaneously and transform from one type to another as the disease progresses.|$|E
25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and <b>nasopharynx.</b> The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a mirror on the inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E
2500|$|N. meningitidis {{is a part}} of {{the normal}} [...] flora in the <b>nasopharynx</b> of up to 5–15% of adults. It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been {{isolated}} from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron sources other than human transferrin and lactoferrin.|$|E
2500|$|Epistaxis, or nosebleed, is {{a special}} case, where almost all first aid {{providers}} train the use of pressure points. [...] The appropriate point here is on the soft fleshy part of the nose, which should constrict the capillaries sufficiently to stop bleeding, although obviously it does not stop bleeding from the <b>nasopharynx</b> or tear ducts.|$|E
2500|$|Nasopharyngeal cancer {{arises in}} the <b>nasopharynx,</b> {{the region in}} which the nasal {{cavities}} and the Eustachian tubes connect with {{the upper part of}} the throat. While some nasopharyngeal cancers are biologically similar to the common HNSCC, [...] "poorly differentiated" [...] nasopharyngeal carcinoma is lymphoepithelioma, which is distinct in its epidemiology, biology, clinical behavior, and treatment, and is treated as a separate disease by many experts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surgical}} treatment for velopalatal insufficiency may cause {{obstructive sleep apnea}} syndrome. When velopalatal insufficiency is present, air leaks into the <b>nasopharynx</b> even when the soft palate should close off the nose. A simple test for this condition {{can be made by}} placing a tiny mirror on the nose, and asking the subject to say [...] "P". This p sound, a plosive, is normally produced with the nasal airway closes off - all air comes out of the pursed lips, none from the nose. If it is impossible to say the sound without fogging a nasal mirror, there is an air leak - reasonable evidence of poor palatal closure. Speech is often unclear due to inability to pronounce certain sounds. One of the {{surgical treatment}}s for velopalatal insufficiency involves tailoring the tissue {{from the back of the}} throat and using it to purposefully cause partial obstruction of the opening of the <b>nasopharynx.</b> This may actually cause OSA syndrome in susceptible individuals, particularly in the days following surgery, when swelling occurs (see below: Special Situation: Anesthesia and Surgery).|$|E
2500|$|Down {{syndrome}} {{is one such}} syndrome. In this chromosomal abnormality, several features combine to make the presence of obstructive sleep apnea more likely. The specific features of Down syndrome that predispose to obstructive sleep apnea include relatively low muscle tone, narrow <b>nasopharynx,</b> and large tongue. Obesity and enlarged tonsils and adenoids, conditions that occur commonly in the western population, {{are much more likely}} to be obstructive in a person with these features than without them. [...] Obstructive sleep apnea does occur even more frequently in people with Down syndrome than in the general population. A little over 50% of all people with Down syndrome suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, and some physicians advocate routine testing of this group.|$|E
2500|$|Neisseria meningitidis, often {{referred}} to as meningococcus, is a Gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their <b>nasopharynx.</b> As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic [...] and endemic form.|$|E
2500|$|Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a {{component}} of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells. Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae [...] mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the <b>nasopharynx.</b> [...] It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc. Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system.|$|E
2500|$|The oropharynx, at {{the back}} of the mouth, forms a circle and {{includes}} the base of the tongue (posterior third) below, the tonsils on each side, and the soft palate above, together with the walls of the pharynx, including the [...] anterior epiglottis, epiglottic valleculae and branchial cleft at its base. [...] The oropharynx is one of three divisions of the interior of the pharynx based on their relation to adjacent structures (nasal pharynx (<b>nasopharynx),</b> oral pharynx (oropharynx) and laryngeal pharynx (laryngopharynx - also referred to as the hypopharynx), from top to bottom). The pharynx is a semicircular fibromuscular tube joining the nasal cavities above to the larynx (voice box) and oesophagus (gullet), below, where the larynx is situated in front of the oesophagus.|$|E

2500|$|A study {{performed}} between 2010 and 2013, {{in which}} the incidence of MERS was evaluated in 310 dromedary camels, revealed high titers of neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV in the blood serum of these animals.
