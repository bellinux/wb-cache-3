25|$|This {{may result}} from another common {{misunderstanding}} that the voltage is generated at the junction. In fact, the junctions should in principle have uniform internal temperature, therefore <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> is generated at the junction. The voltage is generated in the thermal gradient, along the wire.|$|E
25|$|The coil-rotation {{transformer}} used a fixed-position electromagnet coil {{in conjunction}} with a variable-position coil to vary the voltage in the line by varying the alignment of the two coils. Rotated 90 degrees apart, the secondary coil is affected by two equal but opposite fields from the primary, which effectively cancel each other out and produce <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> in the secondary.|$|E

25|$|When the anode is at a {{positive}} potential VAK {{with respect to}} the cathode with <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if VAK is increased beyond the breakdown voltage VBO of the thyristor, avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).|$|E
25|$|Twisted nematic {{displays}} contain liquid crystals that {{twist and}} untwist at varying degrees to allow light to pass through. When <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is applied to}} a TN liquid crystal cell, polarized light passes through the 90-degrees twisted LC layer. In proportion to the voltage applied, the liquid crystals untwist changing the polarization and blocking the light's path. By properly adjusting {{the level of the}} voltage almost any gray level or transmission can be achieved.|$|E
25|$|Vertical-alignment {{displays}} are {{a form of}} LCDs {{in which}} the liquid crystals naturally align vertically to the glass substrates. When <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied, the liquid crystals remain perpendicular to the substrate, creating a black display between crossed polarizers. When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals shift to a tilted position, allowing light to pass through and create a gray-scale display depending {{on the amount of}} tilt generated by the electric field. It has a deeper-black background, a higher contrast ratio, a wider viewing angle, and better image quality at extreme temperatures than traditional twisted-nematic displays.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{time-frame}} of {{the capacitance}} change (as much as 50ms at 20Hz audio signal), {{the charge is}} practically constant and the voltage across the capacitor changes instantaneously to reflect the change in capacitance. The voltage across the capacitor varies {{above and below the}} bias voltage. The voltage difference between the bias and the capacitor is seen across the series resistor. The voltage across the resistor is amplified for performance or recording. In most cases, the electronics in the microphone itself contribute <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> gain as the voltage differential is quite significant, up to several volts for high sound levels. Since this is a very high impedance circuit, only current gain is usually needed, with the voltage remaining constant.|$|E
25|$|Electro-wetting display (EWD) {{is based}} on {{controlling}} {{the shape of a}} confined water/oil interface by an applied voltage. With <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> applied, the (colored) oil forms a flat film between the water and a hydrophobic (water-repellent) insulating coating of an electrode, resulting in a colored pixel. When a voltage is applied between the electrode and the water, the interfacial tension between the water and the coating changes. As a result, the stacked state is no longer stable, causing the water to move the oil aside. This makes a partly transparent pixel, or, if a reflective white surface is under the switchable element, a white pixel. Because of the small pixel size, the user only experiences the average reflection, which provides a high-brightness, high-contrast switchable element.|$|E
25|$|The {{optical effect}} of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E

25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back reflective layer, in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With <b>no</b> <b>voltage,</b> however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E
2500|$|While the NMDAR channel itself {{displays}} {{little or}} <b>no</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence (its open channel I/V curve {{is more or}} less linear), the voltage dependence of the magnesium block effectively, if indirectly, confers voltage dependence to this channel. [...] Thus, in effect, the NMDAR channel is both a ligand-gated and voltage-gated channel at the same time. This fact is critical to the function of the NMDAR as a Hebbian coincidence detector. More strictly speaking, inward cationic current (sodium or calcium) through the open unblocked NMDAR does decrease with depolarization (because of the decreased electrochemical [...] "driving force"), but the voltage-dependent unblocking seems to outweigh this decrease in driving force, so the calcium influx into the spine caused by a pair of appropriately timed pre- and postsynaptic spikes significantly exceeds the sum of the influxes due to the individual spikes alone. This extra, or [...] "nonlinear", calcium entry triggers the strength change.|$|E

40|$|A new {{excitation}} technique {{based on}} the rectification of the oscillatory motion was used in surface micromachined 2 - 5 µm-thick LPCVD polysilicon micromotors with large torques. The 160 µm- 1600 µm diameter rotors consisted of a pivoted circular disk with perimeter cantilevers that bend and generate a twisting force upon actuation by a vibrating stator. The vibrations can be generated and harvested by and from many different sources. Here comb drives were used for feasibility studies. In comparison to electrostatic side-drive micromotors, the torques were larger and the maximum torque of up to 46 nanoN-m was observed and measured. The micromotors generated these large torques with relatively thin (< 5 µm) rotors, they are fully compatible with IC processing, they can be scaled over a large range of diameters while requiring nearly constant excitation voltages, and there are <b>no</b> <b>voltages</b> applied directly to their rotors...|$|R
