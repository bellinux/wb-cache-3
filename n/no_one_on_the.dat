5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground {{is known to have}} witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm. Rough seas caused {{the hull of}} the ship to break and the vessel was separated into two pieces. Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E

5|$|United Airlines Flight 93 was a {{domestic}} scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by four Al-Qaeda terrorists on board, {{as part of}} the September 11 attacks. It crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people aboard were killed, including the four hijackers, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground was injured. The aircraft involved, a Boeing 757–222, was flying United Airlines' daily scheduled morning flight from Newark International Airport in New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport in California.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, in {{response}} to a fall in profits, there were calls from some Partners for the business to be floated on the stockmarket. If this had gone through, each Partner would have received a windfall averaging £100,000. In the end, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Partnership Council agreed with the idea and only one member spoke in favour of a referendum on the issue.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September 1999, a Cessna 404 {{carrying}} nine Airtours {{staff from}} Glasgow to Aberdeen on a transfer flight, crashed minutes after take off {{near the town}} of Linwood, Renfrewshire. Eight people were killed and three seriously injured. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground was hurt. A fatal accident inquiry into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.|$|E
25|$|Wessely {{influenced}} {{his contemporaries}} in various directions. As a scholar he contributed, by his profound philological researches, to {{the reconstruction of}} the language of the Bible, though his work is marred by prolixity and by his refusal to admit shades of meaning in synonyms. As a poet he possessed perfection of style, but lacked feeling and artistic imagination. No one exerted a greater influence than he on the dissemination of modern Hebrew, and <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, did more to retard the development of pure art and of poetic intuition. Because of his energetic commitment to the cause of Jewish emancipation, Wessely may be regarded as a leader of the Maskilim.|$|E

25|$|The {{weather is}} {{reported}} every half-hour during the program's first three hours, though since Al Roker {{took over as}} weather reporter, an interview is conducted by him {{in place of the}} national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations. Today weather reporters have included Bob Ryan (1978–1980); Willard Scott (1980–1996); and Al Roker (1996–present). Until Ryan's hiring, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. Since NBC's purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in Today forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from the cable channel's suburban Atlanta headquarters, or as a fill-in for Roker.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} wrapped on October 27, 1986, both on-time and on-budget. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team, however, {{liked the}} rough cut {{that was put}} together, and Vestron executives were convinced the film {{was going to be}} a flop. Thirty-nine percent of people who viewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot. In May 1987, the film was screened for producer Aaron Russo. According to Vestron executive Mitchell Cannold, Russo's reaction at the end was to say simply, [...] "Burn the negative, and collect the insurance." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Speer's {{accession}} to the office, the German economy, unlike the British one, was not fully geared for war production. Consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime. No fewer than five [...] "Supreme Authorities" [...] had jurisdiction over armament production—one of which, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production. Few women were employed in the factories, which were running only one shift. One evening soon after his appointment, Speer went to visit a Berlin armament factory; he found <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> premises.|$|E

Instead of answering, Desmond gets up to leave, but after Charlie calls him a [...] "coward", a drunken Desmond tackles and chokes Charlie, shouting that Charlie does not know what he has been through.|$|E
500|$|The actor Josh Fadem {{played an}} inexperienced agent that Liz signs {{with in the}} episode.

500|$|The B-52 {{then began}} the 360° left {{turn around the}} tower {{starting}} from about the midfield point of the runway. Located just behind the tower was an area of restricted airspace, reportedly because of a nuclear weapons storage facility. Apparently to avoid flying through the restricted airspace, Holland flew the aircraft in an extremely tight, steeply banked turn while maintaining the low, 250-foot (75m) AGL altitude. Approximately three-quarters of {{the way around the}} turn, at 14:16, the aircraft banked past 90°, descended rapidly, clipped power lines and hit the ground, exploding and killing the four crew members. McGeehan was seated in an ejection seat, but according to the medical statement, he had only [...] "partially ejected at the time of impact"; it does not state whether or not he cleared the aircraft. Huston was also seated in an ejection seat and the medical statement indicated that he had not initiated the ejection sequence. Wolff's seat was not ejection-capable. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground was injured.|$|E
500|$|Writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a biopic of Ed Wood when they were students at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Alexander even proposed making a documentary about Wood, The Man in the Angora Sweater in his sophomore year at USC. However, Karaszewski figured, [...] "there would be <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> planet Earth who would make this movie or want to make this movie, because these aren't the sort of movies that are made." [...] Irritated at being thought of solely as writers for family films for their work on Problem Child and Problem Child 2, Alexander and Karaszewski wrote a 10-page film treatment for Ed Wood and pitched the idea to Heathers director Michael Lehmann, with whom they attended USC film school. The basis for their treatment came from Rudolph Grey's Nightmare of Ecstasy, a full-length biography, which draws on interviews from Wood's family and colleagues. Lehmann presented their treatment to his producer on Heathers, Denise Di Novi. Di Novi had previously worked with Tim Burton on Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns and The Nightmare Before Christmas, and a deal was struck with Lehmann as director and Burton and Di Novi producing.|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. [...] "Even though there's a part of me that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, [...] " [...] she says, [...] "I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on." ...|$|E
