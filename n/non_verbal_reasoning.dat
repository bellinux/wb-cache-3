40|$|Background: Association between {{parenting}} {{dimensions and}} externalizing behaviors in children was examined. Method: Data on {{children from the}} middle class families of Patiala (N= 240) were collected from schools and families. Parents completed questionnaires on parenting dimensions and externalizing behaviors of children. Results: Analysis of variance of externalizing behaviors indicated significant mean differences for gender and age on aggression and conduct disorders. Analysis of variance for parenting variables indicated significant differences for age and gender on indulgence, punitive, physical coercion, and verbal hostility parenting dimensions. Correlations between <b>non</b> <b>reasoning,</b> <b>verbal</b> hostility, physical coercion, autonomy and indulgence parenting dimensions and externalizing behaviors were significantly positive whereas regulation and connection parenting dimensions showed a significant negative correlation with externalizing behaviors. Multiple regression analysis of parenting dimensions to each externalizing behaviors showed that autonomy, non reasoning and indulgence parenting dimensions predicted externalizing behaviors.

Indeed, leadership actors are communicating with their co-workers, their boss, their employees, the media, and so forth. However, {{in the course of}} this paper and because of its importance, the focus on <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> communication will be adopted.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{validate}} a new instrument aimed to assess emotion regulation: the Emotion Regulation Profile-Revised (ERP-R). Exploratory factor analyses yielded two theoretically meaningful factors: down-regulation of negative emotions and up-regulation of positive emotions. Internal reliability scores of the two factors were good. Findings showed evidence of convergent/discriminant validity, with ERP-R scores being independent of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> and verbal skills while positively related to emotional intelligence and to relevant personality dimensions. There was also preliminary evidence of criterion validity. ERP-R scores also demonstrated incremental validity to predict a number of criteria over and above emotional intelligence and emotional stability. Overall, the results show a clear 2 factors solution for the ERP-R and high correlations with convergent and divergent scales as well as good criterion and incremental validities. </span...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: <b>Verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> {{performance}} is {{an indicator of}} the ability to think constructively in everyday life and relies on both crystallized and fluid intelligence. This study aimed to determine the effect of functional hearing on <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> when controlling for age, gender, and education. In addition, the study investigated whether hearing aid usage mitigated the effect and examined different routes from hearing to <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Design: Cross-sectional data on 40 - to 70 -year-old community-dwelling participants from the UK Biobank resource were accessed. Data consisted of behavioral and subjective measures of functional hearing, assessments of numerical and linguistic <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning,</b> measures of executive function, and demographic and lifestyle information. Data on 119, 093 participants who had completed hearing and <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> tests were submitted to multiple regression analyses, and data on 61, 688 of these participants, who had completed additional cognitive tests and provided relevant lifestyle information, were submitted to structural equation modeling. Results: Poorer performance on the behavioral measure of functional hearing was significantly associated with poorer <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> in both the numerical and linguistic domains (p < 0. 001). There was no association between the subjective measure of functional hearing and <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Functional hearing significantly interacted with education (p < 0. 002), showing a trend for functional hearing to have a greater impact on <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> among those with a higher level of formal education. Among those with poor hearing, hearing aid usage had a significant positive, but not necessarily causal, effect on both numerical and linguistic <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> (p < 0. 005). The estimated effect of hearing aid usage was less than the effect of poor functional hearing. Structural equation modeling analyses confirmed that controlling for education reduced the effect of functional hearing on <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> and showed that controlling for executive function eliminated the effect. However, when computer usage was controlled for, the eliminating effect of executive function was weakened. Conclusions: Poor functional hearing was associated with poor <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> in a 40 - to 70 -year-old community-dwelling population after controlling for age, gender, and education. The effect of functional hearing on <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> was significantly reduced among hearing aid users and completely overcome by good executive function skills, which may be enhanced by playing computer games. 11 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive {{dysfunction}} {{occurs in}} more than half of stroke survivors and can have farreaching consequences for functioning in daily life. At present, there are no well established assessments to evaluate the cognitive functioning of individuals with poststroke aphasia. Most assessments currently used in clinical practice have limitations such as dependence on language, need of specialist knowledge, low sensitivity and or specificity and lengthy administration time. Therefore a working party of Speech and Language Therapists, Clinical Neuropsychologists and Occupational Therapists in Lothian, Scotland devised a set of cognitive test materials named the Lothian Assessment for Screening of Cognition in Aphasia (LASCA) in an attempt to assess cognition in aphasic patients post stroke. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the LASCA as a non verbal assessment of cognition by comparing it to the widely used ACE-R. A battery of tests (Spot the word, LASCA, ACE-R, Brixton spatial anticipation test and the BUTT <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>reasoning</b> test) was administered to 35 control participants (age range = 56 - 92 years, mean = 68. 77 years SD= 7. 492) recruited from across Lothian. Moderate correlations were found between the visual functioning subtests between the ACE-R and the LASCA (rho (33) =. 351; p <. 05) and total performance scores on ACE-R and the LASCA (rho (33) =. 614, p< 0. 01). A moderate correlation was also found to exist between the Brixton test and the LASCA executive functioning subtest (rho (33) =. 389, p <. 05). These findings suggest that there is adequate convergent validity between the LASCA and the widely used ACE-R thus concluding that the LASCA may be considered an appropriate non verbal assessment for screening cognition in post stroke aphasic patients...|$|E

50|$|<b>Non</b> <b>verbal</b> {{behavior}} or <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> communication {{is a series}} of wordless behavior that are projected by the speaker to the listener. Common examples of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> behavior include eye contact, smile, facial expression, distance between speaker and listener and any other wordless behavior that can communicate information between people. According to Virginia P. Richmond on 'Teacher Nonverbal Immediacy', teachers that show more positive nonverbal behavior increase the immediacy between students and also contribute to higher student rating. For instance, teachers with higher rating by student were more likely to express <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> behavior like smiling, walking around, head nodding and touching upper torsos whereas low rating teachers are more likely to touch their head, head shaking rather than nodding, and sitting on a chair. One study by Ambady and Rosenthal shows that subjects were able to form accurate judgement of impression by just watching short video clips of teachers providing <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> behavior. An example from the study, participants were able to form accurate impression of the teachers by just watching 10's, 5's, and 2's length of short clips about teachers walking to classroom.
