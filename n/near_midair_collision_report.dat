" If a pilot of flight crew member subjectively believes that the near miss occurred, the report of that event is accepted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and counts as a near miss in the FAA data base regardless of the actual separation distance. While no proximity limits are placed on near midair collision reports, the agency does attempt to categorize each reported encounter by degree of hazard represented from an aviation safety perspective...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{threat of}} midair {{collisions}} {{is one of}} the most serious problems facing the air traffic control system and has been studied by many researchers. The gas model {{is one of the}} models which describe the expected frequency of midair collisions. In this paper, the gas model which has been used, so far, to deal only with simple cases is extended to a generalized form, and some special types of collision models, such as the overtaking model, are deduced from this generalized model. The effects of the probability distributions of aircraft direction and altitude on the frequency of collisions are also analyzed. The results in this paper can be applied to evaluate the frequency of conflicts as well as that of collisions. In this paper, an aircraft is represented as a circular cylinder, and a collision is described as an overlap of two cylinders. If the size of the cylinder is expanded to the volume of the protected airspace of an aircraft, an overlap of two cylinders means a conflict. Therefore, with a slight modification, the results can be used to analyze the frequency of conflicts. This flexibility gives the models of this paper an important potential for application to a future air traffic control system. The FAA is currently developing a new type of air traffic control system called AERA (automated en route air traffic control). AERA is expected to reduce the workload of human controllers and expand the capacity of airspace using new computer systems and better communication links. When this system is fully implemented, aircraft will be able to fly under fewer restrictions. However, if many aircraft are flying on random routes, the frequency of potential conflicts the computer system should handle becomes high. Therefore, the frequency of potential conflicts under various circumstances should be calculated in order to estimate the computer workload before full implementation of the system. The models developed in this paper may be helpful in this evaluation. The consequences of actual collisions are, of course, grave. Fortunately, the average number of such collisions per year has remained relatively small. According to an FAA Report (Report of the FAA Task Force on Aircraft Separation Assurance, Jan. 1979), the average number of midair collisions reported to NTSB from 1974 through 1978 was 33 per year. Most midair collisions have occurred between small general aviation aircraft operating under VFR. However, the report also states that there were 227 near midair collision reports in 1975 alone, and that air carriers were involved in 68 of these cases. (According to the report, a near midair collision is an incident which would probably have resulted in a collision if no action had been taken by either pilot. Closest proximity of less than 500 ft would usually be required for a <b>near</b> <b>midair</b> <b>collision</b> <b>report.)</b> Although the number of conflicts is not available in the report, it is clearly far greater than the number of near midair collisions considering the difference of airspace volumes involved. The outline of this thesis is as follows. In Chapter 2, we present an overview of two aircraft collision models, the Reich model and the gas model, which have been the most important ones in this field. In Chapter 3, we develop some extensions of the gas model including a generalized two-dimensional gas model, an overtaking model and a three dimensional gas model. In Chapter 4, we develop an aircraft collision model which does not assume the uniformity of aircraft distribution. The conclusions of this thesis are summarized in Chapter 5. Also issued as an M. S. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 1982 May 1982 Includes bibliographical references (leaves 86 - 87...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{predicts the}} risk of <b>near</b> <b>midair</b> <b>collisions</b> between {{airborne}} aircraft {{as a function of}} the type of controlled terminal airspace in which they occur, aircraft velocities, the geometries of approach patterns, and the number of flight operations which arise, end in or traverse these areas. Based on an analysis of <b>near</b> <b>midair</b> <b>collision</b> risk, the paper concludes that air carrier operations by themselves are safer than general aviation operations by themselves in radar-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area, but that general aviation operations by themselves are safer in less-controlled than in more-controlled airspace. By far the most risky flight appears to be general aviation aircraft interacting with other general aviation aircraft in positively-controlled environments such as a Terminal Control Area. We offer a model which describes the factors that influence <b>near</b> <b>midair</b> <b>collisions</b> and some reasons for a possible explanation of these surprising results. ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIn recent years, {{a number of}} <b>near</b> <b>midair</b> <b>collisions</b> has {{shed light on the}} increased likelihood of mishaps that are partly attributable to traffic density. In air traffic control operations, situational awareness of a local controller at an airfield such as Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, California, is critical to prevention of catastrophic <b>midair</b> <b>collisions.</b> Spatialized audio technology has the potential to reduce or eliminate temporary losses of situational awareness. Spatialized audio technology allows auditory icons to be presented at perceptual locations external to the head at a complete range of elevation and azimuth locations relative to the listener. This thesis investigates the use of these spatialized auditory icons to determine if they could be effectively implemented in air traffic control type tasks to benefit local controllers. The research was conducted in the Advanced Auditory Displays Laboratory at NPS. A scenario to exemplify typical airfield operations at Camp Pendleton was written using javabased computer code. A virtual tower environment was created with a head mounted video display, inertial head tracker, and a spatialized audio server. Results indicated that subjects of the experiment responded more rapidly and accurately using spatialized audio. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

Multiple external sources (for example, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Flight Safety Foundation, the National Research Council, and the Joint Planning and Development Office) were used to develop a compilation of future safety issues risks, also referred to as future tall poles. The primary criterion used to identify the most critical future safety risk issues was that the issue must be cited in several of these sources as a safety area of concern.

His Schwarm had been engaged in a combat with four Soviet fighters. Beißwenger claimed his last two victories, numbers 151and 152, over Lavochkin LaGG-3 fighters that day. The Messerschmitt Bf 109of Unteroffizier Georg Munderloh was damaged in a <b>midair</b> <b>collision,</b> and Munderloh <b>reported</b> that he would try to reach his base.

Another German pilot observed Beißwenger's aircraft flying at low altitude, clearly suffering from engine problems, attempting to return to friendly territory. [...] After that, there was no trace of him. Beißwenger was later listed as missing in action. It may be that Beißwenger was brought down by Starshiy Leytenant Ivan Kholodov of 32GIAP (Guard Fighter Air Regiment). Kholodov rammed the Bf 109—probably Beißwenger's—that was attacking his wingman, Leytenant Arkadiy Makarov, and managed to bail out of his own damaged craft before it crashed.|$|R
