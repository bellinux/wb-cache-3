The lack of <b>non-farm</b> sources of <b>income</b> and the variation over time in consumption burdens aggravate the seasonal aspects of the agricultural production cycle for poorer households.

Although {{being aware of}} farm households’ potential for <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification seems important for finely-targeting such policy measures, no attempt has thus far been made to summarise the various determinants of income diversification in a single figure. This contribution aims to close this gap. A composite fuzzy indicator that measures farm household potential for <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification is developed and applied to 1, 053 farm households in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia. The indicator summarises the incentives of and capacities for <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification on the individual household member level, and on the household and regional levels to a single measure using fuzzy logic methodology. The composite fuzzy indicator performs well, and {{the results for the}} single farm households can easily be retraced. The indicator not only singles out the households that have the potential for <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification, but also shows the reasons for this. Thus, the result for 1, 053 farm households is not only that most of them have a high potential for <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification, but also that the majority of these households are pushed in diversification due to the smallness of their farms. Only a few of the farm households act under pull conditions, i. e. diversification is not a necessity, but they could opt for profitable non-farm employment due to favourable age, education, and regional conditions. Decision-makers could utilise the composite fuzzy indicator to finely-target diversification measures to the multifaceted conditions of farm households. composite indicator, fuzzy logic, rural <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> diversification, transition countries, Consumer/Household Economics, C 65, J 24, Q 12, R 23,...|$|E

Per capita disposable incomes more than tripled in the cities and almost quadrupled in the rural areas.

40|$|Abstract: Non-farm {{activity}} {{plays an}} increasingly important role in rural household income. Based on data from the Living Standards Measurement Study in the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning, we study the distribution of <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> in rural China. First, we assume <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> as an exogenous transfer to total income to decompose the Gini index; second, we assume <b>non-farm</b> <b>income</b> as a potential substitute for farm income to take household choices into account and simulate household income. The results show that non-farm activity reduces rural income inequality by raising the income of poor households to a larger extent than that of rich households. Improving rural infrastructure and implementing universal basic education are critical {{to build up the}} capacity of households (in particular poor households) to participate in non-farm activity. Strengthening the linkages between farm activity and non-farm activity is essential to optimize the contribution of non-farm activity to pro-poor rural economic development...|$|E

40|$|As India {{integrates}} {{into the global}} economy, its villages are integrating into a rapidly growing urban economy. One of the links through which this is happening is labour markets, where demand for labour to undertake non-farm jobs has been growing. This {{has led to a}} rise in the share of <b>non-farm</b> <b>incomes</b> in total income. These jobs often take people out of the village to engage in labour markets in nearby urban/semi-urban centres. The village of Palanpur is an illustration of a similar trend and we delve deeper into understanding what has led to the rise of <b>non-farm</b> <b>incomes</b> for the last 25 years. An important first step in this endeavour is to understand how villagers allocate time among different job activities and how non-farm activities takes them out of the village. In this paper, we take this first step by examining trends in employment outside the village of Palanpur over the period 1983 - 2008. We classify activities as primary and subsidiary {{on the basis of the}} amount of time spent doing them. We find that, compared to 1993 and 1983, a higher proportion of the adult male labour force works outside the village in 2008. The key driver of outside work is subsidiary jobs that last for short periods of time. Somewhat surprisingly we find that the share of people who work outside the village as a primary occupation has not risen since 1983. This can be understood, however, as part of a process of selective migration. We find evidence, for example, that people who held regular jobs outside the village in 1983, have migrated out in disproportionate numbers. Further scrutiny reveals that there has been a rise in self-employment and non-farm casual labour; activities that take villagers outside Palanpur on a short-term, often daily, basis. We also find that land ownership is an important determinant of working outside the village and that the structural link between land and employment has not changed over time...|$|R
