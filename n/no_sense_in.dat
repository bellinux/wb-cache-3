In 1901, the L completed a remodelling of the approach lines to Central to allow trains to divert onto the Manchester to Southport line and into Southport Chapel Street Station.

500|$|In {{support of}} this theory, Rohrbacher {{provides}} an example with respect to Ammianus Marcellinus' work. In one passage (Amm. 19.12.14), Ammianus describes the Christian emperor Constantius II's attempts to prosecute cases of magic under treason laws, in particular the death penalty applied to those men who were condemned simply for wearing an amulet to ward off diseases: [...] "si qui remedia quartanae vel doloris alterius collo gestaret" [...] ("For if anyone wore on his neck an amulet against the quartan ague or any other complaint"). There is a very similar imperial ruling described in the Life of Caracalla (5.7), which makes <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> Caracalla's time, and is worded in {{almost exactly the same}} way: [...] "qui remedia quartanis tertianisque collo adnexas gestarent" [...] ("wearing them around their necks as preventives of quartan or tertian fever").|$|E
500|$|The episode's opening musical number, [...] "Red Solo Cup", {{was given}} a mixed {{reception}} by reviewers. Chaney called it a [...] "fun change of pace", though she wasn't fond of Toby Keith, who originated the song; Bell admitted {{she had never been}} [...] "much of a Sam fan", but she thought Sam's version [...] "was pretty great". Canning called the song a [...] "terrible choice", and Ford wrote that it [...] "fell unbelievably short". Futterman credited a [...] "surprisingly natural country twang from Sam", but added that the [...] "choir room performance feels mostly stale". Votta could find <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> its inclusion, and called it the [...] "weirdest song on [...] "Glee" [...] since 'Run Joey Run, while Hankinson was harsher, and declared it to be his [...] "least favorite Glee performance of all time". West, on the other hand, said the song was [...] "perfect for Sam", and Overstreet's [...] "smooth sultry voice nailed it".|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{said that}} the {{announcement}} of Kurt as prom queen [...] "effectively caught [...] off guard, right in the gut, as good TV should", others were critical of the story at that moment, including Brown, who {{said that the}}re was no logic to Kurt's victory, no explanation of how it might have happened, and <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> Figgins acceding to it. Semigran and VanDerWerff also called Figgins's actions into question. The sequence after the announcement was lauded by Fallon and Canning, who were impressed by the spliced presentation of multiple aftermaths. Poniewozik said it led to the episode's [...] "theme of community—that is, that not all these characters' problems may be equal, but that they're best able to handle them when they recognize what they have in common. Everyone ... can feel like an outsider on prom night." [...] VanDerWerff also talked about the sense of community, which [...] "has mostly been absent in season two", and noted that [...] "Glee somehow found a way to show off the best AND worst of high school and worked past its own storytelling issues to capture raw emotion." ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{measurement}} approach to obtain increased differentiation of exhaust gas components and stabilized signal behavior using a standard zirconia-based potentiometric lambda probe. The self-discharge characteristic after different voltage pulses {{applied to the}} sensor {{is used as a}} measured parameter which depends on gas type and concentration. The detection of NO in the lower ppm range is demonstrated. In addition, this approach allows to improve the response and selectivity to NO significantly compared to other investigated gases as NO 2, NH 3, H 2 and a mixture of hydrocarbons. Therefore, this technique seems to be capable to enable <b>NO</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>in</b> exhaust gas with improved selectivity using standard lambda probes...|$|R

500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> the context of the scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{seems to}} rest on a misunderstanding of Kant's views since Kant argued that morality is dependent upon {{the concept of a}} rational will (and the related concept of a categorical imperative: an imperative which any rational being must necessarily will for itself). [...] It is not based on contingent features of any being's will, nor upon human wills in particular, so there is <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>in</b> which Kant makes ethics [...] "dependent" [...] upon anything which has not always existed. [...] Furthermore, the sense in which our wills are subject to the law is precisely that if our wills are rational, we must will in a lawlike fashion; that is, we must will according to moral judgments we apply to all rational beings, including ourselves. This is more easily understood by parsing the term [...] "autonomy" [...] into its Greek roots: auto (self) + nomos (rule or law). That is, an autonomous will, according to Kant, is not merely one which follows its own will, but whose will is lawful-that is, conforming to the principle of universalizability, which Kant also identifies with reason. Ironically, in another passage, willing according to immutable reason is precisely the kind of capacity Elshtain ascribes to God as the basis of his moral authority, and she commands this over an inferior voluntarist version of divine command theory, which would make both morality and God's will contingent. Kant's theory is a version of the first rather than the second view of autonomy, so neither God nor any human authority, including contingent human institutions, play any unique authoritative role in his moral theory. Kant and Elshtain, that is, both agree God {{has no choice but to}} conform his will to the immutable facts of reason, including moral truths; humans do have such a choice, but otherwise their relationship to morality is the same as that of God's: they can recognize moral facts, but do not determine their content through contingent acts of will.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Understanding the {{performance}} of cognitive relay networks (CRNs) is of great interest. Recently, stochastic geom-etry {{is being used to}} model and characterize {{the performance}} of CRNs. It is a known fact that sensing {{is an integral part of}} the CRN, however, in most cases it is not perfect. Moreover, the model inaccuracies caused by simplifications and/or approximations when deriving the analytical expressions for characterizing CRNs may distort their true performance. With <b>no</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>in</b> the system, we determine a lower performance bound (LPB) that can be used to judge the reliability of other systems that include sensing and model approximations. Based on the LPB, the operating characteristics (OC) for the CRN are obtained, which determine the joint performance of the primary and secondary system. Finally, OC are used to investigate the system performance under different scenarios. I...|$|R
