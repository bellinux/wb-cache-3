5|$|In April 1941, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded {{and quickly}} {{defeated}} by the Axis powers. Yugoslavia was partitioned, {{and as part of}} this, the Germans established a military government of occupation in an area roughly the same as the pre-1912 Kingdom of Serbia, consisting of Serbia proper, the northern part of Kosovo (around Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. This was due to the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals.</b> They did this to secure two strategic lines of communication – the Danube river, and the railway line that connected Belgrade with Salonika in occupied Greece, and thence by sea to North Africa. The German occupied territory of Serbia was also rich in <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> such as lead, antimony and copper, which German needed to support its war effort.|$|E

5|$|Die casting is a {{metal casting}} {{process that is}} {{characterized}} by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter and tin-based alloys. Depending {{on the type of}} metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys.

However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E

Most of the materials (around two-thirds in terms of refining charges) put through the refining process are by-products from the production of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals,</b> such as dross, matte, and speiss from the zinc smelting industry and anode sludge built up during electrolysis.

40|$|The {{threat posed}} by <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> theft to {{industries}} in South Africa is substantial but is also regarded with indifference. A reason for this view {{may be that the}} criminal act is ordinarily not accompanied by violence and the target of the crime is an object that is far removed from the vicinity of the majority of South Africans. <b>Non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> theft may sometimes even be erroneously termed a victimless crime. This study endeavours to shed light on the complexities of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> theft and the industrial dangers that may be suffered if this crime is not eradicated. A case study from the mining industry was used to examine {{the nature and extent of}} <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> theft. A mixed methods approach was followed in terms of which qualitative and quantitative research was done sequentially to provide the best possible representation of the situation. The participant allowed access to data over a six-year period as well as access to mine employees for interviews to assist with understanding the safety and security measures that the mine put in place to protect its workforce. This information led to another realisation, namely that if <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> thieves cut an electricity supply line that is critical for life support and transportation in the mine, mineworkers may succumb to the harsh conditions underground. It also became evident that the police and the criminal justice system must develop a better understanding of the seriousness of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> theft. If this does not happen in the near future, managing the consequences of nonferrous metal theft at South African mines will become a mammoth task. Such mines and other industries affected by <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> related theft must collaborate with each other and the police in order to understand the nature of the crime and to ensure that the prosecution of the perpetrators is handled properly. These industries should also subscribe to a pragmatic approach to crime prevention whereby various components from different crime prevention strategies are used to address the issues being experienced and whereby a unique crime prevention model for each industry and mining site can be developed.
