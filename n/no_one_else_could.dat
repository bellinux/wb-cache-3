5|$|The battle finally ceased when a shell from Virginia {{struck the}} pilot house of Monitor and exploded, driving {{fragments}} {{of paint and}} iron through the viewing slits into Worden's eyes and temporarily blinding him. As <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> see to command the ship, Monitor was forced to draw off. The executive officer, Lieutenant Samuel Dana Greene, took over, and Monitor returned to the fight. In the period of command confusion, however, the crew of Virginia believed that their opponent had withdrawn. Although Minnesota was still aground, the falling tide meant that {{she was out of}} reach. Furthermore, Virginia had suffered enough damage to require extensive repair. Convinced that his ship had won the day, Jones ordered her back to Norfolk. At about this time, Monitor returned, only to discover her opponent apparently giving up the fight. Convinced that Virginia was quitting, with orders only to protect Minnesota and not to risk his ship unnecessarily, Greene did not pursue. Thus, each side misinterpreted the moves of the other, and as a result each claimed victory.|$|E

This inspired other alebrije artists, and Linares’ work became prized both in Mexico and abroad. Rivera said that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have fashioned the strange figures he requested; work done by Linares for Rivera is now displayed at the Anahuacalli Museum in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|Among the Timucua, a type {{of black}} drink was called cacina by the Spanish. The {{preparation}} and consumption of the drink were strictly limited to the community council house. Women (other than an occasional female chief) were normally excluded from the council house except for activities such as dances, but did prepare the cacina. In 1678 a bedridden cacica (a female chief) was given permission to brew and consume cacina in her house, {{on the condition that}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be present while she did so.|$|E

25|$|During {{the initial}} {{development}} {{to get the}} film made, Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando were originally considered for the roles of Duke and Gonzo but they both grew too old. Afterward, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were considered for the duo, but that fell apart when Belushi died. John Malkovich was later considered {{for the role of}} Duke, but he grew too old too. At one point John Cusack was almost cast (Cusack had previously directed the play version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with his brother playing Duke). However, after Hunter S. Thompson met with Johnny Depp he became convinced that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> play him. When Cox and Davies started writing the screenplay, Depp and del Toro committed to starring in the film.|$|E
25|$|The Mears Newz was {{published}} by Swift Lathers, its founder and editor. Lathers was well-skilled in English and grammar, benefiting from training by his mother, an English teacher. Lathers worked as a stringer for a Detroit newspaper, where he grew to dislike the constant editing of his writing by others. He was then motivated {{to start his own}} newspaper where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> edit his writing. Moving from the Detroit area to Mears in 1909, Lathers started The Mears News (he initially spelled the word News in the name with an s) and believed it was his life's calling to report on items related to Mears, his adopted hometown. His simple meager lifestyle sacrificed personal financial gain to keep his newspaper going. Lathers wrote all his own stories and reports. He printed the newspapers on a foot operated printing press. Lathers would hand deliver the newspapers himself locally.|$|E
500|$|They [...] are fused {{together}} in a curiously personal way: the separate ingredients can be analysed and defined, but not the ultimate product, which is not Dowland plus van Dieren or Elizabethan plus modern, but simply something wholly individual and unanalysable—Peter Warlock. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have written it.|$|E

500|$|David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, {{the real-life}} {{inventor}} who creates a teleportation device for Angier. For {{the role of}} Nikola Tesla, Nolan wanted someone who was not necessarily a film star but was [...] "extraordinarily charismatic". Nolan said that [...] "David Bowie was really the only guy I had in mind to play Tesla because his function in the story is a small but very important role". Nolan contacted Bowie, who initially turned down the part. A lifelong fan, Nolan flew out to New York to pitch the role to Bowie in person, telling him <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> possibly play the part; Bowie accepted after a few minutes.|$|E
500|$|Barrymore {{decided to}} work on more Shakespeare roles. In June 1937, he signed up with NBC Radio to produce a series of six episodes under the name Streamlined Shakespeare, which also {{featured}} Barrie. The first program was Hamlet, which was well received by critics. The New York Times commented that [...] "Shakespeare's lines uttered dramatically by the voice of John Barrymore sweep through the 'ether' with a sound of finality; it seems that they are his words and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> speak them with such lifelike force". Peters disagrees however, and considers that [...] "because he was desperate he pressed too hard and ended by caricaturing, not capturing, his great Shakespearean acting".|$|E

50|$|However, during production, {{the crew}} had some eerie occurrences on the set. Some of the crew, {{especially}} those that came in earlier, had significant problems inside the 637 S Lucerne Blvd house such as things that would bump into them that were not there, and things that would move that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> around <b>could</b> have done around that time. Wagner personally felt a strong presence at the staircase where someone was walking behind him, as well as numerous occurrences where {{the cast and crew}} heard whispering and talking.|$|R

They—and we—may still not be regarded as conventionally acceptable 'nice' literature, as it were—but I have come to value that historical judgment. We wrote the stories <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> tell.

500|$|Although the Netherlandish {{artists are}} {{primarily}} {{known for their}} panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved retables, stained glass, brass objects and carved tombs. According to art historian Susie Nash, by the early 16th century, the region led the field in {{almost every aspect of}} portable visual culture, [...] "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> compete with them". The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and metalwork, which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's [...] of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals {{as in the case of}} van Eyck's lost Portrait of Isabella of Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Sean Connery as Professor Henry Jones: Indiana's father, a {{professor}} of Medieval literature who cared more about looking for the Grail than raising his son. Spielberg had Connery {{in mind when he}} suggested introducing Indiana's father, though he did not tell Lucas at first. Consequently, Lucas wrote the role as [...] "a crazy, eccentric" [...] professor resembling Laurence Olivier, whose relationship with Indiana is [...] "strict schoolmaster and student rather than a father and son". Spielberg had been a fan of Connery's work as James Bond and felt that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> perform the role as well. Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride wrote, [...] "Connery was already the father of Indiana Jones since the series had sprung from the desire of Lucas and Spielberg to rival (and outdo) Connery's James Bond movies." [...] Connery initially turned the role down as he is only twelve years older than Ford, but he relented. Connery—a student of history—began to reshape the character, and revisions were made to the script to address his concerns. [...] "I wanted to play Henry Jones as a kind of Sir Richard [...] Burton," [...] Connery commented. [...] "I was bound to have fun with the role of a gruff, Victorian Scottish father." [...] Connery believed Henry should be a match for his son, telling Spielberg that [...] "whatever Indy'd done my character has done and my character has done it better". Connery signed to the film on March25, 1988. He improvised the line, [...] "She talks in her sleep", which was left in because it made everyone laugh; in Boam's scripts, Henry telling Indiana that he slept with Elsa occurs later.|$|E
60|$|With {{her daughters}} she lived on terms almost of equality. The two elder were now grown up; that is, they were {{respectively}} eighteen and seventeen years old. They were devotedly {{attached to their}} mother, looked on her as the only perfect woman in existence, and would willingly do nothing that could vex her; but they perhaps were not quite so systematically obedient to her as children should be to their only surviving parent. Mrs. Woodward, however, found nothing amiss, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> therefore <b>could</b> well {{have a right to}} complain.|$|R

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1991, Sub Pop {{gave the}} group $1000 to record the July 1992 entry in the labels singles club series. The group entered James Kavoussi's Toxic Shock Studios on Broadway in New York with Frigid Stars LP {{producer}} Mike McMacklin to record early versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", and a cover of the MX-80 song [...] "Promise of Love". The tracks were not successful with only [...] "Promise of Love" [...] being usable. Engle noted that Codeine desired the song to be loud {{on both sides of}} the single, but could not get the song [...] "Jr" [...] to come together. The group had already gone through most of their budget for recording, which led to the group going to an eight-track studio in the Boston suburb of Allston. Immerwahr went into the studio where the group were able to complete a version of the song [...] "Realize". The group met up again to work in early 1992 towards their second LP (Long playing record) The White Birch, with recording commencing in June at Harold Dessau Recording at 25 Murray Street in Manhattan. At the studio, the group attempted to record versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", [...] "Tom", [...] "Wird" [...] "Smoking Room", [...] "Barely Real", [...] "Something New" [...] and [...] "Sea" [...] within a months time. Immerwahr was not content with the tracks, noting several issues such as: his own vocals, his desire to record music with even slower tempos, and the presence of high pitched noises in the songs that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> hear. On attempting to fix a broken toilet at the studio, Immerwahr accidentally flooded the clothing store below the studio.|$|E
500|$|Licinius' defeat came to {{represent}} the defeat of a rival center of pagan and Greek-speaking political activity in the East, {{as opposed to the}} Christian and Latin-speaking Rome, and it was proposed that a new Eastern capital should represent the integration of the East into the Roman Empire as a whole, as a center of learning, prosperity, and cultural preservation for the whole of the Eastern Roman Empire. Among the various locations proposed for this alternative capital, Constantine appears to have toyed earlier with Serdica (present-day Sofia), as he was reported saying that [...] "Serdica is my Rome". Sirmium and Thessalonica were also considered. Eventually, however, Constantine decided to work on the Greek city of Byzantium, which offered the advantage of having already been extensively rebuilt on Roman patterns of urbanism, during the preceding century, by Septimius Severus and Caracalla, who had already acknowledged its strategic importance. The city was thus founded in 324, dedicated on 11 May 330 and renamed Constantinopolis ("Constantine's City" [...] or Constantinople in English). Special commemorative coins were issued in 330 to honor the event. The new city was protected by the relics of the True Cross, the Rod of Moses and other holy relics, though a cameo now at the Hermitage Museum also represented Constantine crowned by the tyche of the new city. The figures of old gods were either replaced or assimilated into a framework of Christian symbolism. Constantine built the new Church of the Holy Apostles on the site of a temple to Aphrodite. Generations later there was the story that a divine vision led Constantine to this spot, and an angel <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> see, led him on a circuit of the new walls. The capital would often be compared to the 'old' Rome as Nova Roma Constantinopolitana, the [...] "New Rome of Constantinople".|$|E
2500|$|The {{guideline}} {{of silent}} prayer comes from Hannah's behavior during prayer, when she prayed in the Temple {{to bear a}} child. She prayed [...] "speaking upon her heart," [...] so that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> hear, yet her lips were moving. Therefore, when saying the Amidah one's voice should be audible to oneself, but not loud enough for others to hear.|$|E
5000|$|The Swiss philanthropist {{and music}} patron Werner Reinhart, to whom Hindemith had {{dedicated}} his Clarinet Quintet in 1923, later told Gertrud Hindemith [...] "there was something Mozartian" [...] about her husband’s writing Trauermusik {{in half a}} day, and premiering it the same day. [...] "I know <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> today who <b>could</b> do that", he said.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of Elias was played by Trevor Fehrman, {{who had previously}} worked with Jeff Anderson in his film, Now You Know. Smith {{saw him in the}} film and was impressed enough to give him a part. In keeping with Smith's tradition of casting actors that he has previously worked with, both Jason Lee and Ben Affleck had parts in the film. Lee played Randal's old enemy, Lance Dowds, and Affleck played a random Mooby's customer. After finding <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> who <b>could</b> pull off being the Sexy Stud, Smith turned to crew member Zak Charles Knutson to fill the role.|$|R
