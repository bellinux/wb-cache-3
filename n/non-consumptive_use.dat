40|$|The {{contingent}} valuation method {{is often used}} for valuing environmental goods possessing use as well as non-use values. This paper investigates {{the relative importance of}} these values in relation to the existence of the wild Asian elephant. It does so by analysing results from a {{contingent valuation}} survey of a sample of urban residents living in three selected housing schemes in Colombo. We find that the major proportion of the respondents’ willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation of wild elephants is attributable to the non-use values of the elephant. However, differences in the relative importance of these values exist between those who visit national parks and those who do not. Differences in respondents’ WTP for conservation of elephants are found to be largely influenced by attitudinal and behavioural factors rather than socio-economic ones. We conclude that policymakers must recognise and take account of the importance of non-use values of the Asian elephant, if this endangered species is to survive in the long run. Nevertheless, the <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>use</b> value of elephants in Sri Lanka is also found to be substantial.

40|$|A {{contingent}} valuation study was undertaken {{to determine the}} level of community support for the dedication of Whian Whian State Forest in north-east NSW as a new national park. The study investigated {{the relative importance of}} a number of forest uses and the values held by the respondents that were important in determining their bid. Although this research was conducted during the final phase of the Comprehensive Regional Assessment of the forests of the Upper North East of New South Wales, {{there are a number of}} discrepancies between the findings reported here and the outcomes of the assessment. This suggests that the determination of the Regional Forest Agreements used criteria other than biophysical and socio-economic attributes. This study identified the ecosystem functions of water catchment protection and provision of habitat for endangered species as the two most important uses of Whian Whian State Forest. Training in sustainable forestry was rated extremely important in more cases (25. 3 %) than all other timber industry related uses presented.

The consumptive and <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>uses</b> are not mutually exclusive; careful planning is needed to ensure that multiple management objectives can be met. Further, the analysis indicates that the two uses may be undertaken in the same area. Whether they are spatially, or temporally separated depends on the magnitude of the consumptive use.

5000|$|While {{there have}} been many {{benefits}} of these conservancies, questions still remain about their success. As of 2004, no quantitative studies had been done to determine if the conservancies have actually helped in protecting biodiversity, (but see the surveys reported above) or in increasing wildlife populations of all threatened species. [...] One concern is that the conservancies might encourage the populations of only high-value game species, and ignore the others. This might not be optimum for biodiversity, although of course far better than if communities were gaining their income primarily through livestock and cropping, as they did before the conservancies were initiated. A way to possibly alleviate this problem might be to focus the profits on <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>uses,</b> such as ecotourism/safari activities, in which the only thing to shoot with is a camera. However, ecotourism likewise could lead to favouring of those species that tourists like to see, and can have major impacts in terms of infrastructure development, pollution, and other pressures of increased numbers of visitations.|$|R

Villagers, foresters, park employees, entrepreneurs and environmentalists were surveyed. The survey applied a multi-group social choice method, following six steps: (i) identification of all relevant social states for sustainable forest management; (ii) elicitation of preferences, for different social states, of forest user groups' members; (iii) determination of attributes of users and social states; (iv) aggregation of individual forest value preferences into social value preferences; (v) inter-group comparison of preferences; and (vi) estimation of predictors of social forest value preferences. A distinction is made between the household-perspective and the citizen-perspective of evaluations. As well, socio-economic and institutional-legal attributes of stakeholders were tested as predictors of stakeholder preferences. The major findings include the following. First, <b>non-consumptive</b> forest <b>uses,</b> including ecosystem services, were given highest priority by all stakeholders. Second, consumptive values were weighted more discriminately, while non-consumptive values were viewed more holistically. Third, forest dependence and environmental-resource-entitlements lead to more household consumption-based valuations; whereas, the appreciation of diverse forest values increases with the education of people. Fourth, the stakeholders exercise higher consensus {{on the importance of}} <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>uses</b> when such values are evaluated in the context of societal needs but not as household needs; consumptive uses registered the opposite effect. This finding signifies the separation between individual-conscience and social-conscience corresponding with the evaluation of consumer needs and societal needs, respectively.

A promising solution is the privatization of rights to instream flows, such that private entities or individuals could purchase and enforce instream water rights; and instream uses of water could compete in the market for water against traditional consumptive uses. However, attempts by states to implement privately held instream rights have also been unsuccessful thus far.

The biological component of the model, which is applied to a nine-species Alaskan marine ecosystem, relies on individual optimizing behaviour by plants and animals to establish population dynamics. The biological component is used to define naturalness. By varying harvesting we arrive at different steady-state populations and humans choose from among these steady states. Welfare maximizing levels of the ecosystem services are derived, then it is shown that in the laissez-faire economy overharvesting occurs when the harvesting industry ignores ecosystem services (2) and (3).

From June 2007 to April 2008 we conducted eight in-depth, semi-structured interviews with sea turtle poachers at five coastal communities in BCS to determine the drivers influencing them. The most prevalent reasons for illegal poaching were direct economic benefits, lack of law enforcement and ease of escape from or bribery of authorities, and strong family tradition. Our results suggest that to reduce illegal poaching {{it will be necessary to}} better enforce existing environmental laws, reduce social acceptance of sea turtle hunting throughout the region, educate fishers on the ecological importance of sea turtles, and show fishers direct economic benefits from <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>use</b> of sea turtles, such as ecotourism...|$|E

Executive Summary This National Water Planning Report Card 2013 follows the first {{baseline}} assessment undertaken in 2011. It provides a consolidated summary of the progress of water planning across Australia against an evaluation framework based on key elements of the National Water Initiative (NWI) and its associated Water Planning Guidelines. Under Australia’s constitutional arrangements, state and territory governments are largely responsible for water resource management and they develop water plans at varying scales. Water plans may combine multiple catchments or they may deal with a single surface or groundwater resource, depending on specific circumstances. Water plans seek to manage water resources sustainably, under changing pressures, to maintain the future viability of the resources and all consumptive and <b>non-consumptive</b> <b>uses</b> that depend on them. This report does not compare state and territory water planning frameworks against each other nor does it advocate a particular water planning model. Rather, it seeks to facilitate a national discussion on the quality of water plans and planning frameworks, as well as identify areas of better practice and those for improvement. It {{should be noted that the}} report card is a desktop assessment.

Nebraska residents were more aware of elk and elk hunting in the Pine Ridge than were nonresidents. Also, more residents had observed elk and were willing to drive longer distances to view elk in the Pine Ridge. Respondents in older age groups (55 – 64) were more knowledgeable about elk. More urban tourists were in favor of elk than those from rural communities, but attitudes toward elk hunting were similar between urban and rural residents. Seventy-six percent of respondents wanted an increase in the population of elk.
