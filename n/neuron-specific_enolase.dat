50|$|Histologically, ganglioglioma is {{composed}} of both neoplastic glial and ganglion cells which are disorganized, variably cellular, and non-infiltrative. Occasionally, it may be challenging to differentiate ganglion cell tumors from an infiltrating glioma with entrapped neurons. The presence of neoplastic ganglion cells forming abnormal clusters, the presence of binucleation and dysmorphic neurons are helpful clues favoring ganglioglioma over glioma. The glial component of ganglioglioma includes fibrillary astrocytes {{with varying degrees of}} cellular atypia. The neoplastic neuronal components are often clustered or irregularly oriented. Fibrovascular stroma confined to the neuronal component, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and small foci of calcification are common, as is immunopositivity for synaptophysin, <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase,</b> and chromogranin A. Elevated Ki-67 and p53 labeling index is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in both children and adults with gangliogliomas. The rare occurrence of malignant transformation is confined to the glial cell population, and is characterized by increased cellularity and mitotic activity, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis.|$|E
50|$|Neuroendocrine {{cells in}} the human {{prostate}} contain a diverse array of secretory products: serotonin (which is present in virtually all neuroendocrine prostatic cells, chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> (NSE) (three proteins that are used as markers for neuroendocrine cells) calcitonin and other peptides of the calcitonin family (calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and katacalcin, which colocalize to the calcitonin-containing cells), bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), thyroid stimulating hormone-like peptide, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), alpha-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), somatostatin, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and adrenomedullin. The physiology of their secretion and its regulation is incompletely understood. Regulatory cues might come through endocrine, paracrine (from neighboring neuroendocrine cells), autocrine or neurocrine routes. The open type cells may in addition receive regulatory signals from luminal moleculesThe developmental origin of these cells is as yet unknown. They are thought to arise from a different precursor than other epithelial prostatic cells, possibly through a neurogenic lineage of their own, which is therefore distinct from the secretory and basal cells that derive from urogenital sinus.|$|E
50|$|The {{immunohistochemical}} phenotype of focal neuroendocrine differentiation in {{prostate cancer}} has been intensively studied. Chromogranin A, {{which is the}} most abundant product of prostatic neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine tumor cells, is widely recognized as a reliable marker for neuroendocrine differentiation. Synaptophysin and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> are also reliable markers. The most frequently encountered products in neuroendocrine tumor cells across prostate cancer samples appear to be calcitonin (in more than one third of cases), neurotensin, serotonin, human chorionic gonadotropin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and bombesin/gastrin-releasing peptide. Neuroendocrine tumor cells express cytokeratins that are typically expressed by luminal secretory type cells, but lack basal cell markers such as high molecular weight cytokeratin and p63. They are negative for androgen receptor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and are positive for prostate acid phosphatase. Neuroendocrine tumor cells are also negative for the proliferation marker Ki-67; however, adjacent non-neuroendocrine tumor cells appear to display an increased expression of Ki-67. As opposed to their normal neuroendocrine counterparts, tumor neuroendocrine cells express the beta-oxidative enzyme alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, which is a recently described marker for prostate cancer.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Brent A. Reynolds and Samuel Weiss {{attempted}} to isolate EGF-responsive cells from an adult mouse {{central nervous system}} (CNS). They dissociated the striata of 3 to 18-month old mice via enzymes and plated them in a serum-free culture containing 20 ng of EGF per milliliter. After two days in vitro, most of the cells had died, but 15±2 cells for each plate were undergoing cell division. This continued {{for two to three}} days, after which the proliferating clusters of cells detached and formed a sphere of proliferating cells. After this discovery of a spherical formation of cells, the two assessed the antigenic properties of the cells within these spheres. They found that cells in the spheres were nearly all immunoreactive for nestin, an intermediate filament found in neuroepithelial stem cells. The cells were not immunoreactive for neurofilament, <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> (NSE), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After more proliferation and longer days in vitro in the presence of EGF, cells eventually became immunoreactive to neurofilament, NSE, and GFAP. The cells that had this immunoreactivity were then tested for CNS neurotransmitters with indirect immunocytochemistry. Reynolds and Weiss found that, at 21 days, in vitro cultures of spheres and associated cells contained two of the major neurotransmitters of the adult striatum. These spheres of cells that Reynolds and Weiss discovered in 1992 were the first neurosphere formations created and analyzed.|$|E
40|$|Summary: A mixed mesencephalic {{cell culture}} damaged by {{glutamate}} {{was used as}} a model to study the efflux of lactate dehydrogenase and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> from neuronal cells into the culture medium. Glutamate toxicity was induced in sister cultures by 15 min exposure to 100 μτηοΐ/ΐ glutamate in a Ca 2 * containing salt solution. Cell injury was monitored 24 h later by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase activity and the <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> content in the cells and in the culture medium. The neuronal cell damage is reflected by an efflux of <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> and lactate dehydrogenase from the cells and an increase of lactate dehydrogenase catalytic activity concentration and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> mass concentration in the culture medium. It was found that the efflux fraction calculated from estimations of the cells was clearly higher than the efflux fraction calculated from estimations of the amount of enzymes found in the culture medium. Calculations of the recovery of lactate dehydrogenase and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> and experiments designed to study the efflux of lactate dehydrogenase and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> during incubation and washing showed that higher amounts of <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> are released than lactate dehydrogenase.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic {{hypothermia}} and pharmacological sedation {{may influence}} outcome prediction after cardiac arrest. The {{use of a}} multimodal approach, including clinical examination, electroencephalography, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and serum <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase,</b> is recommended; however, no study examined the comparative performance of these predictors or addressed their optimal combination. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Adult ICU of an academic hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-four consecutive adults treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Variables related to the cardiac arrest (cardiac rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation), clinical examination (brainstem reflexes and myoclonus), electroencephalography reactivity during therapeutic hypothermia, somatosensory-evoked potentials, and serum <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase.</b> Models to predict clinical outcome at 3 months (assessed using the Cerebral Performance Categories: 5 = death; 3 - 5 = poor recovery) were evaluated using ordinal logistic regressions and receiving operator characteristic curves. Seventy-two patients (54 %) had a poor outcome (of whom, 62 died), and 62 had a good outcome. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression identified absence of electroencephalography reactivity (p < 0. 001), incomplete recovery of brainstem reflexes in normothermia (p = 0. 013), and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> higher than 33 μg/L (p = 0. 029), but not somatosensory-evoked potentials, as independent predictors of poor outcome. The combination of clinical examination, electroencephalography reactivity, and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> yielded the best predictive performance (receiving operator characteristic areas: 0. 89 for mortality and 0. 88 for poor outcome), with 100 % positive predictive value. Addition of somatosensory-evoked potentials to this model did not improve prognostic accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of clinical examination, electroencephalography reactivity, and serum <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> offers the best outcome predictive performance for prognostication of early postanoxic coma, whereas somatosensory-evoked potentials do not add any complementary information.

Methods: We neurologically assessed 190 consecutive patients undergoing elective cardiac operations for coronary artery bypass (n = 147), valve replacement (n = 29), or both (n = 14), before as well as after the operation. Postoperative outcome was classified as type I (uncomplicated), type II (confusion, agitation, disorientation, or epileptic seizures), or type III (stroke, stupor, or coma). Levels of S- 100 β and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> were evaluated in venous blood samples drawn preoperatively and then daily in the first 5 postoperative days. Results: Levels of S- 100 β and <b>neuron-specific</b> <b>enolase</b> differed significantly among the 3 groups (type III > type II > type I) throughout the postoperative period and had a diagnostic specificity and specificity of 89 % and 79 %, respectively, in identifying patients with type III outcome.
