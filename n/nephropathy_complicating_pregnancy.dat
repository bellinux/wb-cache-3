Volvulus of the sigmoid colon {{is the most common}} cause of intestinal obstruction <b>complicating</b> <b>pregnancy</b> accounting for upto 44 % of the aetiology.

Sigmoid volvulus <b>complicating</b> <b>pregnancy</b> carries a high maternal mortality and morbidity, fetal mortality and needs a high index of suspicion and early surgical intervention.

40|$|Background: In Indonesia the {{maternal}} deaths at rural areas was still high because most deliveries {{were conducted by}} non health workers and many occurred homes. Early detection for risk factors, <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and deliveries {{are one of the}} efforts to prevent {{the maternal}} deaths in community. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine knowledge, attitude and behavior of the non health workers on risk factors, <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and deliveries. Methods: It was an observational study with a cross sectional approach, sample were taken purposively. The study was conducted at four public health center in two district (Banjar and Tanah Laut) in South Kalimantan Province. Respondents were non health workers composed of traditional birth attendants (TBAs), Posyandu cadres and families of pregnant and deliveries mothers. Results: The study showed that the majority of respondents had low knowledge on risk factors and <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and deliveries. The majority of respondents, 95 % cadres and 83. 3 % family members were disagree if the delivery services only assisted by health workers. Furthermore, the majority of TBAs (65 %) agreed that deliveries would be assisted by health workers if they were given some compensation. The majority of the patients would be referred to health facilities if they were found <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and deliveries. Therefore, the knowledge of non health workers has to be improved. So that they have good knowledge and abilities to refer patients rightly and promptly.   Key words: the non health workers, knowledge, attitude, behavior, referring, risk factors, <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and deliveries</p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In {{the present}} study, we {{have aimed to}} {{determine}} the frequency of common inherited thrombophilias among women with preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, placental abruption, recurrent pregnancy loss, and stillbirth. Materials and Methods: Sixty women with <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and as a control group 53 normal pregnant women {{were included in the}} study. Women with <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> consist of preeclampsia (n= 21), intrauterine growth restriction (n= 12), intrauterine fetal death (n= 12), placental abruption (n= 5) and recurrent pregnancy loss (n= 10). Genotype analysis for factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin mutation (PT 20210 G/A), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C 677 T polymorphism were performed by real-time online polymerase chain reaction. Results: The frequency of Factor V Leiden mutation was found statistically higher in the <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancy</b> group, com-pared to normal group (23. 3 % vs 7. 5 %) (p= 0. 04). On the other hand, no difference was detected on the heterozygous MTHFR frequencies between the two groups. However, 9 % of the women with <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> had homozygous mutation and no woman was homozygous for MTHFR in the control group. PT gene mutation was found in only one patient from the control group. Discussion: Factor V Leiden mutation and homozygousity for the MTHFR polymorphism, rather than its heterozygousity, might be involved in the pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcome associated with placental vasculopathy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Women with {{a history}} of {{vascular}} <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are at risk for developing remote cardiovascular disease. It is associated with underlying cardiovascular risk factors both jeopardizing trophoblast and vascular function. Subclinical hypothyroidism may relate to both conditions. METHODS: In 372 women {{with a history}} of vascular <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> we assessed thyroid function. RESULTS: Subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 73 / 372 women (19. 6 %). It occurred more often when pregnancy ended before 32 weeks of gestation (p = 0. 008). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common after very preterm delivery. It may contribute to the elevated risk of remote cardiovascular disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{discovery}} of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum and plasma {{has opened a}} new avenue for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis and provided a useful marker of <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (1 – 7). In recent years, the analysis of fetal DNA in maternal serum or plasma has afforded successful prenatal diagnosis of fetal rhesus D status (2) and single-gene disorders (3), as well as fetal gender (4). In addition, an increased fetal DNA concentration in maternal serum or plasma has been demonstrated as a useful marker in preeclampsia (5, 6) and preterm labor (7). However, the origin of the fetal DNA and the biologic significance of its increase in <b>complicated</b> <b>pregnancies</b> remain unclear.
