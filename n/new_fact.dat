2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} the test set forth in Shipman {{illustrate}} the narrowness of the remedy. Because the writ of coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed {{at the time of}} judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, the remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law. [...] Moreover, the allegedly <b>new</b> <b>fact</b> must have been unknown and must have been in existence {{at the time of the}} judgment.|$|E
2500|$|Turning his {{attention}} to the condoned Russification of the 1950s, he exclaimed: [...] "Comrades, there is not one invention, not one thing new in this world, without there also being a Russian coming right up, for them to be telling us that this Russian has in fact 'uncovered' that <b>new</b> <b>fact,</b> that new invention, beforehand!!" [...] Claiming to cite a SovRom engineer, Drăghici compared the Soviet treatment of Romanians with the apartheid regime.

2500|$|However, a {{criticism}} of the E v. Home Secretary approach is that [...] "it might undermine the important principle of finality". Moreover, the fear of opening the floodgates of litigation could be another pressing concern. These worries were expressed by the UK courts in Shaheen v Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005) and in MT (Algeria) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2007). In MT (Algeria), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{went so far as}} to warn against embracing this ground of review as it might have the effect of [...] "turn what is a simple error of fact into an error of law by asserting some <b>new</b> <b>fact</b> which is itself contentious".|$|E

It was a bold new motif creeping in among ancient and venerable airs.|$|E

We [...] ought not to waste this <b>new</b> <b>fact,</b> but take careful account of it. [...] On the other hand, I think he will see that the moment for taking [...] account of it has not come.

[...] He would go back at a heavy discount.
