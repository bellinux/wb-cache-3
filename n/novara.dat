5|$|Unaware that <b>Novara</b> {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of <b>Novara,</b> Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation <b>Novara</b> was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with <b>Novara,</b> Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck <b>Novara,</b> {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship to reduce speed to allow Bristol to catch up. <b>Novara</b> was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from <b>Novara</b> and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
5|$|The ship saw {{extensive}} service during World War I, {{owing to}} the cautious strategies adopted by the Austro-Hungarian fleet and their opponents in the Triple Entente. <b>Novara</b> was frequently used to raid enemy shipping and the Otranto Barrage, including a patrol in November 1915 where she destroyed a stranded French submarine. These operations culminated in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in May 1917, the largest naval battle of the Adriatic Campaign. There, she and her two sisters sank fourteen drifters, though she was badly damaged by a British cruiser {{and had to be}} towed back to port. <b>Novara</b> was involved in the Cattaro Mutiny in January 1918 and led the loyalist vessels to safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{training}} facility(s) of <b>Novara's</b> Youth Sector {{is based}} at Novarello Villaggio Azzurro.|$|R
50|$|Choreutis <b>novarae</b> is a moth in the Choreutidae family. It was {{described}} by Felder and Rogenhofer in 1875. It is found on the Nicobar Islands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Novara's</b> sights can {{be divided}} into two groupings. The city's most {{important}} sights lie within its historic centre, the area once enclosed by the city walls. However, several important sights also lie outside the line of the former city walls.|$|R
5|$|The three cruisers were {{gradually}} drawing {{away from}} their pursuers when <b>Novara,</b> leading the Austrian ships, was hit several times; most critically in the engine room that knocked out half her boilers. Helgoland was also hit five times, but not seriously, aside from one gun disabled. One crewman had been killed and 16 were wounded. The British ships turned away, around the time that <b>Novara</b> had to extinguish her remaining boilers and went dead in the water, upon learning that more Austrian ships were approaching. Saida was preparing to take <b>Novara</b> under tow when several Italian destroyers attacked in succession. The weight of fire from the three cruisers prevented them from closing to torpedo range and they scored no hits. The Allied ship returned to Brindisi and the Austrians slowly proceeded back to base. Helgoland had fired 1052 shells from her 10cm guns. Heyssler received the Order of Leopold with crossed swords in recognition of his leadership during the battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{under the}} terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, <b>Novara</b> and the rest of the fleet was {{surrendered}} to the Allied powers as war prizes; <b>Novara</b> was awarded to France in the post-war distribution of ships. She sprang a leak in the Adriatic and put into Brindisi, Italy, where she sank on 29 January 1920. She was refloated in early April 1920. The ship was renamed Thionville and incorporated into the French fleet after repairs. Thionville was assigned to the torpedo school for use as a training ship, a role she filled until 1 May 1932. The ship was then disarmed and converted into a barracks ship based in Toulon. She remained there until 1941, when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In 1242, the {{citizens}} of Tyre offered the barons opposed to Frederick's rule (Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Toron) their assistance against Richard Filangieri, who ruled Tyre on Frederick's behalf. Marsilio Zorzi, the bailli of the Venetian community in the Holy Land offered naval support to the coalition. At {{the request of the}} members of the High Court, Philip of <b>Novara,</b> a noted jurist, stated that Frederick had forfeited his right to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem when his son, Conrad, had reached the age of majority on 25 April 1243. <b>Novara</b> also argued that Alice and her husband were entitled to rule the kingdom as regent for the absent Conrad because she was his closest relative who lived in the Holy Land. The members of the High Court, the representatives of the clergy, the Military Orders and the Italian communities held a joint assembly where Alice and Ralph of Nesle were proclaimed regents on 5 June. She agreed that Balian of Ibelin and Philip of Montfort would keep all royal castles in the kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|Le Livre de Forme de Plait. Philip of <b>Novara's</b> legal treatise, {{written from}} a more aristocratic viewpoint, {{was written in the}} 1250s. He also wrote a history of the {{conflict}} between the Ibelins (his patrons) and the Hohenstaufens on Cyprus and in Acre.|$|R
50|$|During {{this battle}} the Allies lost two destroyers, 14 drifters and one glider while the Austro-Hungarian navy {{suffered}} only minor damage (<b>Novaras</b> steam supply pipes were damaged by a shell) and few losses. The Austro-Hungarian navy {{returned to its}} bases up north in order to repair and re-supply, and the allies had to rebuild the blockade.|$|R
50|$|Evidence for the {{diffusion}} of Maury’s ideas in the Austrian Navy after this point {{can be found in}} the narrative of the <b>Novara’s</b> circumnavigation (1857-1859), and in a more lucid exposition of them which was published at Pola in 1867. Notwithstanding the latter, Jilek’s textbook probably remained in use at the Academy for about twenty years.|$|R
5|$|<b>Novara</b> {{changed hands}} several times {{as the war}} ended, being {{transferred}} first to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a successor state to Austria-Hungary, and then to France as a war prize {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Commissioned into the French fleet as Thionville, the ship served from 1920 to 1932 as a training ship, and from 1932 to 1941 as a barracks ship in Toulon before being broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|DB Cargo is {{a global}} freight {{operator}} with a large interest in freight over rail in Europe. While High Speed 1 was constructed with freight loops, no freight traffic had run upon the line since opening in 2003. On 16 April 2009 DB Schenker {{signed an agreement with}} HS1 Ltd, the owner of High Speed 1, for a partnership to develop TVM modifications for class 92 freight locomotives to run on the line. On 25 March 2011 {{for the first time a}} modified class 92 locomotive travelled from Dollands Moor to Singlewell using the TVM430 signalling system. A loaded container train ran for the first time on 27 May 2011, to <b>Novara</b> in Italy. Following further trials with loaded wagons DB is to upgrade five Class 92 locomotives to allow them to run on High Speed 1. From 11 November 2011 a weekly service using European-sized swap body containers has run between London and Poland using High Speed 1.|$|E
5|$|In a 2–1 {{victory against}} <b>Novara</b> Calcio on 2 February 2012, Pellissier scored his 100th goal for Chievo. On 18 February, {{he was accused}} of being {{involved}} on the 2011–12 Italian football scandal, which affected his performance. Nevertheless, he also scored in consecutive matches against Fiorentina and Catania Calcio, and a brace in a 4–4 draw against Palermo. He scored 8 league goals in 35 appearances in the 2011–12 season, when he won his fourth Cangrande award. On 26 August 2012, in his 300th Serie A match for the gialloblù, he scored his first goal of five in his 24 appearances of the Serie A 2012–13 season. He also scored a goal on his sole match in Coppa Italia on 18 August 2012 during a 4–0 win over Ascoli.|$|E
2500|$|The first printed edition {{appeared}} in 1482 (based on Campanus of <b>Novara's</b> 1260 edition), {{and since then}} it has been translated into many languages and published in about a thousand different editions. Theon's Greek edition was recovered in 1533. In 1570, John Dee provided a widely respected [...] "Mathematical Preface", along with copious notes and supplementary material, to the first English edition by Henry Billingsley.|$|R
50|$|Male: Forewing very {{variable}} in shape, {{especially in the}} outline of the termen and dorsum. In the type it is comparatively long in proportion to width owing to the less convexity of the dorsal margin, and has the termen oblique, slightly convex; in var. <b>novarae</b> it is remarkably broad, the great convexity of the dorsal margin making it almost subquadrate, while the termen is more convex than in the typical form. In the female the difference is less marked.|$|R
50|$|Born in Rome, Lazio region, Vicari was {{a player}} of the reserve team of Apulian club Taranto in 2011-12 season. In summer 2012 Vicari became a player of <b>Novara's</b> reserve. Vicari also made his Serie B debut in the last round of 2012-13 Serie B. He became a regular member of the first team since 2013. He {{followed}} the club relegated to Lega Pro in 2014 as well as promoted back to Serie B in 2015. In 2015-16 Serie B he wore no.6 shirt.|$|R
5|$|In a {{supplementary}} OKW order dated 10 September 1943, Hitler decrees on {{the establishment}} of further Operational Zones in Northern Italy, which were the stretch {{all the way to}} the French border. Unlike Alpenvorland and Küstenland, these zones did not immediately receive high commissioners (oberster kommissar) as civilian advisors, but were military regions where the commander was to exercise power on behalf of Army Group B. Operation zone Nordwest-Alpen or Schweizer Grenze was located between the Stelvio Pass and Monte Rosa and was to contain wholly the Italian provinces of Sondrio and Como and parts of the provinces of Brescia, Varese, <b>Novara</b> and Vercelli. The zone of Französische Grenze was to encompass areas west of Monte Rosa and was to incorporate the province of Aosta and a part of the province of Turin, and presumably also the provinces of Cuneo and Imperia.|$|E
5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of <b>Novara</b> is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2016, Totti {{publicly}} criticised returning manager – and Rudi García's replacement – Luciano Spalletti in {{the media}} for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma's 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and {{in the media}}, while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired {{at the end of}} the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti. On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2–0, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4–0 aggregate loss. On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th minute and a penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3–2. With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history. Totti's double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola's previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with <b>Novara</b> on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.|$|E
50|$|Miramare Park, {{which at}} one time had no vegetation, and has now a surface area of 22 ha, stands on a rocky {{promontory}} overlooking the Adriatic Sea.The site was planned and arranged by Carl Junker, according to the wishes of Archduke Maximilian who carefully followed the building of his residence.As far as the botanical aspect was concerned, a gardener, Josef Laube, was called in but was replaced in 1859 by Anton Jelinek, a Bohemian who had taken part in the frigate <b>Novara's</b> expedition around the world.|$|R
5000|$|Rodríguez {{remained}} in the youth setup for 4 seasons. In 2006-07 season, he occasionally trained with first team and was awarded the no.39 shirt, by then Juventus coach Didier Deschamps. He also played at Campionato Nazionale Primavera before leaving on loan to Serie D side A.S.D. Cecina, where he was selected for the 2008 Torneo di Viareggio for Serie D selection. He scored 5 goals in 4 matches, which he scored a hat-trick against <b>Novara's</b> Berretti under-20 team [...] and two goals against Pakhtakor's youth team. With Cecina, he scored 1 goal in 10 appearances.|$|R
50|$|The popular {{republic}} {{established by}} the 1848 revolution was short-lived, its suppression leading to renewed Austrian rule. This came to a decisive end when Lombardy was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy 1859 {{as a result of}} the Second Italian Independence War. When annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1859 Lombardy achieved its present-day territorial shape by adding the Oltrepò Pavese (formerly the southern part of <b>Novara's</b> Province) to the province of Pavia. Starting from the late 19th century, and especially with the economic boom of the 1950s-1960s, Lombardy sharpened its status of richest and most industrialized region of Italy.|$|R
5|$|Up to the pontificate of Pope Alexander III (1159–1181), all the {{cardinals}} who were {{appointed to the}} external episcopal sees, resigned their membership in the College of Cardinals after receiving episcopal consecration, which clearly shows that the episcopate was considered a higher dignity than that of cardinal-priest or deacon. On the other hand, the bishops were never appointed cardinals. Certainly, the episcopate and cardinalate were considered incompatible dignities. However, during Alexander’s pontificate a change is apparent; although there were still the cases of {{the cardinals}} leaving the College of Cardinals after assuming episcopal office (Lombardo of Benevento, Rainaldo of Gaeta), there also appeared members of the College who were simultaneously cardinals and bishops. Perhaps Alexander III followed here an example of his rival, Antipope Victor IV, who in 1162 appointed Aicardo Cornazzano bishop of Parma and cardinal-priest. The first such instance in the legitimate obedience was Conrad of Wittelsbach, who was appointed cardinal-priest of S. Marcello in December 1165 and subsequently promoted to the suburbicarian see of Sabina, but continued to act also as archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop of Reims Guillaume aux Blanches Mains was named cardinal priest of S. Sabina in 1179, but retained archdiocese of Reims; similarly bishops Giovanni of Toscanella, Ruffino of Rimini and Gerardo of <b>Novara,</b> elevated to the cardinalate in 1189, 1190 and 1211 respectively. On the other hand, when cardinal-priest Uberto Crivelli was elected and consecrated archbishop of Milan in 1185, he retained his cardinalate and his Roman titulus (S. Lorenzo in Damaso). The posts of cardinal and bishop were no longer considered incompatible with each other. Moreover, the rank of cardinal-priest or cardinal-deacon became {{equal to that of}} bishop. However, it seems that the elected, but not yet consecrated, bishops who were appointed cardinals were generally obliged to resign their sees.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{was ordained}} in Constance, {{the seat of}} the local diocese, and he celebrated his first Mass in his hometown, Wildhaus, on 29 September 1506. As a young priest he had studied little theology, but this was not {{considered}} unusual at the time. His first ecclesiastical post was the pastorate of the town of Glarus, where he stayed for ten years. It was in Glarus, whose soldiers were used as mercenaries in Europe, that Zwingli became involved in politics. The Swiss Confederation was embroiled in various campaigns with its neighbours: the French, the Habsburgs, and the Papal States. Zwingli placed himself solidly {{on the side of the}} Roman See. In return, Pope Julius II honoured Zwingli by providing him with an annual pension. He took the role of chaplain in several campaigns in Italy, including the Battle of <b>Novara</b> in 1513. However, the decisive defeat of the Swiss in the Battle of Marignano caused a shift in mood in Glarus in favour of the French rather than the pope. Zwingli, the papal partisan, found himself in a difficult position and he decided to retreat to Einsiedeln in the canton of Schwyz. By this time, he had become convinced that mercenary service was immoral and that Swiss unity was indispensable for any future achievements. Some of his earliest extant writings, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), attacked the mercenary system using allegory and satire. His countrymen were presented as virtuous people within a French, imperial, and papal triangle. Zwingli stayed in Einsiedeln for two years during which he withdrew completely from politics in favour of ecclesiastical activities and personal studies.|$|E
25|$|Next, Parma {{travelled}} to relegation-threatened <b>Novara,</b> {{where they}} had never won in fifteen previous attempts. Parma had the better {{of the first half}} and perhaps should have twice opened the scoring earlier than they did through Graziano Pellè, but the goal did come on the half-hour mark when Biabiany slid the ball across the area to find <b>Novara</b> defender Matteo Centurioni, who put the ball his own net. <b>Novara</b> then came into the game and were rewarded after 70 minutes, when Raffaele Rubino scored a typical header from close range to become the first player to score goals in the top 4 levels of Italian football at the same club. <b>Novara</b> then doubled Parma's pain 8 minutes later with a Marco Rigoni header. A late Giuseppe Gemiti sending-off and a 200th Parma appearance for Hernán Crespo were not enough to give Parma a way back into the game, as <b>Novara</b> won their first match in nine.|$|E
60|$|I know, indeed, that sons of thine {{have died}} In Lissa's waters, by the mountain-side Of Aspromonte, on <b>Novara's</b> plain,-- Nor have thy {{children}} died for thee in vain: And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine, Thou hast not followed that immortal Star Which leads the people forth to deeds of war. Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep, As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep, Careless {{of all the}} hurrying hours that run, Mourning some day of glory, for the sun Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face, And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.|$|R
50|$|Walter III married Margaret, {{a sister}} of the ex-regent John of Ibelin and the regent of Cyprus, Philip. This brought him firmly into the Ibelin camp opposed to the {{influence}} of the queen's husband, the Emperor Frederick II. When the queen died in Italy on 25 April 1228, the Haute Cour (High Court) elected Walter and John to serve as c-bailiffs for the young king Conrad II, the emperor's son, but they refused. The honour instead went to Lord Balian of Sidon and Eudes de Montbéliard. According to the Gestes des Chiprois and Philip of <b>Novara's</b> history of Frederick's reign, Walter was one of the judges of the judicial duel between Amaury Barlais and Anceau de Brie, which took place in Cyprus before Frederick's arrival {{at the head of the}} Sixth Crusade.|$|R

25|$|With {{defensive}} leader Paletta suspended, Parma's second task in 4 {{days was}} {{the visit of}} <b>Novara,</b> whose relegation was all but confirmed.

5000|$|The chief {{primary source}} for the War is Philip of <b>Novara's</b> The Wars of Frederick II Against the Ibelins, which is a highly {{partisan}} account favouring the Ibelins. Philip was {{an active participant in}} and eyewitness of many of the events he describes. In the 1240s he was handsomely rewarded in money and fiefs by Alice. His Wars is generally trusted but is contained in a later compilation called Les gestes des Chiprois, and it is sometimes difficult to determine if a detail was amended by the compiler. His account, written contemporaneously with events, only covers the years 1228 - 33, 1236, and 1241 - 42. He wrote the last part of his account between 1242 and 1247, adding interpolations until as late as 1258. It is Philip that gives the name [...] "Longuebars" [...] (Lombards) to the imperialists.|$|R
500|$|During World War I, 78 T {{was used}} for convoy, escort, {{minesweeping}} tasks, anti-submarine operations and shore bombardment missions. She also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian Adriatic coast. On 24 May 1915, 78T and seven other 250t-class boats {{were involved in the}} shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the Bombardment of Ancona, with 78T involved in the shelling of Porto Corsini near Ravenna. In the latter action, an Italian [...] shore battery returned fire, hitting the scout cruiser [...] and damaging one of the other 250t-class boats. On 23 July, 78T and another 250t-class boat participated in a shore bombardment and landing operation led by <b>Novaras</b> sister ship [...] against San Benedetto del Tronto, Ortona and Termoli on the central Adriatic coast of Italy. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was 78 T. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.|$|R
500|$|About {{the same}} time, {{scholars}} in European universities began {{to address the}} implications of the rediscovered philosophy of Aristotle and astronomy of Ptolemy. [...] Both astronomical scholars and popular writers considered {{the implications of the}} nested sphere model for the dimensions of the universe. [...] Campanus of <b>Novara's</b> introductory astronomical text, the Theorica planetarum, used the model of nesting spheres to compute the distances of the various planets from the Earth, which he gave as 22,612 Earth radii or 73,387,747 100/660 miles. In his Opus Majus, Roger Bacon cited Al-Farghānī's distance to the stars of 20,110 Earth radii, or 65,357,700 miles, from which he computed the circumference of the universe to be 410,818,517 3/7 miles. [...] Clear evidence that this model was thought to represent physical reality is the accounts found in Bacon's Opus Majus of the time needed to walk to the Moon and in the popular Middle English South English Legendary, that it would take 8,000 years to reach the highest starry heaven. General understanding of the dimensions of the universe derived from the nested sphere model reached wider audiences through the presentations in Hebrew by Moses Maimonides, in French by Gossuin of Metz, and in Italian by Dante Alighieri.|$|R
