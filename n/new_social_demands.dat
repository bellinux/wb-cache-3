New forest legislation has also been developed in several countries in Western Europe in order to adapt its content to changing economic conditions, <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>demands</b> and more political participation of interest groups and citizens at local and regional levels.Economic and Social Context: The evolution of forest legislation in the European Countries indicates that understanding of how natural resources are to be used in a sustainable manner depends on a given economic and social context. The options that should remain open for the future, result from the changing perspectives and possibilities of different generations. The meaning of sustainable forestry is determined by local circumstances and their significance has considerably changed over time. Today sustainable management is understood as forestry practices which respect the naturally given potentials of the ecosystems and maintain the diversity of forests in their typical landscapes. They leave multiple options for an increasing production of wood, for protection of the environment and for recreation.1Regulation of Forest Uses: Public provisions referring to forest uses over more than one generation are probably among the oldest forms of long-term environmental policies. Customary law, codified already in the 14th century, regulated forest uses in accordance with the demands and options of their times. An increasing number of forest and timber ordinances, issued from the 16th century onward, followed. Meeting local needs, long-term availability of raw materials and energy, and increased outputs through better forestry practices were the issues at stake. Legislation established the requirement of a continuous flow of wood production, which meant stopping mere exploitation of what was available. It recognized the long-term nature of forests, and promoted the involvement of several generations in forestry activities. Increasingly it provided for planning and management, and for measures of regeneration and reforestation. Step-by-step forest laws introduced principles of renewable natural resources utilization as a requirement for sustainability as we understand it today.|$|E

PPPs suffer indeed from a lack of strategy-making and dynamism in public sector organizations: public action geared towards private business cooperation requires advanced accounting, management and steering skills that cannot be easily developed. Such issues match with the latest developments in the field of urban regeneration and represent a major stake for local governments. On the basis of empirical evidence from Italian urban regeneration projects, the paper highlights an actual paradox for urban policies. Even when favorable conditions for project management are met in the public sector, PPPs seem either unable to deliver innovative solutions or secure an actual, long term engagement of private and public resources...|$|R
