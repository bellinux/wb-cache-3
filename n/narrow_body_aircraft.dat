25|$|On November 6, 1996, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the re-branding to US Airways, the airline placed an order for up to 400 Airbus A320-series <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircraft,</b> with 120 firm orders {{at the time of}} the order signing. At the time, the order was regarded as the largest bulk aircraft request in history. In 1998, the airline followed with an order for up to 30 Airbus A330-series wide-body aircraft, with an initial firm order for seven of the Airbus A330-300 airliners. These orders enabled US Airways to replace its older aircraft with newer, more efficient aircraft, and it helped with the re-branding and repositioning efforts of US Airways.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, {{extension of}} the runway length from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel taxiway to a full parallel taxiway with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of taxiway fillets and shoulders to 30 metres.

40|$|Airline {{companies}} {{are in a}} high competition with the rising of demand {{in the direction of}} air travels, consequently this requires paying more attention about decreasing the turnaround time. Turnaround time falls out the time between two flights that include boarding the passengers to aircraft and settling them into their seats. Aircraft boarding is an important issue in airline operations because it affects directly turnaround time. Thus, airlines have been overrated to this problem. Up to now, reducing the boarding planning studies were tried for <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircrafts</b> with different strategies. In this study, it is considered double aisle layout and proposed a new strategy, elastically reverse pyramid to be inspired by reverse pyramid, to smooth out interferences among passengers. Customer satisfaction is the first objective of the strategy. A model by Arena is developed and determined block sizes and time intervals with the implementation of three destinations in eight consecutive weeks for each in with the help of data from Turkish Arilines. Initial results show that the new strategy performs high success about preventing the interferences between passengers...|$|R
40|$|The Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) arrival flows are an {{important}} component of overall NAS efficiency and airline costs of operation. The efficiency of TRACON arrival flows {{is a function of the}} relative position of the final waypoint on the Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR) to the runway threshold, the type of approach (ILS, RNP, VFR), and the arrival vertical and longitudinal profile. A previous research established the presence of 16 unique arrival flows for the main runways (31 C, 4 R, 22 L and 13 C) at Midway International Airport (MDW), using 43 days of National Offload Program (NOP) radar track data. This paper uses an aerodynamic fuel burn model to estimate the fuel burn for these flows. The results of the analysis indicate that, during Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), the RNP approach to 13 C uses an average of 14 % less fuel than the ILS approach on to 13 C. For <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> <b>aircrafts,</b> this is equivalent to on an average a savings of $ 47 per flight per approach (at $ 3 a gallon). During Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) the least average fuel burn arrival flow for VFR approach procedures is to runways 4 R or 31 C (174. 9 kg) followed by 13 C (+ 11 %), and 22 L (+ 19 %). During Instrument Meteorologica...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} design studies and wind tunnel tests of high aspect ratio {{supercritical}} wings {{suitable for a}} medium range, <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> transport <b>aircraft</b> flying near M= 0. 80 were presented. The basic characteristics of the wing design were derived from system studies of advanced transport aircraft where detailed structural and aerodynamic tradeoffs {{were used to determine}} the most optimum design from the standpoint of fuel usage and direct operating cost. These basic characteristics included wing area, aspect ratio, average thickness, and sweep. The detailed wing design was accomplished through application of previous test results and advanced computational transonic flow procedures. In addition to the basic wing/body development, considerable attention was directed to nacelle/plyon location effects, horizontal tail effects, and boundary layer transition effects. Results of these tests showed that the basic cruise performance objectives were met or exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Aviation is {{a growing}} {{industry}} with {{its own set of}} environmental impacts such as high altitude greenhouse gas emissions, use of nonrenewable fuels, and stresses to communities surrounding airports. The industry is under increasing pressure to address its impacts. One of the things that affects impacts is fleet composition. The current research mainly covers operational impacts of greenhouse gas and noise emissions of individual aircraft. In order to establish a relationship between the composition of aircraft fleets and environmental impacts, this thesis used four analyses. These analyses examined fuel consumption, exhaust emissions, noise emissions, and infrastructure congestion. A couple of generalized types of aircraft that were used for comparison were <b>narrow</b> versus wide <b>body</b> <b>aircraft</b> and newer versus older aircraft. It was found that older aircraft have larger environmental impacts, and the wide <b>body</b> <b>aircraft</b> do not always benefit from economies of scale in terms of environmental impacts. It was also found that airport size is more closely related to congestion than the type of route networks run from the given airport...|$|R

40|$|For {{the design}} of modern aircrafts {{passenger}} comfort plays an increasingly important role. For passenger thermal comfort the air velocity and temperature distribution is of utmost importance The development of numerical methods for these flows depends on the availibility of valuable and realistic test data. Characteristic for cabin flows is the superposition of natural convection due to various heat loads, like passengers or illumination and forced convection due to the ventilation system. In order to validate these effects the acquisition of full scale data is needed. In addition a realistic simulation of the passenger heat load {{that can be easily}} translated into a numerical model is needed. Since cabin airflow can be easily disturbed nonintrusive field measurements have to be used preferably. Therefore Mo et al. used Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a <b>narrow</b> <b>body</b> (737) <b>aircraft</b> cabin section on fields of view of 0. 61 m x 0. 61 m. To simulate the thermal presence of passengers he used thermal manikins with internal heat sources and heated cylinders respectively. As seeding he tested neutrally boyant helium filled soap bubbles, but decided to use hollow microspheres because it was inpractical to inject enough bubbles into the cabin to maintain an adequate seeding density without disrupting the airflow pattern...|$|R
40|$|The air {{transport}} industry has grown {{at an average}} annual rate of 9 % worldwide since 1960 {{and is expected to}} experience 5 % annual growth worldwide for the foreseeable future. Recently, this rapid growth has fueled concern about the contribution of aviation activities to global climate change. Governments, airlines and manufacturers are currently debating the feasibility and effectiveness of various strategies aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of aircraft emissions. Policy responses including the implementation of taxes, emissions trading schemes, environmental charges and voluntary agreements between airlines and governments are all being considered. In order to design effective approaches towards emissions reduction, {{there is a need to}} understand the mechanisms that have enabled historical improvements in aircraft efficiency. This thesis focuses on the impact regional aircraft have had on the efficiency of the U.
