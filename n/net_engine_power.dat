40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} effects of O 2 -enriched intake air on performance and NO emissions of a locomotive diesel engine. Parasitic power of the air separation membrane required to supply the O 2 -enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, gross and net power output of an engine operating under different levels of O 2 enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in 13 % increase in <b>net</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> when intake air with 28 vol% O 2 is used and fuel injection timing retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in only 4 % improvement in power. If part of the higher exhaust enthalpies from the O 2 enrichment is recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met. O 2 enrichment with its higher combustion temperatures reduces emissions of particulates and visible smoke but increases NO emissions (by up to 3 times at 26 % O 2 content). Therefore, exhaust gas after-treatment and heat recovery would be required if the full potential of O 2 enrichment for improving the performance of locomotive diesel engines is to be realized...|$|E

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} the effects of oxygen-enriched intake air on the performance and nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions of a locomotive diesel engine. The parasitic power of the air separation membrane required to supply the oxygen-enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, the gross and net power outputs of an engine operating under different levels of oxygen enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in an increase in <b>net</b> <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of approximately 13 % when intake air with an oxygen content of 28 % by volume is used and fuel injection timing is retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure improves power by only 4 %. If part of the significantly higher exhaust enthalpies available as a result of oxygen enrichment are recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met, resulting in substantial net power improvements. Oxygen enrichment reduces particulate and visible smoke emissions but increases NO emissions. However, a combination of retarded fuel injection timing and post-treatment of exhaust gases may be adequate to meet the locomotive diesel engine NO{sub x} standards. Exhaust gas after-treatment and heat recovery would be required to realize the full potential of oxygen enrichment. Economic analysis shows that oxygen-enrichment technology is economically feasible and provides high returns on investment. The study also indicates the strong influence of membrane parasitic requirements and exhaust energy recovery on economic benefits. To obtain an economic advantage while using a membrane with higher parasitic power requirements, it is necessary to recover a part of the exhaust energy...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{coupling}} of parabolic dish concentrator with air micro gas turbine <b>engine</b> (<b>net</b> <b>power</b> output equal to 32. 9 kWel). With {{the aim of}} increasing the conversion efficiency of the incoming solar radiation, a high temperature system (up to 1100 °C) has been considered: this solution implies {{the adoption of a}} ceramic expander coupled with a high temperature indirectly-irradiated solar receiver. A flexible Matlab® suite has been developed for the plant sizing and for the part-load simulation; in addition, the model is able to handle general solar field configurations through the computation of reciprocal shading effect. The obtained yearly sun-to-electric efficiency (26. 48 %) reveals the energetic advantage over other CSP technologies that can mitigate the technological issues and consequently higher investment cost, related to high operating temperatures. The potential of a hybrid version of the dish is also discussed...|$|R
25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of Atlantic Cod include <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. <b>Engine</b> <b>power</b> vessels had larger <b>nets,</b> larger <b>engines,</b> and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic Cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation conducted on the effect of exhaust-stack nozzle area, shape, and length on <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> jet thrust, and gain in <b>net</b> thrust (<b>engine</b> propeller plus jet). Single-cylinder engine data were obtained using three straight stacks 25, 44, and 108 inches in length; an S-shaped stack, a 90 degree bend, a 180 degree bend, and a short straight stack having a closed branch faired into it. Each stack was fitted with nozzles varying in exit area from 0. 91 square inch to the unrestricted area of the stack of 4. 20 square inches. The engine was generally operated over a range of engine speeds from 1300 to 2100 r. p. m, inlet-manifold pressures from 22 to 30 inches of mercury absolute, and a fuel-air ratio of 0. 08. The loss in <b>engine</b> <b>power,</b> the jet thrust, and the gain in net thrust are correlated in terms of several simple parameters.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} mathematical {{relationships that}} allow us to forecast the estimated main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of new container ships, based on data concerning vessels built in 2005 - 2015. The presented approximations allow us to estimate the <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> based on the length between perpendiculars and the number of containers the ship will carry. The approximations were developed using simple linear regression and multivariate linear regression analysis. The presented relations have practical application for estimation of container ship <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> needed in preliminary parametric design of the ship. It follows from the above that the use of multiple linear regression to predict the main <b>engine</b> <b>power</b> of a container ship brings more accurate solutions than simple linear regression...|$|R
