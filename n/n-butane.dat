25|$|In the {{fractionation}} section, alkylate {{is separated}} from excess isobutene and acid catalyst through distillation.

25|$|Butadiene {{can also}} be {{produced}} by the catalytic dehydrogenation of normal butane (<b>n-butane).</b> The first such post-war commercial plant, producing 65,000 tons per year of butadiene, began operations in 1957 in Houston, Texas. Prior to that, in the 1940s the Rubber Reserve Company, {{a part of the}} United States government, constructed several plants in Borger, TX, Toledo, OH, and El Segundo, CA to produce synthetic rubber for the war effort as part of the United States Synthetic Rubber Program. Total capacity was 68 KMTA (Kilo Metric Tons per Annum).|$|E
25|$|About 200,000 tonnes of {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{are produced}} annually. The {{most widely used}} industrial process involves the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. Ashland/ISP is one the biggest producers of this chemical route. The method {{is similar to the}} production of diethyl ether from ethanol. The butanediol is derived from condensation of acetylene with formaldehyde followed by hydrogenation. DuPont developed a process for producing THF by oxidizing <b>n-butane</b> to crude maleic anhydride, followed by catalytic hydrogenation. A third major industrial route entails hydroformylation of allyl alcohol followed by hydrogenation to the butanediol.|$|E
25|$|The olefin feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} butene, isobutene, and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The olefin feed {{is also likely}} to contain diluents (such as propane, <b>n-butane,</b> and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle have no effect on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst. They increase acid consumption and contribute to produce undesirable reaction products and increase polymer formation. Common contaminants are water, methanol and ethanol.|$|E

2500|$|Butane (...) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C4H10 {{that is an}} [...] alkane with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

Butanes are highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gases that quickly vaporize at room temperature.

2500|$|There {{is usually}} little need for alkanes to be {{synthesized}} in the laboratory, {{since they are}} usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction.

2500|$|A {{straight-chain}} alkane {{will have}} a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare isobutane (2-methylpropane) and <b>n-butane</b> (butane), which boil at −12 and 0°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58°C, respectively.

The USSRP constructed several plants in Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, LA; Houston, Baytown, and Port Neches, TX; and Torrance, CA. Total annual production was 275 KMTA.|$|E
