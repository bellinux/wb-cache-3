5000|$|Chemotherapy is the {{preferred}} secondary treatment after resection. The treatment kills astroblastoma cells left behind after surgery and induces a non-dividing, benign state for remaining tumor cells. Normally, chemotherapy is not recommended until the second required resection, implying that the astroblastoma is a high-grade tumor continuing to recur every few months. [...] A standard chemotherapy protocol starts with two rounds of <b>nimustine</b> hydrochoride (ACNU), etoposide, vincristine, and interferon-beta. [...] The patient undergoes a strict drug regimen until another surgery is required. By the third surgery, should recurrence in the astroblastoma occur, a six-round program of ifosfamide, cisplatin, and etoposide will [...] "shock" [...] the patient's system {{to the point where}} recurrence halts. [...] Unfortunately, chemotherapy may not always be successful with patients requiring further resection of the tumor, since the tumor cell begins to show superior vasculature and a strong likelihood of compromising a patient's well-being. Oral ingestion of temozolomide for at-home bedside use may be preferred by the patient.|$|E
40|$|Nitrosourea {{therapeutics}} {{occupies a}} definite place in cancer therapy but its exact {{mechanism of action}} {{has yet to be}} established. <b>Nimustine,</b> a chloroethyl nitrosourea derivative, is used to treat various types of malignancy including gliomas. The present work focuses on the understanding of <b>nimustine</b> interaction with DNA to delineate its mechanism at molecular level. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) has been used to determine the binding sites of <b>nimustine</b> on DNA. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy has been used to confirm conformational variations in DNA molecule upon nimustine-DNA interaction. Thermodynamic parameters of nimustine-DNA reaction have been calculated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Results of the present study demonstrate that <b>nimustine</b> is not a simple alkylating agent rather it causes major grove-directed-alkylation. Spectroscopic data suggest binding of <b>nimustine</b> with nitrogenous bases guanine (C 6 = O 6) and thymine (C 4 = O 4) in DNA major groove. CD spectra of nimustine-DNA complexes point toward the perturbation of native B-conformation of DNA and its partial transition into C-form. Thermodynamically, nimustine-DNA interaction is an entropy driven endothermic reaction, which suggests hydrophobic interaction of <b>nimustine</b> in DNA-major groove pocket. Spectral results suggest base binding and local conformational changes in DNA upon <b>nimustine</b> interaction. Investigation of drug-DNA interaction {{is an essential part of}} rational drug designing that also provides information about the drug's action at molecular level. Results, demonstrated here, may contribute in the development of new nitrosourea therapeutics with better efficacy and fewer side effects. Times Cited: 4 (fr...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Hereditary {{breast cancer}} is partly {{explained}} by germline mutations in BRCA 1 and BRCA 2. Although patients carry heterozygous mutations, their tumors have typically lost the remaining wild-type allele. Selectively targeting BRCA deficiency may therefore constitute an important therapeutic approach. Clinical trials applying this principle are underway, but it is unknown whether the compounds tested are optimal. It is therefore important to identify alternative compounds that specifically target BRCA deficiency and to test new combination therapies to establish optimal treatment strategies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We did a high-throughput pharmaceutical screen on BRCA 2 -deficient mouse mammary tumor cells and isogenic controls with restored BRCA 2 function. Subsequently, we validated positive hits in vitro and in vivo using mice carrying BRCA 2 -deficient mammary tumors. RESULTS: Three alkylators-chlorambucil, melphalan, and nimustine-displayed strong and specific toxicity against BRCA 2 -deficient cells. In vivo, these showed heterogeneous but generally strong BRCA 2 -deficient antitumor activity, with melphalan and <b>nimustine</b> doing better than cisplatin and the poly-(ADP-ribose) -polymerase inhibitor olaparib (AZD 2281) in this small study. In vitro drug combination experiments showed synergistic interactions between the alkylators and olaparib. Tumor intervention studies combining <b>nimustine</b> and olaparib resulted in recurrence-free survival exceeding 330 days in 3 of 5 animals tested. CONCLUSIONS: We generated and validated a platform for identification of compounds with specific activity against BRCA 2 -deficient cells that translates well to the preclinical setting. Our data call for the re-evaluation of alkylators, especially melphalan and <b>nimustine,</b> alone or {{in combination with the}} poly-(ADP-ribose) -polymerase inhibitors, for the treatment of breast cancers with a defective BRCA pathway...|$|E

The patient experienced general fatigue and bloody feces for 1 month before consulting a nearby clinic. Blood tests revealed anemia, and fecal occult blood was positive, but no abnormalities were detected using gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy or the skin of the entire body. Computed tomography images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvic region, and positron emission tomography–computed tomography images of the entire body revealed multiple nodules in the ileum, left mammary gland, left thyroid, right inguinal lymph node, and on the fascia of the right thoracic area and right buttocks. The tumor in the left mammary gland was excised and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the excised tissue was positive for HMB 45, melan-A, and MITF, but negative for S- 100 protein. Diagnosed with melanoma with multiple metastases, the patient underwent four cycles of dacarbazine, <b>nimustine</b> hydrochloride, and vincristine (DAV) plus interferon beta chemotherapy and one cycle of dacarbazine, <b>nimustine</b> hydrochloride, cisplatin, and tamoxifen (DAC-Tam) chemotherapy. Two series of embolizations of the artery feeding the ileum tumors, as well as a series of plasma and red blood cell transfusions, were performed for ileum tumor hemorrhage.

40|$|AbstractTo {{counteract}} genotoxic stress, DNA repair {{functions are}} in effect. Most {{of them are}} constitutively expressed while some {{of them can be}} up-regulated depending on the level of DNA damage. In human cells, only few DNA repair functions are subject of induction following DNA damage, and thus {{there is a need to}} identify and characterize inducible repair functions more thoroughly. Here, we provide evidence that the “three prime exonuclease I” (TREX 1) is up-regulated in human fibroblasts and cancer cells on mRNA and protein level. Transcriptional upregulation of TREX 1 was observed upon exposure to ultraviolet light and various anticancer drugs in glioma and malignant melanoma cells. Induction of TREX 1 was found following treatment with the crosslinking alkylating agents <b>nimustine,</b> carmustine, fotemustine and the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, but not following temozolomide, etoposide and ionizing radiation. Induction of TREX 1 following DNA damage requires the AP- 1 components c-Jun and c-Fos, as shown by siRNA knockdown, EMSA experiments, ChIP analysis and reporter assays with the TREX 1 promoter and constructs harboring mutations in the AP- 1 binding site. To analyze whether TREX 1 expression impacts the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutics, TREX 1 expression was down-regulated by siRNA in malignant glioma and melanoma cells. TREX 1 knockdown resulted in enhanced cell death following <b>nimustine,</b> fotemustine and topotecan and to a reduced recovery from the anticancer drug induced block to replication. The data revealed that induction of TREX 1 is a survival response evoked by various genotoxic anticancer drugs and identified TREX 1 as a potential therapeutic target for anticancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|First line {{chemotherapeutics}} for {{brain tumors}} (malignant gliomas) are alkylating agents such as temozolomide and <b>nimustine.</b> Despite growing {{knowledge of how}} these agents work, patients suffering from this malignancy still face a dismal prognosis. Alkylating agents target DNA, forming the killing lesion O 6 -alkylguanine, which is converted into DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) that trigger apoptosis. Here we assessed whether inhibiting repair of DSBs by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a reasonable strategy for sensitizing glioma cells to alkylating agents. For down-regulation of HR in glioma cells, we used an interference RNA (iRNA) approach targeting Rad 51 and BRCA 2, and for NHEJ we employed the DNA-PK inhibitor NU 7026. We also assessed whether inhibition of poly(ADP) ribosyltransferase (PARP) by olaparib would enhance the killing effect. The data show that knockdown of Rad 51 or BRCA 2 greatly sensitizes cells to DSBs and the induction of cell death following temozolomide and <b>nimustine</b> (ACNU). It did not sensitize to ionizing radiation (IR). The expression of O 6 -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) abolished all these effects, indicating that O 6 -alkylguanine induced by these drugs is the primary lesion responsible {{for the formation of}} DSBs and increased sensitivity of glioma cells following knockdown of Rad 51 and BRCA 2. Inhibition of DNA-PK only slightly sensitized to temozolomide whereas a significant effect was observed with IR. A triple strategy including siRNA and the PARP inhibitor olaparib further improved the killing effect of temozolomide. The data provides evidence that downregulatio...|$|E

Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic targets and effective treatment strategies is essential. <b>Nimustine</b> hydrochloride (ACNU) is widely used as the standard chemotherapeutic agent and is frequently administered together with other chemotherapeutic agents in clinical studies. Curcumin, a natural polyphenolic compound, could potentially be combined with chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment; however, there are no reports of studies where ACNU and curcumin were combined for GBM treatment, and the mechanisms underlying their activity remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the effects of combined treatment with curcumin and ACNU on GBM cells and found that it significantly enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. In addition, co-treatment with curcumin increased ACNU-induced apoptosis through enhancing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. Further, curcumin and ACNU acted synergistically in their antitumor effects by targeting N-cadherin/MMP 2 / 9, PI 3 K/AKT, and NF-κB/COX- 2 signaling. These results indicate that curcumin can enhance the anti-proliferation, anti-migration, and proapoptotic activities of ACNU against GBM, and provide strong evidence that combined treatment with curcumin and ACNU {{has the potential to be}} an effective therapeutic option for GBM.

Knockdown of FRA 1 by either siRNA or shRNA clearly sensitized glioma cells towards ACNU-induced cell death. Despite decreased AP- 1 binding activity upon FRA 1 knockdown, this effect is independent on regulation of the AP- 1 target genes fasL, ercc 1 and xpf. In addition, FRA 1 knockdown does not affect DNA repair capacity.

However, FANCG and FANCD 1 /BRCA 2 played notably important roles in the repair of TMZ-induced DNA damage. The most effective molecular target correlating with cellular sensitivity to both ACNU and TMZ was FANCD 1 /BRCA 2. In addition, it was found that FANCD 1 /BRCA 2 small interference RNA efficiently enhanced cellular sensitivity toward ACNU and TMZ in human glioblastoma A 172 cells. These findings suggest that the down-regulation of FANCD 1 /BRCA 2 might be an effective strateg...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Only a few {{previous}} studies have demonstrated an association between resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and thyroid cancer. The current study presents {{the case of a}} 67 -year-old female who was referred to the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University with an enlargement of the neck that had grown gradually over two years and subsequently, rapidly enlarged over the two months prior to admission, alongside a slight sensation of shortness of breath. Laboratory data revealed a significantly increased level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total triiodothyronine, total thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyro-protein and thyroglobulin antibody; however, the levels of thyroperoxidase and TSH receptor antibody were within the normal ranges. A thyroid hormone suppression test revealed a TSH reduction of 32 %, Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland was negative for abnormalities. The patient's thyroid pathology revealed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thyroid. CHOP + <b>nimustine</b> chemotherapy significantly reduced the clinical symptoms. The genetic analysis revealed a novel point mutation of the thyroid hormone receptor β (THRB) gene in exon 10 (g 1680 G to A) in the 3 '-untranslated region of the patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of RTH with thyroid non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which involved a mutation (g 1680 G to A) in exon 10 of THRB...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-two {{patients}} with extensive small lung cancer entered {{a study of}} cyclic alternating combination chemotherapy between February 1981 and December 1984. The chemotherapy consisted of a four-drug combination of cyclophosphamide (CPA), vincristine (VCR), methotrexate (MTX) and procarbazine (PCZ), and a three-drug combination of etoposide (VP- 16), adriamycin (ADM) and <b>nimustine</b> hydrochloride (ACNU). The doses and schedule were as follows: CPA, 270 mg/㎡, i. v., day 1 - 5; VCR, 1. 4 mg/㎡, i. v., day 1; MTX, 6. 5 mg/㎡, i. m., day 1 - 5; PCZ, 65 mg/㎡, p. o., day 1 - 5; VP- 16, 140 mg/㎡, p. o., day 29 - 32; ADM, 40 mg/㎡, i. v., day 29; ACNU, 40 mg/㎡, i. v., day 29. Cycles were repeated every 8 weeks. Of 52 patients, 45 were fully evaluated for tumor response and toxicity. The overall response rate was 89 %, and the complete response rate was 33 %. The median survival time of all the patients who could be evaluated was 11. 0 months: 16. 5 months for complete responders, 10. 0 months for partial responders, and 6. 5 months for non-responders. Responders lived significantly longer than non-responders. The major toxicity was myelosuppression. However, patients tolerated the chemotherapy well, and no patients encountered life-threatening complications. The cyclic alternating chemotherapy appears beneficial compared to the four-drug combination of CPA, VCR, MTX and PCZ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{presence}} of an oligodendroglial component within a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is considered a prognostically favorable factor, but the clinical outcome of patients with glioblastoma multiforme with oligodendroglial component (GBMO) after combined post-operative radiotherapy and chemotherapy has rarely been reported. Methods We analyzed overall and progression-free survival {{in a group of}} ten consecutive patients initially diagnosed with GBMO between 1996 and 2004 (4. 2 % of all GBM patients). Median (range) age was 54 (34 – 73) years, 90 % were resected and median radiotherapy dose was 54 (45 – 60. 6) Gy. 80 % of patients received post-operative chemotherapy with <b>nimustine</b> (ACNU) and VM 26 (teniposide) for a median of 3. 5 (1 – 6) cycles, the remainder were treated with post-operative radiotherapy alone. All specimens were reviewed by an experienced neuropathologist. Results Neuropathological re-evaluation revealed GBM with an oligodendroglial component of 30 % or less in five cases, predominant oligoastrocytic tumors with focal areas of GBM in four patients and WHO grade III oligoastrocytoma with questionable transition to GBM in one patient. Four of ten patients were alive at at 40, 41, 41 and 82 months. The median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 26 months, the 2 -year survival rate was 60 % (progression-free survival: 9. 8 months and 40 %, respectively). Conclusion In conclusion, patients with GBMO treated with post-operative radiotherapy and chemotherapy with ACNU/VM 26 had a better prognosis than reported for GBM in modern chemoradiation series. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{effectiveness}} of chest irradiation in addition to intensive chemotherapy {{in the treatment of}} limited stage small cell lung cancer, 56 patients were randomized to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus chest irradiation, between April 1981 and September 1986. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of a four-drug combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate and procarbazine, and a three-drug combination of VP- 16, adriamycin and <b>nimustine,</b> given alternately every 8 weeks. One group of 28 patients received chemotherapy alone, and another group of 28 patients received chest irradiation of 40 Gy, in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, between cycles 1 and 2 of the chemotherapy. Complete response rate were similar in the two groups; 46 % for those receiving chemotherapy alone, and 62 % for those receiving chemotherapy plus chest irradiation. There {{was no significant difference in}} the median survival time (14. 5 months for chemotherapy alone versus 12. 0 months for chemotherapy plus chest irradiation). The combined modality treatment was more toxic than chemotherapy alone; two patients receiving such treatment died of radiation pneumonitis. However, as far as the 3 -year survival rate, there was a trend favoring patients receiving the combined modality treatment (11 % versus 19 %). Although additional studies are required to determine the optimal dose and schedule, timing, and selection of patients as for chest irradiation, the major need for the treatment of small cell lung cancer is better systemic chemotherapy. It seems likely that the role of chest irradiation will become more important as improved chemotherapy is developed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although BRCA 1 -deficient {{tumors are}} {{extremely}} sensitive to DNA-damaging drugs and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, recurrences do occur and, consequently, resistance to therapy remains a serious clinical problem. To study the underlying mechanisms, we induced therapy resistance in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of BRCA 1 - mutated and BRCA 1 -methylated triple-negative breast cancer. Methods: A cohort of 75 mice carrying BRCA 1 -deficient breast PDX tumors {{was treated with}} cisplatin, melphalan, <b>nimustine,</b> or olaparib, and treatment sensitivity was determined. In tumors that acquired therapy resistance, BRCA 1 expression was investigated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. Next-generation sequencing, methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and Target Locus Amplification (TLA) -based sequencing {{were used to determine}} mechanisms of BRCA 1 re-expression in therapy-resistant tumors. Results: BRCA 1 protein was not detected in therapy-sensitive tumors but was found in 31 out of 42 resistant cases. Apart from previously described mechanisms involving BRCA 1 -intragenic deletions and loss of BRCA 1 promoter hypermethylation, a novel resistance mechanism was identified in four out of seven BRCA 1 -methylated PDX tumors that re-expressed BRCA 1 but retained BRCA 1 promoter hypermethylation. In these tumors, we found de novo gene fusions that placed BRCA 1 under the transcriptional control of a heterologous promoter, resulting in re-expression of BRCA 1 and acquisition of therapy resistance. Conclusions: In addition to previously described clinically relevant resistance mechanisms in BRCA 1 -deficient tumors, we describe a novel resistance mechanism in BRCA 1 -methylated PDX tumors involving de novo rearrangements at the BRCA 1 locus, demonstrating that BRCA 1 -methylated breast cancers may acquire therapy resistance via both epigenetic and genetic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) on the survival of C 57 mice implanted with GL 261 gliomas after chemotherapy with <b>nimustine</b> (ACNU). Methods Forty adult male C 57 mice were divided into four groups: control, HBO, ACNU and HBO + ACNU randomly by SPSS 10, and planted with GL 261 glioma cell suspension in their caudate nucleus to form tumors. From the 7 th day after implantation, these groups (except control group) began to receive different treatments (HBO, ACNU and HBO + ACNU), in order to observe the effects of different treatments on the survival time of tumor bearing mice. Results There {{were no significant differences}} in the tumor volume, mass effect, severe compression of normal brain tissue and midline shift (F = 0. 602, P = 0. 618). The average survival time was significant with one-way ANOVA (F = 12. 177, P = 0. 000) and with the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of log-rank (χ 2 = 13. 604, P = 0. 003), while multiple comparisons between groups showed HBO (χ 2 = 0. 365, P = 0. 546) and single?time ACNU (χ 2 = 0. 884, P = 0. 347) had no effect on the survival of mice; the effect of HBO + ACNU (χ 2 = 9. 962, P = 0. 002) was better than that of HBO (χ 2 = 6. 925, P = 0. 008) and single-time ACNU (χ 2 = 7. 152, P = 0. 007). Conclusion The HBO had no effect on survival time of C 57 mice with implantation of GL 261 and could not promote the growth of the GL 261 glioma. However, combining the treatment with ACNU could extend the survival time of tumor bearing mice, suggesting that HBO could strengthen the therapeutic effects of ACNU...|$|E
40|$|Chloroethylnitrosoureas (CENUs), {{which are}} bifunctional alkylating agents {{widely used in}} the {{clinical}} treatment of cancer, exert anticancer activity by inducing crosslink within a guanine-cytosine DNA base pair. However, the formation of dG-dC crosslinks can be prevented by O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), ultimately leading to drug resistance. Therefore, the level of AGT expression {{is related to the}} formation of dG-dC crosslinks and the sensitivity of cells to CENUs. In this work, we determined the CENU-induced dG-dC crosslink in mouse L 1210 leukemia cells and in human glioblastoma cells (SF- 763, SF- 767 and SF- 126) containing different levels of AGT using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicate that <b>nimustine</b> (ACNU) induced more dG-dC crosslinks in L 1210 leukemia cells than those induced by carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and fotemustine (FTMS). This result was consistent with a previously reported cohort study, which demonstrated that ACNU had a better survival gain than BCNU, CCNU and FTMS for patients with high-grade glioma. Moreover, we compared the crosslinking levels and the cytotoxicity in SF- 763, SF- 767 and SF- 126 cells with different AGT expression levels after exposure to ACNU. The levels of dG-dC crosslink in SF- 126 cells (low AGT expression) were significantly higher than those in SF- 767 (medium AGT expression) and SF- 763 (high AGT expression) cells at each time point. Correspondingly, the cytotoxicity of SF- 126 was the highest followed by SF- 767 and SF- 763. The results obtained in this work provided unequivocal evidence for drug resistance to CENUs induced by AGT-mediated repair of DNA ICLs. We postulate that the level of dG-dC crosslink {{has the potential to be}} employed as a biomarker for estimating drug resistance and anticancer efficiencies of novel CENU chemotherapies...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a phase II trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy immediately after hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) with chemotherapy in adults with high-grade gliomas. Patients with histologically confirmed high-grade gliomas were administered radiotherapy in daily 2 [*]Gy fractions for 5 consecutive days per week up to a total dose of 60 [*]Gy. Each fraction was administered immediately after HBO with {{the period of time}} from completion of decompression to irradiation being less than 15 [*]min. Chemotherapy consisted of procarbazine, <b>nimustine</b> (ACNU) and vincristine and was administered during and after radiotherapy. A total of 41 patients (31 patients with glioblastoma and 10 patients with grade 3 gliomas) were enrolled. All 41 patients were able to complete a total radiotherapy dose of 60 [*]Gy immediately after HBO with one course of concurrent chemotherapy. Of 30 assessable patients, 17 (57 %) had an objective response including four CR and 13 PR. The median time to progression and the median survival time in glioblastoma patients were 12. 3 months and 17. 3 months, respectively. On univariate analysis, histologic grade (P= 0. 0001) and Karnofsky performance status (P= 0. 036) {{had a significant impact on}} survival, and on multivariate analysis, histologic grade alone was a significant prognostic factor for survival (P= 0. 001). Although grade 4 leukopenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 10 and 7 % of all patients, respectively, these were transient with no patients developing neutropenic fever or intracranial haemorrhage. No serious nonhaematological or late toxicities were seen. These results indicated that radiotherapy delivered immediately after HBO with chemotherapy was safe with virtually no late toxicity in patients with high-grade gliomas. Further studies are required to strictly evaluate the effectiveness of radiotherapy after HBO for these tumours...|$|E
