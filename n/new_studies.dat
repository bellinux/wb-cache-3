EPA incorporated comments and data from <b>new</b> <b>studies.</b> Using a 30-year time horizon and a 0% discount rate, EPA concluded that multiple biofuels would meet this standard.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with {{women of childbearing age}} and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often in the form of Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contributor}} to the critical oblivion was the loss of archival documents or, indeed, the artwork itself, often dismembered if not destroyed. Only {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century, supported by <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> and the rediscovery of archival sources, has the mastery of Gasparo Cairano been revealed. While a catalog of his works of art has been reconstructed within the framework of the Renaissance in Brescia, the full story still suffers from gaps and there are still events to be clarified.|$|E

5|$|Whales were {{historically}} {{common in}} continental and marginal waters such as Hallaniyat Islands, along Indian coasts, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden and recent migrations {{into the gulf}} including by cow-calf pairs. It is unknown whether whales seen in the Red Sea originate in this population, however sightings increased since in 2006 even {{in the northern part}} of the sea such as in Gulf of Aqaba. Individuals may reach the Maldives, Sri Lanka, or further east. Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into Persian Gulf, however <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> indicate more regular presences can be expected.|$|E
5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix is derived from the two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix is derived from the urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium is derived from the paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. <b>New</b> <b>studies</b> show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|TCDD was {{classified}} in 1997 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies {{available for the}} classification, the risk, even at very high exposures, was weak and borderline detectable. Therefore, human data were not deemed sufficient, and the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This has been criticized as a deviation from IARC classification rules. It is much debated whether TCDD is carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. Moreover, a recent review concludes that, after 1997, further studies do not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. <b>New</b> <b>studies</b> include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Ranch Hand operation, which concluded that after 30 years the results do not provide evidence of disease.|$|E

Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom, 1750–1925 (1976), and Lawrence W. Levine's Black Culture and Black Consciousness: Afro-American Folk Thought from Slavery to Freedom (1977). One of the more controversial of these studies was John W. Blassingame's The Slave Community.|$|E

25|$|An often quoted reason {{focuses on}} the {{attitude}} of the Judenrat, and of its leader in the period prior to the deportations, the chief rabbi Zvi Koretz, has been heavily criticized. He was accused of having responded passively to the Nazis and downplayed the fears of Jews when their transfer to Poland was ordered. As an Austrian citizen and therefore a native German speaker, he was thought to be well-informed. Koretz has also been accused of having knowingly collaborated with the occupiers. However, several <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> tend to diminish his role in the deportations.|$|E
25|$|Previously, palaeontologists {{had thought}} there were {{multiple}} exchanges of tyrannosauroids between Asia and North America, with various forms moving between the continents via what is now Alaska and the Bering Strait into northern Russia. <b>New</b> <b>studies</b> have disrupted that hypothesis. It has been recently suggested {{that almost all of}} the Asian tyrannosauroids were part of one evolutionary lineage. It is now thought that there were separate evolutionary radiations in North America of northern and southern tyrannosaurids, with Lythronax being placed as part of the southern group. Research on UMNH VP 16690 supports that theory.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} and very popular theory states that lifespan can be lengthened by a tight budget for food energy called caloric restriction. Caloric restriction observed in many animals (most notably mice and rats) shows a near doubling of life span {{from a very}} limited calorific intake. Support for the theory has been bolstered by several <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> linking lower basal metabolic rate to increased life expectancy. That {{is the key to}} why animals like giant tortoises can live so long. Studies of humans with life spans of at least 100 have shown a link to decreased thyroid activity, resulting in their lowered metabolic rate.|$|E

25|$|Introduction of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes into}} rapidly dividing cells has been thought {{to slow down}} or arrest tumor growth. Adenoviruses are a commonly utilized vector for this purpose. Much {{research has focused on}} the use of adenoviruses that cannot reproduce, or reproduce only to a limited extent, within the patient to ensure safety via the avoidance of cytolytic destruction of noncancerous cells infected with the vector. However, <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> focus on adenoviruses that can be permitted to reproduce, and destroy cancerous cells in the process, since the adenoviruses' ability to infect normal cells is substantially impaired, potentially resulting in a far more effective treatment.|$|E
25|$|As {{mandated}} by law, {{and in order}} to establish the fuel category for each biofuel, EPA included in its modeling direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as emissions from land use changes related to the full lifecycle. EPA's modeling of specific fuel pathways incorporated comments received through the third-party peer review process, and data and information from <b>new</b> <b>studies</b> and public comments. EPA's analysis determined that both ethanol produced from corn starch and biobutanol from corn starch comply with the 20% GHG emission reduction threshold required to classify as a renewable fuel. EISA grandfathered existing U.S. corn ethanol plants, and only requires the 20% reduction in life cycle GHG emissions for any renewable fuel produced at new facilities that commenced construction after December 19, 2007.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, 2010, EPA {{finalized}} the Renewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2) for 2010 and beyond. EPA incorporated {{direct emissions}} and significant indirect emissions such as emissions from land use changes along with comments and data from <b>new</b> <b>studies.</b> Adopting a 30-year time horizon and a 0% discount rate EPA declared that ethanol produced from corn starch {{at a new}} (or expanded capacity from an existing) natural gas-fired facility using approved technologies would be considered {{to comply with the}} 20% GHG emission reduction threshold. Given average production conditions it expected for 2022, EPA estimated that corn ethanol would reduce GHGs an average of 21% compared to the 2005 gasoline baseline. A 95% confidence interval spans a 7-32% range reflecting uncertainty in the land use change assumptions.|$|E
