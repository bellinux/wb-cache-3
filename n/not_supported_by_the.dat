Only one western monarch {{attended}} the Council, the elderly James I of Aragon, who could only offer a small force.

Unlike its predecessor and successor citadels, it was not meant as a defence against external threat, but rather to oversee the inhabited Jewish parts of the city, a role incompatible with a proposed northern location.|$|E
5|$|The 1879 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1879 college football season. The team {{was the first}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as it was entirely student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played just a single game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Naval Academy's faculty. The school would not have another football squad until 1882.|$|E

5|$|The 1882 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1882 college football season. The team {{was the second}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy, and the first since 1879. The team was coached by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and was entirely student-operated. It was captained by squad member Alex Jackson. The team played just a single game, an 8 to 0 (8–0) shutout of Johns Hopkins, which was the school's first ever win. The squad was entirely student operated, and was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Naval Academy's faculty.

5|$|The Triangle Link {{was passed}} by the various {{municipal}} councils in February and March 1988. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated. During late 1989, advance tolling on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> national government and the issue placed on hold.|$|E

5|$|The naval {{component}} of the F-FDTL was established in December 2001 when Portugal transferred two small Albatroz-class patrol boats from the Portuguese Navy. Its establishment was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> King's College study team, the UN, or East Timor's other donor countries {{on the grounds that}} East Timor could not afford to operate a naval force. The role of the naval component is to conduct fishery and border protection patrols and ensure that the maritime line of communication to the Oecussi enclave remains open. All of the force's warships are based at Hera Harbour, which is located a few kilometres east of Dili. Under the Force 2020 plan the naval component may eventually be expanded to a light patrol force equipped with corvette-sized ships and landing craft.|$|E
5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff, it was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British leadership {{did not want the}} BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured {{by the time they were}} complete.|$|E
5|$|Young et al. (2012) used biomechanical {{modelling}} {{to examine the}} performance of the diplodocine skull. It was concluded that the proposal that its dentition was used for bark-stripping was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> data, which showed that under that scenario, the skull and teeth would undergo extreme stresses. The hypotheses of branch-stripping and/or precision biting were both shown to be biomechanically plausible feeding behaviors. Diplodocine teeth were also continually replaced throughout their lives, usually in less than 35 days, as was discovered by Michael D'Emic et al. Within each tooth socket, as many as five replacement teeth were developing to replace the next one. Studies of the teeth also reveal that it preferred different vegetation from the other sauropods of the Morrison, such as Camarasaurus. This may have better allowed the various species of sauropods to exist without competition.|$|E

5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> DS and DS Lite. Up to six wireless Internet connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} {{began the}} election by meeting and voting {{once a day}} in the Episcopal Palace in Viterbo, before returning to their respective residences; tradition dictated that the election should take place in the city where the previous pope died, if the late pontiff had died outside Rome. There is little reliable data about the candidates proposed during almost three years of deliberations; certainly cardinals Odo of Châteauroux, John of Toledo, Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, Ottaviano Ubaldini, Riccardo Annibadi and Ottobono Fieschi were counted among papabili. According to later accounts, <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> contemporary sources, after two months, the cardinals nearly elected Philip Benizi, general of the Servite Order, who had come to Viterbo to admonish the cardinals, but fled to prevent his election. Also the candidature of Saint Bonaventure had allegedly been proposed. Modern scholars treat these accounts with scepticism, considering them as products of invention of the hagiographers of these two saints. Charles of Anjou was in Viterbo for the entirety of the election; Philip III of France visited the city in March 1271.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} results were produced in western Slavonia, where Croatian forces began pushing the JNA away from Grubišno Polje towards Lipik on 31 October, {{and away from}} Nova Gradiška towards Okučani on 12 November. In mid-November, another push along the NovskaOkučani axis recaptured several villages by 9 December, while Lipik was recaptured by the Croatian forcesnow renamed the HVon 7 December. The mountains of Papuk and Bilogora, north of Pakrac where the Croatian Serb militia was <b>not</b> <b>supported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> JNA, were brought under Croatian control in the same period. A HV offensive to recapture the Okučani area, codenamed Operation Orkan 91, commenced {{in the final days}} of December. The area was attacked from the directions of Pakrac, Novska and Nova Gradiška. The effort made no progress except west of Nova Gradiškabut even there it was very limited. Under international pressure, Tuđman called off the offensive on 26 December.|$|E
