This typically occurs {{on both sides of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Beach was {{chartered}} as {{a municipal}} corporation by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963. The city currently operates under the council–manager form of government. The city does <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> {{under the jurisdiction}} of a county government, due to state law. Rather, it functions as an independent city and operates as a political subdivision of the state.|$|E
5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did {{not share}} a united {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted to ensure the magazine did <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> afoul of the colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government. However, writings falling under various parts the political spectrum were published, including works by cultural nationalists, a sonnet dedicated to Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg, and notes on fascism.|$|E

5|$|A prophecy {{says that}} Troy will <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> if Troilus lives into adulthood. So the goddess Athena {{encourages}} the Greek warrior Achilles to seek him out {{early in the}} Trojan War. The youth is known to take great delight in his horses. Achilles ambushes him and his sister Polyxena when he has ridden with her for water from a well in the Thymbra – an area outside Troy {{where there is a}} temple of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|As {{each region}} {{has its own}} {{traditional}} pattern, batiks are commonly distinguished by the region they originated in, such as batik Solo, batik Pekalongan, and batik Madura. Batiks from Java can be distinguished by their general pattern and colours into batik pedalaman (inland batik) or batik pesisir (coastal batik). Batiks which do <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> neatly {{into one of these}} two categories are only referred to by their region. A mapping of batik designs from all places in Indonesia depicts the similarities and reflects cultural assimilation within batik designs.|$|E

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|In November 1878, the Grand Ducal {{household}} {{fell ill}} with diphtheria. Alice's eldest daughter Victoria {{was the first}} to fall ill, complaining of a stiff neck in the evening of 5 November. Diphtheria was diagnosed the following morning, and soon the disease spread to Alice's children Alix, Marie, Irene, and Ernest. Her husband Louis became infected shortly thereafter. Elisabeth was the only child to <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> ill, having been sent away by Alice to the palace of the Princess Charles, her mother-in-law.|$|E

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> apart during the cooking process.|$|E

By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent to landfill in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E

Tolokonnikova subsequently filed an appeal with the Zubovo-Polyansky District Court in Mordovia, where she was imprisoned, and Alyokhina with the Berezniki District Court in Perm. Alyokhina's appeal was rejected on January 16, 2013, the judge stating that the presence of her child was already taken into account during her original sentence.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, his sons, {{and other}} Confederate {{soldiers}} encountered Union Army cavalry along Grassy Lick Run south of Romney on April 24, 1862. Parsons carried a double-barreled shotgun, {{and proceeded to}} fire his weapon at the Union forces at close range. As Parsons made his escape from the Union Army forces, he saw his son fired upon as he ran across the road, and supposed he had been killed. He traveled {{to the home of}} a Mr.Hott, and told him of the news of his son's possible death. Parsons became pale and was helped down from his horse by Hott's sons, so he would <b>not</b> <b>fall.</b> According to Hott, Parsons died moments later.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line for another day, such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would <b>not</b> <b>fall</b> into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E
