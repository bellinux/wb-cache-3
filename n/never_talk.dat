5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Cope's {{relations}} with Marsh {{turned into a}} competition for fossils between the two, known today as the Bone Wars. The conflict's seeds began upon the men's return to the United States in the 1860s. Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site. Marsh went behind Cope's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees: any fossils that Vorhees's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven. When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope's fossil finds—a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur, Elasmosaurus, that had four flippers and a long neck—he commented that the fossil's head was on the wrong end, evidently stating that Cope had put the skull {{at the end of}} the vertebrae of the tail. Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right. Leidy came, picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end. Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society. He immediately tried to buy back the copies, but some remained with their buyers (Marsh and Leidy kept theirs). The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover-up at the next society meeting, not to alienate Cope, but only in response to Cope's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong. Cope and Marsh would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> to each other amicably again, and by 1873, open hostility had broken out between them.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} him to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> to his parents again for what they made him say.

The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E
500|$|... "Angel of Death" [...] caused outrage among Holocaust survivors, as well {{as their}} {{families}} and the general public. The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, or do you think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> them out of it." ...|$|E

[...] Later that week, they go out to dinner, but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman.

500|$|The People v. Jackson {{trial began}} in Santa Maria, California, on January 31, 2005. During the trial, the judge allowed {{testimony}} about past allegations, including the 1993 case, to establish whether the defendant had a propensity to commit certain crimes. However, Jordan Chandler {{had left the}} country to avoid testifying. In a lecture at Harvard after the trial, Thomas Mesereau said, [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get him}} to show up and he wouldn't. If he had, I had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] June Chandler testified that she had npt spoken to her son in 11 years. At one point in her testimony, she claimed that she could not remember being sued by Jackson (who had counter-sued for extortion) and at another point said that she had never heard of her own attorney. However, she said she never witnessed any molestation.|$|E

The latter is, in fact, a continuation of a running gag in the original 1960s series, in which Terry was paranoid about being thought weedy.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} Austin {{politicians}} and politicos have expressed sorrow at Gale's death. Marti Bier, a policy aide for the Austin City council member Randi Shade, directly attributed Gale's {{death to the}} Salvation Army, saying, [...] "Something Jennifer would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> about, but was a reality for her, {{is that she is}} a transwoman living in a transphobic society. Homelessness in the trans-community is a really big problem, and one that goes ignored. There are no laws in Texas protecting transgender people, whether from job discrimination, housing discrimination or hate crimes," [...] and [...] "The Salvation Army would not let her in there unless she was grouped with the men. They would make her use her male birth name and completely disregard, and disrespect, her identity as a trans-woman." [...] The Burnt Orange Report blog posted a reflective essay on her life along with photos and a plea to support homelessness.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to her jailing {{for civil}} contempt, Miller's lawyers {{argued that it}} was {{pointless}} to imprison her because she would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> or reveal confidential sources. Under such circumstances, argued her lawyers, jail term would be [...] "merely punitive" [...] and would serve no purpose. Arguing that Miller should be confined to her home and could forego Internet access and cellphone use, Miller's lawyers suggested that [...] "impairing her unrestricted ability to do her job as an investigative journalist ... would present the strictest form of coercion to her". Failing that, Miller's lawyers asked that she be sent to a women's facility in Danbury, Connecticut, nearer to [...] "Ms. Miller's 76-year-old husband", retired book publisher Jason Epstein, who lives in New York City, and whose state of health {{was the subject of a}} confidential medical report filed by Miller's attorneys.

2500|$|In January 1941, Weil and {{his family}} sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the {{remainder}} of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> about [...] "Lehigh" [...] any more. He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the Universidade de São Paulo from [...] 1945 to 1947, where he worked with Oscar Zariski.

He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1954 in Amsterdam, and in 1978 in Helsinki. In 1979, Weil shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray.|$|E
2500|$|Ratings for Smallvilles {{second season}} were up 23% {{from the same}} point last year. It also surpassed 7th Heaven as The WB's most popular show. Gough {{contributes}} much of the second season's success to the family dynamic between Clark and his parents, whose emotional core provided {{a large part of}} the appeal, as was the move away from the overused [...] "freak of the week" [...] story lines. Gough stated, [...] "Most of the time (on TV), the kids are smart, the parents are clueless and they <b>never</b> <b>talk</b> to each other. Ours is the antithesis of that. He turns to them and relies on their guidance." [...] Smallvilles adjustment proved successful, as the second season averaged 6.3 million viewers, up from 5.9 million viewers in season one. That was also a move to #113 overall in the Nielsen ratings, up from #115 the year before. The season's fourth episode, [...] "Red", the season's seventeenth episode [...] "Rosetta", and the season finale, [...] "Exodus", were selected in The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2002 and 2003, respectively.
