5|$|On 9 January 1999, the Marquess {{complained of}} a stomach ache and dizziness, and {{spent most of}} the day in bed. The {{following}} morning, his butler went into his room and found he was <b>not</b> <b>breathing.</b> Along with Whitby, they attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and called an ambulance.

5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and she was <b>not</b> <b>breathing.</b> Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm was brought to the Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E
5|$|On June 25, 2009, Jackson stopped {{breathing}} {{while attempting to}} sleep {{under the care of}} Conrad Murray, his personal physician. Murray had reportedly given Jackson an array of medications in an attempt to help him sleep at his rented mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Attempts at resuscitating Jackson were unsuccessful. Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics received a 911 call at 12:22 pm (PDT, 19:22 UTC), arriving three minutes later. Jackson was reportedly <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> and CPR was performed. Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, and {{for more than an hour}} after arriving there at 1:13 pm (20:13 UTC). He was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).|$|E
5|$|Several drivers {{stopped and}} rushed to the scene. John Watson and Derek Warwick pulled Villeneuve, his face blue, from the catch fence. The first doctor arrived within 35seconds to find that Villeneuve was <b>not</b> <b>breathing,</b> {{although}} his pulse continued; he was intubated and ventilated before being transferred to the circuit medical centre and then by helicopter to University St Raphael Hospital in Leuven where a fatal fracture of the neck was diagnosed. Villeneuve was kept alive on life support while his wife travelled {{to the hospital and}} the doctors consulted specialists worldwide. He died at 21:12 CEST (UTC+2).|$|E

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
25|$|In {{the event}} that the patient is <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> normally, the current {{international}} guidelines (set by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.|$|E

25|$|On 4 June, Norton and Somervell {{were able}} to start their summit bid at 6:40 am, later than {{originally}} planned. A spilled water bottle caused the delay, and a new quantity had to be melted. But the litre of water each man took was wholly inadequate for their climb, and a chronic shortcoming of the pre-WW-II climbs. Weather was ideal. After ascending the North Ridge more than , they decided to traverse the North Face diagonally but, <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> supplemental oxygen, the effect of altitude forced them to stop frequently to rest.|$|E
25|$|Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, {{a form of}} {{artificial}} ventilation, is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration, a metabolic process referring to the overall exchange of gases in the body, where a rescuer presses his or her mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs. Assistance takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for {{a person who is}} <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on his/her own. It is used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to achieve the internal respiration).|$|E
25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During {{the tape of}} the emergency call, released on June 26 one day after Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was <b>not</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{checks for}} {{responsiveness}} and breathing {{are carried out}} with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the recovery position is appropriate. If <b>not</b> <b>breathing,</b> rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient, as the heart may be basically healthy, but hypoxic. The airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence should be followed, rather than starting with compressions as is typical in cardiac arrest, as the basic problem is lack of oxygen. Five initial breaths are recommended, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because {{of water in the}} airways which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter a sequence of two breaths and 30 chest compressions is recommended, repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or advanced life support is available.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Michael Jackson died {{of acute}} {{propofol}} and benzodiazepine intoxication {{at his home}} on North Carolwood Drive in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. His personal physician, Conrad Murray, said he had found Jackson in his room, <b>not</b> <b>breathing</b> and with a barely detectable pulse, and that he administered CPR on Jackson to no avail. After a call was placed to 9-1-1 at , Jackson was treated by paramedics at the scene and was later pronounced dead at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. On August 28, 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner concluded that his death was a homicide. Shortly before his death, Jackson had reportedly been administered propofol and two anti-anxiety benzodiazepines, lorazepam and midazolam, in his home. His personal physician was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 and served a two-year prison sentence.|$|E
