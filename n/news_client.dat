Usenet differs from such media in several ways: Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned; information need not be stored on a remote server; archives are always available; and reading the messages requires not a mail or web client, but a <b>news</b> <b>client.</b> The groups in alt.binaries are still widely used for data transfer.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether investment banking ties influence {{the speed with}} which analysts convey unfavorable news. We hypothesize that affiliated analysts have incentives to respond promptly to good news but prefer not to issue bad <b>news</b> about <b>client</b> companies. Using duration models of the time between an equity issue and the first downgrade, we find affiliated analysts are slower to downgrade from Buy and Hold recommendations and significantly faster to upgrade from Hold recommendations, in both within-analyst and within-issuer tests. We also find affiliated analysts issue recommendations sooner and more frequently after an offering than unaffiliated analysts, and that unaffiliated analysts are more likely than affiliated analysts to drop coverage of sample firms. Our findings indicate that banking ties increase analysts' reluctance to reveal negative news, and that reform efforts must carefully consider the incentives of affiliated and unaffiliated analysts to initiate coverage and convey the results of their research.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of the client {{isolation}} technology Public Secure Packet Forwarding (PSPF) in defending 802. 11 wireless (Wi-Fi) clients, connected to a public wireless access point, from Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache poisoning attacks, or ARP spoofing. Exploitation of wireless attack vectors such as these have been on the rise and some have made national and international <b>news.</b> Although <b>client</b> isolation technologies are common place in most wireless access points, they are rarely enabled by default. Since an average user generally has a limited understanding of IP networking concepts, it is rarely enabled during access point configurations. Isolating wireless clients from one another on unencrypted wireless networks is a simple and potentially effective way of protection. The purpose of this research is to determine if a commonly available and easily implementable wireless client isolation security technology, such as PSPF, is an effective method for defending wireless clients against attacks...|$|R
