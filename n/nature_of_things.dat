5|$|The {{proposal}} that {{one type of}} organism could descend from another type goes back {{to some of the}} first pre-Socratic Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander and Empedocles. Such proposals survived into Roman times. The poet and philosopher Lucretius followed Empedocles in his masterwork De rerum natura (On the <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b>|$|E
5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full theory of evolution as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
25|$|Through these intelligible likenesses or species we {{directly}} know universals, i.e. the <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> We attain to singulars by our senses, {{and also}} by our intellect, when it beholds the sense images. But we ascend to knowledge <b>of</b> spiritual <b>things</b> by analogy.|$|R

5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things</b> in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part of politicians, and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will is our own, no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, the author, Stephen Lewis, aged 67 and living in Toronto, worked as the United Nations Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, a {{position}} he held since 2001. Previously he worked as the Deputy Director of United Nations Children's Fund (1994–99), as the Canadian ambassador to the UN (1984–88), and {{as leader of the}} Ontario New Democratic Party (1970–79). After Lewis optimistically accepted the Special Envoy position he became increasingly distraught by the devastation he witnessed. Already a skilled orator, he became more vocal on the topic. He founded the Stephen Lewis Foundation, hosted Oprah Winfrey as she toured Africa, and was the subject of two award-winning documentaries by The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things,</b> entitled Race Against Time and The Value of Life. Meanwhile he was appointed as a Companion of the Order of Canada, awarded the Pearson Medal of Peace, and named Canadian of the Year (2003) by MacLean's magazine. In 2005, he was invited to deliver the annual series of Massey Lectures from which the book, Race Against Time, was adapted. He wrote the text in early to mid- 2005 and delivered the lecture series in October when the book was released. Lewis wrote the book, not as an employee of the UN, but as a citizen concerned with the world's response to the AIDS challenge in Africa.|$|E

50|$|Empedocles, a fifth-century BC Greek philosopher, {{identified}} Fire, Earth, Air, and Water as elements.

Different mixtures of these elements produced the different <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.|$|R
25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{explaining}} Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience, the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius wrote De Rerum Natura (The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things)</b> in 50 BC.

25|$|According to the Buddha {{the path}} to liberation is one of {{progressively}} coming out of delusion (Pali: Moha). This path is therefore regarded as a path of awakening.

40|$|Scientists apply Bacon’s investigative {{induction}} {{by first}} cataloguing experimental discrepancies among apparent <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Induction begins by multiplying discrepancies, thus creating a puzzle with multiple clues. Solved puzzles thus give us power to produce those unusual, discrepant effects. Bacon’s experimental method, however, is not empiricist. Grasping things empirically, like receiving impressions on a wax tablet, presupposes that our senses cannot deceive us whenever we are deceived: we err in our interpretations. Empiricism thus leaves no objective discrepancies to resolve, as deception resides in our interpretation. Scientific induction, {{for all its}} success, becomes invisible to modern empiricist methodologist...|$|R
40|$|If one believes, as Hume did, {{that all}} events are loose and separate, then {{the problem of}} {{induction}} is probably insoluble. Anything could happen. But if one thinks, as scientific essentialists do, that the laws <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> are immanent in the world, and depend on the essential <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> then there are strong constraints on what could possibly happen. Given these constraints, the problem of induction may be soluble. For these constraints greatly strengthen the case for conceptual and theoretical conservatism, and rule out Goodmanesque inferences based on alternative descriptions of the world. This may not, in itself, solve the problem, but it significantly changes its nature...|$|R
25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools.

Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific {{context in which they}} were first enunciated.|$|E
25|$|In July 1934 {{at the age}} of 14, he sat the exams for the Liceo Classico D'Azeglio, a Lyceum (sixth form or {{senior high}} school) specializing in the classics, and was {{admitted}} that year. The school was noted for its well-known anti-Fascist teachers, among them the philosopher Norberto Bobbio, and Cesare Pavese, who later became one of Italy's best-known novelists. Levi continued to be bullied during his time at the Lyceum, although six other Jews were in his class.

25|$|A basic {{chemical}} hypothesis first {{emerged in}} Classical Greece {{with the theory}} of four elements as propounded definitively by Aristotle stating that fire, air, earth and water were the fundamental elements from which everything {{is formed as a}} combination.

In 50 BC, the Roman philosopher Lucretius expanded upon the theory in his book De rerum natura (On The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>Things).</b> Unlike modern concepts of science, Greek atomism was purely philosophical in nature, with little concern for empirical observations and no concern for chemical experiments.|$|E
