Before meeting Harrison, Coulter was {{considered}} {{a role model for}} curvy girls and stated that she was proud of being a size 14 woman. She has since lost over 30 kilograms, which has transformed her into a size 8. The couple announced their engagement in the 7 January 2013 issue of <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> magazine. After two years of being engaged, Coulter and Harrison married at the Château Bouffémont in Paris, France on 5 August 2015. Coulter appeared {{on the cover of the}} 17 August 2015 issue of <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> in her wedding dress.|$|E

5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a <b>new</b> <b>idea,</b> you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked {{to be released from}} the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came up with a <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> and began work in May 1884.|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and on the good effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this <b>new</b> <b>idea</b> was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E
40|$|Current {{cognitive}} {{models of}} writing attribute {{the discovery of}} <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> through writing to explicit problem-solving processes, and treat text production as a passive process of translating ideas into text. This paper describes an alternative, dual-process model of writing, in which text production {{is assumed to be}} an active knowledge-constituting process. A key prediction of the model is that dispositionally guided text production will lead to the development of more conceptually coherent <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> than writing directed towards extrinsic goals. An experiment designed to test this prediction is then described. The results confirm that dispositionally produced <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> are relatively more conceptually coherent than <b>new</b> <b>ideas</b> produced to satisfy rhetorical goals...|$|R

30|$|Market {{orientation}} requires complex organizational knowledge (Lado et al. 1998) {{in order}} for the intelligence generated to be disseminated and absorbed within the organization. Hurley and Hult (1998) deem innovativeness as an aspect of firm’s culture and openness toward <b>new</b> <b>ideas.</b> They also introduce the capacity to innovate, which is defined as “the ability of the organization to adopt or implement <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> processes, or products successfully“. Market orientation components adopted in this construct describe a structural flow of information acquisition, absorption, and reaction. Therefore, the better the intelligence generated from the organization (adoption of <b>new</b> <b>ideas)</b> the better the information to be disseminated (implementation of <b>new</b> <b>ideas,</b> processes, or products) and the better the responsiveness (qualified as successful).|$|R

Prince Harry was ten weeks into a front-line deployment in Afghanistan that was subject to a voluntary news blackout by the UK press. The blackout was designed to protect Prince Harry and the men serving with him from being specifically targeted by the Taliban. An Australian weekly women’s magazine <b>New</b> <b>Idea</b> had broken the story in January, {{but it was not}} followed up at the time.

A study involving protocol analysis of five expert problem solvers identifies three critical elements.
