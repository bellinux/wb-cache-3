500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors <b>now.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you hear him say, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Asquith first {{considered}} {{taking the}} vacant War Office himself but then {{offered it to}} Bonar Law, who declined it in favour of Lloyd George.

2500|$|This {{resulted}} in the Education Reform Act 1990 (NSW) (now the Education Act 1990). Prior to its assent on 1 June 1990, school education in New South Wales had been provided under a law developed 110 years earlier by Henry Parkes and William Wilkins in their [...] "Public Instruction Act 1880 (NSW)". On {{the significance of this}} law, Metherell said in early 1990: [...] "Chifley in his time was thought of as somewhat of an ogre, but <b>now</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> look back on Ben Chifley we reflect upon his statesmanship. People will eventually thank me for these reforms - this is a blueprint for education into the 21st century".|$|E
2500|$|On September 6, 2013, ESPN retired {{the butt}} fumble from [...] "Worst of the Worst" [...] after going undefeated for 40 weeks. A SportsCenter {{producer}} {{explained that it}} was time to [...] "start fresh" [...] as the 2013 NFL season began. Negandhi concluded, [...] "Time to get some new material and years from <b>now,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> see a really bad play, we'll say, 'But can it compare to the Butt Fumble?' That is setting a legacy." [...] Before retiring the play, ESPN subjected it to analysis on its [...] "Sports Science" [...] segment. In this segment, they show how Sanchez's speed combined with the angle of impact created a force of over 1,300 pounds, well over the 125 pounds required to cause a fumble.|$|E
