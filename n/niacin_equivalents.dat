40|$|Notice for written {{comments}} to the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee prior to its fourth meeting November 4 - 5, 2009. As the committee enters {{the final stages of}} drafting the 2010 Dietary Guidelines technical report, please consider the following science-based information: DAIRY: A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR OF IMPORTANT NUTRIENTS Dairy’s role in a healthy diet for all Americans has long been established by nutrition science. Milk is a good or excellent source of nine essential nutrients (calcium, potassium, phosphorus, protein, vitamins A, D and B 12, riboflavin and <b>niacin</b> <b>equivalents).</b> Based on contributions from actual intake, in addition to calcium, dairy foods together are a major contributor of phosphorus, vitamin B 12 and riboflavin and a substantial contributor of protein, potassium, magnesium, zinc, thiamin and vitamin A to the U. S. diet. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To assess {{dietary intake}} and serum mineral and vitamin levels in elderly people from Northwest Spain {{consuming}} a Mediterranean diet, rich in vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, olive oil, dairy products and moderate in wine. Methods: Cross-sectional observational study in four retirement homes. Forty-five men and 65 women participated. Dietary intake and serum calcium, magnesium, iron, retinol, α-tocopherol, albumin, cholesterol, glucose and hematological parameters were determined. Results: Mean consumption of fruit plus vegetables was 600 g/day. Men consumed significantly more legumes, fruit, meat, and alcoholic beverages, but fewer vegetables than women. Women presented higher carbohydrate and lower alcohol energy contributions. Men consumed significantly more thiamin, <b>niacin</b> <b>equivalents,</b> riboflavin, retinol equivalents and iron. Vitamin D intake was 2. 2 ± 1. 2 μg/day and folate intake was 204 ± 47 μg/day without gender differences. Prevalence of anemia was 6. 7 % {{and that of}} high ferritin, 1. 8 %. Serum cholesterol and retinol were higher in women. Mean serum α-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio in the whole population was 6. 3 ± 2. 3 mmol/mol without gender differences. Conclusion: This elderly population consumes an Atlantic-Mediterranean diet that appears, according to biochemical and hematological parameters, appropriate. However, more fatty fish and leafy green vegetables and the inclusion of fortified foods in the diet might optimize micronutrient status. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for niacin. Niacin is a generic term for nicotinic acid and nicotinamide. Niacin can be {{synthesised}} {{in the human body}} from the indispensable amino acid tryptophan. Approximately 60 mg of tryptophan yields 1 mg of niacin defined as 1 mg <b>niacin</b> <b>equivalent</b> (NE). Long-term inadequate intake of tryptophan and niacin can lead to the development of pellagra. In the absence of new scientific data, the Panel endorses the Average Requirement (AR) for adults of 1. 3 mg NE/MJ (5. 5 mg NE/ 1 000 kcal) adopted by the Scientific Committee for Food (1993), based on data on urinary excretion of niacin metabolites as an endpoint. The Population Reference Intake (PRI) of 1. 6 mg NE/MJ (6. 6 mg NE/ 1 000 kcal) is derived from the AR assuming a coefficient of variation of 10 %. For infants aged 7 - 11 months, children and adolescents, as well as for pregnant and lactating women, the Panel considers that {{there is no evidence that}} the relationship between niacin requirement and energy requirement differs from that o...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{bioavailability}} of niacin from tuna fish, {{peanut butter}} and whole wheat bread was estimated in eight men aged 21 to 30 years. Following a 10 -day adjustment period, each test food, which was added to a constant basal diet, was fed for 14 days; {{the order in which}} these three foods were eaten was randomized. Of the total dietary niacin intake, tuna fish supplied 68 percent of the preformed niacin and 35 percent of the tryptophan, peanut butter supplied 70 percent of preformed niacin and 47 percent of the tryptophan intake, while whole wheat bread supplied only 34 percent of preformed niacin and 23 percent of tryptophan intake. The bioavailability of niacin was assessed by comparing the total intake of <b>niacin</b> <b>equivalents</b> to the total excretion of N'-methylnicotinamide (N'-Me) and N'-methyl- 2 -pyridone- 5 -carboxainide (2 -pyridone) in 24 -hour urine specimens collected on days 12 and 14 of each experimental period. The differences in bioavailability among three test foods were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Expressed as percent of total niacin intake, the bioavailability of niacin in tuna fish, {{peanut butter and}} whole wheat bread was 60 ± 7, 28 ± 6 and 36 ± 13, respectively. The results suggest that the niacin in tuna fish is readily available, while niacin in peanut butter and whole wheat bread are inadequately available for humans. These results are in agreement with other studies on niacin bioavailability carried out in humans and rats...|$|E
