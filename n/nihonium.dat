5|$|All <b>nihonium</b> {{isotopes}} {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; however, the heavier <b>nihonium</b> isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known <b>nihonium</b> isotope, 286Nh, is also the heaviest confirmed <b>nihonium</b> isotope; it has a half-life of 8seconds. The isotope 285Nh and the unconfirmed 290Nh {{have been reported to}} also have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes 284Nh and 283Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known <b>nihonium</b> isotope, is also the shortest-lived known <b>nihonium</b> isotope, with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It is predicted that even heavier undiscovered <b>nihonium</b> isotopes could be much more stable: for example, 287Nh is predicted to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of <b>nihonium</b> has yet to have been established. The isotopes 284Nh, 285Nh, and 286Nh have half-lives long enough for chemical investigation. It is theoretically predicted that <b>nihonium</b> should have an enthalpy of sublimation around 150kJ/mol and an enthalpy of adsorption on a gold surface around −159kJ/mol. From 2010 to 2012, some preliminary chemical experiments were performed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research to determine the volatility of <b>nihonium.</b> The reaction used was 243Am(48Ca,3n)288Mc; the isotope 288Mc has a short half-life and would quickly decay to the longer-lived 284Nh, which would be chemically investigated. Teflon capillaries at 70°C connecting the recoil chamber, where the <b>nihonium</b> atoms were synthesized, and the gold-covered detectors: the <b>nihonium</b> atoms would be carried along the capillaries by a carrier gas. While about ten to twenty atoms of 284Nh were produced, none of these atoms were registered by the gold-covered detectors, suggesting either that <b>nihonium</b> was similar in volatility to the noble gases or, more plausibly, that pure <b>nihonium</b> was not very volatile and thus could not efficiently pass through the Teflon capillaries at 70°C. Formation of the hydroxide NhOH would ease the transport, as <b>nihonium</b> hydroxide {{is expected to be}} more volatile than elemental <b>nihonium,</b> and this reaction could be facilitated by adding more water vapor into the carrier gas. However, it seems likely that this formation is not kinetically favored, so that the longer-lived isotope 286Nh, created as the granddaughter of 294Ts, might be more desirable for future experiments.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{estimates}} of alpha decay half-lives of isotopes of <b>nihonium</b> {{are in good}} agreement with the experimental data. The undiscovered isotope 293Nh has been predicted {{to be the most}} stable towards beta decay; however, no known <b>nihonium</b> isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nihonium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Seven different isotopes of <b>nihonium</b> have been reported with atomic masses 278, 282–286, and 290; they all decay through alpha decay to isotopes of roentgenium, although nihonium-284 may have an electron capture branch to copernicium-284.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar <b>nihonium</b> monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. <b>Nihonium</b> has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and <b>nihonium</b> as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the RIKEN team {{studied the}} 248Cm(23Na,5n)266Bh {{reaction}} to synthesize the decay product 266Bh directly and establish its link with 278Nh as a cross-bombardment; they also established the branched decay of 262Db, which sometimes underwent spontaneous fission and sometimes underwent the previously known alpha decay to 258Lr.Bh and 262Db Produced in the 248Cm + 23Na Reaction |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=78 |issue=6 |pages=064201-1–6 |doi=10.1143/JPSJ.78.064201|arxiv=0904.1093 |bibcode=2009JPSJ...78f4201M }} Due to these inconsistencies in the decay data, {{the small number}} of <b>nihonium</b> atoms produced, and the lack of unambiguous anchors to known isotopes, the JWP did not accept this as a conclusive discovery of <b>nihonium</b> in 2011.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nihonium</b> is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, {{the same as that of}} thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of <b>nihonium</b> are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2016, IUPAC {{disclosed}} {{the name}} of element 113 as <b>nihonium.</b> Prior to the formal approval by the IUPAC Council, a five-month public review was set, expiring 8 November 2016; the name was officially approved on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of <b>nihonium</b> was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for <b>nihonium</b> was found to be congruent, and the data from the Dubna team for moscovium and <b>nihonium</b> to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{periodic}} table has 118 confirmed elements, from element 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson). Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015. Their proposed names, <b>nihonium</b> (Nh), moscovium (Mc), tennessine (Ts) and oganesson (Og) respectively, were announced by the IUPAC in June 2016 and made official in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} from atomic numbers 1 (hydrogen) to 118 (oganesson) {{have been discovered}} or synthesized, with the most recent additions (<b>nihonium,</b> moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson) being confirmed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2015 and officially named in 2016: they complete the first seven rows of the periodic table. The first 94 elements exist naturally, although some are found only in trace amounts and were synthesized in laboratories before being found in nature. Elements with atomic numbers from 95 to 118 have only been synthesized in laboratories or nuclear reactors. Synthesis of elements having higher atomic numbers is being pursued. Numerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), <b>nihonium</b> (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, as expected from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in the boron group, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to thallium in the boron group. <b>Nihonium</b> is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium, and behave as a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them. Unlike all the other p-block elements, it may be able to involve its d-electrons in bonding, although these predictions are disputed.|$|E
5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements <b>nihonium</b> and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and <b>nihonium</b> both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3. The electron of the hydrogen-like moscovium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Mc114+) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Although minute {{quantities}} of some transuranic elements occur naturally, {{they were all}} first discovered in laboratories. Their production has expanded the periodic table significantly, {{the first of these}} being neptunium, synthesized in 1939. Because many of the transuranic elements are highly unstable and decay quickly, they are challenging to detect and characterize when produced. There have been controversies concerning the acceptance of competing discovery claims for some elements, requiring independent review to determine which party has priority, and hence naming rights. In 2010, a joint Russia–US collaboration at Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, claimed to have synthesized six atoms of tennessine (element 117), making it the most recently claimed discovery. It, along with <b>nihonium</b> (element 113), moscovium (element 115), and oganesson (element 118), are the four most recently named elements, whose names all became official on 28 November 2016.|$|E
5|$|This {{experiment}} practically exhausted {{cold fusion}} {{as a method}} for making new elements, due to the extremely low {{cross section of the}} reaction (probability of fusion): the value of 20femtobarns obtained for the 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh is the lowest among all superheavy fusion reactions that have been successful. Nevertheless, it may still be of use in making new isotopes of already known elements: RIKEN had plans to later investigate light isotopes of the next element 114, flerovium, by fusing a lead-208 target with germanium-76 projectiles in the reaction 208Pb(76Ge,n)283Fl.Bh and its daughter nuclei by using the 248Cm(23Na,5n)266Bh Reaction |last=Morimoto |first=Kouji |date=October 2009 |website=www.kernchemie.uni-mainz.de |publisher=University of Mainz |access-date=28 April 2017}} The cross-section for this reaction of lead and germanium producing flerovium is expected to be 200fb, greater than the 30fb for the reaction with bismuth and zinc producing <b>nihonium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unambiguous {{determination}} of the chemical characteristics of livermorium {{has not yet been}} established. In 2011, experiments were conducted to create <b>nihonium,</b> flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. The targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium. The produced nuclides bismuth-213 and polonium-212m were transported as the hydrides 213BiH3 and 212mPoH2 at 850°C through a quartz wool filter unit held with tantalum, showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners McH3 and LvH2 would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of periodic trends in the p-block. Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium. Though no known isotopes of livermorium have long enough half-lives, 288Mc, 289Mc, and 290Mc may be chemically investigated with current methods.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} possible tennessine compound {{would be}} the monohydride, TsH. The bonding {{is expected to be}} provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17picometers compared with the overall length of 195pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin–orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown {{by the fact that the}} element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the <b>nihonium</b> atom, with the dipole moment value being −1.80D. The spin–orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nihonium</b> is {{a highly}} {{unstable}} element and decays by emitting alpha particles. Due to its strong radioactivity, it would definitely be extremely toxic, although significant quantities of <b>nihonium</b> (larger than a few atoms) {{have not yet been}} assembled.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, element 113 on the {{periodic}} table was named <b>nihonium</b> to honor its discovery in 2004 by Japanese scientists at RIKEN.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of synthetic <b>nihonium,</b> all the elements in the boron group have numerous uses and applications in the production and content of many items.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nihonium</b> is {{an element}} that is never found in nature but has been created in a laboratory. It is {{therefore}} classified as a synthetic element with no stable isotopes.|$|E
25|$|Boron is {{classified}} as a metalloid while the rest, {{with the possible exception}} of <b>nihonium,</b> are considered post-transition metals. Boron occurs sparsely, probably because bombardment by the subatomic particles produced from natural radioactivity disrupts its nuclei. Aluminium occurs widely on earth, and indeed is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (8.3%). Gallium is found in the earth with an abundance of 13 ppm. Indium is the 61st most abundant element in the earth's crust, and thallium is found in moderate amounts throughout the planet. <b>Nihonium</b> is never found in nature and therefore is termed a synthetic element.|$|E
25|$|The boron {{group are}} the {{chemical}} elements in group 13 of the periodic table, comprising boron (B), aluminium (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), thallium (Tl), and perhaps also the chemically uncharacterized <b>nihonium</b> (Nh). The {{elements in the}} boron group are characterized by having three electrons in their outer energy levels (valence layers). These elements have also {{been referred to as}} icosagens and triels.|$|E
25|$|Abrikosov {{distinguishes between}} {{ordinary}} metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled. The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies {{than those of}} the transition metals. Gray identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, <b>nihonium,</b> tin, lead, flerovium, bismuth, moscovium, and livermorium. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals that people think of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.|$|E
25|$|The {{elements}} in group 13 are also capable of forming stable compounds with the halogens, usually with the formula MX3 (where M is a boron-group element and X is a halogen.) The only {{exception to this}} is thallium(III) iodide. Fluorine, the first halogen, is able to form stable compounds with every element that has been tested (except neon and helium), and the boron group is no exception. It is even hypothesized that <b>nihonium</b> could form a compound with fluorine, NhF3, before spontaneously decaying due to nihonium's radioactivity. Chlorine also forms stable compounds {{with all of the}} {{elements in}} the boron group, including thallium, and is hypothesized to react with <b>nihonium.</b> All of the elements will react with bromine under the right conditions, as with the other halogens but less vigorously than either chlorine or fluorine. Iodine will react with all natural elements in the periodic table except for the noble gases, and is notable for its explosive reaction with aluminium to form 2AlI3. Astatine, the heaviest halogen, has only formed a few compounds, due to its radioactivity and short half-life, and no reports of a compound with an At–B, –Al, –Ga, –In, –Tl, or –Nh bond have been seen, although scientists think that it should form salts with metals.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the synthetic <b>nihonium,</b> all of the elements of the boron group have stable isotopes. Because all their atomic numbers are odd, boron, gallium and thallium have only two stable isotopes, while aluminium and indium are monoisotopic, having only one. 10B and 11B are both stable, as are 27Al, 69Ga and 71Ga, 113In, and 203Tl and 205Tl. All of these isotopes are readily found in macroscopic quantities in nature. In theory, though, all isotopes with an atomic number greater than 40 are supposed to be unstable to such decay modes as spontaneous fission and alpha decay. Conversely, all isotopes whose atomic numbers are less than 40 are theoretically supposed to be energetically stable to all forms of decay (with {{the exception}} of proton decay, which has never been observed).|$|E
500|$|A 2017 {{experiment}} at the JINR, producing 284Nh and 285Nh via the 243Am+48Ca reaction as {{the daughters}} of 288Mc and 289Mc, avoided this problem by removing the quartz surface, using only Teflon. No <b>nihonium</b> atoms were observed after chemical separation, implying an unexpectedly large retention of <b>nihonium</b> atoms on Teflon surfaces. This experimental result for the interaction limit of <b>nihonium</b> atoms with a Teflon surface [...] disagrees significantly with previous theory, which expected a far lower value of 14.00kJ/mol. This also implies that the <b>nihonium</b> species involved in the previous experiment was likely not elemental <b>nihonium</b> but rather <b>nihonium</b> hydroxide, and that high-temperature techniques such as vacuum chromatography {{would be necessary to}} further probe the behavior of elemental <b>nihonium.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Nihonium</b> is {{the first}} member of the 7p series of {{elements}} and the heaviest group 13 element on the periodic table, below boron, aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium. It is predicted to show many differences from its lighter homologues: a largely contributing effect is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the speed of light. In relation to <b>nihonium</b> atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect, and the effect [...] "tearing" [...] the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called the subshell splitting. Computation chemists see the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more stabilized and less stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s27p1/21. These effects stabilize lower oxidation states: the first ionization energy of <b>nihonium</b> is expected to be 7.306eV, the highest in group 13. Hence, the most stable oxidation state of <b>nihonium</b> is predicted to be the +1 state, and <b>nihonium</b> is expected to be less reactive than thallium. Differences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in halves, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so that they are close in energy to the 7s ones. Thus, the 6d electron levels, being destabilized, should still be able to participate in chemical reactions in <b>nihonium</b> (as well as in the next 7p element, flerovium), thus making it behave in some ways like transition metals and allow higher oxidation states. <b>Nihonium</b> should hence also be able to show stable +3 and possibly also +5 oxidation states. However, the +3 state should still be less stable than the +1 state, following periodic trends. <b>Nihonium</b> should be the most electronegative among all the group 13 elements: for example, in the compound NhTs, the negative charge is expected to be on the <b>nihonium</b> atom rather than the tennessine atom, the opposite of what would be expected from simple periodicity. The electron affinity of <b>nihonium</b> is calculated to be around 0.68eV; in comparison, that of thallium is 0.4eV. The high electron affinity and electronegativity of <b>nihonium</b> are due to it being only one electron short of the closed-shell valence electron configuration of flerovium (7s27p1/22): this would make the −1 oxidation state of <b>nihonium</b> more stable than that of its lighter congener thallium. The standard electrode potential for the Nh+/Nh couple is predicted to be −0.6V.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} possible <b>nihonium</b> compound is the monohydride, NhH. The bonding {{is provided}} by the 7p1/2 electron of <b>nihonium</b> and the 1s electron of hydrogen. However, the SO interaction causes the binding energy of <b>nihonium</b> monohydride to be reduced by about 1eV and the nihonium–hydrogen bond length to decrease as the bonding 7p1/2 orbital is relativistically contracted. This is exceptional in the 7p series of elements; all other MH (M = Fl, Mc, Lv, Ts, Og) molecules have relativistic expansion of the bond length instead of contraction. The analogous monofluoride (NhF) should also exist. <b>Nihonium</b> should also be able to form the trihydride (NhH3), trifluoride (NhF3), and trichloride (NhCl3), with <b>nihonium</b> in the +3 oxidation state. Because the 6d electrons are involved in bonding instead of the 7s ones, these molecules are predicted to be T-shaped and not trigonal planar. Although the polyfluoride anion [...] should be stable, the corresponding neutral fluoride NhF5 should be unstable, spontaneously decomposing into the trifluoride and elemental fluorine. Nihonium(I) is predicted to be more similar to silver(I) than thallium(I): the Nh+ ion is expected to more willingly bind anions, so that NhCl should be quite soluble in an excess of hydrochloric acid or in ammonia while TlCl is not. Additionally, in contrast to the strongly basic TlOH, nihonium(I) should instead form Nh2O, which would be weakly water-soluble and readily ammonia-soluble. The adsorption behavior of <b>nihonium</b> on gold surfaces in thermochromatographical experiments is expected to be closer to that of astatine than that of thallium.|$|E
500|$|<b>Nihonium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Nh and atomic number 113. It is extremely radioactive; its most stable known isotope, nihonium-286, has a half-life of about 8seconds. <b>Nihonium</b> was first {{reported to have}} been created in 2003 by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, and in 2004 {{by a team of}} Japanese scientists at RIKEN.

In June 2004 and again in December 2005, this dubnium isotope was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring spontaneous fission (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a group 5 element (as dubnium {{is known to be}} in group 5 of the periodic table). Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed 268Db which lends support to the assignment of the parent and daughter nuclei to moscovium and <b>nihonium</b> respectively.Am + 48Ca|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.72.034611|date=2005|author=Oganessian, Yu.

500|$|Claims to the {{discovery}} of <b>nihonium</b> were put forward by both the Dubna and RIKEN teams. [...] The Japanese team suggested various names: japonium, symbol Jp, after their home country; nishinanium, symbol Nh, after Japanese physicist Yoshio Nishina, the [...] "founding father of modern physics research in Japan"; and rikenium, symbol Rk, after the team itself. In 2011, the IUPAC evaluated the 2004 RIKEN experiments and 2004 and 2007 Dubna experiments, and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery.|$|E
500|$|The first {{successful}} synthesis of moscovium was by a joint team of Russian and American scientists in August 2003 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia. Headed by Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, the team included American scientists of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The researchers on February 2, 2004, stated in Physical Review C that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of moscovium. These atoms decayed by emission of alpha-particles to <b>nihonium</b> in about 100milliseconds.Am(48Ca,xn)291−x115|date=2004|journal=Physical Review C|volume=69|issue=2|page=021601|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.69.021601|bibcode=2004PhRvC..69b1601O|display-authors=3|last7=Tsyganov|first7=Yu.|last8=Gulbekian|first8=G.|last9=Bogomolov|first9=S.}}Am(48Ca,xn)291−x115|author=Oganessian|display-authors=etal|journal=JINR preprints |date=2003}} ...|$|E
