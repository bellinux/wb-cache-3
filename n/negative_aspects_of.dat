5|$|By the 19th century, {{emphasis}} on the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Cynic philosophy led to the modern understanding of cynicism to mean a disposition of disbelief in the sincerity or goodness of human motives and actions.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} most important works of Indonesian literature, with its love story being compared to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the Chinese legend of the Butterfly Lovers. Some Western critics, including Dutch critic A. Teeuw and writer A. H. Johns, consider it to be the first true Indonesian novel, as opposed to Azab dan Sengsara, which was less developed in its theme of forced marriage and the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> adat.|$|E
50|$|One <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the co-occurrence matrix is {{that the}} {{extracted}} features do not necessarily correspond to visual perception.|$|R
50|$|Despite the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Aži Dahāka in mythology, dragons {{have been}} used on some banners of war {{throughout}} the history of Iranian peoples.|$|R
50|$|A further <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> beak-trimming is that {{it leaves}} birds less able to groom {{themselves}} effectively, thus beak-trimmed hens have greater ectoparasite burdens than hens with intact beaks.|$|R
5|$|Antoinette Wright, {{director}} of the DuSable Museum, has said that African American art has grown out of a need for the culture to preserve its history orally and in art due to historical obstacles {{to other forms of}} documentation. She also believes that the museum serves as a motivational tool for members of a culture that has experienced extensive negativity. In the 1980s, African American museums such as the DuSable endured the controversy of whether <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the cultural history should be memorialized. In the 1990s, the African American genre of museum began to flourish despite financial difficulties. In 2016, the museum formed an affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the company}} {{developed}} Resistance 3—the sequel to Resistance 2—which {{was designed to}} be similar to Fall of Man. The team at Insomniac reviewed players' feedback regarding the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> Resistance 2, re-introduced some mechanics from Fall of Man, and focused on narrative. They considered such an approach can differentiate a franchise from other first-person shooters. Resistance 3 was regarded by the team as the best game in the series, but it sold poorly and was a financial failure. According to Price, the team was disappointed but were still proud of the project. In early 2012, Price announced that the company would not be involved in any future Resistance projects. Sony retained the intellectual property rights to the franchise.|$|E
5|$|The series {{ended its}} sixth season with 13.26 million viewers, ranking #17 {{in terms of}} ratings, the lowest the series had ever ranked up to then. The season {{received}} mixed critical feedback, with the season's premiere and finale given heavier critical acclaim, {{in contrast to the}} middle. The season was one of the least acclaimed in terms of awards and nominations, being the show's only season not to warrant a Primetime Emmy nomination. Despite the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> ratings and awards, the season managed to receive a spot on Movieline top ten list. Buena Vista released the season onto a DVD box-set, being made available to regions 1 and 2.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> trade {{barriers}} {{is that they}} result in a limited choice of products and would therefore force customers to pay higher prices and accept inferior quality.|$|R
5000|$|Brian Inglis who was {{supportive}} {{of some of}} Guirdham's ideas wrote that a <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> his writing was that he tended [...] "to make sweeping assertions unsupported by evidence".|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} period when Egypt became occupied, the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the Nun (chaos) became the {{dominant}} perception, reflecting {{the forces of}} disorder that were set loose in the country.|$|R
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E
25|$|The {{storm of}} {{controversy}} created by Velikovsky's publications {{may have helped}} revive the catastrophist movement {{in the second half}} of the 20th century; however, it is also held by some working in the field that progress has actually been retarded by the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the so-called Velikovsky Affair.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union transformed, often radically, the country's {{physical}} environment. In the 1970s and 1980s, Soviet citizens, {{from the}} highest officials to ordinary factory workers and farmers, began to examine <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> this transformation and to call for more prudent use {{of natural resources and}} greater concern for environmental protection.|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot said [...] "An {{engaging}} story, logical puzzles, {{and nice}} visuals combine to make The Awakened a great adventure game", {{adding that the}} only <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{it is that you}} can't skip cutscenes.|$|R
50|$|Harry Potter {{has been}} seen as seeking a {{succession}} of father figures, from Rubeus Hagrid to Albus Dumbledore, contrasted from the role of Lord Voldemort as the counterpart and <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the father figure.|$|R
50|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Japan's {{economic}} growth is industrial pollution. Until the mid-1970s, {{both public and private}} sectors pursued {{economic growth}} with such single-mindedness that prosperity was accompanied by severe degradation of both the environment and the quality of life (see environmental protection in Japan).|$|R
25|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> {{inequality}} {{are spread}} across the population. For example, when comparing the United States (a more unequal nation) to England (a less unequal nation), the US shows higher rates of diabetes, hypertension, cancer, lung disease, and heart disease across all income levels. This is also true {{of the difference between}} mortality across all occupational classes in highly equal Sweden as compared to less-equal England.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Monopoly {{can be traced}} back to 1903, when American anti-monopolist Elizabeth Magie created a game through which she hoped to be able to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. It was {{intended}} as an educational tool to illustrate the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> concentrating land in private monopolies. Magie took out a patent in 1904. Her game, The Landlord's Game, was self-published, beginning in 1906.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Alphabet City {{was home}} to a mix of Puerto Rican and African American {{families}} living alongside struggling artists and musicians (who were mostly young and white). Attracted by the Nuyorican movement, low rents, and creative atmosphere, Alphabet City attracted a growing Bohemian population. At one time it {{was home to}} many of the first graffiti writers, b-boys, rappers, and DJs. The area also had high levels of illegal drug activity and violent crime. The Broadway musical Rent portrays some of the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> this time and place.|$|E
30|$|We {{estimate}} an additional radiation dose of approximately 3.4  mSv for these CT scans, {{which is another}} <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> our study. However, the incremental dose compared with the cardiac catheterisation procedure is small, the images are limited to the kidneys, and can be rapidly performed.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that individualistic systems have been recently employed in Japan, and Japanese people have become more individualistic. However, previous research suggested that such cultural changes have negative associations with interpersonal relationships and happiness for Japanese (Ogihara & Uchida, 2014). In the present research, to demonstrate a <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> individualism in Japan, we examined the meaning of individualism which Japanese people hold. Japanese participants aged 16 to 69 reported their evaluation to the word "individualism" and their perception of an "individualistic person. " We found that individualism was regarded as being neutral and ambivalent, including both the positive <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "with independence and freedom" and the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> being "without positive interpersonal relationships. " In contrast, participants predicted others' evaluation of individualism to be more negative than their own evaluation, since they presumed that others would not consider the positive <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> independence and freedom...|$|R
2500|$|The {{benefit of}} the J.E.M. {{decision}} is that universities {{will be able to}} more easily capture the full economic value of their plant genetic inventions and discoveries.

25|$|According to Shusterman our culture’s growing {{preoccupation with}} the body has not yet found an {{appropriate}} response {{in the realm of}} philosophy, which simply neglects the somatic, textualizes it, or reduces it to gender or racial difference, and thus is unwilling or unable to counteract the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the current body boom (such as the tendency that “contemporary aesthetic ideals of body remain enslaved by shallow and oppressive stereotypes that serve more to increase profits for the cosmetics industries than to enrich our experience of the varieties of bodily charms”).|$|E
25|$|Reception of iOS 7 was mixed. The {{new design}} {{language}} was criticized, with critics noting {{the implementation of}} design changes rather than actual productivity improvements, and citing examples such as animations delaying access, lack of icon consistency, and buttons being hidden as <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the user experience. The addition of the Control Center was praised, as were updates to Siri and multitasking. Shortly after release, {{there were reports of}} the new design causing sickness, a trend explained as being caused by animations with similar effects as car sickness.|$|E
25|$|The idea of '{{resilience}} building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept of resilience as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a developable characteristic of oneself. Those who view resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.|$|E
40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> airport’s activity, {{which is}} its harmful {{influence}} on the environment, is described, {{with the emphasis on}} the ground waters pollution. The pollution of ground waters of the Nyvka river in the zone of international airport Kyiv is analyzed. The levels of waste emission into the river are determined. </p...|$|R
25|$|The <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the oily-skin type is that oily complexions are {{especially}} susceptible to clogged pores, blackheads, and buildup of dead skin cells {{on the surface}} of the skin. Oily skin can be sallow and rough in texture and tends to have large, clearly visible pores everywhere, except around the eyes and neck.|$|R
50|$|Another {{important}} role of Tiferet is that of Saviour, and in Christian Kabbalah it is through Tiferet, the Son, that the father is known. Thagirion {{could be said to}} be the <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> this dogma, the harsher doctrines that condemn all who dare defy their particular brand of beauty to everlasting hell and fire.|$|R
25|$|Thus Heine's {{formative}} years were spent under French influence. The adult Heine {{would always be}} devoted to the French for introduction of the Napoleonic Code and trial by jury. He glossed over the <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> French rule in Berg: heavy taxation, conscription, and economic depression {{brought about by the}} Continental Blockade (which may have contributed to his father's bankruptcy). Heine greatly admired Napoleon as the promoter of revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality and loathed the political atmosphere in Germany after Napoleon's defeat, marked by the conservative policies of Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich, who attempted to reverse the effects of the French Revolution.|$|E
25|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> using {{a living}} trust {{as opposed to}} a will and probate include upfront legal expenses, the expense of trust administration, and a lack of certain safeguards. The cost of the trust may be 1% of the estate per year versus the {{one-time}} probate cost of 1 to 4% for probate, which applies {{whether or not there is}} a drafted will. Unlike trusts, wills must be signed by two to three witnesses, the number depending on the law of the jurisdiction in which the will is executed. Legal protections that apply to probate but do not automatically apply to trusts include provisions that protect the decedent's assets from mismanagement or embezzlement, such as requirements of bonding, insurance, and itemized accountings of probate assets.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, the Central Java {{division}} and Jepara {{branch of the}} Indonesian organisation Nahdlatul Ulama (the Awakening of the Religious Scholars) declared the government's proposal {{to build a nuclear}} power station nearby at Balong on the Muria peninsula haram or forbidden. The fatwā was issued following a two-day meeting of more than a hundred ulama to consider {{the pros and cons of}} the proposal addressed by government ministers, scientists and critics. The decision cited both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the proposal, which it had balanced to make its judgment. Key concerns were the question of long-term safe disposal and storage of radioactive waste, the potential local and regional environmental consequences of the plant’s operation, the lack of financial clarity about the project, and issues of foreign technological dependence.|$|E

50|$|A <b>negative</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the society}} is its intense xenophobia, which is marked by the Pylean demons' adverse {{reaction}} to mention of details of non-Pylean anatomy (for instance, the fact that other species might keep their hearts in their chest, rather than their buttocks).
