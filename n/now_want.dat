25|$|A new {{characteristic}} of the modern aspects of the third quest has been the role of archaeology; James Charlesworth states that few modern scholars <b>now</b> <b>want</b> to overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea {{during the time of}} Jesus. A further {{characteristic of}} the third quest has been its interdisciplinary and global nature of the scholarship. While the first two quests were mostly carried out by European Protestant theologians, the third quest has seen a worldwide influx of scholars from multiple disciplines.|$|E

2500|$|In the morning, Moses {{relates to}} Aaron that God {{has a message}} for him, while deferring its revelation to a later time. [...] However, this {{particular}} day, Moses changes {{the order in which}} the priests and dignitaries walk to the Tent of Meeting, placing Aaron in the center position of honor, much to the delight of the people. [...] Still, he does not explain to Aaron the reason for the change, nor can he later explain the matter to Aaron when they and Eleazar walk together to the mountain. [...] Moses tries in a gently elliptical manner to explain to Aaron that the latter's death is at hand, asking hypothetically whether [...] Aaron was loaned something from God which God might <b>now</b> <b>want</b> returned; however, Aaron does not perceive Moses's meaning.|$|E

2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t <b>now</b> <b>want</b> to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E

[...] In the February 2008 Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying [...] "I think the idea behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their movies– Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none {{of the members of the}} band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle." [...] In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, [...] "Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more— it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my ideal model— Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and <b>now</b> <b>want</b> to give you new stuff." ...|$|E
