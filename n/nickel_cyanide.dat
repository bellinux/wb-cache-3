50|$|The cyanonickelates are a {{class of}} {{chemical}} compound containing anions consisting of <b>nickel</b> atoms, and <b>cyanide</b> groups. The {{most important of these}} are the tetracyanonickelates containing four <b>cyanide</b> groups per <b>nickel.</b> The tetracyanonickelates contain the Ni(CN)42− anion. This can exist in solution or in solid salts. The ion has cyanide groups arranged in a square around the central nickel ion. The symmetry of the ion is D4h. The distance from the nickel atom to the carbon is 1.87 Å, and the carbon-nitrogen distance is 1.16 Å. Tetracyanonickelate(II) can be oxidised electrochemically in solution to yield tetracyanonickelate(III) Ni(CN)4−. Ni(CN)4− is unstable and Ni(III) oxidises the cyanide to cyanate OCN−. Tetracyanonickelate(III) can add two more cyanide groups to form hexacyanonickelate(III).|$|R
50|$|Reaction {{of nickel}} {{hydroxide}} with hydrogen cyanide (HCN) (in {{the presence or}} absence of ferrous hydroxide, hydrogen sulfide or methyl mercaptan) generates <b>nickel</b> <b>cyanide,</b> which reacts with carbon monoxide (CO) to generate pairs of α-hydroxy and α-amino acids: e.g. glycolate/glycine, lactate/alanine, glycerate/serine; as well as pyruvic acid in significant quantities. Pyruvic acid is also formed at high pressure and high temperature from CO, H2O, FeS in the presence of nonyl mercaptan.Reaction of pyruvic acid or other α-keto acids with ammonia in the presence of ferrous hydroxide or in the presence of ferrous sulfide and hydrogen sulfide generates alanine or other α-amino acids. Reaction of α-amino acids in aqueous solution with COS or with CO and H2S generates a peptide cycle wherein dipeptides, tripeptides etc. are formed and subsequently degraded via N-terminal hydantoin moieties and N-terminal urea moieties and subsequent cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid unit.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{influence}} of functional group structure and resin matrix on the speciation of copper and nickel cyanides sorbed onto two commercially available ion exchange resins. Batch experiments were performed using synthetic copper and nickel solutions containing 50 and 200 mgrL free cyanide, respectively. Despite the presence of CuŽCN. 32 y and CuŽCN. 43 y in solution, {{it has been found}} using Raman spectroscopy that the Imac HP 555 s resin, which has a polystyrene–divinylbenzene matrix, loads predominantly the CuŽCN. 32 y complex. In contrast, the polyacrylic resin, Amberlite IRA 958, sorbed significant amounts of both CuŽCN. 32 y and CuŽCN. 43 y.

40|$|The metal {{finishing}} industry is water intensive. Surveys of South African {{metal finishing}} companies indicate that water consumption {{is as high}} as 400 L/m 2 of metal surface treated, whilst best available practice can achieve less than 10 L/m 2. The industry uses hazardous chemicals such as chrome VI, cadmium, <b>nickel</b> and <b>cyanide.</b> If consumption of these chemicals can be optimized, quantities of heavy metals released into the environment will be reduced. In some cases where cleaner production techniques were applied by local companies, heavy metals have been completely eliminated from effluents discharged to municipal sewers, which represents a significant benefit to the urban environment. This benefit was accompanied by significant reduction in the use of chemicals, with a concomitant cost saving and competitive advantage to the companies concerned. A Danish environmental aid initiative aims to promote cleaner production in the South African metal finishing industry. Local consultants have been trained by Danish experts in this field.

40|$|Coulometric {{experiments}} with a Ni plate electrode in 1 kmol NaOH m- 3 containing 10 - 4 - 1 kmol NaCN m 3 showed that cyanide could be oxidized at high current efficiency [-> 2 mol e-(mol CN-) - 1] with negligible nickel dissolution. How-ever, current densities were low for potentials below those at which Ni(OH 2) was oxidized to Ni(OH) 3, when oxygen evolu-tion occurred, causing a sharp decrease in current efficiency. The electrochemical behavior of <b>nickel</b> in alkaline <b>cyanide</b> solutions was studied by cyclic voltammetry using a rotating (Pt) ring-disk (Ni) electrode system. No cyanide oxidation products were detected at the platinum ring electrode. However, {{by plating the}} Pt with Pb from alkaline solution, and using potentials 10 mol m-s, species other than oxygen (reduction) and hydrogen (oxidation) generated by the nickel disk electrode could be detected transiently, prior to passivation. From ther-modynamic alculations for Ni-CN-H 20 systems in the preceding paper, the most likely species involved were predicted to be Ni(CN) 4 = ions, formed by reduction of Ni(OH) 3 and the simultaneous oxidative dissolution of the underlying metal. The reaction(s) was observed only on the negative-going potential sweep of the nickel disk; no nickel dissolution {{was found to have}} occurred when the electrode was anodically polarized at constant potentials due to the presence of Ni(CN) J Ni(OH) = adsorbed on the electrode, as predicted from the thermodynamic calculations.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1998 Ion {{exchange}} resins {{are widely}} used to remove or concentrate heavy metals from aqueous solutions or slurries. This thesis attempts to properly evaluate the interaction between ion exchange resins and heavy metals at trace metal concentrations. The durability of the resins and their effectiveness in real slurries were also investigated. In this study, a chelating resin, {{as well as a}} cation, and anion exchange resin was contacted with aqueous solutions of heavy metals in both free and complexed form. Zinc, <b>nickel</b> and copper <b>cyanide</b> complexes were adsorbed onto the anion exchange resin, while the chelating and cation exchange resins were contacted with zinc and nickel nitrates, and cupric sulphate. All the tests were conducted in batch stirred tank reactors. All the metal cyanide complexes behaved in a similar manner when contacted with the anion exchange resins. These tests were p~rf 0 nned under variations in temperature, stirring speed, pH., ionic strength and. initial metal 90 E~entrations. Fitting of a dual resistance model to the profiles for thetlptllk:e" of the complexes, show that both film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion rates were improved with an increase in temperature, and that film diffusion rates improved with an increase in stirring speed. A high ionic strength negatively affected equilibrium loading as well as diffusional rates. It was found that at these low concentrations, the diffusional rates improves with a decrease in the external metal concentration. A comparative study involving the chelating and cation·exchange resins were performed, during which the resins were contacted with the metals in free fonn. It was found that at high metal concentrations, the chelating resin induced a rate limiting effect, but at trace concentrations, this effect is virtually negated. Whereas the cation exchange resin exhibited little selectivity in adsorbing the metals, {{it was found that the}} chelating resin prefers the metals in the eu > Ni > Zn. The chelating resin proved to be no less durable then the cation exchange resin, and both slightly lost their ability to adsorb the metal cations as a result of the effects of an inert coarse sand slurry. Tests performed with a real ore leachate, showed the cation exchange resin to be efficient at a low pH, but also relatively non selective, since the adsorption of copper from the leachate was greatly reduced due to the presence of other heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of traces of metallo-cyanide complexes by capillary zone electrophoresis is described. The suitability of preconcentration procedures based on supported liquid membranes in a flow system is investigated. Methyltrioctylammonium chloride in dibutyl ether is used as the active component of the membrane liquid. Due to ion-pairing mechanisms enrichment factors ranging from 50 to 600 can be achieved for cyanide complexes of Fe(II), Fe(III), Ni, Co, Pd, Pt, Cr, Au and Ag. The final capillary electrophoretic separation of the metallo-cyanides is performed off-line with a phosphate-triethanolamine buffer at pH 8. 5 as the carrier electrolyte. Its separation selectivity and compatibility with the preconcentration procedure are optimized by addition of hexamethonium bromide, sodium perchlorate and sodium cyanide. Detection limits in the low nmol range {{can be achieved by}} direct UV detection at 214 nm.

40|$|The {{object of}} the work {{described}} is to determine whether, in any nickel compound, the paramagnetism of the nickel is approximately neutralised by the diamagnetism of the molecule, so {{that it might be}} possible to change the sign of the susceptibility by temperature change alone. A method for measuring small susceptibilities has been developed which, in comparison with current methods, uses simpler apparatus, and simplifies the taking of observations, without prejudice to accuracy or sensitivity. The susceptibilities of a number of nickel compounds have been investigated. It is found that the susceptibility is profoundly affected by the nature of the chemical valence link. In polar compounds the nickel retains a practically constant paramagnetism which is considerably larger than the underlying diamagnetism, and it is hence concluded that such compounds are unsuitable for investigations of change of sign of susceptibility by change of temperature alone. It is suggested that the investigation might be carried out on certain nickel dioxime compounds. The results indicate an abnormality in the structure of <b>nickel</b> <b>cyanide...</b>|$|E

Residual stresses in the coating depending on current density and on the velocity of the cathode were investigated. Residual stresses in coatings represent tensile stresses and their values range from (191 ± 14) N/mm 2 to (403 ± 29 N/mm 2 after deposition.

40|$|Ten {{bacterial}} isolates {{capable of}} growth on tetracyanonickelate(II) [K 2 [Ni(CN) 4]] (TCN) {{as the sole}} nitrogen source were isolated from soil, freshwater, and sewage sludge enrichments. Seven of the 10 were identified as pseudomonads, while the remaining 3 were classified as Klebsiella species. A detailed investigation of one isolate, Pseudomonas putida BCN 3, revealed a rapid growth rate on TCN (generation time, 2 h), with substrate removal and growth occurring in parallel. In addition to TCN, all isolates were able to utilize KCN, although the latter was significantly more toxic; MICs ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 8 mM for KCN and {{greater than or equal}} to 50 mM for TCN. While growth occurred over a wide range of TCN concentrations (0. 25 to 16 mM), degradation was most substantial under growth-limiting conditions and did not occur when ammonia was present. In addition, cells grown on TCN were found to accumulate <b>nickel</b> <b>cyanide</b> [Ni(CN) 2] as a major biodegradation product. The results show that bacteria capable of growth on TCN can readily be isolated and that degradation (i) appears to parallel the capacity for growth on KCN, (ii) does not occur in the presence of ammonia, and (iii) proceeds via the formation of Ni(CN) 2 as a biological metabolite...|$|E
40|$|The first {{examples}} of the application of biphasic and phase transfer catalysis to early-transition-metal organometallic chemistry are described. These include very efficient and convenient syntheses of the (η 5 -cyclopentadienyl) tricarbonylhydridovanadate anion under remarkably mild biphasic conditions. The latter is capable of effecting, under phase transfer conditions, the reduction of halides, sterically encumbered nitro compounds, and the cyclodehydration of α,β-unsaturated ketones. The reactions may proceed via electron transfer pathways. The use of <b>nickel</b> <b>cyanide</b> under biphasic or phase transfer conditions converts vinyl epoxides to the unsaturated ketones and/or unsaturated δ-hydroxyacids.

40|$|Purpose. The {{processes}} of biopassive detoxication are {{of special interest}} for the solution of environmental issues of detoxification of gold heap leach cyanide-bearing wastes whose detoxification period is unlimited. These processes are based on spontaneous degradation of cyanides {{under the influence of}} natural factors including the action of autochthonous bacterial community. The purpose of the work is to develop a biopassive detoxification technology of heap leach stockpiled wastes. Methods. A long-term experiment on ore mass storage under the conditions of heap leach ore pile zoning has been carried out in order to model the process of passive detoxification of gold heap leach stockpiled wastes. The content of toxic compounds in the ore mass has been determined using a chemical analysis based on standard procedures. Results. It is found that biochemical processes dominate over simple chemical oxidation during passive detoxification of the gold heap leach ore pile. Approximating biodegradation equations have been calculated for the major toxic compounds (thiocyanates and cyanides including copper and <b>nickel</b> <b>cyanide</b> complexes). The technology of biopassive detoxification of heap leach stockpiled wastes has been developed at an industrial heap leach site of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) deposit. Water balance of the heap leach installation and detoxification time for the major mass of the ore pile have been calculated. Process circuit and process flow diagram of the proposed technology have been developed. Conclusions. The introduced technology eliminates the costs for reagent detoxification and is based on high economic and environmental efficiency as compared to conventional chemical technology.

40|$|<b>Nickel</b> <b>cyanide</b> is a layered {{material}} showing markedly anisotropic behaviour. High-pressure neutron diffraction measurements show that at pressures up to 20. 1 kbar, compressibility {{is much higher}} in the direction perpendicular to the layers, c, than in {{the plane of the}} strongly chemically bonded metal-cyanide sheets. Detailed examination of the behaviour of the tetragonal lattice parameters, a and c, as a function of pressure reveal regions in which large changes in slope occur, for example, in c(P) at 1 kbar. The experimental pressure dependence of the volume data is fitted to a bulk modulus, B 0, of 1050 (20) kbar over the pressure range 0 – 1 kbar, and to 124 (2) kbar over the range 1 – 20. 1 kbar. Raman spectroscopy measurements yield additional information on how the structure and bonding in the Ni(CN) 2 layers change with pressure and show that a phase change occurs at about 1 kbar. The new high-pressure phase, (Phase PII), has ordered cyanide groups with sheets of D 4 h symmetry containing Ni(CN) 4 and Ni(NC) 4 groups. The Raman spectrum of phase PII closely resembles that of the related layered compound, Cu 1 / 2 Ni 1 / 2 (CN) 2, which has previously been shown to contain ordered C≡N groups. The phase change, PI to PII, is also observed in inelastic neutron scattering studies which show significant changes occurring in the phonon spectra as the pressure is raised from 0. 3 to 1. 5 kbar. These changes reflect the large reduction in the interlayer spacing which occurs as Phase PI transforms to Phase PII and the consequent increase in difficulty for out-of-plane atomic motions. Unlike other cyanide materials e. g. Zn(CN) 2 and Ag 3 Co(CN) 6, which show an amorphization and/or a decomposition at much lower pressures (100 kbar), Ni(CN) 2 can be recovered after pressurising to 200 kbar, albeit in a more ordered form...|$|E
