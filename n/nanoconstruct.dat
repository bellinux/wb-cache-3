Recently, the geometrical confinement of Gd 3 +-based contrast agents (CAs) within porous structures has been proposed as a novel, alternative strategy to improve relaxivity without chemical modification of the CA. Here, we have characterized and optimized the performance of MRI <b>nanoconstructs</b> obtained by loading [Gd(DTPA) (H 2 O) ] 2 − (Magnevist®) into the pores of injectable mesoporous silicon particles. <b>Nanoconstructs</b> with three different pore sizes were studied, and at 60 [*]MHz, they exhibited longitudinal relaxivities of ~ 24 [*]m m− 1 [*]s− 1 for 5 – 10 [*]nm pores and ~ 10 [*]m m− 1 [*]s− 1 for 30 – 40 [*]nm pores. No enhancement in relaxivity was observed for larger pores sizes. Using an outer-sphere compound, [GdTTHA] 3 −, and mathematical modeling, it was demonstrated that the relaxivity enhancement {{is due to the}} increase in rotational correlation times (CA adsorbed on the pore walls) and diffusion correlation times (reduced mobility of the water molecules), as the pore sizes decreases. It was also observed that extensive CA adsorption on the outer surface of the silicon particles negates the advantages offered by nanoscale confinement.

An improved synthetic pathway was used to couple the paramagnetic precursor to the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were rendered water dispersible via citrate capping, leaving one acid group free for amide coupling with the mono-amino precursor of the DOTA ligand. Luminescence spectroscopy measurements have shown that the excitation of the <b>nanoconstruct</b> at 980 nm resulted in intense upconverted emission of thulium(III) at 800 nm. The assembly of several paramagnetic centers on the nanoparticle scaffold reduces the overall tumbling rate, resulting in enhanced longitudinal relaxation times and improved relaxivity.

Yet, clinical applications of magnetic hyperthermia are sporadic, mostly due to the low energy conversion efficiency of the metallic nanoparticles and the high tissue concentrations required. In this work the hyperthermic performance of commercially available formulations of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) are studied. These nanoparticles are operated under {{a broad range of}} AMF conditions. Using a computational model for heat transport in a biological tissue, the minimum requirements for local hyperthermia (Ttissue > 42 °C) and thermal ablation (Ttissue > 50 °C) are derived in terms of particles concentrations, operating AMF conditions and blood perfusion. The resulting maps can be used to rationally design hyperthermic treatments and identifying the proper route of administration - systemic versus intratumor injection - depending on the magnetic and biodistribution properties of the nanoparticles. Moreover, Iron oxide nanoparticles (IOs) are intrinsically theranostic agents {{that could be used for}} magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and local hyperthermia or tissue thermal ablation.

In terms of its relaxivity (r 1, 2) values, this new CA material outperforms currently-available clinical CAs by up to 16 times for r 1 and 21 times for r 2. Finally, sub-micrometer discoidal magnetic <b>nanoconstructs</b> have been produced and studied for applications for in vivo magnetic-field-guided delivery into cancerous tumors.

40|$|Chemotherapy {{has been}} widely used in {{clinical}} practice for cancer treatment. A major challenge for a successful chemotherapy is to potentiate the anticancer activity, whilst reducing the severe side effects. In this context, we design a bio-inspired protein-gold <b>nanoconstruct</b> (denoted as AFt-Au hereafter) with a core-void-shell structure which exhibits a high selectivity towards carcinoma cells. Anticancer drug 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) can be sequestered into the void space of the construct to produce an integrated nanoscale hybrid AFt-AuFU that exhibits an increased cellular uptake of 5 -FU. More importantly, AFt-Au, serving as a bio-nano-chemosensitizer, renders carcinoma cells more susceptible to 5 -FU by cell-cycle regulation, and thus, leads to a dramatic decrease of the IC 50 value (i. e. the drug concentration required to kill 50 % of the cell population) of 5 -FU in HepG 2 cells from 138. 3 mu M to 9. 2 mu M. Besides HepG 2 cells, a remarkably enhanced anticancer efficacy and potentially reduced side effects are also achieved in other cell lines. Our further work reveals that the drug 5 -FU is internalized into cells with AFt-Au primarily via receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how gold nanoparticle nanoconstructs can enhance anticancer effects of lysosomal targeting aptamers {{in breast cancer}} cells. Nanoconstructs consisting of anti-HER 2 aptamer (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HApt) densely grafted on gold nanostars (AuNS) first targeted HER 2 and then were internalized via HER 2 -mediated endocytosis. As incubation time increased, the <b>nanoconstruct</b> complexes were found in vesicular structures, starting from early endosomes to lysosomes as visualized by confocal fluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy. Within the target organelle, lysosomes, HER 2 was degraded by enzymes at low pH, which resulted in apoptosis. At specific time points related to the doubling time of the cancer cells, we found that accumulation of HER 2 -HApt-AuNS complexes in lysosomes, lysosomal activity, and lysosomal degradation of HER 2 were positively correlated. Increased HER 2 degradation by HApt-AuNS triggered cell death and cell cycle arrest in the G 0 /G 1 phase inhibition of cell proliferation. This work shows how a perceived disadvantage of nanoparticle-based therapeutics-the inability of nanoconstructs to escape from vesicles and thus induce a biological response-can be overcome by both targeting lysosomes and exploiting lysosomal degradation of the biomarkers.

40|$|Inflammation is {{a common}} {{hallmark}} in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, cancer, obesity, and neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), growing evidence directly correlates neuronal damage with inflammation of myeloid brain cells, such as microglia. Here, polymeric nanoparticles were engineered and characterized for the delivery of anti-inflammatory molecules to macrophages stimulated via direct incubation with amyloid-β fibers. 200 [*]nm spherical polymeric <b>nanoconstructs</b> (SPNs) and 1, 000 [*]nm discoidal polymeric <b>nanoconstructs</b> (DPNs) were synthesized using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and lipid chains as building blocks. First, the internalization propensity in macrophages of both nanoparticles was assessed via cytofluorimetric and confocal microscopy analyses, demonstrating that SPNs are by far more rapidly taken up as compared to DPNs (99. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 11 vs 14. 4 [*]±[*] 0. 06 %, within 24 [*]h). Then, Curcumin-loaded SPNs (Curc-SPNs) were realized by encapsulating Curcumin, a natural anti-inflammatory molecule, within the PLGA core of SPNs. Finally, Curc-SPNs were shown to diminish up to 6. 5 -fold the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines—IL- 1 β; IL- 6, and TNF-α—in macrophages stimulated via amyloid-β fibers. Although more sophisticated in vitro models and systematic analyses on the blood–brain barrier permeability are critically needed, these findings hold potential {{in the development of}} nanoparticles for modulating inflammation in AD...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDespite the {{preclinical}} {{success of}} adoptive therapy with T cells bearing chimeric <b>nanoconstructed</b> antigen receptors (CARs), certain {{limitations of this}} therapeutic approach such as the immunogenicity of the antigen binding domain, the emergence of tumor cell escape variants and the blocking capacity of soluble antigen still remain. Here, we address these issues using a novel CAR binding moiety based on the oligoclonal camelid single domain antibodies. A unique set of 13 single domain antibodies were selected from an immunized camel phage library based on their target specificity and binding affinity. A combination of these single domain antibodies was used to generate four tumor associated glycoprotein (TAG- 72) -specific CARs harboring an identical antigen binding site, but with different signaling and spacer domains. Although all four CARs were functionally active against the TAG- 72 expressing tumor cells, the combination of CD 3 ζ, OX 40, CD 28 {{as well as the}} CH 3 -CH 2 -hinge-hinge domains most efficiently triggered T cell activation. Importantly, CAR mediated functions were not blocked by the soluble TAG- 72 antigen at a supraphysiological concentration. Our approach may have the potential to reverse multiple tumor immune evasion mechanisms, avoid CAR immunogenicity, and overcome problems in cancer gene therapy with engineered <b>nanoconstructs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since its discovery, small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{has been}} {{considered}} a potent tool for modulating gene expression. It {{has the ability to}} specifically target proteins via selective degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) not easily accessed by conventional drugs. Hence, RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutics have great potential in the treatment of many diseases caused by faulty protein expression such as fibrosis and cancer. However, for clinical application siRNA faces a number of obstacles, such as poor in vivo stability, and off-target effects. Here we developed a unique targeted nanomedicine to tackle current siRNA delivery issues by formulating a biocompatible, biodegradable and relatively inexpensive nanocarrier of sterically stabilized phospholipid nanoparticles (SSLNPs). This nanocarrier is capable of incorporating siRNA in its core through self-association with a novel cationic lipid composed of naturally occuring phospholipids and amino acids. This overall assembly protects and delivers sufficient amounts of siRNA to knockdown over-expressed protein in target cells. The siRNA used in this study, targets connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), an important regulator of fibrosis in both hepatic and renal cells. Furthermore, asialoglycoprotein receptors are targeted by attaching the galactosamine ligand to the nanocarries which enhances the uptake of nanoparticles by hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells, the major producers of CTGF in fibrosis. On animals this innovative <b>nanoconstruct,</b> small interfering RNA in sterically stabilized phospholipid nanoparticles (siRNA-SSLNP), showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and accumulated mostly in hepatic and renal tissues making siRNA-SSLNP a suitable system for targeting liver and kidney fibrotic diseases...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{development}} of thermoresponsive magnetic hydrogels based on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) encapsulation of Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanostructures (MNS). In particular, we {{examined the effects of}} hydrogels encapsulated with poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) and polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) surface modified Fe 3 O 4 MNS on magnetic resonance (MR) T- 2 (transverse spin relaxation) contrast enhancement and associated delivery efficacy of absorbed therapeutic cargo. The microstructural characterization reveal the regular spherical shape and size (similar to 200 nm) of the hydrogels with elevated hydrophilic to hydrophobic transition temperature (40 degrees C) characterized by LCST (lower critical solution temperature) due to the presence of encapsulated MNS. The hydrogel-MNS (HGMNS) system encapsulated with PEG functionalized Fe 3 O 4 of 12 nm size (HGMNS-PEG- 12) exhibited relaxivity rate (r(2)) of 173 mM(- 1) s(- 1) compared to 129 mM(- 1) s(- 1) obtained for hydrogel-MNS system encapsulated with POSS functionalized Fe 3 O 4 (HGMNS-POSS- 12) of the same size. Further studies with HGMNS-PEG- 12 with absorbed drug doxorubicin (DOX) reveals approximately two-fold enhance in release during 1 h RF (radio-frequency) field exposure followed by 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. Quantitatively, it is 2. 1 mu g mg(- 1) (DOX/HGMNS) DOX release with RF exposure while only 0. 9 mu g mg(- 1) release without RF exposure for the same period of incubation. Such enhanced release of therapeutic cargo is attributed to micro-environmental heating in the surroundings of MNS as well as magneto-mechanical vibrations under high frequency RF inside hydrogels. Similarly, RF-induced in vitro localized drug delivery studies with HeLa cell lines for HGMNS-PEG- 12 resulted in more than 80 % cell death with RF field exposures for 1 h. We therefore believe that magnetic hydrogel system has in vivo theranostic potential given high MR contrast enhancement from encapsulated MNS and RF-induced localized therapeutic delivery in one <b>nanoconstruct...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chapter 2 {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid viruses by nanoscale engineering of the capsids of cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). This was achieved by cationization of the capsid surfaces by EDC-mediated coupling of ethylenediamine to the capsid surfaces followed by electrostatic attachment of an anionic polyethylene glycol-based surfactant. Characterization by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) confirmed the existence of discrete CPMV/polymer surfactant nanoconjugates. Retention of the protein secondary structure was confirmed by Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD). Rheological investigations were performed on the liquid virus material. A series of infection studies revealed that the modified polymer-surfactant/virus <b>nanoconstruct</b> remained infective to the plant, V. unguiculata. Furthermore, the surfactant-bound conjugates showed solubility {{in a range of}} organic solvents as well as increased thermal stability (cf wild-type CPMV). Chapter 3 discusses the preparation of monodisperse conducting polyaniline (PAni) nanofibres using polyferrocenylsilane-b-poly(2 -vinyl pyridine) (PFS-b-P 2 VP) block copolymer micelles as templates. PFS-b-P 2 VP cylindrical micelles with narrow length distributions (Lw/Ln < 1. 04) were prepared using a one-dimensional (1 - 0) self-seeding procedure. These micelles were subsequently used in the template-directed synthesis of monodisperse leucoemeraldine (LEB) PAni nanofibres with lengths of up to 1200 nm. The LEB-PAni nanofibres were then oxidized and doped to the conductive emeraldine salt (ES) oxidation state. The oxidation states of the PAni nanofibres were determined using ultraviolet-visible (UV - Vis) spectroscopy. Retention of the same lengths and narrow length distributions of the micellar templates throughout the templating and doping processes was confirmed by statistical analysis of the PAni nanofibres lengths from TEM micrographs. Preliminary experiments into the characterization of the conductive properties of the PFS-b-P 2 VP micellar templates, LEB-PAni nanofibres and ES-PAni nanofibres were carried out by scanning conductance microscopy (SCM).

40|$|Porous silicon {{has been}} used for the {{delivery}} of therapeutic and imaging agents in several biomedical applications. Here, mesoporous silicon <b>nanoconstructs</b> (SiMPs) with a discoidal shape and a sub-micrometer size (1, 000 × 400 nm) have been conjugated with gadolinium-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid Gd(DOTA) molecules and proposed as contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The surface of the SiMPs with different porosities – small pore (SP: ~ 5 nm) and huge pore (HP: ~ 40 nm) – and of bulk, non-porous silica beads (1, 000 nm in diameter) have been modified with covalently attached (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES) groups, conjugated with DOTA molecules, and reacted with an aqueous solution of GdCl 3. The resulting Gd(DOTA) molecules confined within the small pores of the Gd-SiMPs achieve longitudinal relaxivities r 1 of ~ 17 (mM·s) − 1, which is 4 times greater than for free Gd(DOTA). This enhancement is ascribed to the confinement and stable chelation of Gd(DOTA) molecules within the SiMP mesoporous matrix. The resulting <b>nanoconstructs</b> possess no cytotoxicity and accumulate in ovarian tumors up to 2 % of the injected dose per gram tissue, upon tail vein injection. All together this data suggests that Gd-SiMPs could be efficiently used for MR vascular imaging in cancer and other diseases...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{performance}} of nanoparticles {{is affected by}} their size, shape and surface properties. Fabrication methods based on emulsification and nano-precipitation cannot control these features precisely and independently over multiple scales. Herein, discoidal polymeric <b>nanoconstructs</b> (DPNs) with a diameter of 1000 nm and a height of 500 nm are demonstrated via a modified hydrogel-template strategy. The DPNs are obtained by mixing in one synthesis step the constituent polymers – poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) dimethacrylate – and the payload with magneto-optical properties – 5 nm ultra-small super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) and Rhodamine B dye (RhB). The DPN geometrical features are characterized by multiple microscopy techniques. The release of the Rhodamine B dye is pH dependent and increases under acidic conditions by the enhanced hydrolysis of the polymeric matrix. Each DPN is loaded with ∼ 100 fg of iron and can be efficiently dragged by static and external magnetic fields. Moreover, the USPIO confinement within the DPN porous structure is responsible for a significant enhancement in MRI relaxivity (r 2 ∼ 500 (mMs) − 1), up to ∼ 5 times larger than commercially available systems.

40|$|DNA <b>nanoconstructs</b> are {{obtained}} in solution by using six unique 42 -mer DNA oligonucleotides, whose sequences {{have been designed}} to form a pseudohexagonal structure. The required flexibility is provided by the insertion of two non-base-paired thymines in the middle of each sequence that work as flexible hinges and constitute the corners of the nanostructure when formed. We show that hexagonally shaped nanostructures of about 7 nm diameter and their corresponding linear open constructs are formed by self-assembly of the specifically designed linear oligonucleotides. The structural and dynamical characterization of the nanostructure is obtained in situ for the first time by using dynamic light scattering (DLS), a noninvasive method that provides a fast dynamic and structural analysis and allows the characterization of the different synthetic DNA <b>nanoconstructs</b> in solution. A validation of the LS results is obtained through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and atomic force microscopy (AFM). In particular, a mesoscale molecular model for DNA, developed by Knotts et al., is exploited to perform MC simulations and to obtain information about the conformations as well as the conformational flexibilities of these nanostructures, while AFM provides a very detailed particle analysis that yields an estimation of the particle size and size distribution. The structural features obtained by MC and AFM are in good agreement with DLS, showing that DLS is a fast and reliable tool for characterization of DNA nanostructures in solution...|$|R
