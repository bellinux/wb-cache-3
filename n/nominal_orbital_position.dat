40|$|Abstract — This paper extends our prior work on {{spacecraft}} debris avoidance {{based on}} positively invariant sets {{to the case}} of moving debris. In this approach, a time-varying connectivity graph is constructed between a set of forced equilibria, forming a virtual net that is centered around a <b>nominal</b> <b>orbital</b> <b>position</b> of the spacecraft. The connectivity between two equilibria is determined based on contractive sets in order to guarantee that collision-free transitions between equilibria can be effected within a giving time period. A graph search algorithm is imple-mented to find the shortest path around the debris, or through the debris ’ path once it has moved on. Simulation results are presented that illustrate this approach. I...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contributes several control {{strategies that}} provide advanced capabilities in spacecraft applications. Specifically, we consider predictive, adaptive, and time-varying control methods, and {{apply them to}} orbital and attitude control. First, we develop a Model Predictive Control approach with dynamically reconfigurable constraints for orbital rendezvous and docking. The controller is designed to transition between MPC-based guidance during spacecraft rendezvous and docking, with each phase having distinct requirements, constraints, and sampling rates. The MPC controller is demonstrated in simulation studies using a nonlinear model of spacecraft orbital motion. An Extended Kalman Filter is used to estimate spacecraft states based on relative angles and relative range measurements. Second, we consider spacecraft relative motion control based {{on the use of}} safe positively invariant sets. A connectivity graph is constructed between a set of forced equilibria, forming a virtual net around a <b>nominal</b> <b>orbital</b> <b>position.</b> The connectivity between two equilibria is determined based on safe positively invariant sets in order to guarantee that transitions can be effected while spacecraft actuator limits are adhered to and debris collisions are avoided. A graph search algorithm is implemented to find the shortest path around the debris. Third, for attitude control, we extend the continuous inertia-free control law for spacecraft attitude tracking derived in prior work to handle magnetic actuation, reaction wheels, and control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). The actuators are mounted in a known configuration with an unknown orientation relative to the unknown spacecraft principal axes. We demonstrate effective attitude control capability without relying on inertia matrix characterization. Lastly, we develop a forward-propagating Riccati-based linear time-varying feedback controller. We show that if the closed-loop dynamics matrix is symmetric, then the Forward-Propagating Riccati (FPR) controller is asymptotically stabilizing. We also show {{that in the case of}} periodic systems there exists a period below which the dynamics of the closed-loop system are asymptotically stable. Additionally, we show that there is a separation of estimator and FPR regulator dynamics and thus FPR control may be used in an output feedback configuration. We apply the FPR controller to both a magnetically actuated spacecraft and to a maneuvering spacecraft in an elliptic orbit...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{segment is}} one of three {{segments}} of each satellite navigation systems (SNS). Nowadays two SNSs, GPS and GLONASS, are fully operational, two next SNSs, BeiDou in China and Galileo in Europe, are in final phase of the construction. In the case of China system this segment will consist of 35 satellites with three types of orbits ? medium (MEO), geostationary (GEO) and inclined geosynchronous (IGSO). As GEO and IGSO satellites can be used in China and Asia-Pacific region only, BeiDou MEO constellation with 27 fully operational satellites will be taken into account in this paper. The orbital planes of the Galileo constellation will be divided in “slots” that contains at least one operational satellite. The Galileo reference constellation has 24 <b>nominal</b> <b>orbital</b> <b>positions</b> or operational slots in MEO homogeneously distributed in 3 orbital planes; i. e. 8 slots equally spaced per plane. As the error of user’s position obtained from both systems depends on geometry factor DOP (Dilution Of Precision) among other things the knowledge of the number of satellites visible by the user above given masking elevation angle Hmin and the distributions of DOP coefficient values, GDOP in particular, is very important. The lowest and the greatest number of satellites visible in open area by the observer at different latitudes for different Hmin, the percentage of satellites visible above angle H, distributions (in per cent) of satellites azimuths and GDOP coefficient values for different Hmin for BeiDou and Galileo systems at different latitudes are presented in the paper...|$|R
