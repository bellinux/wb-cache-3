According to a Norton Protection Blog {{post in the}} Norton Community, titled [...] "What's new in Norton Internet Security 2012":"With 2012 we are introducing SONAR Policy Enforcement - We now {{have the ability to}} convict a suspicious process based on a behavioral “profile.” To create these profiles, an analyst looks at the 500+ attributes that SONAR tracks and make a series of associations. For example, let’s say a particular process tried to access the system folder and tried to call home, but does not have any running UI. Also, it downloaded more than 15 files the previous day. Any one of these things alone may not be “bad” but taken as a whole, the behavioral profile is bad. The analyst will therefore make a rule that says if we see this string of behaviors, then we should stop the process from executing. Doing all of this is a big deal--we aren’t just looking at what the process does on your computer, we are also looking at its communication characteristics!Sonar 4.0 also introduces protection against <b>Non</b> <b>Process</b> Threats (NPTs). As the name suggests, these threats are not active processes by themselves, but they inject themselves into legitimate active processes. SONAR 4.0 technology is able to much more aggressively remove threats on pre-infected machines." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cost-benefit}} outlook {{of black}} liquor gasification (BLG) could be greatly improved if the smelt causticization step {{could be achieved}} in situ during the gasification step. Or, at a minimum, the increase in causticizing load associated with BLG could be mitigated. A number of chemistries have been proven successful during black liquor combustion. In this project, three in situ causticizing processes (titanate, manganate, and borate) were evaluated under conditions suitable for high temperature entrained flow BLG, and low temperature steam reforming of black liquor. The evaluation included both thermodynamic modeling and lab experimentation. Titanate and manganate were tested for complete direct causticizing (to thus eliminate the lime cycle), and borates were evaluated for partial causticizing (to mitigate the load increase associated with BLG). Criteria included high carbonate conversion, corresponding hydroxide recovery upon hydrolysis, <b>non</b> <b>process</b> element (NPE) removal, and economics. Of the six cases (three chemistries at two BLG conditions), only two {{were found to be}} industrially viable: titanates for complete causticizing during high temperature BLG, and borates for partial causticizing during high temperature BLG. These two cases were evaluated for integration into a gasification-based recovery island. The Larsen [28] BLG cost-benefit study was used as a reference case for economic forecasting (i. e. a 1500 tpd pulp mill using BLG and upgrading the lime cycle). By comparison, using the titanate direct causticizing process yielded a net present value (NPV) of $ 25 M over the NPV of BLG with conventional lime cycle. Using the existing lime cycle plus borate autocausticizing for extra capacity yielded a NPV of $ 16 M...|$|E

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} mills are high power {{consuming}} industries. Pulp and integrated mills produce power via steam turbines in recovery boilers. Due to high power {{prices and the}} fact that biomass combusted in the recovery boiler is considered as green energy, there is today a desire to always increase the power generation when investing in new recovery boilers. In order to increase power output from the steam turbine the steam data (i. e temperature and pressure) needs to be increased. With higher steam temperature follows a higher risk of corrosion due to the <b>non</b> <b>process</b> element potassium in the boiler fuel. The uncertainties of high temperature corrosion and the unpredictable environment in the furnace makes it difficult to design recovery boilers. This results in higher investment cost and could lead to less profit for the mill buying the boiler. The question then stands whether the revenue obtained from the higher power generation, is higher than the investment made for the upgrade in order to produce the higher steam data over a certain time. And more specifically what steam data will be the most economical, when comparing revenue from power generation with investment cost? In this study, together with ÅF Industry AB, four boilers with different steam data (Boiler A: 38. 5 bar, 450 °C; Boiler B: 92 bar, 480 °C; Boiler C: 106 bar, 500 °C; Boiler D: 115 bar, 515 °C) were compared. The boilers were compared for four potassium levels: 1. 0 wt%, 1. 5 wt%, 2. 5 wt%, 3. 5 wt%. And two values of power were used, 300 SEK/MWh and 700 SEK/MWh. The marginal differences between the boilers were: the amount of material used in the superheaters in order to produce different steam data; the type of material used in the superheaters and the furnace; whether an ash-treatment system was needed (in order to purge potassium from the process); the turbines and generators; whether a feed water demineralization equipment was needed; the yearly cost for make-up chemicals (due to usage of an ash-treatment system) and the amount of power generated. The boilers investment cost and net yearly revenue were compared {{in order to determine the}} marginal pay-off in years. The most economical choice of boiler for the different potassium levels for 300 SEK/MWh: 1. 0 wt%, Boiler D; 1. 5 wt%, Boiler C; 2. 5 wt%, Boiler B; 3. 5 wt%, Boiler D (A). And for 700 SEK/MWh: 1. 0 wt%, Boiler D; 1. 5 wt%, Boiler C; 2. 5 wt%, Boiler D (B); 3. 5 wt%, Boiler D. The conclusion in this thesis was that the deciding factor is whether the boiler is in need of an ash-treatment system. Higher steam data is preferable as long as ash-treatment can be avoided. However, when comparing two boilers with ash-treatment the one with higher steam data is more feasible. Low steam data, such as boiler A, will never be feasible, regardless of potassium level and value of power...|$|E

40|$|<b>Non</b> {{self-regulating}} (integrating) <b>processes</b> move in an unbounded manner when perturbed in {{open loop}} by a bounded manipulated or disturbance variable. It {{is not uncommon}} for some temperature, level, and pressure control loops to display this type of behavior.

An additional challenge is that the controllers and tuning methods proven for self regulating processes can yield poor and often unstable performance when applied to integrating processes. A rule based methodology for controller selection and design for <b>non</b> self-regulating <b>processes</b> is developed and documented. This work fills the gaps of previous research by providing a completely characterized set of controller design strategies encompassing a wide range of <b>non</b> self-regulating <b>processes</b> and control objectives.
