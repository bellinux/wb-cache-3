40|$|Double-pulsed 2 -micron {{integrated}} path {{differential absorption}} (IPDA) lidar {{is well suited}} for atmospheric CO 2 remote sensing. The IPDA lidar technique relies on wavelength differentiation between strong and weak absorbing features of the gas normalized to the transmitted energy. In the double-pulse case, each shot of the transmitter produces two successive laser pulses separated by a short interval. Calibration of the transmitted pulse energies is required for accurate CO 2 measurement. Design and calibration of a 2 -micron double-pulse laser energy monitor is presented. The design {{is based on an}} InGaAs pin <b>quantum</b> <b>detector.</b> A high-speed photo-electromagnetic <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> was used for laser-pulse profile verification. Both <b>quantum</b> <b>detectors</b> were calibrated using a reference pyroelectric thermal detector. Calibration included comparing the three detection technologies in the single-pulsed mode, then comparing the <b>quantum</b> <b>detectors</b> in the double-pulsed mode. In addition, a self-calibration feature of the 2 -micron IPDA lidar is presented. This feature allows one to monitor the transmitted laser energy, through residual scattering, with a single detection channel. This reduces the CO 2 measurement uncertainty. IPDA lidar ground validation for CO 2 measurement is presented for both calibrated energy monitor and self-calibration options. The calibrated energy monitor resulted in a lower CO 2 measurement bias, while self-calibration resulted in a better CO 2 temporal profiling when compared to the in situ sensor...|$|R

Quantum optics relies upon detectors sensitive to non-classical features of light, enabling precise tests of physical laws and quantum-enhanced technologies such as precision measurement and secure communications.

To address this requirement <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> tomography (QDT) has been recently introduced.

40|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>detectors</b> provide {{information}} about quantum systems by establishing correlations between certain properties of those systems {{and a set of}} macroscopically distinct states of the corresponding measurement devices. A natural question of fundamental significance is how much information a <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> can extract from the quantum system it is applied to. In the present paper we address this question within a precise framework: given a <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> implementing a specific generalized quantum measurement, what is the optimal performance achievable with it for a concrete information readout task, and what is the optimal way to encode information in the quantum system in order to achieve this performance? We consider some of the most common information transmission tasks - the Bayes cost problem (of which minimal error discrimination is a special case), unambiguous message discrimination, and the maximal mutual information. We provide general solutions to the Bayesian and unambiguous discrimination problems. We also show that the maximal mutual information has an interpretation of a capacity of the measurement, and derive various properties that it satisfies, including its relation to the accessible information of an ensemble of states, and its form {{in the case of a}} group-covariant measurement. We illustrate our results with the example of a noisy two-level symmetric informationally complete measurement, for whose capacity we give analytical proofs of optimality. The framework presented here provides a natural way to characterize generalized quantum measurements in terms of their information readout capabilities.

40|$|The {{low-temperature}} {{limit of}} charge qubit decoherence {{due to its}} Coulomb interaction with electrons tunneling through Luttinger liquid quantum-point contact (QPC) is investigated. The study is focused on <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> properties of Luttinger liquid QPC. Efficiency of Luttinger liquid qurrent-carrying quantum point-contact (QPC) as <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> for the coupled charge qubit quantum state {{is characterized by the}} ratio of decoherence time and the acquisition of information time and how both depend on electron-electron interaction has remained an interesting open question. Here this question is answered in its most challenging zero- (and near zero-) temperature realization where the latter two characteristic inverse time-scales (i. e. corresponding rates), both tends to zero shadowing true picture of quantum detection in the zero-temperature limit. In order to resolve this difficulty two important mathematical statements (S-theorem and S-lemma) have been proven here for the first time. As the result, it was established here that low-temperature properties of QPC <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> with 1 D electrodes are defined explicitly by the competition between two different time-scales those reflecting two different types of physical processes in the system. These processes are: i) the orthogonality catastrophe-type decoherence of charge-qubit, one is analogous to the decay of Kondo-resonance narrowed by QPC plasmons; ii) Kane-Fisher suppression of the electron tunneling through Luttinger liquid QPC resulting in the divergence of electron tunneling time. In particular, it has been found that at temperatures close to zero there exists a certain well-defined threshold value $ g=g_{cr} $ of Luttinger liquid correlation parameter which serves as a sharp boundary between region of good (or even perfect) quantum detection at $ gg_{cr} $...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the role}} of {{coherence}} in determining the distribution of work done on a quantum system? We approach this question from an operational perspective and consider a setup in which the internal energy of a closed system is recorded by a <b>quantum</b> <b>detector</b> before and after the system is acted upon by an external drive. We find that the resulting work distribution depends on the initial state of the detector {{as well as on the}} choice of the final measurement. We consider two complementary measurement schemes, both of which show clear signatures of quantum interference. We specifically discuss how to implement these schemes in the circuit QED architecture, using an artificial atom as the system and a quantized mode of the electromagnetic field as the detector. Different measurement schemes can be realized by preparing the field either in a superposition of Fock states or in a coherent state and exploiting state-of-the art techniques for the characterization of microwave radiation at the quantum level.

When feedback is used to quantum systems, two major types of feedback control protocols including coherent feedback control (CFC) and measurement-based feedback control (MFC) have been developed.
