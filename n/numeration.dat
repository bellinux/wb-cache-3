On a note more distantly related to combinatorics, the second section also discusses the general formula for sums of integer powers; the free coefficients of this formula are therefore called the Bernoulli numbers, which influenced Abraham de Moivre's work later, and which have proven to have numerous applications in number theory.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that most early peoples which have left records knew {{something}} of <b>numeration</b> and mechanics, and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying.

25|$|The Greeks {{employed}} Attic <b>numeration,</b> {{which was}} based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the Romans. Greek numerals one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter Π (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, pente. Numbers six through nine were pente with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (Δ) of the word for ten, deka, one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.|$|E

25|$|Sexagesimal numerals were a mixed radix {{system that}} {{retained}} the alternating base10 and base6 {{in a sequence}} of cuneiform vertical wedges and chevrons. By 1950BC, this was a positional notation system. Sexagesimal numerals came to be widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians.

25|$|A decimal {{number system}} using hieroglyphics {{dates back to}} 3000 BC in Egypt, and was later in use in ancient India where the modern <b>numeration</b> system was developed.

The concept of 0 as a number, and not merely a symbol for separation is attributed to India. In India, practical calculations were carried out using zero, which was treated like any other number by the 9th century CE, even in case of division. Brahmagupta (598–668) was able to find (integral) solutions of Pell's equation. Conceptual design for a perpetual motion machine by Bhaskara II dates to 1150.

25|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as the T1G (and chassis 101 as the T1F), Dan Gurney has stated that this was never the car's official designation. Instead, the car was simply the Eagle Mark 1. Hence, the four chassis produced were numbered 101, 102, 103 and 104 (the Ti-Mag car). The Indianapolis sister cars were the Mk2, with subsequent Indy designs also taking model numbers 3 and 4. The Mk5 was a Formula Atlantic car adapted from the Mk 4 chassis, while Mk6 was the designation given to the still-born Formula One successor to the Mk1. With AAR's withdrawal from Grand Prix racing at the end of 1968, the team switched to a year-based chassis <b>numeration</b> scheme, with Indy chassis from 1971 onward taking numbers (e.g. 71xx) according to their year of design.|$|E

50|$|Although various {{scholars}} {{had mentioned}} about <b>numerations</b> in the Sinhala language in their writing on Sinhala language, a systematic study {{had not been}} conducted up to now on numerals and <b>numerations</b> found in Sinhala right before British occupation of Kandy. In modern Sinhala, Arabic numerals, which were introduced by Portuguese, Dutch and English, is used for writing numbers and carrying out calculations. Roman numerals are used for writing dates and for listing items or words in Sinhala though at present, Roman numerals are not commonly used and they were also introduced by Westerners who invaded Sri Lanka. It is accepted that Arabic numerals had evolved from Brahmi numerals. It had also been discovered by Sri Lankan archeologists that Brahmi numerals {{were used in the}} ancient Sri Lanka and it may have evolved into two sets of numerals which were known as archaic Sinhala numerals and Lith Illakkum which were found in the Kandyan period. This paper mainly covers numerals and <b>numerations</b> in Sri Lanka at the time of British occupation of the Kandyan Kingdom and their evolution to the forms which were found in 1815, the year the British occupied the whole of Sri Lanka.

25|$|On December 20, 1920, Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky {{created the}} Foreign Department (Innostranny Otdel—INO), {{made up of}} the Management office (INO chief and two deputies), chancellery, agents department, visas bureau and foreign sections. In 1922, after the {{creation}} of the State Political Directorate (GPU) and connecting it with People's Commisariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) of the Russian SFSR, foreign intelligence was conducted by the GPU Foreign Department, and between December 1923 and July 1934 by the Foreign Department of Joint State Political Directorate or OGPU. In July 1934, OGPU was reincorporated into NKVD of the Soviet Union, and renamed the Main Directorate of State Security (GUGB). Until October 9, 1936, INO was operated inside the GUGB organization as one of its departments. Then, for conspiracy purposes, People's Commissar of Internal Affairs Nikolai Yezhov, in his order #00362 had introduced a <b>numeration</b> of departments in the GUGB organization, hence Foreign Department or INO of the GUGB became GUGB's Department 7, and later Department 5. By 1941, foreign intelligence was given the highest status and from department it was enlarged to directorate. The name too was changed from INO (Innostranny Otdiel), to INU—Inostrannoye Upravleniye, Foreign Directorate. During the following years, Soviet security and intelligence organs went through frequent organizational changes. From February to July 1941, foreign intelligence was the responsibility of the recently created new administration the People's Commissariat of State Security (NKGB) and was working in its structure as a 1st Directorate and, after the July 1941 organizational changes, as a 1st Directorate of the People's Commisariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD).|$|E
25|$|The {{variance}} between Massorah and Septuagint {{texts in}} this <b>numeration</b> is likely enough {{due to a}} gradual neglect of the original poetic form of the Psalms; such neglect was occasioned by liturgical uses and carelessness of copyists. It is generally admitted that Pss. 9 and 10 were originally a single acrostic poem; they have been wrongly separated by Massorah, rightly united by the Septuagint and Vulgate. Pss. 42 and 43 are shown by identity of subject (yearning for the house of Jahweh), of metrical structure and of refrain (cf. Heb. Ps. 42:6, 12; 43:5), to be three strophes of {{one and the same}} poem. The Hebrew text is correct in counting as one Ps. 146 and Ps. 147. Later liturgical usage would seem to have split up these and several other psalms. Zenner combines into what he deems were the original choral odes: Pss. 1, 2, 3, 4; 6 + 13; 9 + 10; 19, 20, 21; 56 + 57; 69 + 70; 114 + 115; 148, 149, 150. A choral ode would seem to have been the original form of Pss. 14 and 70. The two strophes and the epode are Ps. 14; the two antistrophes are Ps. 70. It is noteworthy that, on the breaking up of the original ode, each portion crept twice into the Psalter: Ps. 14 = 53, Ps. 70 = 40:14–18. Other such duplicated portions of psalms are Ps. 108:2–6 = Ps. 57:8–12; Ps. 108:7–14 = Ps. 60:7–14; Ps. 71:1–3 = Ps. 31:2–4. This loss of the original form of some of the psalms is allowed by the Biblical Commission (1 May 1910) to have been due to liturgical practices, neglect by copyists, or other causes.|$|E

40|$|Current {{versions}} of Chomskyan syntax {{take for granted}} that syntactic derivations depend on prior specification of complete "numerations" of lexical items, which then combine according {{to the principles of}} syntax. However, competence models have provided no ways to choose such numerations; they are either chosen randomly or based on the intuition of (ultimately native) speakers. In neither case is there any scientific characterization of these objects, and so syntactic derivations lose their status as a scientific model. This essay claims that <b>numerations</b> in a plausible formal model of language can be conceived as random (or, formally equivalently, pragmatically determined) only if syntactic derivations can supplement them in a highly constrained way: by adding to them items from a special lexical subcomponent of purely grammatical or "closed class 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 items.
