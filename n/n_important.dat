50|$|Initially, {{genetic mapping}} {{of the mouse}} class I antigens {{suggested}} the existence of multiple class I loci in the H2 complex. Soon, however, inconsistencies in the assignment of certain antigens to loci signaled that something was amiss with the H2 maps, as they were then drawn. Klein and Donald C. Shreffler solved the problem by demonstrating that a given antigen could be present on molecules controlled by different loci. Taking this finding into account, {{they were able to}} reduce the number of the class I loci to two, H2K and H2D. This “two-locus model” played a <b>n</b> <b>important</b> part in subsequent interpretations of the Mhc. The model was also consistent with the results of earlier Klein’s PhD work, in which he discovered that immune selection for a loss of certain H2 antigens on somatic cells was accompanied by the loss of some but not other unselected antigens. In this respect, the antigens fell into two groups as if carried by two different molecules. The discovery of the class II genes had been fitted into the model by the demonstration that they mapped between the H2K and the H2D. Shreffler also demonstrated the existence of another locus mapping between the two class I loci. It coded for what he called the “serum serological” or Ss protein, present in a soluble form in the blood fluid phase, in contrast to the class I and class II antigens, which were expressed on cell surfaces. At that stage, the H2 complex could be divided into four regions: class I (H2K)…Class II (Ir-1)…Ss…Class I (H2D).|$|E

40|$|Roads, in {{particular}} rural roads, {{play a major}} role in deve- lopment. In Ethiopia, where the vast majority of the popula- tion depends on agricultural production, this is even more so, and the country’s road network has become a major po- licy issue with significant consequences for the population. An extensive network of 114, 397 km of different roads has been constructed, maintained, and classified to date. Alt- hough community roads account for nearly two-thirds of the country’s total road network, virtually no work deals specifically with issues related to their construction.
