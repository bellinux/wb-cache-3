5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E

25|$|The Fool {{does not}} follow any ideology. He rejects all appearances, of law, justice, moral order. He sees brute force, cruelty and lust.

Lear, insisting on his fictitious majesty, seems ridiculous to him. All the more ridiculous because he does <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> ridiculous he is.

He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E

25|$|I {{have further}} shown cause for the belief that direct selection, after the fashion of the {{horticulturist}} and the breeder, neither has played, nor can play, any important part {{in the evolution of}} society; apart from other reasons, because I do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> such selection could be practiced without a serious weakening, it may be the destruction, of the bonds which hold society together. It strikes me that men who are accustomed to contemplate the active or passive extirpation of the weak, the unfortunate, and the superfluous; who justify that conduct on the ground that it has the sanction of the cosmic process, and is the only way of ensuring the progress of the race; who, if they are consistent, must rank medicine among the black arts and count the physician a mischievous preserver of the unfit; on whose matrimonial undertakings the principles of the stud have the chief influence; whose whole lives, therefore, are an education in the noble art of suppressing natural affection and sympathy, are not likely to have any large stock of these commodities left. But, without them, there is no conscience, nor any restraint on the conduct of men, except the calculation of self-interest, the balancing of certain present gratifications against doubtful future pains; and experience tells us how much that is worth. Every day, we see firm believers in the hell of the theologians commit acts by which, as they believe when cool, they risk eternal punishment; while they hold back from those which are opposed to the sympathies of their associates.|$|E

[...] Gonzalez gave the duet a [...] "B", as, while there was [...] "so much to swoon for", she is more partial to ballads because they [...] "discourage oversinging throughout the entire song". Futterman wrote that while Mercedes had more sass than Rachel, [...] "both ladies sang". VanDerWerff did <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the song was relevant, and felt that Michele's voice was ill-suited to it.|$|E
500|$|Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University {{wrote that}} in a liberal {{democracy}} freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from [...] "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons [...] "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its {{way of life is}} threatened. I do <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." [...] He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.|$|E
500|$|Sabahans and Sarawakians could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> {{they would}} benefit from merger. Many {{regarded}} Malaya as being only for the Malays, a group they did not include themselves in. The spectre of [...] "Malaysia" [...] — {{the inclusion of the}} phrase [...] "Malay" [...] being considered frightening — with its official religion of Islam and official language of Malay, did nothing to soothe their fears of [...] "Malay domination". For merger to come about, they insisted the natives of Sabah and Sarawak be awarded the same privileges as Malays. A 20-point agreement between Sabah and the Malayan government, and a slightly different 18-point agreement by Sarawak, was later agreed upon. After much negotiation and a show of support from the British for merger, the impasse was resolved. Although natives of Borneo were denied the privileges of Malays, merger was effected on 16 September 1963.|$|E

500|$|Chief Justice Yong Pung How {{rejected}} {{this conception}} of public order. He noted that Singapore had {{a policy of}} compulsory military service known as National Service, and that the Minister had taken {{the view that the}} continued existence of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, which held the belief that military service was forbidden, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. As such, since the Minister had formed the view that the Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to national security, it was not open to the court to take a different view on the matter. Yong C.J. said in his judgment: [...] "I could <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the concept of public order as envisaged under Art 15(4) is dissimilar to the notion of public peace, welfare and good order within s 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act." [...] He emphasized that the right to religious freedom was not an absolute right as it was subject to the inherent limitations set out in Article 15(4). The right of freedom of religion had to be reconciled with the [...] "right of the state to employ the sovereign power to ensure peace, security and orderly living, without which the constitutional guarantee of civil liberty would be a mockery". Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster {{primarily}} illustrated his concept of the [...] "round" [...] character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' Jane Austen and Her Art—"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study" [...] of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her [...] "narrative art". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale [...] "so small that the reader does <b>not</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them". She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism {{and that it was}} becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.|$|E
