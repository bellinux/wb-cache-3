5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all he <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{was that}} the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle.

5000|$|As {{with other}} forms of {{inversion}} of control, dependency injection supports the dependency inversion principle.

Prisoners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> their countries’ and their families’ situation, a fact well understood by the German authorities. Several sets of newspapers intended for prisoners were printed so that rumours would spread, in particular through mail to their families. In order to sap the enemy’s morale, each newspaper had its targeted recipient group. For British prisoners, The Continental Times was printed; by 1916, this journal had a circulation of 15,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 the Soviet Red Army {{advanced}} {{to the outskirts of}} Vilnius. This change in the tides of war brought both joy and fear to the surviving Jews of the HKP camp who understood that the SS would try to kill them {{in the days before the}} German retreat. Many prepared for this eventuality by discreetly making hiding places in the camp in secret bunkers, in walls, and in the rafters of the attic. A large and crucial unknown was one of timing — the prisoners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when the SS killing squads were coming so they could successfully implement plans to escape or hide. As the sounds of fighting grew closer the level of tension within the camp became palpable.|$|E
25|$|Martí as a liberator {{believed}} that the Latin American countries <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the reality of their own history. Martí also saw {{the necessity of a}} country having its own literature. These reflections started in Mexico from 1875 and are connected to the Mexican Reform, where prominent people like Ignacio Manuel Altamirano and Guillermo Prieto had situated themselves in front of a cultural renovation in Mexico, taking on the same approach as Esteban Echeverría thirty years before in Argentina. In the second “Boletin” that Martí published in the Revista Universal (May 11, 1875) one can already see Martí’s approach, which was fundamentally Latin American. His wish to build a national or Latin American identity was nothing new or unusual in those days; however, no Latin-American intellectual of that time had approached as clearly as Martí the task of building a national identity. He insisted on the necessity of building institutions and laws that matched the natural elements of each country, and recalled the failure of the applications of French and American civil codes in the new Latin American republics. Martí {{believed that}} “el hombre del sur”, the man of the South, should choose an appropriate development strategy matching his character, the peculiarity of his culture and history, and the nature that determined his being.|$|E

These performances are fantasy sequences, playing out in the character's mind and portraying his internal creative processes as comedic monologues; these monologues mainly employ material from the character's failing marriage and are intended to show that [...] "he thinks in punchlines, in comedy".

Moffat felt that audiences <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{from the start that}} the relationship would not survive. However, it was unclear to some viewers that the fantasy sequences were set in the writer's mind; many journalists reported that the character Mark was a stand-up comic, not a sitcom writer.|$|E
