5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become <b>new</b> <b>species.</b> Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these <b>new</b> <b>species</b> can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing <b>new</b> <b>species</b> of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica {{populations in}} Europe were first {{found in the}} Netherlands in 1995. During a species inventory, several {{specimens}} of an unknown caprellid were recovered by Platvoet et al. from artificial structures {{in and around the}} Neeltje-Jans and the Eastern Scheldt storm surge barrier in Burghsluis, Zeeland. As with the case of the first discovery of C.mutica in North America, Platvoet et al. initially misidentified them as a <b>new</b> <b>species.</b> Remarking upon the resemblance of the caprellids to C.acanthogaster, they named it Caprella macho. They were later discovered to be introduced populations of C.mutica rather than a <b>new</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, the dodo was {{assigned}} the genus Didus, now a junior synonym of Raphus. In 1848, a <b>new</b> <b>species</b> within the now defunct genus Didus, D. nazarenus, was named by Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville. To house their <b>new</b> <b>species,</b> {{as well as}} the other species known at the time, Strickland and Melville named the subfamily Didinae. In 1893 three species were assigned to the group Pezophaps solitarius, Didus ineptus, and the possible species Didus borbonicus. Today, only two raphine species are known, with Didus ineptus becoming a junior subjective synonym of Raphus cucullatus; Didus? borbonicus now classified as the ibis Threskiornis solitarius; and Didus nazarenus being identified as synonymous with Pezophaps solitarius.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos {{described}} a <b>new</b> <b>species</b> of giant mouse lemur, the northern giant mouse lemur (M.zaza). Their studies compared the morphology, behavioral ecology, and mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences of specimens from both Kirindy Forest in central-western Madagascar and around Ambato in northwestern Madagascar, {{part of the}} Sambirano valley. Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, sociality, and breeding, as well as sufficient genetic distance to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description {{was based on a}} southern specimen, they named the northern population as a <b>new</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
