5|$|Although a 12th-century monastic chronicler at Worcester called Leofric Edward's {{chancellor}}, {{this is not}} correct, as Edward had no chancellor at this time.

5|$|Although {{they could}} <b>not</b> <b>hold</b> the city, the 24th Infantry Division {{achieved}} a strategic victory by delaying the North Koreans, providing time for other American divisions {{to establish a}} defensive perimeter around Pusan further south.

The remainder of his career was spent in non-operational positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and his penchant for drinking.|$|E

Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E

This has sometimes led to accusations of sharing confidential information or re-packaging a competitor's tactics as best practices.|$|E
