40|$|The {{oxygen and}} carbon {{monoxide}} binding to erythrocytes, hemolysate and purified hemoglobin components {{from the blood}} of four species of Antarctic fishes (Notothenia coriiceps neglecta, Notothenia rossii, <b>Notothenia</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> and Parachaenichthys charcoti) was investigated. The blood from all the fishes studied displayed the Root effect and the functional properties of hemoglobin {{were found to be}} finely regulated by pH and organic phosphates. The results presented indicate an important physiological role for the blood pigment of nototheniids and bathydraconids, in spite of the noting fact that they share the habitat of hemoglobin-less fishes. In particular, {{it is worth noting that}} these fishes possess the choroid rete, one of the two organs that require the oxygen-pumping mechanism mediated by a Root-effect hemoglobin...|$|E
40|$|Bottom trawls at 8 {{stations}} and at depths from about 200 to 400 m {{were carried out}} {{to the north of}} the South Shetland Islands. Thirty-six species of fish belonging to 9 families were caught. <b>Notothenia</b> <b>gibberifrons,</b> Chionodraco rastrospinosus, Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and 2 Rajidae made up about 80 % of the number of fish caught. The dominant species was N. gibberifrons accounting for 51. 9 % of the total number of individuals and 44. 7 % of the total weight. It is shown that the krill (Euphausia superba, DANA) is an important food item in the diet of these demersal fish and that while many nototheniid species supplement their diet with benthic organisms, channichthyid species supplement their diets with other fish. The significance of these results is discussed in relation to the distribution of the krill and to the ecological role of the krill in the Antarctic food chain...|$|E
40|$|Fish (<b>Notothenia</b> <b>gibberifrons)</b> {{collected}} in pristine Antarctic sites were injected with Diesel Fuel Arctic (DFA). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) {{was used to}} identify and quantify polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites obtained from hydrolyzed fish bile. The concentrations of naphthols (NPH), phenanthrenols (PHN), dibenzothiophenols (DBT), and total PAH metabolites (∑PAH) vary with time. The response curve (production of PAH metabolites vs. time) resembled a Sigmoid curve, with an initial low response at 24 h followed by a rapid rise in production of PAH metabolites (55. 74 μg/g) 120 h after exposure to DFA. PAH metabolites identified include NPH, PHN, and DBT and their alkylated derivatives, reflecting {{the composition of the}} DFA to which the fish were exposed. The GC/MS technique is highly sensitive, particularly in the detection of multi-ring PAH metabolites. The results suggest that analysis of PAH metabolites is a valuable tool for environmental monitoring and assessment of exposure to petroleum...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic notothenioid fishes present specializations {{related to}} their chronically cold environment, such as high lipid content in tissues (predominantly triacylglycerols, TAG). When TAGs are mobilized, they yield fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids are the primary fuel of {{oxidative}} muscle tissues. Gluconeogenesis from glycerol has not been studied in Antarctic fishes despite the importance of glycerol as a breakdown product of TAGs. To assess the possible importance of glycerol as a substrate for gluconeogenesis and to determine whether this pathway and Krebs cycle are metabolically cold adapted, key hepatic enzyme activities were measured in Antarctic notothenioid fishes (<b>Notothenia</b> coriiceps, Gobionotothen <b>gibberifrons</b> and Chionodraco rastrospinosus) an...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{responsive}} to hypercapnia (elevated CO 2 concentrations) and shaping branchial energy turnover were investigated in isolated perfused gills of two Antarctic Notothenioids (Gobionotothen <b>gibberifrons,</b> <b>Notothenia</b> coriiceps). Branchial oxygen consumption was measured under normo- versus hypercapnic conditions (10, 000 ppm CO 2) at high extracellular pH values. The fractional costs of ion regulation, protein and RNA synthesis {{in the energy}} budgets were determined using specific inhibitors. Overall gill energy turnover was maintained under pH compensated hypercapnia in both Antarctic species {{as well as in}} a temperate zoarcid (Zoarces viviparus). However, fractional energy consumption by the examined processes rose drastically in G. gibberifrons (100 - 180 %), {{and to a lesser extent}} in N. coriiceps gills (7 - 56 %). In conclusion, high CO 2 concentrations under conditions of compensated acidosis induce cost increments in epithelial processes, however, at maintained overall rates of branchial energy turnover...|$|R
40|$|Species {{composition}} of the bottom trawl collection from the adjacent waters of the South Shetland Islands was represented {{by the number of}} species and specimens. Descriptions of the embryos and the egg-capsules of the rajid fishes and of Trematomus hansoni with abnormally developed lower lateral line were given. Two species discovered for the first time from West Antarctica were also described. A total of 3576 specimens examined were referred to 9 families and 36 species. <b>Notothenia</b> <b>gibberifrons</b> was by far the commonest (50. 2 % of fishes examined) and was the dominant species at most of stations. Gymnoscopelus nicholsi and Chionodraco rastrospinosus were the second in abundance. In comparison with the channichthyid fishes collected from the Ross Sea in 1979,it seemed that the genus Chionodraco was the dominant genus among the family Channichthyidae in both areas. Pogonophryne scotti and Chionodraco myersi, which had been recorded only from East Antarctica, were collected for the first time. The circumpolar distribution of P. scotti and C. myersi was inferred from the present records of these species from West Antarctica...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic {{mitochondrial}} and peroxisomal beta-oxidation {{were examined}} in an Antarctic marine teleost, <b>Notothenia</b> <b>gibberifrons.</b> Enzymic profiles and rates of beta-oxidation by intact organelles were determined by using a range of fatty acyl-CoA substrates to evaluate substrate preferences. Partitioning of beta-oxidation between organelles was estimated. Substrate selectivities are broader for peroxisomal beta-oxidation than for mitochondrial beta-oxidation. Mitochondria show marked preference for the oxidation of a monounsaturated substrate, palmitoleoyl-CoA (C 16 : 1), and two polyunsaturates, eicosapentaenoyl-CoA (C 20 : 5) and docosahexaenoyl-CoA (C 22 : 6). Carnitine palmitoyltransferase activities with palmitoleoyl-CoA (C 16 : 1) are 2. 4 -fold higher than activities with palmitoyl-CoA (C 16 : 0). Most polyunsaturated acyl-CoA esters measured appear to inhibit by over 40 % the oxidation of palmitoyl-CoA by peroxisomes. Our {{findings suggest that the}} polyunsaturates, eicosapentaenoic acid (C 20 : 5) and docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6), found in high concentrations in Antarctic fishes [Lund and Sidell (1992) Mar. Biol. 112, 377 - 382], are utilized as fuels to support aerobic energy metabolism. Metabolic capacities of rate-limiting enzymes and beta-oxidation rates by intact organelles indicate that up to 30 % of hepatic beta-oxidation in N. gibberifrons can be initiated by the peroxisomal pathway...|$|E
