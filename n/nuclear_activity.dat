5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations as leaders in the field, and the fear of Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> were taken very seriously. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
25|$|The first direct {{proof that}} {{nucleosynthesis}} occurs in stars was the astronomical observation that interstellar gas has become enriched with heavy elements as time passed. As a result, stars that were born from it {{late in the}} galaxy, formed with much higher initial heavy element abundances than those that had formed earlier. The detection of technetium in the atmosphere of a red giant star in 1952, by spectroscopy, provided the first evidence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> within stars. Because technetium is radioactive, with a half-life {{much less than the}} age of the star, its abundance must reflect its recent creation within that star. Equally convincing evidence of the stellar origin of heavy elements, is the large overabundances of specific stable elements found in stellar atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch stars. Observation of barium abundances some 20-50 times greater than found in unevolved stars is evidence of the operation of the s-process within such stars. Many modern proofs of stellar nucleosynthesis are provided by the isotopic compositions of stardust, solid grains that have condensed from the gases of individual stars and which have been extracted from meteorites. Stardust is one component of cosmic dust, and is frequently called presolar grains. The measured isotopic compositions in stardust grains demonstrate many aspects of nucleosynthesis within the stars from which the grains condensed during the star's late-life mass-loss episodes.|$|E

40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency State Evaluation Process: The Role of Information Analysis in Reaching Safeguards Conclusions (Mathews et al. 2008), several {{examples}} of nonproliferation models using analytical software were developed that may assist the IAEA with collecting, visualizing, analyzing, and reporting information {{in support of}} the State Evaluation Process. This paper focuses on one of the examples a set of models developed in the Proactive Scenario Production, Evidence Collection, and Testing (ProSPECT) software that evaluates the status and nature of a state’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities.</b> The models use three distinct subject areas to perform this assessment: the presence of <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities,</b> the consistency of those <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> with national <b>nuclear</b> energy goals, and the geopolitical context in which those <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> are taking place. As a proof-of-concept for the models, a crude case study was performed. The study, which attempted to evaluate the <b>nuclear</b> <b>activities</b> taking place in Syria prior to September 2007, yielded illustrative, yet inconclusive, results. Due to the inconclusive nature of the case study results, changes that may improve the model’s efficiency and accuracy are proposed...|$|R

2500|$|After {{the end of}} {{military}} rule in 1985, a new Constitution was approved in 1988 that remains in force today.

2500|$|On 31 July, the Security Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} demanding that Iran stop [...] "all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities".

A month later, an IAEA report indicated that [...] "there are no indications of ongoing reprocessing activities in Iran," [...] but that other elements of <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> and the use of centrifuges had continued or resumed. The IAEA also said that Iran did not submit a timetable to the IAEA to resolve its nuclear program, as Iran had promised. The report also said that construction of the heavy water research reactor at Arak had continued.|$|E
2500|$|Amid the {{unfolding}} political transition post-dictatorship, a new Constitution was drafted in 1987–1988, for which Brazil’s nuclear development program became {{a focal point}} of debate.

[...] While current official discourse often presents this decree as a unilateral guarantee that Brazil will never build nuclear artifacts, {{at the time of the}} new Constitution Brazil was still arguing for the legality of peaceful nuclear explosions—and oral history evidence points to the notion that those drafting the constitution sought to incorporate language consistent with such technologies. Brazil would only renounce nuclear explosions in 1990, two years after the Constitution was passed.|$|E

2500|$|Iran also {{minimizes}} {{the significance of}} the IAEA's inability to verify the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, arguing the IAEA has only drawn such conclusions in a subset of states that have ratified and implemented the Additional Protocol. The IAEA has been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran, but not the absence of undeclared activities. According to the IAEA's Safeguards Statement for 2007, of the 82 states where both NPT safeguards and an Additional Protocol are implemented, the IAEA had found no indication of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> in 47 states, while evaluations of possible undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity</b> remained ongoing in 35 states. Iran ceased implementation of the Additional Protocol and all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond that required under its safeguards agreement after the IAEA Board of Governors decided to report its safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. Iran insisted that such cooperation had been [...] "voluntary," [...] but on 26 December 2006, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1737, invoking Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which among other things required Iran to cooperate fully with the IAEA, [...] "beyond the formal requirements of the Safeguards Agreement and Additional Protocol." [...] The IAEA reported on 19 November 2008, that, while it is [...] "able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran," [...] it [...] "has not been able to make substantive progress" [...] on [...] "key remaining issues of serious concern" [...] because of a [...] "lack of cooperation by Iran." [...] Iran has maintained that the Security Council's engagement in [...] "the issue of the peaceful nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran" [...] are unlawful and malicious. Iran also argues that the UN Security Council resolutions demanding a suspension of enrichment constitute a violation of ArticleIV of the Non-Proliferation Treaty which recognizes the inalienable right of signatory nations to nuclear technology [...] "for peaceful purposes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 19, 2009, the IAEA {{reported}} that samples {{taken from the}} site revealed new traces of processed uranium. A senior UN official said additional analysis of the June find had found 40 more uranium particles, {{for a total of}} 80 particles, and described it as significant. He added that experts were analyzing minute traces of graphite and stainless steel found at and near the site, but said that it was too early to relate them to <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity.</b> The report noted Syria's refusal to allow agency inspectors to make follow-up visits to sites suspected of harboring a secret nuclear program despite repeated requests from top agency officials. Syria disputed these claims. According to Syria's IAEA representative Othman, {{there would have been a}} large amount of graphite had the building been a nuclear reactor. Othman continued, [...] "They found 80 particles in half a million tonnes of soil. I don't know how you can use that figure to accuse somebody of building such a facility." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid August 2007, Israeli commandos {{from the}} Sayeret Matkal {{reconnaissance}} unit covertly raided the suspected Syrian nuclear facility and brought nuclear material back to Israel. Two helicopters ferried twelve commandos {{to the site}} {{in order to get}} photographic evidence and soil samples. The commandos were probably dressed in Syrian uniforms. Although the mission was successful, it had to be aborted earlier than planned after the Israelis were spotted by Syrian soldiers. Soil analysis revealed traces of <b>nuclear</b> <b>activity.</b> There was disagreement between CIA director Michael Hayden and Mossad director Meir Dagan about whether the site should be bombed. Hayden was fearful that this would cause an all-out war, but Dagan was sure that Assad would not react, so long as the bombing was done covertly and not publicized. Anonymous sources reported that once material was tested and confirmed to have come from North Korea, the United States approved an Israeli attack on the site. Senior U.S. officials later claimed that they were not involved in or approved the attack, but were informed in advance. In his memoir Decision Points, President George W. Bush wrote that Prime Minister Olmert requested that the U.S. bomb the Syrian site, but Bush refused, saying the intelligence was not definitive on whether the plant was part of a nuclear weapons program. Bush claimed that Olmert did not ask for a green light for an attack and that he did not give one, but that Olmert acted alone and did what he thought was necessary to protect Israel. Another report indicated that Israel planned to attack the site as early as July 14, but some U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, preferred a public condemnation of Syria, thereby delaying the military strike until Israel feared the information would leak to the press. The Sunday Times also reported that the mission was [...] "personally directed" [...] by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak.|$|E
