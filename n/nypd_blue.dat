5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the third act, Bart argues that modern writers like Steven Bochco, one of the creators of the television series <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> are more talented than Shakespeare. Bochco saw the episode with his children and was so flattered that he sent The Simpsons staff some <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> merchandise. After the ghost of Homer has spoken to Bart, he leaves Bart's room by flying through the wall, causing slime to appear on the wall. This is a reference to Slimer, a ghost from the Ghostbusters franchise who has a similar function.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} told CanWest News Service that {{he hoped}} the documentary would provoke a wider discussion about freedom of speech, sexual slang and its media use. Anderson questioned whether the word should be used on <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> and how parents should discuss its use with their children. He emphasized that artists and filmmakers {{should be free to}} express their views without censorship, deferring to public opinion on the appropriateness of his documentary's title.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{nominated}} for and won several other television awards including the Emmy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

He made his feature film debut in Flight of the Intruder (1991), had a recurring role as a lawyer-turned-vigilante in <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> before auditioning, unsuccessfully, for a series pilot called Couples.

5|$|Carter's initial {{pitch for}} The X-Files was {{rejected}} by Fox executives. He fleshed out the concept and returned a few weeks later, when they commissioned the pilot. Carter worked with <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> producer Daniel Sackheim to further develop the pilot, drawing stylistic inspiration from the 1988 documentary The Thin Blue Line and the British television series Prime Suspect. Inspiration also came from Carter's memories of The Twilight Zone {{as well as from}} The Silence of the Lambs, which provided the impetus for framing the series around agents from the FBI, in order to provide the characters with a more plausible reason for being involved in each case than Carter believed was present in Kolchak. Carter was determined to keep {{the relationship between the two}} leads strictly platonic, basing their interactions on the characters of Emma Peel and John Steed in The Avengers series.|$|E

5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked with not only creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear {{as if they had been}} taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

25|$|The {{pilot was}} {{developed}} by Steven Bochco (who also created such acclaimed series as <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> L.A. Law and Hill Street Blues).

25|$|Diane Holloway, Cox News Service (April 20, 2001) — The {{music is}} big-band smooth, {{the cars are}} shiny with tail fins and the {{dialogue}} is snappy, almost musical. At times conversations sound like fingers rhythmically popping. … The antithesis of today's gritty cop dramas, A's new Nero Wolfe series is slick and classy. Nobody spinning the dial will mistake the lavish sets, fabulous period costumes and moody lighting for <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue.</b> The camera doesn't jiggle; it glides.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Burke {{departed}} from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger. September 1993 saw {{the debut of}} <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> a gritty police procedural from Steven Bochco (who created Doogie Howser, M.D. and the critically pilloried Cop Rock for ABC earlier in the decade); lasting twelve seasons, the drama became known for its boundary pushing of network television standards (particularly its occasional use of graphic language and rear nudity), which led some affiliates to initially refuse to air the show in its first season.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1993 the AFA {{purchased}} full-page ads in The New York Times, USA Today, and Los Angeles Times denouncing the sexual and violent content of the upcoming ABC police drama <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue.</b> It also urged ABC affiliates not to broadcast the program and citizens to boycott sponsors of Blue. About {{a quarter of the}} 225 existing ABC stations followed suit, but such affiliates were mostly in rural areas of the US. The AFA campaign increased hype for the show in larger American media markets, and Blue {{became one of the most}} popular shows of the 1993–1994 television season.|$|E
25|$|Miami Vice was a {{groundbreaking}} police {{program of the}} 1980s. It had a notable impact on the decade's popular fashions and {{set the tone for}} the evolution of police drama. Series such as , <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> and the Law & Order franchise, though being markedly different in style and theme from Miami Vice, followed its lead in breaking the genre's mold; Dick Wolf, creator and executive producer of the Law & Order franchise, was a writer and later executive producer of Miami Vice. Parodies and pastiches of it have continued decades after it aired, such as Moonbeam City (2015).|$|E
25|$|In the past, WFAA {{has also}} chosen to {{pre-empt}} certain ABC programs because of content deemed inappropriate by station management, {{in some cases}} due to concerns over possible FCC-imposed fines. Under the stewardship of general manager Mike Shapiro during the 1960s and 1970s, WFAA pre-empted certain theatrical and made-for-television films aired by ABC which management deemed too risque for broadcast. WFAA was the largest ABC affiliate to pre-empt <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> (which had its first two seasons air on independent station-turned-UPN affiliate KTXA instead) due to concerns over its violent content, and occasional strong profanity and partial nudity. Channel 8 substituted the police procedural in its Tuesday night timeslot with alternate programming, before launching Good Evening Texas—a weekly talk show serving {{as an extension of}} Good Morning Texas—in September 1994; WFAA began clearing <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> at the start of its third season in September 1995. It was also among the more than 20 ABC-affiliated stations that declined to air the network's telecast of Saving Private Ryan in November 2004, due to concerns over possible fines over the intense war violence and strong profanity in the film that ABC opted against editing out of the broadcast amid the FCC's crackdown on indecent material following the wardrobe malfunction incident that occurred during Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson's Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show performance that February; the FCC declared the film's telecast as not being in violation of the agency's broadcast decency regulations after it aired.|$|E
25|$|The program's {{focus on}} failure and {{those at the}} bottom of the social scale is pronounced, very much in {{contrast}} to Bochco's later project L.A. Law. Inspired by police procedural detective novels such as Ed McBain's 1956 Cop Hater, the show has been described as Barney Miller out of doors; the focus on the bitter realities of 1980s urban living was revolutionary for its time (later seasons were accused of becoming formulaic). Some trace the origins of this shift to the death of Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil Esterhaus) midway through season four, leading to the replacement of the beloved Sgt. Esterhaus by Sgt. Stan Jablonski, played by Robert Prosky. In this respect, the series that broke the established rules of television could be said to have ultimately failed to break its own rules. Nonetheless, it is a landmark piece of television programming, the influence of which was seen in such series as <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> and ER. In 1982, St. Elsewhere was hyped as Hill Street Blues in a hospital. The quality work done by MTM led to the appointment of Grant Tinker as NBC chairman in 1982.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we're doing right now." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Schulberg of The Oregonian wrote, [...] "Forget all {{the commotion}} about <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue.</b> Homicide {{delivers}} without the lewd language and skin shots. It depicts violence {{in a most}} compelling way: You don't see it. You just feel it." [...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is what it took to get you to watch <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|The 90-minute special {{extended}} into the Sports Night time slot that preceded <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> during the 1998–99 United States network television season. Smits {{appeared in the}} November 9, 2004 [...] "The Vision Thing" [...] episode in his only return guest performance.|$|E
500|$|During {{a period}} in network {{television}} history when producers were pushing the broadcast boundaries on sexually explicit content with such shows as <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue,</b> the controversy over this and other television episodes that made inroads into presenting same-sex sexuality or affection led producers not to present any sexualization of their gay and lesbian characters. As noted by author Ron Becker, [...] "So viewers got to see Carol and Susan wed on Friends, but they didn't get to see them kiss. And fans of <b>NYPD</b> <b>Blue</b> could hear male hustlers talk about their johns, but the only sex they got to see involved the precinct's straight cops—naked butts and all. Clearly, chastity was the price gay characters paid for admission to prime-time television in the 1990s." ...|$|E

500|$|Vince Gilligan wrote [...] "Tithonus" [...] in {{an attempt}} to create a story wherein {{immortality}} is portrayed as scary.
