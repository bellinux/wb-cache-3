500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made to feel as if her love for Tara is the most <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> in the world".

500|$|Soon after, Moore and Black quit {{their old}} band, the Starlite Wranglers, {{to play with}} Presley regularly, and DJ and {{promoter}} Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions, and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, [...] "His movement was a <b>natural</b> <b>thing,</b> {{but he was also}} very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick." [...] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was [...] "not bad" [...] but did not suit the program. Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Oprys chief, and more adventurous, rival. The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs. Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Aristotle’s {{method of}} understanding the first principles of <b>natural</b> <b>things</b> in the Physics I. 1 and analyzes the three stages of which this method consists. In the Physics I. 1, Aristotle suggests that the natural proper route which one has to follow {{in order to find}} out the first principles of <b>natural</b> <b>things</b> is to proceed from what is clearer and more knowable to us to what is more knowable and clear by nature. In the Physics I. 1, the terms καθόλου (universal) and καθ΄ ἕκαστα (particular) are not used in their usual meaning (e. g., the meaning which the same terms have in the Posterior Analytics I. 2). This paper examines the Physics I. 1 in comparison with the Posterior Analytics II. 19 in order to elucidate the meaning of καθόλου in the first chapter of Aristotle’s Physics. Furthermore, it reaches the conclusion that the structure of the natural world to which we belong determines the structure and the form of our knowledge. On the one hand, <b>natural</b> <b>things</b> are composite and, on the other hand, perception is involved in the initial grasping of <b>natural</b> <b>things</b> as composites. Thus, since perceptual knowledge is more accessible to us than any other kind of knowledge it is natural to reach knowledge of simple things, i. e., of the principles, starting our inquiry with the composites...|$|R

2500|$|The {{historical}} process, however, never {{attempts to}} preserve an essence {{in the first}} place. Rather, it develops an essence through successive forms. This means that at any moment {{on the path of}} historical change, there is a contradiction between what exists and what {{is in the process of}} coming-to-be. The realization of a <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> like a tree is a process that by and large points back toward itself: every step of the process takes place in order to reproduce the genus. [...] In the historical process, however, what exists, what is actual, is imperfect. It is inimical to the potential. [...] What is trying to come into existence - freedom - inherently negates everything preceding it and everything existing, since no actual existing human institution can possibly embody pure human freedom. [...] So the actual is both itself and its opposite (as potential). And this potential (freedom) is never inert but constantly exerts an impulse toward change.|$|E
2500|$|This {{ceiling was}} done {{at the time the}} new Chapel was built. It would not have been {{possible}} to remove a wood and plaster ceiling entire, or even in pieces, and re-erect it, and there would have been no need for an expensive model if the old vaulting had been in the College, ready to put up again. Also, the entry of 18 June 1659, [...] "began to plaster the Chapel roof" [...] which, doubtless, refers to the panels of plaster between the wood ribs. It may be objected that this is very late for a fan-vaulted roof, and so it would be anywhere but in Oxford. The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640.

2500|$|Liability issues {{strongly}} {{affect the}} structure of the diving industry, its organisation and even the implementation of recommended diving practices – and this is very much the case with buddy diving. [...] Diving is a risky sport, where very serious accidents will occasionally occur. In an increasingly litigious world, accidents trigger a search for “blame”, and aspersions of blame often trigger ensuing litigation. It is a <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> for those who may face the potential risks of litigation to take measures to mitigate these risks. [...] Diving certification agencies must necessarily insure themselves against liability risks, and must act to minimise the cost of this insurance for both themselves and their operatives. The buddy system, beneficial as it can be in enhancing diver safety, has the legal effect of [...] creating an involved intermediary person between the certifying agency and any injured party, an intermediary who could be easily identified as not having provided “duty of care” if an accident occurs. [...] This may afford a legal cushion for the agency, or trainer, or boat - but it is not exactly good news for someone acting in the role of a buddy. The more skilled the buddy partner, the more these duties of care may be assumed to increase.|$|E
2500|$|Although these {{crossings}} were, {{by their}} nature, {{carried out in}} a manner to avoid enemy contact. The crews managed to equip the boats with several concealed weapons. David Howarth, who was with Special Operations Executive and Norwegian seaman, Per Blystad (1911-1942) invented many of these constructions. The most ingenious of these was a concrete-lined oil drum bolted to the deck. When the removable lid was lifted, a pair of ready loaded Lewis Guns were telescoped into firing position, {{with the aid of}} a counterweight below decks. A steel shield came automatically up to protect the gunner. Oil drums were a <b>natural</b> <b>thing</b> to carry on a fishing boat's deck. Once in the North Sea, one of the boats was inspected by a suspicious British Navy ship, all other weapons were confiscated, but they did not find the two twin machine guns mounted on deck! Special low mountings for twin 0.50" [...] Colt machine guns were mounted in the netroom, at the aft of the boat. These were not totally hidden, but with the use of folding handles, triggers, aims and shields they managed to keep them just above the edge of the gunwale, and they were easy to camouflage with a net. A similar construction was mounted in the bow, with a tarpaulin over, of the same shape as the covering of the whaling harpoons many of the Norwegian fishing boats had in the bow. At last all of the Bus boats carried seven or eight mounted, ready armed machine guns, and were able to protect themselves against enemy aircraft attacks.|$|E
