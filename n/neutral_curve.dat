40|$|Although {{self-excited}} oscillations in collapsible channel flows {{have been}} extensively studied, {{our understanding of}} their origins and mechanisms is still far from complete. In the present paper, {{we focus on the}} stability and energy budget of collapsible channel flows using a fluid–beam model with the pressure-driven (inlet pressure specified) condition, and highlight its differences to the flow-driven (i. e. inlet flow specified) system. The numerical finite element scheme used is a spine-based arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian method, which is shown to satisfy the geometric conservation law exactly. We find that the stability structure for the pressure-driven system is not a cascade as in the flow-driven case, and the mode- 2 instability is no longer the primary onset of the self-excited oscillations. Instead, mode- 1 instability becomes the dominating unstable mode. The mode- 2 <b>neutral</b> <b>curve</b> is found to be completely enclosed by the mode- 1 <b>neutral</b> <b>curve</b> in the pressure drop and wall stiffness space; hence no purely mode- 2 unstable solutions exist in the parameter space investigated. By analysing the energy budgets at the neutrally stable points, we can confirm that in the high-wall-tension region (on the upper branch of the mode- 1 <b>neutral</b> <b>curve),</b> the stability mechanism is the same as proposed by Jensen and Heil. Namely, self-excited oscillations can grow by extracting kinetic energy from the mean flow, with exactly two-thirds of the net kinetic energy flux dissipated by the oscillations and the remainder balanced by increased dissipation in the mean flow. However, this mechanism cannot explain the energy budget for solutions along the lower branch of the mode- 1 <b>neutral</b> <b>curve</b> where greater wall deformation occurs. Nor can it explain the energy budget for the mode- 2 neutral oscillations, where the unsteady pressure drop is strongly influenced by the severely collapsed wall, with stronger Bernoulli effects and flow separations. It is clear that more work is required to understand the physical mechanisms operating in different regions of the parameter space, and for different boundary conditions...|$|E

Several departures not observed either in singly or doubly diffusive couple stress fluid layer {{have been identified}} while analyzing the linear stability of the problem. In contrast to the doubly diffusive couple stress fluid system, oscillatory convection is found to occur even if the diffusivity ratios are greater than unity. The presence of couple stress {{is to increase the}} threshold value of solute Rayleigh number beyond which oscillatory convection is preferred. Moreover, disconnected closed oscillatory <b>neutral</b> <b>curves</b> are identified for certain choices of physical parameters indicating the requirement of three critical values of Rayleigh number to specify the linear stability criteria instead of the usual single value.

To clarify this we examine the variation with increasing Ma of the reference Couette flow and analyse the narrow-gap limit of the compressible TC problem.

40|$|AbstractA linear {{stability}} {{analysis is}} presented of the steady flow {{in a rapidly}} rotating sphere undergoing weak precession. It is well-known that without precession all disturbances damp with decay rate proportional to Re− 1 / 2 where Re = a 2 Ωs/ν is the Reynolds num- ber defined by a the sphere radius, Ωs the the spin angular velocity, and ν the kinematic viscosity of fluid. With precession, two kinds of instability modes exist; one is global and inviscid in nature, {{and the other is}} local and viscous. Here we investigate the former by an asymptotic analysis for large Re and small Γ (= Ωp/Ωs), the ratio of the precession and spin angular velocities. It is shown that a weak precession with Γ of order Re− 1 / 2 destabilises disturbances through coupling between an axisymmetric mode (with respect to the spin axis) and the (2, 1, 1) mode.
