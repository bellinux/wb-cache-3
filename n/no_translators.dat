5000|$|From 1527 the Paravars {{were being}} {{threatened}} by Arab fleets offshore, {{headed by the}} Muslim supporting Zamorin of Calicut, and also by an onshore campaign of the Rajah of Madura to wrest control of Tirunelveli and the Fishery Coast {{from the hands of}} the Rajah of Travancore. This continuing situation, and the desire to be relieved of the rivalry from Lebbai divers, caused the Paravars to seek the protection of Portuguese explorers who had moved into the area. A delegation led by Vikirama Aditha Pandya visited Goa to seek talks to this end in 1532. The protection was granted on the condition that the leaders were immediately baptised as Catholics and that they would encourage their people also to convert to Catholicism; the Portuguese would also gain a strategic foothold and control of the pearl fisheries. The deal was agreed and some months later 20,000 Paravars were baptised en masse, and became subjects of Portugal, during the visit of Pedro Gonsalves, Vicar of Cochin. By the end of 1537 the entire community had declared itself to be Catholics, according to Hastings, and the Portuguese proceeded to destroy the Arab fleet when they met fortuitously at Vedalai on 27 June 1538. From that point the Paravar people as a whole enjoyed renewed prosperity. Their declaration of acceptance of the Catholic faith did not prevent them from continuing to worship in the manner which they had done previously because there were <b>no</b> <b>translators</b> to spread the Catholic message and also because the conversion was seen by the Paravar people as being merely a convenient arrangement to obtain protection, not a statement of belief. Bayly describes the situation as being [...] "... really a declaration of tactical alliance rather than religious conversions as the term is usually understood." ...|$|E

There were only three staff members working on both games, Gebelli, Sakaguchi, and a female graphic designer, Nordico Shibuya (who later worked on the Frontier games).

5000|$|The literal {{translation}} of the μωρανθῇ, mōranthē, [...] "loses its savour", is [...] "becomes foolish". In Aramaic the same term is used for losing savour and becoming foolish. Some have speculated that [...] "became foolish" [...] is thus a mistranslation by someone who did not realize the dual meaning of the Aramaic. Gundry feels {{that the idea of}} foolish salt is such [...] "utter nonsense" [...] that <b>no</b> <b>translator</b> would ever make such a mistake; he feels {{it is more likely that}} the Semitic expression had been assimilated into Greek and that became foolish was an expression for losing savour. English language translators universally accept that the verse is talking about flavour rather than intelligence. Some scholars do feel that this may be wordplay related to the Rabbinic use of salt as a metaphor for intelligence.|$|R

60|$|Perhaps the ode to Leuconoe, which Mr. Austin Dobson has {{rendered}} so prettily in a villanelle, {{may come}} {{within the scope}} of this Muse, for it has a playfulness mingled with its melancholy, a sadness in its play. Perhaps, too, if Horace is to be done into verse, these old French forms seem as fit vehicles as any for Latin poetry that was written in the exotic measures of Greece. There is a foreign grace and a little technical difficulty overcome in the English ballade and villanelle, as in the Horatian sapphics and alcaics. I would not say so much, on my own responsibility, nor trespass so far on the domain of scholarship, but this opinion was communicated to me by a learned professor of Latin. I think, too, that some of the lyric measures of the old French Pleiad, of Ronsard and Du Bellay, would be well wedded with the verse of Horace. But perhaps <b>no</b> <b>translator</b> will ever please any one but himself, and of Horace every man must be his own translator.|$|R
40|$|If {{we look at}} the {{translator}} as a expert who transfers only to the source-linguistic text information in the target text, our definition is not enough to understand this complicated process. The translator transfers the texts of a culture of a language in another culture of another language. The translator should exactly know the culture of the target language, and produce his translation purpose-oriented after the expectations of this culture. The text types offer {{the translator}} the possibility in which way he can understand the sourcetext and translate into the targettext. Without knowing with which purposes and which receiver's circle he translates, every discussion is vain and not translation-scientific. A translation hangs together always with the connection of a text. Without text there is no translation. The subject of our article is a discussion in Turkey about a translation. It is about a translation in the Turkish. It is about a source-linguistic text which tells about the remedial customer of Sebastian Kneipp. This book was violently criticized in Turkey as a translation. It is maintained that this translation manipulates the original text, and wrong transfers. But there is <b>no</b> <b>translator</b> and <b>no</b> translation...|$|R

5000|$|Chavez {{places the}} theme of the manga {{within the context of a}} manzai boom of the 1980s, and a {{subsequent}} general increase of manzai on television and anime. He felt that the comedic twist on the staging of Romeo and Juliet was refreshing. Brigid Alverson was disappointed that there were <b>no</b> <b>translator's</b> notes explaining manzai. Chavez feels that later, the more complicated manzai humour is lost in translation, and that it is a difficult topic for a manga. Alverson did not find the comedy particularly funny, but felt the secondary characters were well-developed, especially enjoying the lampooning of [...] "super-cute shoujo girl" [...] characters via Meg. Chavez also remarked on the character designs of the females, describing them as [...] "moe", noting the illustrator's previous work for Gainax. [...] Katherine Dacey felt that the manga [...] "covered familiar ground, but yielded some funny moments nevertheless", feeling that the more [...] "melodramatic" [...] moments were not well-integrated with the rest of the manga, but that they added an extra dimension to the characters' friendship. Connie C. for PopCultureShock felt that the blending of genres was done well, and although she found the plot and characters [...] "unremarkable", she felt that the manga was well-executed.|$|R

With <b>no</b> <b>translator</b> to hand, Fiamma translated. At that interview, Restivo produced his timed and dated bus ticket. There were a number of innocent victims arrested prior to Restivo. Restivo was questioned by the Police in mid 2003 and released without charge. At an early stage he had produced a bus ticket with a time-stamp of 8:44 a.m. to support his alibi of having been {{on his way to a}} computer course at the time of the murder. The detective heading the inquiry later said that Restivo gave the impression of being [...] "bumbling". Forensic investigation showed the killer had left few traces at the crime scene. Luminol tests showed a trail of bloody shoe-prints that ended suddenly, this was thought to indicate the killer had changed his shoes before leaving Barnett's house. Although Barnett's son told police the day after the murder that his mother's keys went missing after Restivo's visit of 6 November, and he was found to have soaked the trainers he had worn on 12 November in bleach, Restivo was not strongly suspected at first because of his bus ticket.|$|R
