50|$|Celtis australis, {{commonly}} known as the European <b>nettle</b> <b>tree,</b> Mediterranean hackberry, lote tree, or honeyberry, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor. The tree was introduced to England in 1796.|$|R
50|$|They are colloquially {{known as}} {{stinging}} <b>trees,</b> stinging <b>nettles</b> or <b>nettle</b> <b>trees.</b> One Australian species, Dendrocnide excelsa (giant stinging tree), can grow to over 40 metres in height, but the dangerous Dendrocnide moroides (gympie-gympie) is only shrub-size.|$|R
50|$|Forests {{cover and}} area of 120 ha, or 57% of the island. Tree species include walnut <b>tree</b> and European <b>nettle</b> <b>tree.</b> In November 2011 some 2,500 {{seedlings}} of the pedunculate oak were planted. Higher forest coverage influences the micro climate and provides new habitats for the birds. Autochthonous tree species include willow and poplar.|$|R
50|$|Trema lamarckiana, the Lamarck's trema or West Indian <b>nettle</b> <b>tree,</b> is {{a species}} of a plant in the Cannabaceae family {{belonging}} to a genus of Treme Lour. It is a small evergreen shrub that is native of Florida and the West Indies. It has several common names such as pain-in-back, cabrilla and Lamarck trema. It is 6 m tall growing all year.|$|R
50|$|Dendrocnide excelsa, {{also called}} Australian <b>nettle</b> <b>tree,</b> fibrewood, gimpi gimpi, giant {{stinging}} tree, gympie, is a rainforest tree of eastern Australia. It occurs from Tathra, New South Wales to Imbil in southeastern Queensland, {{and is very}} common at Dorrigo National Park and other rainforest walks in eastern Australia. The habitat of the giant stinging tree is subtropical, warm temperate or littoral rainforest, particularly in disturbed areas, previously flattened by storms or cyclones.|$|R
50|$|Celtis, {{commonly}} known as hackberries or <b>nettle</b> <b>trees,</b> is a genus of about 60-70 species of deciduous trees widespread in warm temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in southern Europe, southern and eastern Asia, and southern and central North America, south to central Africa, and northern and central South America. The genus {{is present in the}} fossil record at least since the Miocene of Europe, and Paleocene of North America and eastern Asia.|$|R
50|$|Centuries-old English oaks, elms, maples {{and ashes}} are slowly being {{replaced}} by spontaneous vegetation, represented by acacias, trees of heaven, elders, ivy, pines and <b>nettle</b> <b>trees.</b> The highest level of species assortment {{can be found in}} the western part of the park, while in the eastern part, nearer to the city centre, mainly lindens and oaks are diffused. A botanically relevant arboretum is situated in the garden of the Scuola di Guerra Aerea (School of Air War).|$|R
5000|$|The {{school is}} located in a central but also very calm area next to a large park called [...] "Tiergarten". This is near the Potsdamer Platz in the {{so-called}} [...] "diplomatic district" [...] near numerous embassies, including those of Italy, Japan, and Saudi Arabia and other political and economic organizations like CDU's headquarters and KPMG. Just south of the campus on Köbi Road are two American <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> which because of their beauty are considered a national monument in the city of Berlin.|$|R
50|$|Colophospermum mopane, {{commonly}} called mopane, mophane, mopani, balsam <b>tree,</b> <b>butterfly</b> <b>tree,</b> or turpentine tree, is {{a tree in}} the legume family (Fabaceae), that grows in hot, dry, low-lying areas, 200 to 1150 m in elevation, in the far northern parts of southern Africa. The tree only occurs in Africa {{and is the only}} species in genus Colophospermum. Its distinctive butterfly-shaped (bifoliate) leaf and thin seed pod make it easy to identify. In terms of human use it is, together with camel thorn and leadwood, one of the three regionally important firewood trees.|$|R
50|$|Wunü Shan {{is located}} in the north {{temperate}} zone so it has four distinct seasons. There are more than 60 natural tourist spots. In the spring and summer one will find flowers, <b>trees,</b> <b>butterflies,</b> and birds, and there are tourist ships that travel down the river. In the fall, the mountain turns red because of the famous Chinese sweet gums. In the winter, the mountain receives snow.|$|R

He eventually decided upon Kakashi, and remains glad that he did to this day. In keeping with the meaning of his name, scarecrows are occasionally used to represent Kakashi; Naruto, for example, uses a scarecrow that is dressed like Kakashi to help him train for a combat test between the two.

50|$|In the past, the Upper Rock was tree-covered. Most of {{the trees}} were felled for fuel during the Great Siege of Gibraltar between 1779 and 1783.Trees today mostly produce berries that are eaten by birds, who presumably dropped their seeds on the rock.The most common is the olive (Olea europea). Carob (Ceratonia siliqua and <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> (Celtis) are also found.Trees have been planted along the paths, {{including}} the stone pine (Pinus pinea) and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis).Both are native to the region, but the Aleppo pine is particularly common in dry, limestone regions.There was a drought in the 1990s when many of the introduced trees died, although the Aleppo pine fared better than others.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is a toxic shrub, it {{also play}} a {{significant}} part in the phenology of a local butterfly, namely the red admiral (Vanessa gonerilla). The leaves of the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is the preferred food and provide protection for the butterfly larvae. When the larvae arrives in the leaves, it will curve the tip of nettle leaf, use the silken threads to make the leaves stick together, and constructs a secure {{place where they can}} eat the food. Due to the caterpillar's activities, the leaves of shrub can fall off. The eggs of butterflies, also including the yellow admiral (Vanessa itea), are laid on the leaves of nettle during the spring and summer. It takes eight to ten days for the eggs to incubate. Beside these butterflies, some mammals also eat the leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle,</b> like the Common brushtail possum, goats and deer. However, because no native non-flying, non-marine mammals existed in New Zealand prior to human arrival in the last one thousand years, the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> would have been without mammalian predators in its evolutionary history until quite recently.|$|R
50|$|Through public {{programs}} {{and working with}} the Land Trust for Tennessee (founded by governor Phil Bredesen) Owl’s Hill has become a focal point for neighboring landowners interested in placing conservation easements on their land. In the fall of 2000, a species inventory was completed. Owl's Hill retained two biologists to undertake a 20-month survey using scientific sampling techniques to document amphibian and reptile populations. Addenda to the inventory catalogue include wildflower, <b>tree,</b> <b>butterfly,</b> bird and mammal populations.|$|R
50|$|Kali Bair {{is an old}} village {{situated}} {{in the suburbs of}} Nankana Sahib city, Punjab province, Pakistan. On the world map the location of the village comes at 31’24’16.19’’N and 73’44’54.62’’E (Google Maps). Kali Bair word refers to a black hackberry tree which is usually not black. Kali means Black and Bair means hackberry or <b>nettle</b> <b>tree.</b> Arabic word for Bair is Sidrah. There was a black hackberry (Bair) tree here which is rare to find in any area. That’s why the place started to be known by that very tree. Formerly {{it had been in the}} jurisdiction of Sheikhupura district, however during the presidential period of Pervez Musharraf, Nankana Sahib was promoted from Tehsil level to a district. Now the village has been announced to be the part of the municipal corporation.|$|R
50|$|Various {{rituals and}} names were {{associated}} with the latrine god in different parts of Japan. On Ishigaki Island it was called kamu-taka and was propitiated by the sick with sticks of incense, flowers, rice and rice wine. In Nagano Prefecture's former Minamiazumi District, sufferers from toothache offered lights to the toilet god, which was called takagamisama. The inhabitants of Hiroshima called the toilet god Setchinsan while those of Ōita Prefecture called it Sechinbisan and those of Ehime Prefecture called it Usshimasama. The American anthropologist John Embree recorded in the 1930s that the inhabitants of part of the southernmost Japanese island of Kyūshū would put a branch of willow or Chinese <b>nettle</b> <b>tree,</b> decorated with pieces of mochi (rice cake), into the toilet as an offering to ask the toilet god to protect the house's inhabitants from bladder problems in the coming year.|$|R
50|$|Boehmeria glomerulifera Miq as {{known as}} Malabar <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is a Dicot large shrub or small tree native to Asia. It {{belongs to the}} family Urticaceae.|$|R
50|$|Related <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> of the Celtis genus {{have been}} {{introduced}} to South Africa, and are readily confused with the white stinkwood. These species, which typically have the leaves less hairy, {{have been introduced}} as shade trees in gardens and parks, or invade river banks and other city spaces. Some of them also hybridize, as all are wind pollinated. C. occidentalis, of Canadian origin, is distinguishable by the warts on it bark, besides the distinctly larger purple or black fruit of some 1 cm in diameter. C. australis is of Mediterranean origin. Its leaves have a rough upper side, and the fruit resemble those of C. occidentalis. C. sinensis is of oriental origin and has dark, glossy leaves, that are only hairy on the underside. Its fruit are dark orange and about 6 mm in diameter. Its numerous fruit are carried on short and sturdy stalks.|$|R
50|$|With {{effect of}} 1 January 1861, {{the street and}} the {{adjacent}} sites, alleys and fields around were seceded from Tempelhof and incorporated into Berlin, which formed in this new southern quarter of the city's then 16 quarters, namely the Tempelhofer Vorstadt (i.e. Tempelhof-bound Suburb). On 27 November 1864 the Tempelhofer Straße was - in analogy to Belle-Alliance-Platz - renamed Belle-Alliance-Straße, thus spreading southwards the name of the French chief command post La Belle Alliance in the Battle of Waterloo, therefore named Battle of Belle Alliance in Prussian historiography. Following a royal Most-Supreme Cabinet Order (Allerhöchste Cabinets-Ordre) all streets newly laid out right and left of Belle-Alliance-Straße were named after battles won against Napoleon and commanders who distinguished themselves in these battles. In the 1880s, the street became an avenue by planting <b>nettle</b> <b>trees</b> in the section between Yorckstraße and Dudenstraße, with some of them - such as near Fidicinstraße junction - still standing, meanwhile under nature protection.|$|R
5000|$|In the Māori culture, <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the people’s lives. For example, it can be used in medicine, [...] and food. Māori use the bark of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> and the leaves of kawakawa, boiled together, to make a liquid that can be used internally and externally for eczema and venereal disease. Also, the leaves of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> play a significant part in the treating pains. The decoction of leaves and youth twigs dip in boiled water is said to have a benefit on stomachache and on the treatment of gonorrhea. It is also commonly documented that Urtica ferox was a food source for Māori. The inner stems were sometimes consumed after the leaves and outer bark had been removed, the thin film that makes up the inner bark was also eaten raw and is said to have a sweet taste, it is also documented that stems were cooked after having the leaves removed.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the periods}} of November to March, the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> flowers. Because the <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is a {{dioecious}} shrub, it will cross pollinate. The pollen of male flowers can {{transfer to the}} female flowers through wind. These pollen grains can be collected by female dense stigmas. When pollen arrives in the female flowers, the pollination of female flowers will begin. Then in January, the fruit of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> mature. The seed of <b>tree</b> <b>nettle</b> is one and half millimeters long and brown color, ovoid shape like. When the seed is planted in the environment which has more light and water, it will take one month to germinate. One {{study found that the}} seeds germinate after one month in soil, the seeds germinate throughout winter and spring of the year they are dropped. In this study cited out of the 5 different Woody seeding species Urtica ferox had the lowest germination rate of 59% compared to >85% of the other similar species, the author surmise that <b>Tree</b> <b>Nettle</b> is capable of building up a large seed bank in the soil which will survive for 5 - 15 years.Seed dispersal is carried out by rolling, wind and in the gut of birds, the seeds are achenes and are surrounded by a persistent perianth which contribute to the long lived seed bank it produces. This is important for the ecological niche that it inhabits, we can surmise that it doesn’t do well competitively with the other species in its environment due to its growth on boundary zones, an adaption for long lived seed banks are therefore advantageous as it must wait for clearing and collapse of the larger dominating species before it can take hold.|$|R
