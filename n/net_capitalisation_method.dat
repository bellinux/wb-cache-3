This value is currently lower than what farmers {{are willing to pay for}} the water in this area, as measured by the income <b>capitalisation</b> <b>method,</b> namely R 0, 125 /m 3, but may increase in the future as more and more South African estuaries are undermined through upstream river water abstraction, and recreational substitutes are diminished.

40|$|Trees {{are living}} {{elements}} interspersed throughout our cities, and are considered by economists to be «fixed assets». Though they {{form part of}} our cities {{they do not have}} a set price as normally understood and calculated within the framework of a perfectly competitive market. The main aim of this article was to compare the main methods developed in the USA (North American) and Europe (Finnish, Swiss, French and <b>Capitalisation</b> <b>methods)</b> for determining the monetary value of urban trees in the town of Santiago del Estero, northeastern Argentina. The values of eight specimens of the most abundant species in the city (Brachychiton populneum, Citrus auriantum, Grevillea robusta, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Sapindus saponaria, Tabebuia impetiginosa, Thevetia peruviana, and Tipuana tipu) were calculated using all five methods mentioned above and the mean values returned compared by ANOVA. The results suggest a methodology combining both capitalisation and parametric indices might be the most useful way of determining the value of city tree...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that operating lease capitalisation has on key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators of listed South African companies operating within five sectors (namely General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Food & Drug Retailers, General Retailers and Travel & Leisure), as well as whether the impact thereof is substantially {{the same as the}} new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases in terms of ED/ 2013 / 6 (IASB, 2013). Furthermore, the extent of lease usage in South Africa and whether the size of a company has a bearing on its extent of leasing is examined. Additional analysis is also performed investigating the materiality of straight-lining and onerous contract provisions relating to operating leases, as well as the impact of operating lease capitalisation on disclosed loan covenants. Based predominantly on the constructive operating lease <b>capitalisation</b> <b>method</b> developed by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991 & 1997), a refined constructive lease capitalisation model is developed in this study which incorporates aspects of current lease accounting rules not previously considered, namely provisions recognised in respect of the straight-lining of operating leases as well as onerous operating lease contracts. This model also incorporates the new proposed lease accounting rules which require the capitalisation of all leases (Type A and Type B). The results indicate that the capitalisation of future non-cancellable operating lease commitments {{have a significant impact on}} key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators, most notably leverage and other debt-related ratios. Furthermore, of the five sectors analysed, retailers were the most affected. When considering the new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases, the results indicate that operating lease capitalisation has substantially the same impact on key financial statement ratios and Altman‟s failure prediction models as the conventional operating lease <b>capitalisation</b> <b>method,</b> except for certain debt-related and profitability ratios. Further results indicate that operating leases are used extensively and substantially more than finance leases within South Africa. It was also found that operating lease usage was positively related to company size, while finance lease usage decreased as company size increased. Curvilinear relationships were also noted between a company‟s size and its extent of leasing. Further analysis revealed that recognised straight-lining lease provisions are substantially more material than recognised onerous lease contract provisions and are capable of distorting the analysis of operating lease capitalisation if ignored. When scrutinising loan covenants disclosed, it was established that none of the loan covenants were breached when capitalising operating leases; however, in each instance operating lease capitalisation negatively impacted all covenant related ratios...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} of Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991), Beattie, Edwards and Goodacre (1998) and others {{has shown that}} the capitalisation of operating leases on the balance sheet has a major impact on the accounting ratios. This empirical study expands previous research on two issues. First, we refine the <b>capitalisation</b> <b>methods</b> that have been developed by previous researchers. Second, we expand the focus from the relevance criteria of operating-lease information to the completeness-criterion of decision-making usefulness as defined by the Conceptual Frameworks. The results show that in our dataset of Dutch non-financial listed companies during the period 2000 - 2004 only a small part did not report operating leases. Of the remaining companies, a major part (minimum 36 %) did not comply with the accounting standards. The information is therefore not only incomplete, but also impractical in terms of facilitating a fair comparison with other companies. For the companies reporting operating leases, the operating leases appear to be meaningful and relevant. Also the information is essential when comparing companies. Further we conclude that the information required by the accounting standards is not complete while financial statement analysis is sensitive to assumptions with regard to discount rates, total and remaining lives. Also the different capitalisation approaches lead to significantly different capitalisation results. Based on our results we advise standard setters to require further disclosures in the notes...|$|R
40|$|The Discounted Cash Flow {{method of}} {{property}} valuation {{is a fairly}} new method and research in other English speaking countries indicated a trend towards {{the use of the}} DCF method in preference to the Capitalization method despite an initial hesitance due to the perceived complexity of the method. The aim of this study was therefore to form an understanding if similar perception of complexity exists in South Africa and how these perception influence the perceptions and preference of use of the DCF method of valuation by valuation professionals within the South African context. The research was guided by three specific research questions which probed valuers' methodology preference, valuers' education, and difficulties experienced in accessing data needed for DCF valuation input variables. A mixed method research approach was adopted using questionnaire and document surveys to gather data from valuation professionals, lecturers of valuation education programs accredited with the SACPVP, and the curricula of these programs. The results indicate a general low preference {{for the use of the}} DCF method of valuation while the <b>Capitalisation</b> <b>method</b> is indicated as the most preferred method. This low preference was found to be the result of a high degree of difficulty experienced in accessing data needed for DCF valuation input variables. It was also found that the level of valuation education increases the acceptance and preference for the use of the DCF method...|$|R
40|$|Current UK lease {{accounting}} regulation {{does not}} require operating leases to be capitalised in the accounts of lessees, although {{this is likely to}} change with the publication of FRS 5. This study conducts a prospective analysis of the effects of such a change. The potential magnitude of the impact of lease capitalisation upon individual users' decisions, market valuations, company cash flows, and managers' behaviour can be indicated by the effect on key accounting ratios, which are employed in decision-making and in financial contracts. The capitalised value of operating leases is estimated using a method similar to that suggested by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991), adapted for the UK accounting and tax environment, and developed to incorporate company-specific assumptions. Results for 1994 for a random sample of 300 listed UK companies show that, on average, the unrecorded long-term liability represented 39 % of reported long-term debt, while the unrecorded asset represented 6 % of total assets. Capitalisation had a significant impact (at the 1 % level) on six of the nine selected ratios (profit margin, return on assets, asset turnover, and three measures of gearing). Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation between each ratio before and after capitalisation revealed that the ranking of companies changed markedly for gearing measures in particular. There were significant inter-industry variations, with the services sector experiencing the greatest impact. An analysis of the impact of capitalisation over the five-year period from 1990 to 1994 showed that capitalisation had the greatest impact during the trough of the recession. Results were shown to be robust with respect to key assumptions of the <b>capitalisation</b> <b>method.</b> These findings contribute to the assessment of the economic consequences of a policy change requiring operating lease capitalisation. Significant changes in the magnitude of key accounting ratios and a major shift in company performance rankings suggest that interested parties' decisions and company cash flows are likely to be affected...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} commenced {{by looking}} at what the knowledge economy is and what the driving forces are. In order to decide on how knowledge in this new economy can be managed, it was first necessary to define the concept of knowledge. The difference between tacit and explicit knowledge and {{the interaction between the}} two were discussed and at the end ways of managing this knowledge were investigated. In a discussion of the term knowledge management it was concluded that it can be regarded as the handling of tacit and explicit objects of knowledge through information systems, so that it enhances innovation and learning in the enterprise. However, when this knowledge is used for creating economic value, it becomes an item of capital and it is therefore necessary to determine what Intellectual Capital is. The history of Intellectual Capital was discussed and in defining Intellectual Capital seven different models for Intellectual Capital were studied. It was found that Intellectual Capital is subdivided into three major components, viz. Human Capital, Structural Capital and Customer Capital. Each of these components was then thoroughly described and discussed. The aim of the research was to study the explicit management and measurement models of Intellectual Capital that would improve understanding of the mechanisms by which value is created and extracted. The different approaches that can be followed in managing Intellectual Capital were investigated. It was concluded that the three major components cannot be seen as independent from each other and must therefore be managed as a whole. The management of the interaction between the three components {{can be seen as the}} management of the intellectual assets of an organisation and this consists of two phases, viz. value creation and value extraction. In order to determine how successful an organisation is in managing its Intellectual Capital this management needs to be measured. The vehicle for measuring performance is a model with a set of indicators in each of the three major components. It was found that measurement models can be divided into four major categories: • Market <b>capitalisation</b> <b>methods</b> • Return on assets methods • Direct intellectual capital methods, and • Scorecard methods. Twenty-seven different models were investigated in order to understand which indicators were necessary to measure Intellectual Capital in an organisation. In order to propose a new framework a study was firstly done on what a framework should look like and which elements should be included. Thereafter an investigation was done to determine which indicators should be included in such a framework. As it was found that such a framework is very organisation-specific, a brief overview of the RAU was given and according to the strategic objectives of the University as set out in the three-year rolling plan a set of indicators was decided upon. It was necessary that each of these indicators indicate whether the University had been successful in the key performance area through the management of its Intellectual Capital. The criteria and indicators identified were applied in the composition of a new model in an effort to find a suitable model for use at universities. The evaluation process turned up the scorecard models as the most suitable for applying in this instance. An attempt was therefore made to modify and adjust these types of models to answer all the requirements of the University. Meeting the requirement that indicators from all three major components must be present was possible. Efforts to adapt existing models in such a way that sub-components can also be measured were met successfully. This model was then tested at RAU and it was measured whether the management of Intellectual Capital contributed to reaching the University’s strategic goals. Prof. A. S. A. Du Toi...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} {{of the use of}} debt and leasing in the UK using a comprehensive measure of debt and leases, in recognition of the link between lease and debt-type financing decisions, based on financial contracting theory and the tax advantage hypothesis. The design of the study takes account three lacunae in our current understanding of this topic. Firstly, {{despite the fact that the}} capital structure literature is voluminous, it is perhaps surprising that relatively little research has been carried out on lease finance, given its significant role as a major source of finance for many firms. Secondly, the role of tax in the capital structure decision is unclear. Empirically testing for tax effects is challenging because spurious relationships may exist between the financing decision and many commonly used tax proxies. More importantly, our understanding of the impact of taxes on UK financing decisions is far from complete, especially since several major corporate tax reforms have taken place in the last decade. Thirdly, empirical evidence on capital structure determinants is also voluminous but far from conclusive. Notably, contradictory signs and significance levels are commonly observed. Using the standard regression approach invariably involves identification of the average behaviour of firms, and therefore does not measure diversity across firms. In response to these three major issues, this study employs empirical research methods, namely cross-sectional pooled regression, static and dynamic panel data regression, and quantile regression to analyse a large sample of 361 non-financial firms, drawn from the FTSE 350 and FTSE All-Small indices over the tax years 1995 through 2003. The operating lease data are estimated using the constructive <b>capitalisation</b> <b>method</b> while the simulated before-financing marginal tax rate is used to proxy for the firms’ tax status. The endogeneity of corporate tax status is evident since the use of simple tax proxy, the effective tax rate, leads to a spurious negative relation between debt usage and tax rates. The problem was avoided with a better measure of tax variable that is the simulated before-financing marginal tax rate where it is found that the empirical relationships between the tax factor and debt and leasing are consistent with those theoretical predictions. Furthermore, there is a clear distinction between the effect of taxes on debt and leasing where the firm’s marginal tax status is only relevant when managers make decisions on debt financing. The use of quantile regression method in the present study represents a novel approach in investigating {{the determinants of}} the use of debt and leasing. The results reveal that the determinants of debt and leasing are heterogeneous across the whole distribution of firms, consistent with the notion of heterogeneity as promoted by Beattie et al. (2006), but contradicting their claim that the large-scale regression approach cannot measure firms’ diversity. This finding implies that average model results (e. g., from OLS or panel data models) may not apply to the tails of debt and leasing levels, and hence assuming that the determinants of debt and leasing decisions are the same for all firms in the economy is clearly unrealistic. Using the dynamic panel data model, this thesis confirms that debt and leasing are substitutes rather than complements, and that the degree of substitutability is more pronounced among smaller firms, where the degree of information asymmetry is greater. More importantly, the use of a joint specification for debt and leasing improves our understanding of the determinants of the two fixed-claim financing instruments. There is also significant evidence to support the view that firm characteristics affect contracting costs which in turn impact on the choice between alternative forms of finance, namely equity, debt and leasing.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Management Accountancy)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{objective}} {{of a business}} valuation arrangement is to reach a reasonable and acceptable opinion of value. Valuing a business entity has become less of a guessing game than before. Business valuations are two thirds science and one third art according to several theorists and practitioners. The result of a valuation is only definite if it can accurately predict the future, and given {{that it is not}} possible, there will always be an element of risk that the actual value differs from the expected estimate. There are several reasons why business valuations need to be performed. They can be categorised into three groups, namely transaction-based, tax-based, and litigation-based. Most business entities will require a business valuation at some stage. Business valuations can be categorized into different approaches and methods. The three approaches comprise the income based valuation approach, the market derived valuation approach, as well as the asset based valuation approach. Each one of these approaches has different methods that can be used under them. For the purpose of this research study, the methods used under the income based valuation approach are the discounted economic income valuation method and the direct <b>capitalisation</b> valuation <b>method.</b> The guideline publicly traded business entity valuation method and the merger and acquired business entity valuation method are used under the market derived valuation approach. When performing a business valuation under the asset based valuation approach, the asset accumulation valuation method and the capitalised excess earnings valuation method are used. In this research study a business valuation is going to be performed on a franchised restaurant, namely a Spur Steak Ranch. The particular Spur Steak Ranch {{that is going to be}} used is the Tampa Bay Spur. A franchise is a right granted to individuals or groups to market a business entity‟s products or services within a particular location. Franchising is a method of expanding a business entity on less capital than would otherwise be possible. The franchisee pays a capital lump sum to enter the franchise and accepts some of the running costs of its outlet. In addition, the franchise offers the franchisee the use of the franchise name and any goodwill related with it, the use of its business structures and support services, its product or service to sell, as well as management and staff training programmes. Franchising has become a dominant force in the distribution of products and services in several parts of the world. Any facility that prepares separate meals for eating on or off the premises falls under the title „„restaurant. ‟‟ Not one restaurant is the same, and by producing meal experiences with unique characteristics, restaurants accommodate the requirements of particular customer categories. A restaurant is as much a financial entity as any other business entity. The most important elements in profitability in restaurants are economy and productivity. The franchised restaurant used in this research study is the Spur Steak Ranch which has been in South Africa for over 40 years. Allen Ambor, the founder and executive chairperson of Spur, is the person who started it all in 1967 when he invested R 4, 000 to open the Golden Spur in Newlands, Cape Town. Today, Spur restaurants are very popular for having play areas for children, thus, entertaining the whole family, making Spur a very popular fully-licensed franchised restaurant. The particular Spur Steak ranch used in this case study is the Tampa Bay Spur. The Tampa Bay Spur Steak Ranch is a family-oriented franchised restaurant, based on the widely known Spur concepts. The restaurant is owned by Lungisa Financial Administrators and is located in the Time Square Building, Dias Road, in Jeffrey‟s Bay. The restaurant spans in the region of 550 m 2 and can accommodate up to 180 customers. The Tampa Bay Spur was taken over by new owners in December 2011 and also completed a revamp that ended in March 2011. The research question and objective in this research study is to find out what combination of valuation approaches and methods seems to be the most reliable and accurate to value a franchised restaurant, particularly, a Spur Steak Ranch, and more specific the Tampa Bay Spur. To achieve this objective, five secondary objectives must be carried out. The first objective is to critically evaluate and compare popular valuation approaches and methods with each other. The second objective is to deliberate the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods. Thirdly, to point out the uncertainty factors in valuations, for example, to calculate the discount rate by using the WACC or CAPM formula. The fourth objective is to develop an empirical case study based on actual information of a selected Spur (Tampa Bay Spur) and comparing different valuation approaches and methods with the original amount calculated by Spur after performing a business valuation on the Tampa Bay Spur. The fifth and last objective is to make recommendations regarding the valuation method used by the Spur. After performing a business valuation on the Tampa Bay Spur by using several valuation approaches and methods, calculating an average value from the different approaches and comparing it to the original value that the Spur calculated after performing a valuation on the Tampa Bay Spur, a conclusion can be made that the valuation method used by the Spur is fair and reliable. However, the method used by the Spur does not give enough insight for the buyer and seller to understand how they calculated the final value and needs improvement. Master...|$|R
