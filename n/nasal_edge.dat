500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain <b>nasal</b> <b>edge</b> to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
40|$|A 56 -year-old man {{presented}} with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the <b>nasal</b> <b>edge</b> of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To make {{an initial}} {{assessment}} of the feasibility of using records of eye movements during perimetry to improve the estimate of scotoma edge location. METHODS. The <b>nasal</b> <b>edge</b> of the blind spot was mapped in seven normal subjects with a 2 ° grid of test locations, using a custom test station, while gaze direction was monitored with an eye tracker. Records were analyzed {{to determine whether the}} combined sensitivity and eye movement data could be used to estimate the nature of the blind spot edge. RESULTS. Analysis was conducted for 15 high-variability test locations. For 11 locations the blind spot edge estimates fit plausibly with the general form of the blind spot (edge orien-tation within 90 ° of expected); for four locations the agree-ment was poor. One consequence of interpreting the test results using the edge estimates was an average reduction o...|$|E
40|$|Tiago Bravo Ferreira, Joana PortelinhaEgas Moniz Hospital, Lisbon, PortugalPurpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the distance between}} the endothelial surface of the cornea to the anterior edge of an Artiflex® phakic intraocular lens (IOL) implant to improve the safety profile of this implant. Methods: This is a retrospective clinical case series of 45 patients who had Artiflex phakic IOL implantation (Artiflex p-IOL) with a follow-up period of 3 years. A Pentacam HR imaging system was used to measure the distance from various points of the anterior edge of the Artiflex IOL to the endothelial surface of the cornea, which we called endothelial–IOL (E–IOL) distance, in 45 eyes. The E–IOL distances were assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Corresponding correlations of central endothelial distance to temporal and <b>nasal</b> <b>edges</b> and center of the IOL anterior surface were tabulated. Results: Mean follow-up was 21. 39 ± 11. 28 months. A statistically significant reduction of the E–IOL distance was observed over the follow-up period (P 0. 05). For an E–IOL distance of the IOL edge > 1, 500 µm, the distance from the endothelium to the central point of the p-IOL optic should be a minimum of 1, 700 µm to improve the safety profile for Artiflex p-IOL implantation and reduce the potential complication of accelerated endothelial cell loss. Conclusion: After Artiflex IOL implantation, the mean annual reduction of the E–IOL distance was 25 µm. A negative correlation existed between the spherical equivalent power of the implanted IOL and the postoperative E–IOL distance. The minimum E–IOL distance {{from the center of the}} IOL to minimize the risk of endothelial cell loss was 1. 7 mm. This distance, as is the 1. 5 mm initially proposed by Baikoff, is a postoperative value. We cannot make that assumption for the preoperative evaluation, as the morphometry of the anterior chamber changes with the implant. Keywords: phakic IOL, endothelium, iris-fixated phakic IO...|$|R
40|$|Although Merkel cell {{carcinoma}} of the eye lid is reported frequently in the literature, only limited information exists about the distribution of Merkel cells in this tissue. Therefore, serial sections of 18 human cadaver eye lids (donors ages ranging between 63 and 97 years) were stained for cytokeratin 20 in various planes. The overall appearance of Merkel cells in these samples was low and mainly located in the outer root layer of the cilia hair follicles. Merkel cells were more frequent in the middle, and almost not detectable at the <b>nasal</b> and temporal <b>edges.</b> The localization is in accordance with that of Merkel {{cell carcinoma}}, but concerning the scarce appearance within this adulthood group, a specific physiological role of these cells in the eye lid is difficult to establish...|$|R

We report the findings of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at the fixation point {{in a case of}} bilateral macular coloboma. Case report: The subject is a  4 -year-old boy. He visited our hospital at age  1  year and  4  months for the evaluation of strabismus. The fundus examination of both eyes showed round-shaped sharply-demarcated atrophic lesions involving the macula with large choroidal vessels and bared sclera at the base. Immunologic tests including toxoplasmosis, rubella, varicella, herpes virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus were all negative. At age  4  years and  1  month, cycloplegic refraction showed insignificant refractive errors and his best corrected visual acuity was  0. 6 bilaterally. The SD-OCT showed a crater-like depression accompanying atrophic neurosensory retina, and the absence of retinal pigment epithelium and choroid. Examination of the fixation behavior by visuscope showed steady fixation with an area  0. 5 ° nasal to the <b>nasal</b> <b>edge</b> of the atrophic lesion bilaterally. The SD-OCT findings at fixation area showed remaining normal retinal structures involving inner segment-outer segment (IS/OS) junction line. Conclusion: The findings of SD-OCT {{have been shown to be}} useful in the diagnosis of macular coloboma. In the fixation point, the structure of retina and choroid were well preserved.

Settings and design: Beyoglu Eye Training and Research Hospital, Refractive Surgery Department, Istanbul, Turkey. Retrospective pilot study. Materials and methods: Medical records of patients who had SMILE in one eye and femto-LASIK in the other eye were reviewed. Visante corneal Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images at 1 week and 1 month post-surgery were analyzed. Both cap and flap thickness at the temporal edge and the <b>nasal</b> <b>edge</b> were measured and compared to each other. Statistical analyses used: PAWS Statistics 18 and unpaired student t-test were {{used to compare the}} groups. Results: The study included 66 eyes of 33 patients (24. 7 ± 3. 8 years, 20 females and 13 males). Mean flap thickness was 114. 88 µm ± 4. 96 µm, and mean cap thickness was 114. 63 µm ± 5. 18 µm. In group 1 (SMILE), cap thickness values were 115. 84 µm ± 6. 84 µm, 114. 75 µm ± 7. 36 µm, 113. 66 µm ± 6. 88 µm, and 114. 27 µm ± 6. 90 µm in measurement zones 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In group 2 (FemtoLASIK), flap corneal thickness values were 115. 96 mmHg ± 7. 01 mmHg, 114. 72 mmHg ± 7. 17 mmHg, 113. 54 mmHg ± 6. 45 mmHg, and 115. 30 mmHg ± 6. 64 mmHg in measurement zones 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. In both groups, no statistically significant change within the measurement zones was observed. Conclusion: The predictability of cap thickness in SMILE surgery does not differ from the femto-LASIK flaps created using the same femtosecond laser platform.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the 2 homodimer isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -AA and -BB, and their receptors (PDGF alpha-receptor and PDGF beta-receptor) were mapped immunocytochemically during {{the development of the}} embryonic mouse secondary palate, from embryonic day (E) 12 to E 15. The staining patterns of PDGF-AA/alpha-receptor and PDGF-BB/beta-receptor are different. Generally, the former is present and the latter is sparse/absent during the period of palate development. The localisations of PDGF-AA and alpha-receptor are more intensive in the epithelia than in the mesenchyme, and change temporally during palatal shelf elevation, midline epithelial seam formation and disruption. Before the palatal shelf has elevated (E 13), PDGF alpha-receptor is present in the palatal mesenchyme, <b>nasal</b> and medial <b>edge</b> epithelia (MEE), whilst PDGF-AA stains lightly in the palatal epithelia. During palatal midline epithelial seam formation and following its degeneration throughout E 14, PDGF-AA and PDGF alpha-receptor were intensively colocalised in the nasal and midline seam epithelia. These findings indicate that the interaction between PDGF-AA and its receptor may participate in palate development, particularly in regulating palatal midline epithelial seam formation and degeneration...|$|R

50|$|In 2015, some {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the skull of Kunbarrasaurus were established. The roof {{of the skull}} is almost perfectly flat, apart from a limited convex profile of the postorbital bone and the <b>nasal</b> bone. The <b>edges</b> of the skull top, formed by the prefrontal, supraorbital and postorbital bones, make a right angle with the skull sides. The supraorbital {{is made up of}} one bone instead of two or three. The prefrontal is only exposed on the skull roof and does not reach the eye socket. The nasal bone does not reach the snout side and is limited to the snout top and the large, more centrally placed, opening around the nostril. This opening, which is completely located in the nasal bone, is large compared to the maxillary part of the snout and fully accessible from above and the side. The maxilla vertically attains the full height of the skull, reaching to the prefrontal on the skull roof. The hindmost tooth is positioned under the rear edge of the eye socket. The lacrimal bone is directed vertically. The pterygoid bones do not touch each other with their rear ends at the braincase, totally separated by the basisphenoid. The quadrate is vertically oriented. The coronoid process of the lower jaw is strongly protruding. The side of the braincase largely consists of cartilage instead of bone, so that many brain nerves must have had their exits in a single large opening, rather than separate small ones. The inner ear is very large compared with the skull as a whole and differs from that of all other known Dinosauria in the ear vestibule not being separated from the brain cavity, the floor for the cochlea not being made of bone and the vestibule being so large that the semicircular canals are shortened. The skull osteoderms are flat or at most have a low keel. There are no squamosal or quadratojugal horns or bosses on the upper skull corners or the cheeks.|$|R
40|$|Development of the {{mammalian}} secondary palate {{involves a}} series of epithelial mesenchymal interactions: during one of these, a mesenchymal signal specifies regionally distinct palatal epithelial differentiation. Extracellular matrix molecules and soluble growth factors {{may be involved in}} this signalling process. In this study, we have mapped the expression of the genes for insulin-like growth factors (IGF I and II), the peptides they encode, and the IGF binding protein 1 (IGF BP- 1) during murine palatogenesis (embryonic days (E) 12 - 15). IGF-I gene expression was below detectable levels in the craniofacial region at all ages. IGF-I peptide was at the threshold of immunocytochemical detection and widely distributed in the palatal mesenchyme, decreasing in staining intensity from E 12 to E 14. By contrast, IGF-II mRNA was intensely localised in several tissues. IGF-II gene expression within the forming palate was developmentally regulated. In the vertical palatal shelves (E 12 to E 13) IGF-II gene expression was absent. On early E 14, in the horizontal prefusion palate, significant expression was present in the palatal mesenchyme, but not the epithelium. Once palatal fusion had occurred, mesenchymal expression fell rapidly to undetectable levels. IGF-II mRNA was next detectable in the secondary palate on late E 15 at sites of membranous bone formation. By contrast to the mRNA distribution, IGF-II peptide was localised predominantly in the palatal epithelia (particularly the <b>nasal</b> and medial <b>edge</b> epithelia) but also in the mesenchyme of the E 14 prefusion palate. Significantly, the IGF binding protein had a similar distribution pattern to the IGF-II peptide. At all ages, the developing tongue myotubes labelled heavily for IGF-II mRNA, protein and binding protein. These data suggest that IGF-II may play a localised paracrine role during murine palatogenesis, perhaps in the mesenchymal signalling of epithelial differentiation. IGF-II may also serve to coordinate the development of the tongue and palate. The distribution of IGF-II peptide was very similar to that of TGF-beta, suggesting a possible interactive role of these growth factors during palate development. Finally, evidence that the IGF-II gene is imprinted (Ferguson-Smith et al. 1991) and may be the target for uniparental disomy in the human Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (Henry et al. 1991), which is characterised by the overgrowth of tissues (especially the tongue) expressing IGF II in the embryo, indicates the necessity of reanalysing human cleft palate families for disruption (including uniparental disomy) of the genes encoding IGFs, their receptors and binding proteins...|$|R
