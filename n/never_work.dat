Horner believed that Cameron's film schedules were too short and stressful. The two parted ways until 1997 when Cameron, impressed with Horner's score for Braveheart, asked him to compose the score for Titanic.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 2007, Schmid had rebuilt the roster, keeping only three players he had {{inherited}} and acquiring Argentine attacker Guillermo Barros Schelotto. Schmid cut the Crew's goalkeeper, Jon Busch, {{who had been with}} the team for five years. Schmid had concerns over Busch's playing style and fitness. Busch later criticized Schmid's management skills, and said he would <b>never</b> <b>work</b> for the coach again, but gave credit to Schmid's tactical approach. Scheletto's contributions were crucial to Columbus's improvement that season, but the team failed to make the playoffs. A writer for ESPN speculated that the Crew suffered because the team management would not spend more money, while Schmid lamented that he could not attract a foreign star to the little-known city of Columbus.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Eastwood {{teamed up}} with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt (Eastwood) and a young con man drifter, Lightfoot (Bridges). On its release, in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high {{suspense}} and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4million. Eastwood's acting was noted by critics, but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Eastwood reportedly fumed {{at the lack of}} Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would <b>never</b> <b>work</b> for United Artists again.|$|E

5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would <b>never</b> <b>work</b> in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 2013 on Raw, Cody Rhodes {{was fired}} from the WWE after failing to defeat the WWE Champion Randy Orton, a non-title match into which Rhodes was forced after he {{questioned}} the company's chief operating officer Triple H's authoritarian rule. Goldust returned the following week and similarly lost to Orton in a non-title match, thus failing to get his half-brother rehired. Eventually, their father Dusty Rhodes returned to Raw {{in an attempt to}} convince Stephanie McMahon to give his sons their jobs back. Instead, McMahon propositioned that Dusty could choose either one of his sons to receive a job, but not both. Dusty refused and Big Show knocked out Dusty as per McMahon's orders. In return, the Rhodes Brothers ambushed Triple H's henchmen the Shield on Raw. The next week, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as the Authority) offered the brothers their jobs back if they could defeat the Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns (the WWE Tag Team Champions) at Battleground. If they lost, they would <b>never</b> <b>work</b> in WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. All three members of the Rhodes family were then attacked by the Shield, including United States Champion Dean Ambrose. On October 6 at Battleground, the Rhodes Brothers made their debut match as a tag team with Dusty backing them up at ringside. Ambrose attempted to interfere, and was taken out by Dusty. Soon after, Cody pinned Rollins in the non-title match to earn the brothers' jobs back. Various WWE wrestlers and agents came out to celebrate with the Rhodes family, including Arn Anderson, Dean Malenko, and Dave Finlay.|$|E

25|$|The {{scheme was}} devised by C. Y. O'Connor who oversaw its design {{and most of}} the {{construction}} project. Although supported by Premier Forrest, O'Connor had to deal with widespread criticism and derision from members of the Western Australian Parliament as well as the local press based on a belief that the scope of the engineering task was too great and that it would <b>never</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Hughes and Cumia were {{involved}} in a public feud on Twitter regarding their growing strained relationship over the years. The two expressed a wish to <b>never</b> <b>work</b> together again. In October 2016, growing differences between Hughes and Norton led to Hughes hosting afternoons with The Opie Radio Show and Norton staying in mornings with former Opie and Anthony producer Sam Roberts. On October 4, the first day of Hughes's new afternoon show, Hughes and Cumia spoke {{for the first time in}} over two years in a phone call that was broadcast live during both of their respective shows. They have since had a number of on-air calls together. On July 6, 2017, Hughes was fired from SiriusXM.|$|E
25|$|The Strategic Air Command was {{concerned}} that externally mounting the RASCAL and the associated internal equipment needed to support the missile would seriously degrade {{the performance of the}} bomber. The performance impact was great enough to make the B-47/RASCAL combination of questionable value. SAC also argued the B-47/RASCAL combination might <b>never</b> <b>work</b> well. Since the equipment being added to the B-47 to guide the missile added more complexity to the already complex B-47. Then the modification costs required to carry the RASCAL added nearly US $1 million to the cost of every B-47. To SAC these costs seemed premature considering the state of the RASCAL's development at that time. Finally SAC considered it unwise to commit aircraft and to start training crews before the missile's development had been completed.|$|E

25|$|Tarkovsky {{returned}} to Italy in 1982 to start shooting Nostalghia. He {{did not return}} to his home country. As Mosfilm withdrew from the project, he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian RAI. Tarkovsky completed the film in 1983. Nostalghia was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and won the FIPRESCI prize and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. Tarkovsky also shared a special prize called Grand Prix du cinéma de creation with Robert Bresson. Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Palme d'Or, a fact that hardened Tarkovsky's resolve to <b>never</b> <b>work</b> in the Soviet Union again. In the same year, he also staged the opera Boris Godunov at the Royal Opera House in London under the musical direction of Claudio Abbado.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can <b>never</b> <b>work</b> in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E

One of the producers replied by calling Campbell an [...] "asshole", commenting that the crew had gone severely over budget. The difficulty during production left a negative impression on Campbell, who insisted that he wanted to <b>never</b> <b>work</b> with big-budget producers again, insisting that the conduct was [...] "soulless" [...] and [...] "just a business." [...] Raimi commented negatively about the process too, musing that [...] "it was really wrong. It was such a horrible, horrible, horrible, depressing scene." ...|$|E
