25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> actual {{compound}} (because the meaning is not institutionalized), {{so there is}} no sound reason for writing them in one word. In addition, the normal alternative for writing in one word is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this opposition is unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E

25|$|Atwater v. Lago Vista, , was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{which held}} that a person's Fourth Amendment rights are not violated when the subject is arrested for driving without a seatbelt. The court ruled that such an arrest for a misdemeanor that is punishable only by a fine does <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Possession holds {{a special}} place in that it has been criminalized but under common law does <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> act. Some {{countries}} like the United States have avoided the common law conclusion in Regina v. Dugdale by legally defining possession as a voluntary act. As a voluntary act, it fulfills the requirements to establish actus reus.|$|E

Post Register editor Dean Miller stated that Zuckerman's sexual orientation had been known only by Zuckerman's family and a few of his close friends and colleagues, and Zuckerman himself also disputed VanderSloot’s contention that the advertisements did <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> outing.|$|E

25|$|Not every unfair act {{amounts to}} an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an {{individual}} worker overtime pay for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might {{be a violation of}} the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{area of the}} Abrantes Castle was at {{one time}} {{occupied}} by a Lusitanian castro structutre. It was conquered during the Roman invasion of the peninsula around 130 BC by Consul Decimus Junius Brutus, and occupied for a time by Roman legions after Brutus expanded and remodelled it. Successive invasions by Alans (411), Visigoths (492) and Moors (716) further indicated the strategic importance of this site, justifying {{the establishment of a}} permanent military garrison. However, the area and its river did <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> important link between the settlements of the Iberian Peninsula until the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|Stevens, in {{his initial}} draft, {{expressed}} great {{concern with the}} possibility that an individual might be liable for copyright infringement for copying a single program in his own home, and for his own use. At the same time, Justice Brennan was wavering on affirming based {{on the presence of}} non-infringing uses of the technology—but Brennan was not prepared to say that making home copies for repeated personal use did <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> infringement. Justice White, noting Brennan's position, suggested that Stevens shift the basis of his opinion away from arguments about whether home-use was, in fact, an infringement. White pointed out that the issue need not be resolved, because the suit was not against home-users, but against the producers of the technology that enabled them.|$|E

25|$|Chief Sarhili faced intense {{pressure}} from belligerent factions {{within his own}} government and mobilised his armies for their movement to the frontier. The Cape Government reiterated its insistence that the matter was best left to local resolution, and did <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> international war for imperial military intervention. High-pressure negotiations by Cape Prime Minister John Charles Molteno extracted a promise from Britain that imperial troops would stay put and on no account cross the frontier. Gcaleka forces of 8000 attacked a Cape police outpost near the frontier at Ibeka; a fierce shoot-out followed but the Gcaleka forces were dispersed. Soon, several other outposts and stations along the frontier were coming under attack. The Cape Government now had to use all available diplomatic leverage it had to keep the British imperial forces contained.|$|E
500|$|Assault {{requires}} a positive act, not an omission. Mere lawful {{presence in a}} location {{is not enough to}} satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal trespass, however, is sufficient. John Cyril Smith has suggested that wilfully refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission. It is arguable that there was once a rule that [...] "mere words" [...] could <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> assault, but the case of R v Ireland confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault. R. v Constanza added threatening letters to this category.|$|E
500|$|The third arm was the Volunteers, mainly {{drawn from}} small businessmen, artisans, and professionals; they were {{predominantly}} urban middle-class units, training at weekends {{and with no}} annual camp. There were 213 rifle corps and 66 corps of artillery, though the latter were mostly coastal artillery or static [...] "position batteries" [...] equipped with unwieldy 40-pounder guns, and they did <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> organised field force. There were some engineer and medical units, but no service corps. The status of the volunteer units was further complicated by their origins as private societies; they received some central funding, but were mostly supported by local subscriptions and the generosity of their commanders.|$|E

500|$|Written Chinese (...) {{comprises}} Chinese characters (/; pinyin: , literally [...] "Han characters") used {{to represent}} the Chinese language. Chinese characters do <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> alphabet or a compact syllabary. Rather, the writing system is roughly logosyllabic; that is, a character generally represents one syllable of spoken Chinese and may be a word on its own or {{a part of a}} polysyllabic word. The characters themselves are often composed of parts that may represent physical objects, abstract notions, or pronunciation. Literacy requires the memorization of a great many characters: educated Chinese know about 4,000. The large number of Chinese characters has in part led to the adoption of Western alphabets as an auxiliary means of representing Chinese.|$|E

2500|$|Although rarely {{listed as}} an element, {{the common law}} {{required}} that [...] "entry occur {{as a consequence of}} the breaking". For example, if a wrongdoer partially opens a window with a pry bar—but then notices an open door, which he uses to enter the dwelling, there is no burglary under common law. The use of the pry bar would <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> entry even if a portion of the prybar [...] "entered" [...] the residence. Under the instrumentality rule the use of an instrument to effect a breaking would <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> entry. However, if any part of the perpetrator's body entered the residence in an attempt to gain entry, the instrumentality rule did not apply. Thus, if the perpetrator uses the prybar to pry open the window and then used his hands to lift the partially opened window, an [...] "entry" [...] would have taken place when he grasped the bottom of the window with his hands.|$|E
