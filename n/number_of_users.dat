5|$|Montgomery County, Maryland, {{similarly}} approved {{plans to}} install 20 stations and 200 bikes in the Rockville and Shady Grove areas near Washington Metro stations and high-traffic destinations such as Montgomery College and Rockville Town Center. The expansion {{will be paid}} for by a $1.288 million grant from the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board with a $688,000 local match. Officials also cited plans to add 50 stations and 400 bicycles in southern areas of the county, including Bethesda, Silver Spring, Friendship Heights, and Takoma Park. However, bicycling advocates cautioned that clusters of stations in the county could be too far from each other as well as the larger network of stations within neighboring Washington, D.C. There was also concern that the county has too few bike lanes and trails to support the expected <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> Despite these concerns, Montgomery County added its first stations in May 2013.|$|E
5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down.

40|$|Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) uses a {{very large}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{low-power}} transmit antennas to serve much smaller <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> The most widely proposed type of massive MIMO transmit beamforming is zero-forcing, {{which is based on}} the right inverse of the overall MIMO channel matrix to force the inter-user interference to zero. The performance of massive MIMO is then analyzed based on the throughput <b>of</b> cell-edge <b>users.</b> This paper reassesses this beamforming philosophy, to instead consider the maximization of the energy efficiency of massive MIMO systems in assuring the quality-of- service (QoS) for as many users as possible. The bottleneck <b>of</b> serving small <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> by a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> transmit antennas is unblocked by a new time-fraction-wise beamforming technique, which focuses signal transmission in fractions of a time slot. Accordingly, massive MIMO can deliver better quality-of-experience (QoE) in assuring QoS for much larger <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b> The provided simulations show that the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> served by massive MIMO with the required QoS may be twice or more than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> its transmit antennas.

5|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{population}} growth in southern Buckinghamshire caused by the railway, Chesham remained relatively unaffected by development. Although there was extensive development in Chesham Bois, roughly halfway between Chesham and Amersham, between 1889 and 1925 the population of Chesham itself grew by less than 2,000, and between 1925 and 1935—the peak of the Metro-land boom—by only 225. Between 1921 and 1928 the season ticket revenue from Amersham and Chalfont& Latimer stations rose by 134%; that from Chesham by only 6.7%. Although the MR owned large tracts of land around Chesham, bought {{in anticipation of a}} revival of the LNWR connection scheme, Selbie chose not to build a housing estate on the site, instead selling much of it to the local council. By this time, service on the Chesham branch was of a relatively poor quality. Improvements to the central London section and the prioritisation of the Aylesbury line had led to ageing surplus stock often being used on the Chesham branch, and the partial electrification caused delays at Rickmansworth as steam locomotives were coupled and uncoupled. As the branch was mainly operated as a shuttle service passengers to and from Chesham were obliged to wait at Chalfont& Latimer station. This had been built to serve a lightly populated area, but the Metro-land development had caused a much larger <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> than it had been designed for, and it had few waiting facilities, poor lighting, inadequate shelter, and dirty toilets. As Amersham grew, {{more and more of the}} trains which had previously run direct from London to Chesham instead ran to Amersham, causing further crowding as passengers waited for the shuttle service at Chalfont& Latimer. Improving road transport caused an increasing number of commuters to abandon the Chesham line, which in turn prompted the MR to further reduce passenger services.|$|E

The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> on the river in 1999 stayed relatively steady at 4,120, but average group size rose to 7.05. But as the cancellation policy took hold, the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> dropped substantially to 2,596 in 2000 (6.3 average group size), and to 2,262 in 2001 (6.37 average group size).

The choice of utility function has a large impact on the computational complexity of the resulting single-objective optimization problem. For example, the common utility of weighted sum rate gives an NP-hard problem with a complexity that scales exponentially with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users,</b> while the weighted max-min fairness utility results in a quasi-convex optimization problem with only a polynomial scaling with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many {{web sites}} {{benefit from a}} network effect. One example is web marketplaces and exchanges. For example, eBay {{would not be a}} {{particularly}} useful site if auctions were not competitive. However, as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> grows on eBay, auctions grow more competitive, pushing up the prices of bids on items. This makes it more worthwhile to sell on eBay and brings more sellers onto eBay, which drives prices down again as this increases supply, while bringing more people onto eBay because there are more things being sold that people want. Essentially, as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>users</b> of eBay grows, prices fall and supply increases, and more and more people find the site to be useful.|$|E

The research shows that increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> will effect the value of average througput, average delay, and average jitter.

The highest throughput in scenarios 1 and 2 is achieved with a value of 46714. 6 kbps and 57113. 3 kbps respectively. Futhermore the lowest delay in scenarios 1 and 2 achieved with a value of 0. 053 ms and 0. 102 ms.

50|$|Trunked radio takes {{advantage}} of the probability that with any given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>user</b> units, not everyone will need channel access at the same time, therefore fewer discrete radio channels are required.
