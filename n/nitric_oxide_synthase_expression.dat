40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{extended}} our previous findings {{about the effects of}} 10 minutes of passive mandibular extension in anesthetized Wistar rats. By prolonging the observation time to 3 hours, we showed that 10 minutes mandibular extension caused a significant reduction of the mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate respect to baseline values, which persisted up to 160 minutes after mandibular extension. These effects were accompanied by a characteristic biphasic response of pial arterioles: during mandibular extension, pial arterioles constricted and after mandibular extension dilated for the whole observation period. Interestingly, the administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone abolished the vasoconstriction observed during mandibular extension, while the administration of N?-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, a <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> inhibitor, abolished the vasodilation observed after mandibular extension. Either drug did not affect the reductions of mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate induced by mandibular extension. By qRT-PCR, we also showed that neuronal <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> gene <b>expression</b> was significantly increased compared with baseline conditions during and after mandibular extension and endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> gene <b>expression</b> markedly increased at 2 hours after mandibular extension. Finally, western blotting detected a significant increase in neuronal and endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> protein <b>expression.</b> In conclusion mandibular extension caused complex effects on pial microcirculation involving opioid receptor activation and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> release by both neurons and endothelial vascular cells at different times...|$|R

In this study the localization of endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> type III within {{the wall of the}} human internal thoracic and radial arteries and the great saphenous vein was investigated. MethodsSpecimens were harvested from 23 patients undergoing surgical myocardial revascularization and submitted to light and electron microscope analysis using histochemical stainings and immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies anti-endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> type III, Factor VIII, and α-smooth muscle actin. ResultsEndothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> type III was evident in the intima of all conduits and, unexpectedly, in the muscle cells of the media of muscular internal thoracic arteries and radial arteries. No endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> type III <b>expression</b> was found in the media of great saphenous veins. Semiquantitative analysis revealed a higher endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> type III <b>expression</b> in the wall of internal thoracic artery, particularly {{at the level of the}} media.

This discrepancy may be explained by differential regulation of the endothelial and inducible types of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> gene <b>expression.</b> This study aimed to investigate the differential effect of lipopolysaccharide treatment in vivo on the three isoforms (endothelial, brain type, and inducible) of <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> gene <b>expression</b> in the rat. Design: Prospective, controlled, animal trial. Setting: Experimental laboratory of a postgraduate medical research institution. Subjects: Normal, anesthetized rats. Interventions: Animals were treated with lipopolysaccharide (15 mg/kg ip), saline (1 mL/kg ip), or lipopolysaccharide plus dexamethasone (3 mg/kg ip, 50 mins before lipopolysaccharide administration) in vivo 4 hrs before experimentation. Measurements and Main Results: The expression of endothelial, brain type, and inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNAs was quantified by Northern blot analysis using bovine, rat, and mouse cDNA probes, respectively. An endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA was detected at 4. 3 kilobase in the heart, lung, and aorta, and a 10 -kilobase brain type <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA was detected in the brain. The endothelial and brain-type signals were strong in tissues from animals treated with saline, but were reduced by three- to four-fold in tissues from lipopolysaccharide-treated rats as estimated by optical density ratio. The 4. 4 kilobase inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA detected using the murine cDNA probe was absent or negligible in the heart, lung, and brain from saline-treated rats, but was markedly increased in the same tissues from lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. Dexamethasone significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide induced inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA <b>expression,</b> but had no effect on the down regulation of endothelial and brain <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNAs. Conclusions: Rats treated with lipopolysaccharide in vivo display down-regulation of endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> mRNA in the heart, lung, and aorta, and brain type <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> mRNA in the brain.

We hypothesized that postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy may regress after reperfusion in a piglet model of chronic (5 weeks) left pulmonary artery obstruction. MethodsThe ligated left pulmonary artery was reimplanted into the pulmonary arterial trunk. Pulmonary artery blood flow and pressure were measured 2 days and 5 weeks after reperfusion. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle thickness, endothelium-dependent relaxation, and left lung endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> activity and <b>expression</b> were assessed 5 weeks after ligation (n = 10) and 5 weeks after reperfusion (n = 10), and compared with a sham group (n = 10). Patency of the anastomoses and systemic blood supply to the lung were assessed by pulmonary angiography and nonselective thoracic aortography, respectively. ResultsAngiography showed that pulmonary artery anastomoses were patent in all animals. Five weeks after reperfusion, left pulmonary blood flows {{were similar to those}} in the sham animals, and systemic blood supply to the left lung decreased. Left pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 50 % at 5 weeks after reperfusion compared with 2 days after reperfusion (P =. 0009). Medial muscle thickness of the left pulmonary artery greater than 600 μm increased 5 weeks after ligation and regressed to sham values 5 weeks after reperfusion (P =. 001).

Beside ischemia and reperfusion injury, immunosuppressive drugs {{have been accused of}} supporting thrombogenicity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of commonly applied immunosuppressants on microvascular thrombus formation in normal and postischemic tissue in vivo. METHODS: In the skin fold chambers of tacrolimus-, cyclosporine A-, antithymocyte globulin-, rapamycine-, or saline-treated mice, light/dye-induced microvascular thrombus formation was studied. Additional mice underwent ischemia and reperfusion of the skin fold chamber tissue and received tacrolimus, antithymocyte globulin, or saline before reperfusion. Additionally, the effect of prednisolone was tested in animals with ischemia and reperfusion. Concentrations of sP-selectin, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, and asymmetric dimethylarginine were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Immunohistochemistry of the skin fold chamber tissue served for analysis of vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression.</b> RESULTS: In normal tissue, tacrolimus, cyclosporine A, antithymocyte globulin, and rapamycine accelerated microvascular thrombus formation significantly when compared with saline. Whereas ischemia and reperfusion in saline-treated mice enhanced thrombus formation, thrombogenicity was not further increased by ischemia and reperfusion in tacrolimus- or antithymocyte globulin-treated animals. Application of prednisolone reversed the tacrolimus- and antithymocyte globulin-induced prothrombotic effect. Antithymocyte globulin increased sP-selectin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1, whereas tacrolimus induced asymmetric dimethylarginine production significantly. While tacrolimus and antithymocyte globulin additionally induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression,</b> cyclosporine A influenced only endothelial inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression.</b> CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressants enhance thrombus formation in vivo. Although antithymocyte globulin activates the microvascular endothelium, we show for the first time that tacrolimus increases asymmetric dimethylarginine plasma levels. Thus, impaired nitric oxide availability might be the underlying mechanism for the tacrolimus-associated increased thrombogenicity.

Macrophage nitric oxide synthase is inducible with massive increases in new nitric oxide synthase protein synthesis following immune stimulation of macrophages? By contrast, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase are thought to be constitutive with activation induced by calcium entry into cells in the absence of new protein synthesis. Developmental studies showing the transient expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in embryonic and early postnatal life in rodent spinal motoneurons and cerebral cortical plate neurons (Bredt and Snyder, unpublished observations) implies inducibility of neuronal nitric oxide synthase.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Ischemic stroke is a {{major cause}} of death {{worldwide}} but lacks viable treatment or treatment targets. Monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF) is a small heat-stable pentapeptide produced by Entamoeba histolytica in axenic culture, which is supposed to protect the brain from ischemic injury; the mechanism, however, remains unknown. In this study, we further investigated the mechanism underlying the protective role of MLIF in brain ischemia. Methods—A middle cerebral artery occlusion model in rats was used for detecting the effect of MLIF in the brain ischemia in vivo. To identify targets of MLIF in brain endothelial cells, we performed immunoprecipitation of biotin-conjugated MLIF and mass spectrometry. Results—MLIF can protect the brain from ischemic injury in vivo, yielding decreased ischemic volume, prolonged survival, and improved neurological outcome. In vitro studies showed that MLIF displayed protective effects through inhibition of expression of pathological inflammatory adhesion molecules and enhancing endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> and nitric oxide release in the cerebrovascular endothelium.

We previously showed that S 18886 inhibits atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E–deficient (apoE/) mice by a mechanism independent of platelet-derived TXA 2. Atherosclerosis is accelerated by diabetes and is associated with increased TXA 2 and other eicosanoids that stimulate TP. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether S 18886 lessens the enhanced atherogenesis in diabetic apoE/ mice. Methods and Results—Diabetes mellitus was induced in apoE/ mice with streptozotocin and was treated or not with S 18886 (5 mg · kg 1 · d 1). After 6 weeks, aortic lesion area was increased 4 -fold by diabetes in apoE/ mice, associated with similar increases in serum glucose and cholesterol. S 18886 largely prevented the diabetes-related increase in lesion area without affecting the hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia. S 18886 prevented deterioration of endothelial function and endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression,</b> as well as increases in intimal markers of inflammation associated with diabetes. In human aortic endothelial cells in culture, S 18886 also prevented the induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 and prevented the decrease in endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> caused by high glucose. Conclusions—The TP antagonist inhibits inflammation and accelerated atherogenesis caused by diabetes, most likely b...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDietary {{anthocyanins}} {{are widely}} distributed in fruits, vegetables and red wines, {{and there are}} several reports mentioning their beneficial effects. Previously we reported that cyanidin- 3 -glucoside (Cy 3 G) induced endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (eNOS) <b>expression</b> and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) production in bovine vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we show that Cy 3 G regulates phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt, affects the interaction between eNOS and soluble guanylyl cyclase, and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production. Our results suggest that Cy 3 G enhances vascular eNOS activity, and may help to improve vascular endothelial function...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{protozoan}} parasites of {{the genus}} Leishmania antagonize host defense mechanisms by interfering with cell signaling in macrophages. In this report, the impact of Leishmania donovani on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (NOS) <b>expression</b> in the macrophage cell line RAW 264 was investigated. Overnight infection of cells with leishmania led to {{a significant decrease in}} phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) -stimulated MAP kinase activity and inhibited PMA-induced phosphorylation of the MAP kinase substrate and transcription factor Elk- 1. Simultaneously, leishmania infection markedly attenuated the induction of c-FOS and inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (iNOS) <b>expression</b> in response to PMA and gamma interferon (IFN-γ), respectively. These effects correlated with decreased phosphorylation of p 44 and p 42 MAP kinases on tyrosine residues. Consistent with the latter finding, lysates prepared from leishmania-infected cells contained an activity that dephosphorylated MAP kinase in vitro, suggesting the possibility of a phosphatase acting in vivo. Attenuation of both MAP kinase activity and c-FOS and iNOS expression was reversed by treatment of macrophages with sodium orthovanadate prior to infection. It was also found that the specific activity of the Src homology 2 domain containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP- 1) toward MAP kinase was markedly increased in leishmania-infected cells. These findings indicate that infection with L. donovani attenuates MAP kinase signaling and c-FOS and iNOS expression in macrophages by activating cellular phosphotyrosine phosphatases. This may represent a novel mechanism of macrophage deactivation during intracellular infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{anti-human}} {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) drug efavirenz (EFV) alters mitochondrial function in cultured neurons and glial cells. <b>Nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> (NO) is a mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with HIV {{central nervous system}} symptoms. We show that EFV promotes inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (iNOS) <b>expression</b> in cultured glial cells and generated NO undermines their mitochondrial function, as inhibition of NOS partially reverses this effect. EFV inhibits mitochondrial Complex I in both neurons and glia; however, when the latter cells are treated for longer periods, other mitochondrial complexes are also affected {{in accordance with the}} increased NO production. These findings shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the frequent EFV-associated neurotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} biochemically measure the {{production}} of nitric oxide in gingival crevicular fluid and immunohistochemically measure the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the gingiva of patients with sickle cell disease. Additionally, we aimed to obtain insight into the immunopathology of sickle cell disease by comparing inducible nitric oxide synthase levels in patients with sickle cell disease and controls using gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid. Materials and Methods: The study included 20 sickle cell disease patients and 20 healthy controls. Immunohistochemical {{analysis was used to}} measure inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> in gingiva and nitric oxide levels in gingival crevicular fluid were spectrophotometrically measured. Results: Nitric oxide levels in the patients and controls did not differ significantly (21. 2 ± 4. 5 and 23. 1 ± 2. 3 μM L- 1, respectively, p> 0. 05). There weren’t any statistically significant differences in infiltrated inflammatory cells, density of inflammatory cells that stained with inducible nitric oxide synthase, or nitric oxide expression in gingiva between the patient and control groups (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first study to examine the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid in patients with sickle cell disease. Using the gingiva and gingival crevicular fluid we were unable to observe sickle cell disease-associated inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> and a difference in nitric oxide levels...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe {{hypothesis}} that the protective effects of mild hypothermia against the pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury are mediated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase was tested. MethodsEndothelial nitric oxide synthase knock-out and wild-type mice were sham operated or underwent a 1 -hour occlusion of the left pulmonary hilum, followed by 5 hours of reperfusion. Temperature in the left pleural cavity during ischemia was maintained at either 36 °C (normothermia) or 32 °C (hypothermia). Inflammatory response (myeloperoxidase activity), endothelial barrier function (extravasation of Evans blue–labeled albumin), and endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> and phosphorylation were determined {{at the end of}} reperfusion. ResultsAfter normothermic ischemia both strains had a similar mortality (wild-type, 22. 9 %; knock-out, 15. 4 %), which was completely abolished by hypothermia. Endothelial barrier function was disturbed after normothermic ischemia in both wild-type and knock-out mice. Mild hypothermia significantly reduced pulmonary Evans blue extravasation in wild-type mice, but not in knock-out mice. Myeloperoxidase activity increased after normothermic ischemia to the same degree in both strains. This response was significantly attenuated by hypothermia in wild-type mice, but not in knock-out mice. In wild-type mice, endothelial <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression</b> and phosphorylation were higher after hypothermic ischemia than after normothermic ischemia. No effect of ischemia on expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase was found in wild-type or knock-out mice. ConclusionHypothermic protection against pulmonary ischemia-reperfusion injury is dependent on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and is associated with increased expression and phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} mechanisms of altered fibroblast collagen production induced by polyunsaturated fatty acids. 3 T 3 -Swiss fibroblasts were grown in medium containing either eicosapentaenoic or arachidonic acid. The effects of nuclear factor-kappaB activation by lipopolysaccharide on inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, collagen production, and in-vitro wound healing were studied. Results: Eicosapentaenoic acid treated cells produced less prostaglandin E 2 but had increased inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression,</b> nitric oxide production, collagen formation, and recoverage area during in-vitro wound healing than cells treated with arachidonic acid. Activation of nuclear factor-kappaB with lipopolysaccharide increased inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> <b>expression,</b> {{the production of}} nitric oxide, prostaglandin E 2, collagen, and the in-vitro wound recoverage area. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide, but the amount of nitric oxide was greater in eicosapentaenoic acid treated cells. NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester plus lipopolysaccharide treatment increased collagen production and cellular recoverage area while treatment with NGnitro- L-arginine methyl ester alone decreased it in wounded fibroblasts. Conclusion: The activation of the NF-κB pathway and PGE 2 can be linked by the cross-talk of iNOS and NO in the PUFA altered fibroblast collagen production and wound healing. Additional {{studies are needed to}} determine how polyunsaturated fatty acids can be used as adjuvants in combination with other treatments (i. e, drugs) to design therapies to either enhance healthy collagen production or inhibit production and reduce fibrosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChromogranin A (CgA), a neuroactive glycoprotein, is {{associated}} with microglial activation cascades implicated in neurodegeneration. Here we show that CgA-dependent inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (iNOS) <b>expression</b> and stress responses in microglia involved signalling via scavenger receptors (SR), since SR class-A (SR-A) ligands blocked iNOS expression, mitochondrial depolarisation, apoptosis and glutamate release. Furthermore, block of SR-A ameliorated CgA-induced microglial neurotoxicity. In contrast, block of CD 36, or the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) did not prevent CgA-induced microglial activation and neurotoxicity. Thus, manipulation of specific scavenger receptor-coupled signalling pathways may provide avenues for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases implicating microglial activation with chromogranin peptides...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{glycosylation}} end products induce inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (iNOS) <b>expression</b> via a p 38 MAPK-dependent pathway. BackgroundAdvanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) accumulation in tissue {{has been}} implicated in diabetic related complications, including diabetic nephropathy. Activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) ameliorates diabetic nephropathy. MethodsIn the present study, we investigated the effects of AGEs on inducible <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>synthase</b> (iNOS) <b>expression</b> and <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production, {{and the effects of}} rosiglitazone, an activator of PPAR-γ, on AGE-induced iNOS expression and nitrite release in glomerular mesangial cells. ResultsAGEs caused a dose- and time-dependent increase of iNOS induction and nitrite accumulation in mesangial cells. A protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein), or a p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (SB 203580) suppressed AGE-induced iNOS expression and nitrite release from mesangial cells. Addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) -AGEs to mesangial cells increased p 38 MAPK activities. Activation of PPAR-γ by rosiglitazone inhibited AGE-induced iNOS expression, nitrite release, and p 38 MAPK activation in mesangial cells. AGE-stimulated nitrite release was attenuated by pretreatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and anti-transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) antibodies. AGE-induced iNOS expression was inhibited by treatment with a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inhibitor, pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate. Addition of BSA-AGEs to mesangial cells stimulated p 65 NF-κB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. ConclusionThese data suggest that cytokine release, NF-κB and p 38 MAPK-dependent pathways {{may play a role in}} AGE-induced iNOS expression and subsequent <b>nitric</b> <b>oxide</b> production in mesangial cells. Rosiglitazone may prevent AGE-induced iNOS expression by interfering with p 38 MAPK activity...|$|R
