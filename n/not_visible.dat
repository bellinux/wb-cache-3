5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently <b>not</b> <b>visible).</b> The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> to the naked eye. It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through a telescope of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E

5|$|The star, as {{seen from}} Earth, has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.8. It is <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> with the naked eye. In comparison, Pluto's apparent magnitude at its brightest is slightly brighter, at 13.65.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15 {{is located}} at a {{distance}} of 308 parsecs (1,004 light years), and it has an estimated apparent magnitude of 10.9. It is, thus, <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> from Earth with the unaided eye.|$|E

5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> because the photosphere is much brighter than the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{from the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, HD 28185 has a parallax of 23.62 milliarcseconds, which {{corresponds to a}} distance of 42 parsecs (138 light-years). Since the star is located further than 25 parsecs from Earth, it is not listed in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars. With an apparent magnitude of 7.81, the star is <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> with the naked eye, though {{it can be seen}} using binoculars.|$|E

However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was <b>not</b> <b>visible</b> from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E

HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 is {{a shooter}} game, with players {{predominantly}} experiencing gameplay from a first-person perspective.

5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the sun, but switch to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is <b>not</b> <b>visible.</b> This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|E
