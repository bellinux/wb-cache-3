5|$|Abdul Taib Mahmud, the BN chief {{minister}} of Sarawak, revised <b>new</b> <b>land</b> renewal rates which took effect on June 1. He {{said that the}} Sarawak <b>new</b> <b>land</b> rates is the cheapest in Malaysia as compared to other states. In accordance with opposition proposal for the unconditioned, automatic renewal of land leases, he also challenged the opposition-led state governments to announce <b>new</b> <b>land</b> rates lower than the current one announced by himself, without risking the income of the state governments.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 5th century AD, <b>new</b> <b>land</b> routes between Asia and Europe {{developed}} {{further to}} the north, in the Rus'. Many of these routes passed through Yugra and extended to the Baltic region. The Khazars, Volga Bulgaria, and the Rus' Khaganate were active in trading along the northern trade routes.|$|E
5|$|Luthor sends his moll, Kitty, to {{distract}} Superman, {{allowing him to}} steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the hypocenter to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor {{plans to use the}} Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current land masses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his <b>new</b> <b>land.</b> Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the <b>new</b> <b>land</b> growth by launching it into the sea.|$|E
5000|$|In the April 1492 [...] "Capitulations of Santa Fe", King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella promised Columbus that if {{he succeeded}} he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and {{appointed}} Viceroy and Governor of all the <b>new</b> <b>lands</b> he could claim for Spain. He {{had the right to}} nominate three persons, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the <b>new</b> <b>lands.</b> He would be entitled to 10 percent of all the revenues from the <b>new</b> <b>lands</b> in perpetuity. Additionally, he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the <b>new</b> <b>lands</b> and receive one-eighth of the profits.|$|R

50|$|From this research, Fort wrote four books. These are: The Book of the Damned (1919), <b>New</b> <b>Lands</b> (1923), Lo! (1931) and Wild Talents (1932); {{one book}} was written between <b>New</b> <b>Lands</b> and Lo! {{but it was}} {{abandoned}} and absorbed into Lo!.|$|R
5|$|Philip {{had in the}} {{meantime}} expanded his territories west along the Apsus and Genusus river valleys, {{right up to the}} borders of Illyria. Philip's plan was, it seems, to first take the Illyrian coasts, conquer the area between the coasts and Macedon, and use the <b>new</b> <b>land</b> link to provide a rapid route for reinforcements across the narrow straits to Italy.|$|E
5|$|After the Communist Party {{seized power}} in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the city {{became part of}} the Eastern Bloc. The city annexed <b>new</b> <b>land,</b> and the {{population}} rose significantly, becoming 90% Slovak. Large residential areas consisting of high-rise prefabricated panel buildings, such as those in the Petržalka borough, were built. The Communist government also built several new grandiose buildings, such as the Most Slovenského národného povstania bridge and the Slovak Radio headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Currently, Caroline never reaches {{water at}} either ends. The 1829 map, however, shows it {{accessing}} the Gulf of Mexico at both termini. Whereas the road now starts at Whitehead, it once continued past both Whitehead and Front to the shore. This {{is confirmed by}} {{a map of the}} island from the early 1900s, which depicts Caroline abutting a breakwater at its southwestern end. Eventually, the street was excluded from the lot of the Truman Annex, and disconnected from the water at its northeastern terminus by the construction of the former City Electric Power Plant on <b>new</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E

5|$|His {{fleet of}} 13 ships sailed {{far into the}} western Atlantic Ocean, perhaps intentionally, where he made {{landfall}} on what he initially {{assumed to be a}} large island. As the <b>new</b> <b>land</b> was within the Portuguese sphere according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, Cabral claimed it for the Portuguese Crown. He explored the coast, realizing that the large land mass was probably a continent, and dispatched a ship to notify King Manuel I of the new territory. The continent was South America, and the land he had claimed for Portugal later {{came to be known as}} Brazil. The fleet reprovisioned and then turned eastward to resume the journey to India.|$|E
5|$|His health declining, Baltimore's {{persistence}} {{over the}} charter finally {{paid off in}} 1632. The king first granted him a location south of Jamestown, but Baltimore asked the king to reconsider in response to opposition from other investors interested in settling the <b>new</b> <b>land</b> of Carolina into a sugar plantation. Baltimore eventually compromised by accepting redrawn boundaries {{to the north of}} the Potomac River, on either side of the Chesapeake Bay. The charter was about to pass when the fifty-two-year-old Baltimore died in his lodgings at Lincoln's Inn Fields, on 15 April 1632. Five weeks later, on 20 June 1632, the charter for Maryland passed the seals.|$|E
5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding <b>new</b> <b>land</b> was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E

5|$|John Cabot was {{sponsored}} by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, {{looking for a new}} route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the <b>new</b> <b>land.</b> In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests that he might have.|$|E
5|$|Since 1771, Battersea and Chelsea {{had been}} linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge. As London grew {{following}} {{the advent of}} the railways, Chelsea began to become congested, and in 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the building of an embankment at Chelsea to free <b>new</b> <b>land</b> for development, and proposed the building of a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge and the replacement of Battersea Bridge with a more modern structure.|$|E
5|$|Smith was a {{pilot for}} the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930 {{involved}} in aerial overflights to discover <b>new</b> <b>land</b> {{that could be}} claimed {{for the benefit of}} the United States. The land was later viewed by Byrd and named after his wife. Smith was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Congressional Gold Medal. An Antarctic peak bears his name. He was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|Three mega-projects were {{initiated}} {{in the mid-1990s}} to irrigate so-called [...] "New Lands" [...] outside the Nile River Valley.

5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many {{were left to}} rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create <b>new</b> <b>land.</b> Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition (SNAE), 1902–04, was {{organised}} {{and led by}} William Speirs Bruce, {{a natural}} scientist and former medical student from the University of Edinburgh. Although overshadowed in prestige terms by Robert Falcon Scott's concurrent Discovery Expedition, the SNAE completed a full programme of exploration and scientific work. Its achievements included {{the establishment of a}} manned meteorological station, the first in Antarctic territory, and the discovery of <b>new</b> <b>land</b> to the east of the Weddell Sea. Its large collection of biological and geological specimens, together with those from Bruce's earlier travels, led to the establishment of the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The best-known artistic {{representation}} of the Swedish mass migration is the epic four-novel suite The Emigrants (1949–1959) by Vilhelm Moberg (1898–1973). Portraying the lives of an emigrant family through several generations, the novels have sold nearly two million copies in Sweden and have been translated into more than twenty languages. The tetralogy has been filmed by Jan Troell as The Emigrants (1971) and The <b>New</b> <b>Land</b> (1972), and forms the basis of Kristina from Duvemåla, a 1995 musical by former ABBA members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus.|$|E

5|$|The {{permanent}} {{names of}} these moons were announced, together {{with that of}} 2003 EL61, by the International Astronomical Union on September 17, 2008: (136108) Haumea I Hiʻiaka and (136108) Haumea II Namaka. Each moon was named after a daughter of Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Hiʻiaka is the goddess of dance and patroness of the Big Island of Hawaii, where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located. Nāmaka is the goddess of water and the sea; she cooled her sister Pele's lava as it flowed into the sea, turning it into <b>new</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|There was {{a massive}} {{expansion}} of ploughland during the Song dynasty. The government encouraged people to reclaim barren lands and put them under cultivation. Anyone who opened up new lands and paid taxes were granted permanent possession of the <b>new</b> <b>land.</b> Under this policy, the cultivated land in the Song dynasty is estimated to have reached a peak number of 720million mu, and was not surpassed by later Ming and Qing dynasties.|$|E
5|$|When the United States {{purchased}} Louisiana from France in 1803, American authorities {{insisted that}} the agreement also included Texas. The boundary between New Spain and the United States was finally set at the Sabine River in 1819, at {{what is now the}} border between Texas and Louisiana. Eager for <b>new</b> <b>land,</b> many United States settlers refused to recognize the agreement. Several filibusters raised armies to invade the area west of the Sabine River. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico. Due to its low population, Mexico made the area part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas.|$|E
