25|$|Taxation {{took the}} form of an annual {{property}} tax of 0.25% for territorial purposes with an additional county tax <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> this <b>amount.</b> This tax was to be paid on all town lots and improvements, mills, carriages, clocks and watches, and livestock; farmland and farm products were not taxed. In addition, a poll tax of 50 cents for every qualified voter under age 60 was assessed and a graduated schedule of merchants' licenses established, ranging from the peddlar's rate of $10 per year to a $60 annual fee on firms with more than $20,000 of capital.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} new strategy-proof double auction {{protocol}} characterized as average-case budget-non-negative. It is wellknown {{that there is no}} strategy-proof double auction protocol that satisfies Pareto efficiency, individual rationality, and budget-balance simultaneously. The existing approach is to give up Pareto efficiency or strategy-proofness by enforcing budget-balance or budget-positive as a hard constraint. We propose a new direction to slightly relax the budgetnon-negative condition. Although this protocol might incur loss or profit in some cases, it is guaranteed <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> the predetermined <b>amount</b> of loss. Simulation results show that this protocol can be budget-non-negative on average and achieve social surplus that is very close to being Pareto efficient by setting parameters appropriately...|$|R
50|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{settlement}} on February 28, 1978, which—because it extinguished the tribe's aboriginal title—required Congressional legislation. Congress passed the Rhode Island Claims Settlement Act (RICSA) on September 30, 1978. In exchange for extinguishing the Narragansett's claim, the Act required the Secretary of the Interior to acquire approximately 900 acres of privately held {{land for the}} Narragansett and required the state to convey certain other publicly held lands to the Narragansett Corporation. The Act also created a $3.5 million settlement fund, funded by a federal appropriation. The Act also required the Governor to negotiate for the tribe an option to purchase additional privately held lands, exercisable by the Secretary for the tribe, with the option payment <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> 5% of the fair {{market value of the}} lands and the total price <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> the <b>amount</b> of the settlement fund. That Act extinguished all aboriginal title in Rhode Island, including title held by other tribes. Thus, the Act extinguished the claim of the Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe, even though they were in no way compensated by the Act. The terms of the agreement extended state civil and criminal jurisdiction to the settlement lands. No state, federal, or local property tax was to be assessed on the lands.|$|R
30|$|Streambank erosion {{occurs as}} a result of changes in streamflow, water {{flooding}} or the discharge of concentrated runoff from other sources. The consequences of streambank erosion are <b>not</b> limited <b>to</b> the streambanks only but also it might impair the water quality and cause significant economic damage to the surrounding ecosystem. Low Impact Development (LID) or Green Infrastructure (GI) was developed to mimic the natural water cycle of the land by reducing the negative impact of stormwater runoff on water bodies and eventually human health. It {{is important to note that}} the two terms LID and GI have been used in this study interchangeably. LID practices are structural or non-structural management practices that aim to decrease the impacts of urbanization and sediments on water quality. GI includes the installation of any of the following structural measures to retrofit existing infrastructure and reduce runoff volumes and peak flows: bioretention, green roofs, rainwater harvesting, and permeable pavements (Damodaram et al. 2010). Regulatory enforcement of GI implementation results in an urgent need for quantitative information on GI practice effectiveness for sediment and stream erosion (Lee and Jones-Lee 2002). While GIs have been mentioned in the literature for stormwater management (Dietz and Clausen 2008; Elliott and Trowsdale 2007; Hood et al. 2007; Bedan and Clausen 2009) there is little research that studied GI impact on the downstream reduction of stream bank erosion in urban areas (Burns et al. 2015; Jia et al. 2015). Some studies (Bledsoe 2002; Krishnappan and Marsalek 2002; Gassman et al. 2007) addressed GI effectiveness through field experiments, very few studies addressed GI effect on stream erosion using computer modeling. Modeling allows large-scale evaluations as well as varying variables to assess several scenarios. One example is what McCuen and Moglen (1988) suggested as a multi-criterion approach to mitigate channel instability. This approach requires the cumulative, post-development bed load transport volume <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>exceed</b> the pre-development <b>amount</b> for the 2 -year recurrence interval. Although this approach provided some insights into reducing total runoff on a watershed scale it did not evaluate the impact of GI and shear stresses. Additional models were developed that include a stream bank erosion component including: The Système Hydrologique Européen (SHE) (Abbott et al. 1986), Soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) (Neitsch et al. 2002), Watershed Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) (Flanagan et al. 2001), and Conservation Channel Evolution and Pollutant Transport System (CONCEPTS) (Langendoen 2000). Mostly, these models use the excess shear stress equation for determining rates of erosion but the GI component is slight <b>to</b> <b>not</b> be integrated.|$|R
