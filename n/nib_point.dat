50|$|Initially, pens {{were made}} by slicing a {{suitable}} <b>nib</b> <b>point</b> {{from the end of}} a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small reservoir of ink by capillary action. However, these ink reservoirs were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external inkwell for replenishing.|$|E
50|$|Pen nibs come in {{a variety}} of {{different}} shapes and sizes for different purposes but can be split into two main types: broad <b>nibs</b> and <b>pointed</b> <b>nibs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Pointed</b> <b>nibs</b> {{originated}} in the 17th century and were initially created by hand from quills {{in a similar fashion}} to broad-edge nibs. Towards the end of the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, a high demand for nibs coupled with steel manufacturing processes eventually led to the mass production of the steel <b>nib.</b> <b>Pointed</b> <b>nibs</b> also {{led to the development of}} newer styles of penmanship such as the English Round Hand and Copperplate scripts during the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as the Spencerian script in the 19th century.|$|R
60|$|He put Sylvie down, {{making her}} lie quiet beside his bonnet-grec, and, depriving {{me of the}} pens and penknife, {{proceeded}} to slice, <b>nib,</b> and <b>point</b> with the accuracy and celerity of a machine.|$|R
50|$|Pointed pens {{are also}} used by artists and drafters for sketching, mapping and {{technical}} drawing. Although any <b>pointed</b> <b>nib</b> {{can be used for}} drawing, there are nibs available that resemble writing nibs but are specially designed for pen drawing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pointed</b> <b>nib</b> is {{flexible}} {{and comes to}} a sharp point rather than a broad edge. Thick and thin strokes are achieved by varying the amount {{of pressure on the}} nib. Thick lines are created on downstrokes by pushing down on the nib, causing the nib tines to splay and allowing more ink to flow through the widened slit onto the writing surface. Lighter pressure produces less flexing of the tines, creating thinner strokes. The finest hairline strokes are created on the upstrokes and sideways strokes. Due to the shape of the <b>pointed</b> <b>nib,</b> thick lines can only be produced on downstrokes. If too much pressure is applied to the pen on an upstroke, the nib tines are likely to dig into the paper.|$|R
50|$|Round Hand (also Roundhand) {{is a type}} of {{handwriting}} and calligraphy {{originating in}} England in the 1660s primarily by the writing masters John Ayres and William Banson. Characterised by an open flowing hand(style) and subtle contrast of thick and thin strokes deriving from metal <b>pointed</b> <b>nibs,</b> Round Hand's popularity grew rapidly, becoming codified as a standard, through the publication of printed writing manuals.|$|R
50|$|The whole nib narrows to a {{point where}} the ink is {{transferred}} to the paper. Broad calligraphy pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the broad <b>point.</b> <b>Nibs</b> divided into three 'tines' are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores.|$|R
5000|$|The Parker 180 is a {{fountain}} pen {{developed in the}} 1970s by the Parker Pen Company. Introduced to market in 1977 {{as an attempt to}} modernize the then-floundering fountain pen industry, the 180 was a slender pen with a very unusual flat nib design. [...] The [...] "180" [...] is a play on 180°, because the pen was meant to be used in either a rightside-up or upside-down orientation to modify the width of the line drawn by the pen. It was offered in either an [...] "X/M" [...] ("Extra-Fine / Medium") or [...] "F/B" [...] ("Fine / Broad") configuration. Towards the end of its production the nibs made were not two <b>point</b> <b>nibs,</b> and was marked as X, F, M or B.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the parallels between}} the female vampire’s fang (that which punctures phallogocentric discourse {{as well as other}} female bodies) and the <b>pointed</b> <b>nib</b> of the female narrator’s pen. Drawing on feminist and psychoanalytic theory, I read the vampiress’ bite as reworking the positions of the female vampire and her companion within a male dominated Symbolic and consider how both women ingest language only to expel it transformed as that which speaks their desire. Carmilla, Sheridan Le Fanu’s 1872 novella, serves as the referential center of this project and frames my interpretations of Crashaw’s 17 th century Teresian poems, Coleridge’s “Christabel,” and filmic adaptations of Carmilla. These texts, like the bodies of the women they describe, are inherently vampiric, and the boundaries of both are rendered fluid as the female vampire and her companion redefine ontological boundaries through the act of writing, of biting, and of creating spaces of possibility...|$|R
