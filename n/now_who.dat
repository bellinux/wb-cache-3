25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know <b>now</b> <b>who</b> gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
25|$|After {{some days}} of deliberation, Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain {{announced}} on 5 April {{that he was}} resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and Twenty20 sides in the long-term interest of the team. According to him, as he would be 37 {{by the time of}} the 2015 World Cup, could not be sure of his place in the side then and it would be better for a new captain to be groomed <b>now,</b> <b>who</b> would be at the peak of his career during that tournament. He stated he was willing to captain the team for the upcoming tours of England and possibly Australia if the selectors felt this would aid the transition to a new captaincy. A day after Sangakkara's announcement, Mahela Jayawardene resigned from the post of vice-captain, and Aravinda de Silva from the post of Chairman of Selectors.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{critics also}} praised Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus's {{performances}} in the film. Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that Gandolfini brought [...] "superb sensitivity and naked vulnerability" [...] to his portrayal of Albert, while Indiewire's Eric Kohn felt that Gandolfini [...] "truly blossoms" [...] in the film. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern similarly described Gandolfini's performance as [...] "marvelous" [...] and [...] "grounded in genial humanity", and found Louis-Dreyfus to be [...] "equally endearing". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that Gandolfini gave [...] "a performance of immense tenderness and charm", [...] "as endearing as it is heartbreaking", and said of Louis-Dreyfus, [...] "Holofcener brings out a vulnerability you may have forgotten was in this actress." [...] Slate magazine's Dana Stevens, meanwhile, wrote that [...] "There's no one making films right <b>now</b> <b>who</b> writes that kind of dialogue better than Holofcener ... And it's hard to imagine anyone speaking it better than Gandolfini and Julia Louis-Dreyfus." ...|$|E

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner <b>now</b> <b>who</b> never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E

500|$|... "Trevor" [...] was co-written by Ken Hawryliw and Jim Guttridge. Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. <b>Now,</b> <b>who</b> would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But then we had to give him an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E
500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name <b>now),</b> <b>who</b> nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E
500|$|Rivera's cut fastball was a {{respected}} pitch among major league hitters. Jim Thome called it [...] "the single best pitch {{ever in the}} game". David Ortiz echoed his sentiment, saying, [...] "His cutter was the single best pitch I've ever seen, but the really amazing thing is how {{he was able to}} do it for so many years. Are there guys <b>now</b> <b>who</b> have stuff as nasty as Mariano? Maybe for one year, two years. But nobody could maintain it like he did." [...] In 2004, ESPN.com ranked his cutter as the best [...] "out pitch" [...] in baseball. Olney described his cut fastball as [...] "the most dominant pitch of a generation". Although switch-hitters usually bat left-handed against right-handed pitchers to better see the ball's release point, switch-hitters occasionally batted right-handed when facing the right-handed Rivera to avoid being jammed on their hands by his cutter. Similarly, some managers, such as Bruce Bochy in the 1998 World Series, sent right-handed batters to pinch hit for left-handers [...] against Rivera, thinking that the cutter would be more difficult for lefties to hit. Opposing hitters occasionally chose to face Rivera with backup or batting practice bats, rather than risk their best bats being broken by his cutter.|$|E

500|$|Nathin Rabin of The A.V. Club {{said the}} episode {{made him feel}} [...] "borderline euphoric", and said of it, [...] "With a light touch the show made an {{insightful}} point—that we need our dance-offs and workday discos and spontaneous expressions of delight." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode had [...] "an infectious sense of fun" [...] and {{felt as if the}} show producers [...] "just turned the camera on the cast's wrap party and let it roll a while". However, Fickett also said very little actually happened in the episode, which he said felt [...] "mostly like filler" [...] between the recently finished Michael Scott Paper Company arc and the following week's season finale, [...] "Company Picnic". New York magazine writer Will Leitch also said the episode felt lighter than recent episodes, but he said, [...] "that’s okay: They’ve earned a week off, and they sure seem to be having a lot of fun." [...] He particularly praised the competition between Andy and Kelly, and Michael's dancing: [...] "There are few funnier dancers than Steve Carell, particularly Steve Carell amped on coffee." [...] Andy Shaw of TV Fodder said the episode allowed the entire cast to shine and included great chemistry between Phyllis Smith and Rainn Wilson. He also said he was glad to see Ellie Kemper get more screen time, [...] "and not just because she's Office eye candy. She adds some freshness to the cast, as she's the only person at Dunder Mifflin right <b>now</b> <b>who</b> doesn't really know anything about all the drama and backstory, so she just takes Michael and everyone else for face value." [...] Kelly West of Cinema Blend described [...] "Cafe Disco" [...] as [...] "one of the most random episodes of The Office." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Non-Existent Manuscript, Italian scholar Cesare G. De Michelis studies early Russian {{publications}} of the Protocols. The Protocols were first {{mentioned in the}} Russian press in April 1902, by the Saint Petersburg newspaper Novoye Vremya ( [...] – The New Times). The article was written by famous conservative publicist [...] {{as a part of}} his regular series [...] "Letters to Neighbors" [...] ("Письма к ближним") and was titled [...] "Plots against Humanity". The author described his meeting with a lady (Yuliana Glinka, as it is known <b>now)</b> <b>who,</b> after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the Protocols; but after reading some excerpts, Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reference}} to the female employees of the company not sharing in the company's profits was a very real concern at the time.

[...] The physicians felt that if the company [...] "did not give them one meal a day … they were a mean and shabby lot." [...] The board chairman felt that the company had made great strides in that area: they were already giving the employees one meal a day, providing a hot dinner [...] "at a nominal price," [...] and [...] "ot a girl went into the company's service <b>now</b> <b>who</b> did not receive 10 shillings a week." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Fagan, Clark was [...] "one of {{the most}} {{important}} prehistorians of the twentieth century", an individual whose [...] "intellectual influence on archaeology was enormous", producing a [...] "legacy to prehistory [...] will endure for generations". Coles similarly noted that he was [...] "one of the founders of European and world-wide prehistoric studies, and there are many <b>now</b> <b>who</b> would assert his primacy in these fields over all other prehistorians of the 20th century". Coles noted that among continental European scholars, Clark was [...] "the most respected British prehistorian" [...] of his generation. Clark's work was however little known in the United States, where it was eclipsed in the 1960s by the growth of processual archaeology. A less grandiose assessment was left by the archaeologist Pamela Jane Smith, who stated that Clark made [...] "major contributions to the establishment of prehistory as an academic subject at Cambridge University".|$|E
