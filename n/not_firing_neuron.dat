MS-DB neurons {{were divided into}} three groups according to their action potential characteristics and firing properties. Slow <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> displayed a broad action potential followed by a prominent after-hyperpolarization. Burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons,</b> when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials, exhibited a high-frequency burst of spikes {{on the crest of}} a slow depolarizing potential. Fast <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> did <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> bursts of spikes when depolarized from hyperpolarized holding potentials. Eighteen MS-DB neurons were identified as septohippocampal by antidromic activation. Of the septohippocampal neurons, four were slow <b>firing</b> <b>neurons,</b> five were burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> and nine were fast <b>firing</b> <b>neurons.</b> The mean axon conduction velocities of these neurons fell into two significant groups, termed slow conducting and fast conducting. Slow <b>firing</b> septohippocampal <b>neurons</b> had significantly slower conduction velocities than either fast firing or burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> (P < 0. 05), being 0. 7 ± 0. 5 ms− 1 for slow <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> and 2. 9 ± 2. 0 and 2. 0 ± 1. 4 ms− 1 for burst firing and fast <b>firing</b> <b>neurons,</b> respectively.

BF cholinergic neurons can be differentiated into two electrophysiologically identifiable subtypes: early and late <b>firing</b> <b>neurons.</b> Early <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> (∼ 70 %) are more excitable, show prominent spike frequency adaptation and are more susceptible to depolarization blockade, a phenomenon characterized by complete silencing of the neuron following initial action potentials.

In voltage clamp analysis, we have shown that early <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> have a higher density of low voltage activated (LVA) calcium currents.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the emergence of}} in-phase synchronization in a heterogeneous network of coupled inhibitory interneurons {{in the presence of}} spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Using a simple network of two mutually coupled interneurons (2 -MCI), we first study the effects of the STDP on in-phase synchronization. We demonstrate that, with STDP, the 2 -MCI network can evolve to either a state of stable 1 : 1 in-phase synchronization or exhibit multiple regimes of higher order synchronization states. We show that the emergence of synchronization induces a structural asymmetry in the 2 -MCI network such that the synapses onto the high frequency <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> are potentiated, while those onto the low frequency <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> are de-potentiated, resulting in the directed flow of information from low frequency <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> to high frequency <b>firing</b> <b>neurons.</b> Finally, we demonstrate that the principal findings from our analysis of the 2 -MCI network contribute to the emergence of robust synchronization in the Wang-Buzsaki network (Wang and Buzsaki, 1996) of all-to-all coupled inhibitory interneurons (100 -MCI) for a significantly larger range of heterogeneity in the intrinsic firing rate of the neurons in the network. We conclude that STDP of inhibitory synapses provide a viable mechanism for robust neural synchronization...|$|R
30|$|Since {{unsupervised}} learning requires competition, lateral inhibition was introduced and thus, the weights of the winner neurons (first spiking neurons) are increased while other neurons suffer a small weight reduction value. Tests showed that depressing the weights of the non <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> decrease {{the amount of}} noise in the network. The depression of synapses that do <b>not</b> <b>fire</b> at all was added in order to eliminate ‘mute’ synapses (inactive synapses), reducing the network size and improving robustness against noise. This training causes a side effect since, for weight increase, spike-intense patterns require a higher membrane threshold, avoiding the patterns with low spike intensity to be recognized by the network. This is solved by introducing negative weights, preventing neurons from reacting on every pattern and increasing the specificity of classifier.|$|R
40|$|Distinct {{functional}} {{roles in}} learning and memory {{are attributed to}} {{certain areas of the}} hippocampus and the parahippocampal region. The subiculum {{as a part of the}} hippocampal formation is the principal target of CA 1 pyramidal cell axons and serves as an interface in the information processing between the hippocampus and the neocortex. Subicular pyramidal cells have been classified as bursting and regular firing cells. Here we report fundamental differences in long-term potentiation (LTP) between both cell types. Prolonged high-frequency stimulation induced NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in both cell types. While LTP relied on postsynaptic calcium in regular <b>firing</b> <b>neurons,</b> no increase in postsynaptic calcium was required in bursting cells. Furthermore, paired-pulse facilitation revealed that the site of LTP expression was postsynaptic in regular <b>firing</b> <b>neurons,</b> while presynaptic in burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons.</b> Our findings on synaptic plasticity in the subiculum indicate that regular firing and bursting cells represent two functional units with distinct physiological roles in processing hippocampal output...|$|R

50|$|Evidence for the single-process view {{comes from}} an {{electrode}} recording study done on epileptic patients who took an item-recognition task. This study found that hippocampal neurons, regardless of successful recollection, responded to the familiarity of objects. Thus, the hippocampus may not exclusively subserve the recollection process. However, {{they also found that}} successful item recognition was not related to whether or <b>not</b> 'familiarity' <b>neurons</b> <b>fired.</b> Therefore, it's <b>not</b> entirely clear which responses relate to successful item recognition. However, one study suggested that hippocampal activation {{does not necessarily mean that}} conscious recollection will occur. In this object-scene associative recognition study, hippocampal activation was not related to successful associative recollection; it was only when the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus was activated that successful performance was observed. Further, eye tracking evidence revealed that participants looked longer at the correct stimulus, and this was related to increases in hippocampal activity. Therefore, the hippocampus may play a role in the recovery of relational information, but it requires concomitant activation with the prefrontal cortex for conscious recollection.|$|R
40|$|The rostral {{nucleus of}} the solitary tract (rNST) plays {{a pivotal role in}} taste processing. The rNST {{contains}} projection neurons and interneurons that differ in morphology and intrinsic membrane properties. Although characteristics of the projection neurons have been detailed, similar information is lacking on the interneurons. We determined the intrinsic properties of the rNST GABAergic interneurons using a transgenic mouse model that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of a GAD 67 promoter. Glutamic acid decarboxylase–green fluorescent protein (GAD 67 –GFP) neurons were distributed throughout the rNST but were concentrated in the ventral subdivision with minimal interaction with the terminal field of the afferent input. Furthermore, the density of the GAD 67 –GFP neurons decreased in more rostral areas of rNST. In whole cell recordings, GAD 67 –GFP neurons responded with either an initial burst (73 %), tonic (18 %), or irregular (9 %) discharge pattern of action potentials (APs) in response to membrane depolarization. These three groups also differed in passive and AP characteristics. Initial burst neurons had small ovoid or fusiform cell bodies, whereas tonic <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> had large multipolar or fusiform cell bodies. Irregular <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> had larger spherical soma. Some of the initial burst and tonic <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> were also spontaneously active. The GAD 67 –GFP neurons could also be categorized in subgroups based on colocalization with somatostatin and parvalbumin immunolabeling. Initial burst neurons would transmit the early dynamic portion of the encoded sensory stimuli, whereas tonic <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> could respond to both dynamic and static components of the sensory input, suggesting different roles for GAD 67 –GFP neurons in taste processing...|$|R

40|$|To {{examine the}} role of striatal {{mechanisms}} in cocaine-induced stereotyped licking, we investigated the acute effects of cocaine on striatal neurons in awake, freely moving rats before and after cocaine administration (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg). Stereotyped licking was induced only by the high dose. Relative to control (saline), cocaine reduced lick duration and concurrently increased interlick interval, particularly at the high dose, {{but it did not}} affect licking rhythm. Firing rates of striatal neurons phasically related to licking movements were compared between matched licks before and after injection, minimizing any influence of sensorimotor variables on changes in firing. Both increases and decreases in average firing rate of striatal neurons were observed after cocaine injection,and these changes exhibited a dose-dependent pattern that strongly depended on predrug firing rate. At the middle and high doses relative to the saline group, the average firing rates of slow <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> were increased by cocaine, resulting from a general elevation of movement-related firing rates. In contrast, fast <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> showed decreased average firing rates only in the high-dose group, with reduced firing rates across the entire range for these neurons. Our findings suggest that at the high dose, increased phasic activity of slow <b>firing</b> striatal <b>neurons</b> and simultaneously reduced phasic activity of fast <b>firing</b> striatal <b>neurons</b> may contribute, respectively, to the continual initiation of stereotypic movements and the absence of longer movements...|$|R

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{mechanism of}} synchronous firing {{in a population}} of neu-rons is studied {{from the point of}} view of information geometry. Higher-order interactions of neurons, which cannot be reduced to pairwise corre-lations, are proved to exist in synchronous <b>firing.</b> In a <b>neuron</b> pool where each <b>neuron</b> <b>fires</b> stochastically, the probability distribution q(r) of the ac-tivity r, which is the fraction of <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the pool, is studied. When q(r) has a widespread distribution, in particular, when q(r) has two peaks, the <b>neurons</b> <b>fire</b> synchronously at one time and are quiescent at other times. The mechanism of generating such a probability distribution is interesting because the activity r is concentrated on its mean value when each <b>neuron</b> <b>fires</b> independently, because of the law of large numbers. Even when pairwise interactions, or third-order interactions, exist, the concentration is not resolved. This shows that higher-order interactions are necessary to generate widespread activity distributions.

Phase transitions in epileptiform activity in neurons following a prolonged challenge with an epileptogenic stimulus has been shown in other brain structures, but not in the subiculum. Considering the importance of the subicular burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> in the propagation of epileptiform activity to the entorhinal cortex, we have explored the phenomenon of phase transitions in the burst <b>firing</b> <b>neurons</b> of the subiculum in an in vitro rat brain slice model of epileptogenesis. Whole-cell patch-clamp and extracellular field recordings revealed a distinct phenomenon in the subiculum wherein an early hyperexcitable state was followed by a late suppressed state upon continuous perfusion with epileptogenic 4 -aminopyridine and magnesium-free medium. The suppressed state was characterized by inhibitory post-synaptic potentials in pyramidal excitatory neurons and bursting activity in local fast-spiking interneurons at a frequency of 0. 1 - 0. 8 Hz. The inhibitory post-synaptic potentials were mediated by GABA(A) receptors that coincided with excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate action potential discharge. These inhibitory post-synaptic potentials ceased following a cut between the cornu ammonis 1 and subiculum. The suppression of epileptiform activity in the subiculum thus represents a homeostatic response towards the induced hyperexcitability. Our results suggest the importance of feedforward inhibition in exerting this homeostatic control...|$|R
