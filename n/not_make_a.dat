5|$|Although no {{supernova}} {{has been}} observed in the Milky Way since 1604, it appears that a supernova exploded in the constellation Cassiopeia about 300 years ago, around the year 1667 or 1680. The remnant of this explosion, Cassiopeia Ais heavily obscured by interstellar dust, which is possibly why it did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> notable appearance. However it {{can be observed in}} other parts of the spectrum, and it is currently the brightest radio source beyond our solar system.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial and he could <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found {{a solution to this}} problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Garcia debuted {{with the}} Indians on October 8, 1948, {{just before the}} Indians played in the 1948 World Series.

It was the franchise's second World Series victory, but Garcia did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> World Series appearance.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> real tensor for this reason.|$|E

5|$|If the Wartburg and Hambach rallies had {{lacked a}} {{constitution}} and administrative apparatus, that problem was addressed between 1867 and 1871. Yet, as Germans discovered, grand speeches, flags, and enthusiastic crowds, a constitution, a political reorganization, {{and the provision}} of an imperial superstructure; and the revised Customs Union of 1867–68, still did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> nation.|$|E
5|$|Joss {{made his}} major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also {{known as the}} Bluebirds) against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop fly in the {{direction}} of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey did <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never hit the ground.) Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} outside of Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator {{instead of the}} dainty-looking sorceress she originally was.

5|$|Andrea Bowen, {{who starred}} as Susan's daughter, Julie, {{departed}} from the cast, as her character left for college {{at the end of}} the fourth season. Teri Hatcher expressed disappointment in the producers' decision, but Cherry stated that Bowen would return in the future. Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision on his character until mid-June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated. It was later confirmed that he would return to the series.|$|E
