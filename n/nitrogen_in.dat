5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes.

5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix <b>nitrogen</b> <b>in</b> some bacteria and cyanobacteria, all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide's rapid {{reaction}} {{with water}} in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>in</b> proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid.

5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards <b>nitrogen.</b> <b>In</b> these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>in</b> a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E
