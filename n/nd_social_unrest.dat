40|$|Can {{food prices}} cause <b>social</b> <b>unrest?</b> Throughout history, riots have {{frequently}} broken out, ostensibly {{as a consequence}} of high food prices. Using monthly data at the international level, this article studies the impact of food prices – food price levels as well as food price volatility – on <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> Because food prices and <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> are jointly determined, data on natural disasters are used to identify the causal relationship flowing from food price levels to <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> Results indicate that for the period 1990 – 2011, food price increases have led to increases in <b>social</b> <b>unrest,</b> whereas food price volatility has not been associated with increases in <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> These results are robust to alternative definitions of <b>social</b> <b>unrest,</b> to using real or nominal prices, to using commodity-specific price indices instead of aggregated price indices, to alternative definitions of the instrumental variable, to alternative definitions of volatility, and to controlling for non-food-related <b>social</b> <b>unrest...</b>|$|R
40|$|From 1985 - 2005 Bolivia {{experienced}} {{a rise in}} foreign direct investment (FDI) and a rise in <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> This study seeks to apply Gurr???s (1970) theory of relative deprivation to the rise in <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in Bolivia during this time by presenting a closer examination of the statistics for FDI and other social and economic indicators identified by Gurr (1968) and later Oseghale (1993). Gurr (1970) theorized that across many populations at a given time, {{a high level of}} relative deprivation correlated with a high magnitude of <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> This study shows that in a single population over a long period, <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> correlates more with the change in the level of relative deprivation rather than the absolute measurement of relative deprivation. In addition, when isolated from other social and economic indicators, there is a significant correlation between FDI and the magnitude of <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in Bolivia during this time...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{an answer}} to the {{question}} of why <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> sometimes occurs in the wake of an IMF Structural Adjustment Program (SAP). Under certain circumstances, partly determined by a country 2 ̆ 019 s comparative advantage, a nation 2 ̆ 019 s elite may have an incentive to make transfers to the rest of society through government employment in order to quell <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> But under an SAP, the elite are constrained from making such transfers and consequently <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> may arise. The paper proposes a framework from which a prediction can be made about the circumstances under which <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> can be expected to occur. It then takes this prediction to the data and finds empirical support for it...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between peace and development holds {{the key to}} effective strategies for addressing the roots of <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> Rising expectations are the principal driving force for social development. However, the faster and higher aspirations rise, the greater the gap between expectations and reality. That gap promotes a sense of frustration, depravation and aggression leading to <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> and violence. The opposite is also true: rising economic opportunity can mitigate or eliminate <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> The remarkable renunciation of armed struggle by the IRA in North Ireland in mid - 2005 appears inexplicable until the impact of rising incomes and expanding employment opportunities in the Republic of Ireland is also taken into account. A similar approach {{can be applied to}} address the problems of violence and <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in Kashmir and Palestine. Here too apparently intractable conflicts will lend themselves to be addressed economically. India's recent efforts to provide guaranteed employment to its rural poor are part of a strategy to stem the rising tide of <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in impoverished areas resulting from rising expectations among the poor...|$|R

40|$|The {{world has}} seen over recent months an {{increase}} in the level of <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in response to both the imposition by governments of austerity measures and attempts by civilians to overthrow undemocratic and repressive regimes. This unprecedented and extensive level of unrest across diverse political and economic environments has raised many questions as to the causes and consequences, {{not the least of which}} is the challenge to the sovereignty of the state and the role of globalization. This paper will discuss the <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> consequences of globalization and consider whether globalization has undermined the concept of state sovereignty to such an extent that the <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> in evidence is in effect the beginning of a new era in international law and international relations...|$|R

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature has}} not been successful in generating robust results for {{a positive relationship between}} income inequality and <b>social</b> <b>unrest</b> outcomes such as crime and suicide. This paper questions the use of standard income inequality measures (e. g., Gini coefficient) in such studies and shows that income-mobility-based measures are effective in explaining outcomes of <b>social</b> <b>unrest.</b> Analyses of Korean and the United States region-by-year data suggest that crime and suicide rates are better explained by income immobility (i. e., the degree of economic segregation) rather than the inequality aspects of income distribution. The explanatory power improves as a heavier weight is placed on the poor group's degree of immobility. Findings in the current study will be helpful for guiding future efforts to develop more effective measures of <b>social</b> <b>unrest...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have studied the}} trends that accompany <b>social</b> <b>unrest,</b> and have suggested ties between youth and revolt. Most notable is Gunnar Heinsohn’s theory of the youth bulge. According to this theory, an especially large population of young people, especially males, is associated with <b>social</b> <b>unrest,</b> war, and terrorism. The rationale that Heinsohn gives is that these population trends leave many people unable to find prestigious places in society, so they {{turn their attention to}} creating change in society.|$|R
