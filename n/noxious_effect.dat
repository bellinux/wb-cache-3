25|$|Researchers at the University of Nice in France {{have been}} {{studying}} a tiny aquatic slug which is a natural predator of C. taxifolia. Called Elysia subornata, it was found {{off the coast of}} Florida, in waters warmer than those in the Mediterranean. This slug is believed to feed exclusively on C. taxifolia, by sticking its proboscis into the stem and sucking out the white viscous liquid inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an enzyme which neutralizes the <b>noxious</b> <b>effect</b> of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.|$|E
500|$|The skin of many frogs {{contains}} mild {{toxic substances}} called bufotoxins {{to make them}} unpalatable to potential predators. Most toads and some frogs have large poison glands, the parotoid glands, located {{on the sides of}} their heads behind the eyes and other glands elsewhere on their bodies.

If the <b>noxious</b> <b>effect</b> is immediate, the predator may cease its action and the frog may escape.

60|$|We {{come now}} to our third class of Fringing-reefs, which will require a very short notice. Where the land slopes {{abruptly}} under water, these reefs {{are only a few}} yards in width, forming a mere ribbon or fringe round the shores: where the land slopes gently under the water the reef extends farther, sometimes even as much as a mile from the land; but in such cases the soundings outside the reef always show that the submarine prolongation of the land is gently inclined. In fact the reefs extend only to that distance from the shore at which a foundation within the requisite depth from 20 to 30 fathoms is found. As far as the actual reef is concerned, there is no essential difference between it and that forming a barrier or an atoll: it is, however, generally of less width, and consequently few islets have been formed on it. From the corals growing more vigorously on the outside, and from the <b>noxious</b> <b>effect</b> of the sediment washed inwards, {{the outer edge of the}} reef is the highest part, and between it and the land there is generally a shallow sandy channel a few feet in depth. Where banks of sediment have accumulated near to the surface, as in parts of the West Indies, they sometimes become fringed with corals, and hence in some degree resemble lagoon-islands or atolls, in the same manner as fringing-reefs, surrounding gently sloping islands, in some degree resemble barrier-reefs.|$|E

40|$|Background: Amyloid beta (Aβ) is {{the main}} agent {{responsible}} for the advent and progression of Alzheimer's disease. This peptide can at least partially antagonize nerve growth factor (NGF) signalling in neurons, which {{may be responsible for}} some of the effects produced by Aβ. Accordingly, better understanding the NGF signalling pathway may provide clues as to how to protect neurons from the toxic effects of Aβ. Results: We show here that Aβ activates the RhoA GTPase by binding to p 75 NTR, thereby preventing the NGF-induced activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B) that is required for neuron survival. We also show that the inactivation of RhoA GTPase and the activation of PTP 1 B protect cultured hippocampal neurons against the <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> of Aβ. Indeed, either pharmacological inhibition of RhoA with C 3 ADP ribosyl transferase or the transfection of cultured neurons with a dominant negative form of RhoA protects cultured hippocampal neurons from the effects of Aβ. In addition, over-expression of PTP 1 B also prevents the deleterious effects of Aβ on cultured hippocampal neurons.

40|$|The {{release of}} methyl {{isocyanate}} in Bhopal, India, caused the worst industrial accident in history. Exposures to industrial isocyanates induce lacrimation, pain, airway irritation, and edema. Similar responses are elicited by chemicals used as tear gases. Despite frequent exposures, the biological targets of isocyanates and tear gases in vivo {{have not been}} identified, precluding the development of effective countermeasures. We use Ca 2 + imaging and electrophysiology {{to show that the}} <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> of isocyanates and those of all major tear gas agents are caused by activation of Ca 2 + influx and membrane currents in mustard oil-sensitive sensory neurons. These responses are mediated by transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1), an ion channel serving as a detector for reactive chemicals. In mice, genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of TRPA 1 dramatically reduces isocyanate- and tear gas-induced nocifensive behavior after both ocular and cutaneous exposures. We conclude that isocyanates and tear gas agents target the same neuronal receptor, TRPA 1. Treatment with TRPA 1 antagonists may prevent and alleviate chemical irritation of the eyes, skin, and airways and reduce the adverse health effects of exposures {{to a wide range of}} toxic noxious chemicals. —Bessac, B.

40|$|Background The {{psychological}} {{transmission of}} the <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> of a major trauma {{from one generation to}} the next remains unclear. The present study aims to identify possible mechanisms explaining this transmission among families of Holocaust Survivors (HS). We hypothesized that the high level of depressive and anxiety disorders (DAD) among HS impairs family systems, which results in damaging coping strategies of their children (CHS) yielding a higher level of DAD. Methods 49 CHS completed the Resilience Scale for Adults, the Hopkins Symptom Check List- 25, the 13 -Item Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale. We test a mediation model with Family types as the predictor; coping strategies (i. e. Resilience or SOC) as the mediator; and DAD as the outcome variable. Results Results confirm that the CHS' family types are more often damaged than in general population. Moreover, growing in a damaged family seems to impede development of coping strategies and, therefore, enhances the occurrence of DAD. Limitations The present investigation is correlational and should be confirmed by other prospective investigations. Conclusions At a theoretical level we propose a mechanism of {{transmission of the}} <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> of a major trauma {{from one generation to the}} next through family structure and coping strategies. At a clinical level, our results suggest to investigate the occurrence of trauma among parents of patients consulting for DAD and to reinforce their coping strategies.

40|$|Abstract Background Tissue {{plasminogen}} activator (tPA) exerts multiple {{functions in}} the central nervous system, depending on the partner with which it interacts. In particular, tPA acts as a positive neuromodulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamatergic receptors (NMDAR). At the molecular level, it has been proposed that the pro-neurotoxicity mediated by tPA might occur through extrasynaptic NMDAR containing the GluN 2 D subunit. Thus, selective antagonists targeting tPA/GluN 2 D-containing NMDAR signaling would {{be of interest to}} prevent <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> of tPA. Results Here, we compared three putative antagonists of GluN 2 D-containing NMDAR and we showed that the new compound UBP 145 ((2 R*, 3 S*) - 1 -(9 -bromophenan-threne- 3 -carbonyl) piperazine- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid) is far more selective for GluN 2 D subunits than memantine and PPDA (phenanthrene derivative (2 S*, 3 R*) - 1 -(phenanthrene- 2 -carbonyl) piperazine- 2, 3 -dicarboxylic acid). Indeed, in vitro, in contrast to the two other compounds, UBP 145 prevented NMDA toxicity only in neurons expressing GluN 2 D (ie, in cortical but not hippocampal neurons). Furthermore, in cultured cortical neurons, UBP 145 fully prevented the pro-excitotoxic effect of tPA. In vivo, we showed that UBP 145 potently prevented the noxious action of exogenous tPA on excitotoxic damages. Moreover, in a thrombotic stroke model in mice, administration of UBP 145 prevented the deleterious effect of late thrombolysis by tPA. Conclusions In conclusion, tPA exerts <b>noxious</b> <b>effects</b> on neurons by acting on GluN 2 D-containing NMDAR and pharmacological antagonists of GluN 2 D-containing NMDAR could be used to prevent the ability of tPA to promote neurotoxicity. </p...|$|R
