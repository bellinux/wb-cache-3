40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of the effect of various fuel economy technologies on the certified CO 2 emissions of light duty vehicles. The vehicles operate under two different driving cycles, namely the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide harmonized Light duty Test Procedure (WLTP), which is considered closer to real world driving and {{is going to be the}} <b>new</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test in the near future. The study focuses on the comparative evaluation of the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions under these two driving cycles. To this aim, simulation models for a number of passenger cars were developed and validated against test data, generated via a specifically developed test protocol. In order to cover a large share of the market, the European fleet was divided into a number of segments based on specific vehicle characteristics and technologies, and representative vehicles for each segment were chosen. In order to minimize flexibilities and sources of uncertainty, the models were developed according to a standardized modelling procedure, based on the development of a reference “template model”. AVL's Cruise was used as simulation platform. The various components and modules for each vehicle model, as well as the respective input parameters, were defined with the support of the respective OEMs. After gaining confidence in the simulation models for all the vehicles considered in the present work, additional technologies, such as start-stop, brake energy recuperation and different drivetrain configurations, were implemented in each model. Specific strategies have been defined for the implementation of individual technologies and, where needed, additional algorithms were developed in Cruise. The results show that the effect of each technology on CO 2 emissions is different between NEDC and WLTP, owing to the different characteristics of each cycle. For example, the effect of start-stop on CO 2 emissions is larger in NEDC, due to longer idling periods compared to WLTP. In this context, the results of this study can provide useful indications for the most effective fuel economy technologies under the <b>new</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> procedure...|$|R
40|$|Before {{the end of}} 2013, the {{responsible}} institutions of the European Union will probably decide on {{a proposal for a}} new “Regulation on the sound level of motor vehicles. ” It will specify a <b>new</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> test method for noise emission and will give revised limit values for the permissible noise emission per vehicle (sub-) category.

40|$|The {{present report}} summarises the work {{carried out by}} the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to {{estimate}} the impact of the introduction of the <b>new</b> <b>type</b> <b>approval</b> procedure, the Worldwide Light duty vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), on the European car fleet CO 2 emissions. To this aim, a new method for the calculation of the European light duty vehicle fleet CO 2 emissions, combining simulation at individual vehicle level with fleet composition data is adopted. The method builds on the work carried out in the development of CO 2 MPAS, the tool developed by the Joint Research Centre to allow the implementation of European Regulations 1152 and 1153 / 2017 (which set the conditions to amend the European CO 2 targets for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles due to the introduction of the WLTP in the European vehicle type-approval process). Results show an average WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio in the range 1. 1 - 1. 4 depending on the powertrain and on the NEDC CO 2 emissions. In particular the ratio tends to be higher for vehicles with lower NEDC CO 2 emissions in all powertrains, the only exception being with the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). In this case, indeed, the WLTP to NEDC CO 2 emissions ratio quickly decreases to values that can be also lower than 1 as the electric range of the vehicle increases. JRC.

2500|$|In {{much the}} same way as they had taken up the Tojeiro {{prototype}} and turned it into the Ace, AC acquired the rights and at the 1973 London Motor Show showed their own version, the mid-engined ME3000 with the 3.0-litre Ford Essex V6 engine installed transversely over a bespoke AC-designed gearbox. Development was virtually complete in 1976 when <b>new</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> regulations were introduced. A prototype failed the [...] crash test, and the chassis had to be redesigned. On the second attempt, the car passed with flying colours. This was a huge achievement for a tiny firm—Vauxhall had to make several attempts before the contemporary Chevette passed. For AC, such delays meant that the first production cars (now renamed 3000ME) were not delivered until 1979, by which time they were in direct competition with the Lotus Esprit. Although comfortable, brisk, nicely built and practical, AC's ambitions of selling 250 cars per year were a distant memory. After just 71 cars were sold, Hurlock called a halt to production as his health was suffering and the company was struggling in the teeth of a recession. In 1984, production stopped at Thames Ditton and the car and the AC name were licensed to a new company registered as AC (Scotland) plc run by David McDonald in a new factory in Hillington, Glasgow. Here, 30 cars were built, including a development car tested with Alfa Romeo's 2.5-litre V6 engine and a nearly complete Mark 2 prototype of the same. Regardless (or possibly because) of these developments, AC Scotland called in the receivers in 1985.|$|R

40|$|Real-world CO 2 {{emissions}} of passenger cars very often deviate from the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value. The <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> value for CO 2 {{emissions of}} passenger cars {{is based on}} a chassis dynamometer test in a laboratory. The total vehicle resistance of a vehicle, or 'road load', is simulated on the chassis dynamometer to obtain representative emissions. The road load of a vehicle is determined by means of a coast down test. As a large number of parameters and external conditions influence the coast down test, the <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> procedures for performing the coast down test allow for certain margins within which certain test parameters should lie. These margins can partly explain the difference between the real-world and <b>Type</b> <b>Approval</b> CO 2 emissions.
