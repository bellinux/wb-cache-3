5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro {{also points out that}} some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{about what would}} have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana would not have been appropriate. This is because mana is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E

25|$|In other words, on average, 80% of {{the times}} that upper and lower {{thresholds}} are calculated by this method, the true mean is both below the upper threshold and above the lower threshold. This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> {{saying that there is}} an 80% probability that the true mean lies between a particular pair of upper and lower thresholds that have been calculated by this method; see confidence interval and prosecutor's fallacy.|$|E
500|$|This {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a value of 0. [...] A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> an answer of [...] "no". [...] For example, consider the question [...] "How many books does Adam own?" [...] The answer may be [...] "zero" [...] (we know that he owns none) or [...] "null" [...] (we do not know how many he owns). [...] In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start out with no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value [...] "zero" [...] until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.|$|E
500|$|The use of iron {{instead of}} wood {{as the primary}} {{material}} of ships' hulls began in the 1830s; the first [...] "warship" [...] with an iron hull was the gunboat Nemesis, built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839. [...] There followed, also from Laird, the first full-blown warships with metal hulls, the 1842 steam frigates Guadelupe and Montezuma for the Mexican navy. [...] But a thin iron skin, while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood, was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire.|$|E

500|$|Women's yeshivas {{that include}} Talmud {{study on the}} {{curriculum}} often schedule chavrusa study sessions for their students. In Orthodox women's seminaries, students are paired with study partners of equal or greater strength to learn Halakha, Chumash, Jewish philosophy, or any other topic in Judaism. Although the latter set-up is often called [...] "chavrusa learning", it is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> what Orthodox men do and is better called [...] "one-on-one study". In recent years, telephone study partnerships for women have been promoted as a kiruv (Jewish outreach) tool in Israel and as an option for busy homemakers.|$|E

While reviewing Spears' third studio album Britney (2001), Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the track, along with [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman" [...] and [...] "What It's Like to Be Me", [...] "are pivotal moments on Britney Spears' third album, the record where she strives to deepen her persona (<b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> her character, of course), making it more adult while still recognizably Britney".|$|E
500|$|As the {{difference}} between the two prices or quantities increases, the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons. [...] First, the PED for a good is not necessarily constant; as explained below, PED can vary at different points along the demand curve, due to its percentage nature. Elasticity is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> the slope of the demand curve, which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity. [...] Second, percentage changes are not symmetric; instead, the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value. For example, if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units, the percentage change is 50%, i.e., (15 − 10) ÷ 10 (converted to a percentage). [...] But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units, the percentage change is −33.3%, i.e., (10 − 15)÷15.|$|E

500|$|The basic {{concepts}} of most DKP systems are simple. [...] Players are given points {{for participating in}} raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss 'drops' the item. [...] A player who does not {{get a chance to}} spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future. [...] These points, while earned and spent like currency, are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world. [...] The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players. [...] Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband, those points become valueless. [...] These measures vary considerably in usage. [...] Some guilds eschew formalized 'loot' systems completely, allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses. [...] Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding. [...] A few common variations are described below.|$|E
