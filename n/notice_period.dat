Rangers also failed to beat Alloa either home or away in the league before losing 3–2 to Alloa in the semi-final of the Scottish Challenge Cup. Amid mounting criticism, McCoist submitted his resignation intending to honour his 12 months <b>notice</b> <b>period</b> but was placed on 'gardening leave' and replaced by Kenny McDowall on a caretaker basis. McDowall remained in charge for just three months before resigning in March 2015. During his time in charge, Rangers won just three matches. Rangers then named former player Stuart McCall as their third manager of the season for the remaining fixtures. Under McCall, Rangers finished third in the league and then reached the Premiership play-off final, which they lost 6–1 on aggregate to Motherwell.|$|E

500|$|He {{had joined}} the board of First Division club Birmingham City in January 1976. When Willie Bell was sacked as manager in September 1977, Ramsey refused {{to take his place}} on a {{permanent}} basis, but did agree to act as caretaker until a successor could be found. By early November, he had changed his mind. He resigned his directorship to take on the role of consultant, with a remit that covered not only day-to-day team management but also a wide-ranging responsibility for club affairs, to include the selection of Birmingham's next manager. His tenure lasted just four months. In February 1978, star player Trevor Francis was fined for giving newspaper interviews about his desire to leave a club he saw as lacking ambition, and the board accepted Ramsey's recommendation to place him on the transfer list. Three days later, when the decision was reversed for fear of a backlash from supporters, Ramsey gave two weeks' notice to quit. The club announced his resignation before the <b>notice</b> <b>period</b> ended, and reports attributed his departure to the recent 4–0 defeat by Coventry City. Ramsey was quick to refute any such link, insisting that he had [...] "never walked out on anyone". Francis was sold less than a year later, in {{what became known as the}} first million-pound transfer.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2008, {{the parties}} had {{attempted}} to agree on dates for the races.

[...] GGYC took the position that the 10-month <b>notice</b> <b>period</b> should run from the November 2007, when the court of first instance ruled that CNEV was not a valid [...] challenger, so the races should take place in October 2008. [...] Despite various attempts, the parties were unable to agree on the dates and on May 12, 2008, the New York Supreme Court issued an order setting the date at 10 months after that date. The 10-month delay was held to have been suspended during the appeals process and was reinstated by the final April2, 2009 decision of the New York Court of Appeals. However, SNG refused to accept a race in February 2010, arguing again that the deed did not permit racing in the Northern Hemisphere until May. GGYC forced a court session and, on May14, 2009, the court ruled from the bench that the race must take place in February 2010, unless another date was mutually agreed to.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} secure employment, either in one's current job or {{in a job}} that utilises a person's skills in the most {{socially}} productive way, is usually seen as crucial {{for the success of}} the economy and human development. The aim is to counterbalance the destructive effect on productivity and social costs that come from abuse of managerial power. Consistent with minimal international standards, employees in the United Kingdom have three principal job security rights, introduced originally by the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965 and the Industrial Relations Act 1971. First, after one month's work an employee must have at least one week's notice before any dismissal, unless there has been gross misconduct. This minimum rises to two weeks after two years, three weeks after three years, and so on, up to twelve weeks after twelve years. Second, after two years' work, the dismissal must be fair. This means the employer must have a justification based on an employee's capability, conduct, redundancy or another good reason, or the employee can claim damages or the job back from an Employment Tribunal. Third, also after two years' work and if dismissed because the enterprise no longer needs someone doing the employee's job, there is a right to a redundancy payment. Like the <b>notice</b> <b>period,</b> redundancy pay increases according to the number of years worked. Contracts should usually go beyond this bare minimum, but cannot go below. Compared to its European and Commonwealth counterparts, jobs in the UK are relatively insecure. Workers have few ways, except pressure through collective bargaining, to challenge a management's decision about dismissals before they take place. When collective redundancies are proposed, however, EU law has introduced a requirement that employers consult on changes. EU law also introduced a rule that if a business is transferred, for instance, during a merger or acquisition, employees may not have their terms worsened or lose their jobs without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. If employees do lose their work, they may fall back on a minimal system of state insurance, funded primarily through income tax or National Insurance, to collect a [...] "jobseekers allowance", and may make use of public employment agencies to find employment again. The UK government has in the past aimed to create [...] "full employment" [...] however this goal has not necessarily translated into secure and stable work.|$|E

2500|$|While [...] "wrongful" [...] {{dismissal}} concerns breaches of {{the terms}} of an employment contract, [...] "unfair" [...] dismissal is a claim based on the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 94 to 134A. It governs the reasons for which an employer terminates a contract, and requires they fall into the statutory definition of what is [...] "fair". The Industrial Relations Act 1971, following the Donovan Report 1968, set up its structure. Under ERA 1996 section 94 any employee, who is employed for over two years, may claim for an Employment Tribunal (composed of a judge, an employer and an employee representative) to review the decision. Temporary or seasonal breaks in employment, such as for teachers who are not in class over summer, cannot break the continuity of the contract for the qualifying period, even if a contract purports to be for a fixed term. An employee is only [...] "dismissed" [...] if the employer has decided to end the work relationship, or if they have constructively dismissed the employee through a serious breach of mutual trust and confidence. An employee will not have a claim if they have voluntarily resigned, though a court must be satisfied that someone truly intended to forgo the legal right to sue for unfair dismissal. In Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd v Lineham Mr Lineham used the toilet at work after drinking at the pub. Afterwards, in response to the manager rebuking him in front of other staff, he threw down his keys and drove off. He claimed he was dismissed, and the Tribunal agreed that at no time had Mr Lineham resigned. By contrast in Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp Mr Sharp walked off because the company welfare officer refused to let him collect holiday pay immediately. Although Mr Sharp was in financial difficulty, this was due to his absences, and so he was not justified in leaving, and not constructively dismissed. Under ERA 1996 section 203(1), statutory rights may not be excluded or limited, although section 203(2) and (3) still allows employers and employees to settle a legal claim, so long as the compromise agreement is made freely and with independent legal advice. It has also been held that an employee is not dismissed if the relationship is frustrated. In Notcutt v Universal Equipment Co (London) Ltd a man's heart attack meant he could no longer work. The employer paid no wages during the ordinary <b>notice</b> <b>period,</b> but was successful in arguing that the contract was impossible to perform and therefore void. This doctrine, applicable as a default rule in general contract law, is controversial since unlike commercial parties it will be rare that an employee has the foresight or ability to contract around the rule. The Supreme Court recently emphasised in Gisda Cyf v Barratt that the [...] "need to segregate intellectually common law principles relating to contract law, even in the field of employment, from statutorily conferred rights is fundamental." [...] This meant that when an employee claimed unfair dismissal, after accusations of allegedly inappropriate behaviour at a private party, the three month time limit for her claim only began running when the employer had actually notified her. The general contract law principle that notifications take effect when arriving during business hours was not even [...] "a preliminary guide" [...] to the interpretation of the right to a fair dismissal.|$|E

40|$|Differential {{enforcement}} of employment protection by explicit {{design of the}} legislation, for example through exemptions for small firms, has been exploited in {{a growing body of}} research. However, {{little is known about the}} effects of differential enforcement that is not defined by the letter of the law, presumably due to the lack of data. Our study incorporates aspects of both types of differential enforcement as we combine the evaluation of a partial reform with information on the more difficult-to-observe {{enforcement of}} the same reform in collective agreements. We analyse a reform of <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> for employer-initiated separations in Sweden, which reduced the <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> for newly hired older workers substantially but implied minor or no changes in the notices for younger workers. The reform was initiated at different times depending on collective agreement. These circumstances provide ample opportunity for the identification of its effects. Our findings indicate heterogeneous effects across collective agreements. Despite differences in terms of dynamics and size, a positive effect on hirings is found for all agreements. In most cases, our results also show an increase in separations, indicating an increase in employment turnover. A salient feature of the results is that the estimated effects increase with the treatment dose, i. e., the size of the reduction in <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> across different age groups.

40|$|Job {{protection}} {{has often}} been blamed {{as a source of}} the poor employment performance of many European countries. Since the beginning of the 90 s, much attention has been devoted to the theoretical and the empirical analysis of the consequences of labor market regulation on labor market performance. In this paper, we summarize these results by considering three main indicators of job protection: administrative firing costs, <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> and short-term contracts. We study the effects of job protection policies thanks to an equilibrium matching model calibrated on the French labor market. Our results suggest that administrative firing costs and <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> have no significant effect on the unemployment rate. However these instruments profoundly modify the composition of unemployment as well as labor market dynamics. Ultimately, we consider the potential employment protection effect of an US based experience rated scheme on the French labor market. To a certain extent, this system is here proven to improve labor market performance. L'Haridon Olivier, Malherbet Franck. Protection de l'emploi et performance du marché du travail.

For example, in Austria, Belgium, or Greece, different EPL rules exist for blue-collar and for white-collar workers. Similarly, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, and Madagascar, workers are divided into categories, and different EPL rules (such as <b>notice</b> <b>periods</b> or severance pay) apply to workers in each category. Another example is Senegal and Tunisia, where workers in managerial positions enjoy levels of protection different from those of other workers. In all of these cases, each of the specific categories is considered as being covered by EPL, despite the fact that different rules may apply.|$|R
30|$|The {{reason for}} the strong and {{sensitive}} consideration of the core workforce was {{closely related to the}} general scarcity of workers and employees during the 1960 s and early 1970 s.

According to the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, {{at the end of the}} 1970 s approximately 48 [*]% of all workers were comprehensively protected. The Work Constitution Act in 1972 strengthened the role of the works councils in terms of dismissals so that measures against the essential interests of the core workforce became nearly impossible.|$|R
