30|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{problems}} in the use and disposal of poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and includes the concise background of virgin and recycled PET as well as their possible applications. The current state of knowledge with respect to PET recycling method is presented. Recycling of PET is the most desirable method for waste management, providing an opportunity for reductions in oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and PET waste requiring disposal because of its <b>non-degradability.</b> Advanced technologies and systems for reducing contamination, mechanical and chemical recycling, and their applications are discussed, and the possibility of diverting the majority of PET waste from landfills or incineration to recycling is suggested.|$|E
30|$|Besides nutrients, {{excessive}} {{amounts of}} heavy metals {{have been introduced}} to estuarine and coastal environments {{as a result of}} intense industrial development and anthropogenic activities (Fianko et al. 2007; Nduka and Orisakwe 2009; Sundaray et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012; Lacerda et al. 2013). Heavy metals are deemed to be dangerous pollutants and have raised environmental concern due to their toxicity, persistence and <b>non-degradability,</b> bioaccumulation in organisms, and ultimately their effect on human health (Burgos and Rainbow 2001; Kress et al. 2004; Otero et al. 2005; Kurun et al. 2007; Du Laing et al. 2008). Special attentions have been paid to Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn and many other heavy metals.|$|E
30|$|This {{subsequent}} {{addition of}} test substance allows {{the detection of}} any false positive effect caused e.g. by the increased bioavailability of nutrients or easily biodegradable organic components from the sludge due to the solubilizing action of the surfactant (for known bacteriotoxic substances (e.g. many surfactants) {{it may be necessary}} to reduce the substance concentration so far that toxic effects no longer occur). The inclusion of a toxicity control, e.g. glucose of acetate, can help to distinguish between <b>non-degradability</b> cased by persistence or by toxic inhibition. However, depending on the biological activity of the sludge inoculum used (gas production rate of the control), the substance concentration can only be reduced to a limited extent as the signal/noise ratio has a limiting effect from approx. 120 mg TOC/L.|$|E
40|$|The {{real and}} {{potential}} applications of phospholipid and surfactant vesicles {{in areas such}} as drug delivery, solar energy conversion, and chemical reactivity control have been discussed by Fendler. Additional applications may be foreseen for vesicles which can be made to respond to environmental stimuli such as heat, light, or specific chemical substances. One might imagine, for example, the use of such sensitized vesicles for selective release of drugs in targets of local hyperthermia) or low ambient pH). We have recently demonstrated that multilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) are rendered sensitive to pH in the presence of synthetic poly(carboxylic acid) s related to poly(acrylic acid). In biomedical applications, however, the <b>non-degradability</b> of these poly(acrylic acid) derivatives may be a serious limitation. In this paper, we show that a similar pH-dependent modification of DPPC vesicle structure may be effected by poly(P-malic acid) (PMLA 100), a degradable poly(carboxylic acid). PMLA 100 has been recently introduced to tailor-made macromolecular prodrugs and microemulsion-like systems for solubilization of hydrophobic drugs in aqueous media) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{marine and}} {{terrestrial}} ecosystems {{are exposed to}} many types of contaminants in which protrude the heavy metals by their high persistence, <b>non-degradability</b> and toxicity. Many organismos {{have been used to}} assess the presence of these elements. In this paper Pyura vittata was used to evaluate the effect of a sublethal dose of cadmium on the coelomic cell population. Sublethal dose was estimated at 96 h following the methodology proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States later sublethal dose was selected for conducting chronic tests for 21 days. We determined the incorporation of metal in the hepatopancreas muscle, tunic and gills. Samples were taken from the coelomic fraction at 3, 7. 15 and 21 days of exposure to assess the fraction of celomocitos. Coelomic fraction was obtained and performed total cell count, percentage of viable cells and percentage of each cell type. The median lethal dose for P. vittata exposed to cadmium was 0. 02 mg/l. The results determined that cadmium induces {{an increase in the number}} of celomocitos in short periods of exposure, three days, however during chronic exposure of 21 days, the organisms tend to standardize the cell number...|$|E
40|$|Zinc, {{lead and}} cadmium are {{metallic}} trace elements (MTEs) that are {{widespread in the}} environment and tend to accumulate in soils because of their low mobility and <b>non-degradability.</b> The purpose of this work is to evaluate the applicability of biosensors as tools able to provide data about the bioavailability of such MTEs in contaminated soils. Here, we tested the genetically-engineered strain Escherichia coli pPZntAgfp as a biosensor applicable to the detection of zinc, lead and cadmium by the biosynthesis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) accumulating inside the cells. Flow cytometry was used to investigate the fluorescence induced by the MTEs. A curvilinear response to zinc between 0 and 25 mg/L and another curvilinear response to cadmium between 0 and 1. 5 mg/L were highlighted in liquid media, while lead did not produce exploitable results. The response relating to a Zn 2 +/Cd 2 + ratio of 10 was further investigated. In these conditions, E. coli pPZntAgfp responded to cadmium only. Several contaminated soils with a Zn 2 +/Cd 2 + ratio of 10 were analyzed with the biosensor, and the metallic concentrations were also measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Our results showed that E. coli pPZntAgfp {{could be used as}} a monitoring tool for contaminated soils being processed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Non-viral gene {{delivery}} systems {{are one of}} the most potential alternatives to viral vectors because of their less immunogenicity, less toxicity and easy productivity in spite of their low capacity of gene transfection using DNA or silencing using siRNA compared to that of viral vectors. Among non-viral systems, the polycationic derivatives are the most popular gene carriers since they can effectively condense nucleic acids to transfer into the cells, especially the polyethylenimine (PEI) which has been used as a golden standard polymer owing to its high buffering ability for endosomal escape of gene to be expressed. However, PEI has severe problems for its toxicity due to the high positive charge density and <b>non-degradability</b> although the toxicity of PEI depends on its molecular weight (MW) and structure. Therefore, a considerable attention has been paid on synthesis of degradable PEI derivatives using low MW one because low MW PEI is much less toxic than high MW PEI. Other degradable polycationic gene carriers such as polyamidoamines (PAA) and cyclodextrin (CD) -based polycations are also in a significant interest because of their high transfection efficiency with low toxicity. This review in detail explains the recent developments on these three major degradable polycations as promising carriers for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) ...|$|E
40|$|Metals such as antimony, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, {{and zinc}} {{can be highly}} {{relevant}} pollutants in stormwater runoff from traffic areas because of their occurrence, toxicity, and <b>non-degradability.</b> Long-term measurements of their concentrations, the corresponding water volumes, the catchment areas, and the traffic volumes {{can be used to}} calculate specific emission loads and annual runoff loads that are necessary for mass balances. In the literature, the annual runoff loads are often specified by a distinct catchment area (e. g., g/ha). These loads were summarized and discussed in this paper for all seven metals and three types of traffic areas (highways, parking lots, and roads; 45 sites). For example, the calculated median annual runoff loads of all sites are 355 g/ha for copper, 110 g/ha for lead (only data of the 21 st century), and 1960 g/ha for zinc. In addition, historical trends, annual variations, and site-specific factors were evaluated for the runoff loads. For Germany, mass balances of traffic related emissions and annual heavy metal runoff loads from highways and total traffic areas were calculated. The influences on the mass fluxes of the heavy metal emissions and the runoff pollution were discussed. However, a statistical analysis of the annual traffic related metal fluxes, in particular for different traffic area categories and land uses, is currently not possible {{because of a lack of}} monitoring data...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of heavy metals {{in the environment}} especially in water supplies have caused many concerns because of their toxicity and <b>non-degradability.</b> Hexavalent Chromium (Cr) {{is one of the}} most toxic metals which is used in many industries, so it is essential to remove it from industrial wastewater. In this study, we made a comparison between different adsorption isotherms in the chromium (VI) removal process using carbon nano tubes from aqueous solutions. Methods: This experimental study used atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To determine the adsorption isotherms, a synthetic sample with defined concentration of Cr (VI) was prepared and different doses of adsorbent were added to it. The effect of initial Cr concentration, pH, adsorbent dose, and reaction time on removal of Cr was investigated. Temperature and mix rate were steady during a defined time. At the end, Cr (VI) concentration measured and adsorbents equality capacities were calculated via formulas and graphs. Data analysis were performed using descriptive statistics. Results: Adsorption capacities (qe) increased with increasing of initial Cr concentration, and reaction time decreased with increasing adsorbent dose and pH. Correlation coefficients for Langmuir, and Freundlich isotherms in oxidized Multi-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (MWCNTs) were 0. 93, 0. 874, and 0. 714 and in oxidized Single-Walled Carbon Nano Tubes (SWCNTs) were 0. 904, 0. 868, and 0. 711 respectively. Conclusion: Chromium ions adsorption in carbon nano tubes is accordant to Langmuir isotherm model, and MWCNTs have more cc than SWCNTs. Carbon nano tubes are effective adsorbents in removal of Cr (VI) from aqueous solutions. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals in aqueous solutions above certain limits represents {{a serious threat}} to the environment due to their toxicity and <b>non-degradability.</b> Thus, the removal of these metals from contaminated waters has received increasing attention during recent decades. This paper describes the removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions by emulsion liquid membranes, through a carrier-facilitated counter-transport mechanism, using benzoylacetone as the carrier and HCl as the stripping agent (protons as counter-ions). To optimize the Cu(II) removal process, the effect of the following operating parameters on the on the stability of the emulsion liquid membrane and on the Cu(II) removal efficiency was studied: feed pH, HCl concentration in the permeate phase, carrier and emulsifier concentration in the membrane phase, feed phase/emulsion phase and permeate phase/membrane phase volume ratios, emulsification time and speed in the primary emulsion preparation and stirring speed in the whole feed phase/emulsion phase system. Typical membrane transport parameters, such as flux and permeability, were also determined. Optimal Cu(II) removal conditions were: 5. 5 feed pH, 10 kg/m 3 benzoylacetone concentration in the membrane phase, 18. 250 kg/m 3 HCl concentration in the permeate phase, 50 kg/m 3 Span 80 concentration in the membrane phase, 200 rpm stirring rate, 5 min emulsification time, 2700 rpm emulsification rate, 2 : 1 feed:emulsion volume ratio and 1 : 1 permeate:membrane volume ratio. In these optimal conditions, 80. 3 % of Cu(II) was removed in 15 min with an apparent initial flux and permeability of 0. 3384 kg·m− 3 ·min− 1 and 0. 3208 min− 1, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Health monitoring, telemedicine, military, {{interactive}} entertainment and portable audio/video systems were most promising applications where WBANs can be used. However, designers of such systems face {{a number of}} challenging tasks, as they need to address often quite conflicting requirements for size, operating time, precision and reliability. Network security {{is very important in}} Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) since the vital human life might be jeopardized, unless managed properly. Approach: This article presented security architecture of a wireless body area network for ambulatory health status monitoring. A novel Intrusion Detection System (IDS) inspired by the biological immune system that use Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) was proposed to enhance the performance of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) to operate despite the presence of compromised (misbehaving) nodes. Results: The proposed IDS scheme had been implemented using network simulator Qualnet v 5. 2. The performances of IDS scheme had been analyzed using AODV, DSR and DSDV routing protocols for parameters such as average detection rate and false alarm rate. These negative selection detectors are capable of distinguishing well behaving nodes from compromised nodes with good degree of accuracy. The high false positives rate is also minimized. Conclusion/Recommendations: Wireless Body Area Networks are an enabling technology for mobile health care. The IDS can be implemented on todays devices as it only requires minimal and low-cost hardware changes. The authors strongly believe that adding sufficient security mechanisms to WBAN will study as a trigger in the acceptance of this technology for health care purposes. Simulation results indicate the <b>non-degradability</b> of network performance when these IDS is incorporated in the routing algorithm for security enhancements...|$|E
30|$|Water {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious environmental problems being faced by modern society (Marques et al. 2000; Ruiz-Manriquez et al. 1998). Heavy metals are known for their <b>non-degradability</b> and toxicity. It is, therefore, essential to control their discharge into water bodies and natural streams. Cadmium is highly toxic and non-essential metal which is released into the environment by various ways such as photographic development, ceramic, alkaline batteries, electroplating and metal plating works (Mohapatra and Anand 2007). Cadmium exposes human health to severe risks, due to its higher toxicity and can exert its toxic effects even at low concentrations. Occupational levels of cadmium exposure are a risk factor for chronic lung disease and testicular degradation (Benoff et al. 2000). Cadmium can also damage some specific structure of the functional units of the kidney (Satarug et al. 2000). Cadmium concentrations in unpolluted natural water are usually below 0.001  mg L− 1 (Friberg et al. 1986) therefore it is necessary to remove cadmium from industry effluent. For this reason, it is significant to focus the attention on the development of improved friendly methods and low-cost adsorbents for toxic heavy metal removal. Various techniques are in use for the removal of heavy metals from the industrial discharge but adsorption technology has been found to show high efficiency in detoxifying effluents (Kenduzler and Turker 2005). Adsorption utilizes the ability to accumulate heavy metals from wastewater by either metabolically medium or physiochemical pathway of uptake (Fourest and Roux 1992). Natural materials have excellent potential as inexpensive adsorbents. Many adsorbents have been used in past years for cadmium ion removal, however, the exploration and development of new adsorbents is endless. Biomaterials such as Cashew nut shell (Kumar et al. 2012 a, b), Borassus aethiopum seed shells (Adie et al. 2012), Modified corncob (Leyva-Ramos et al. 2012), Chitosan (Hydari et al. 2012), Agricultural wastes (Chao and Chang 2012), Seeds of Mast tree (Rao and Rehman 2012), Peganum harmala seeds (Zamani et al. 2013), Nylon- 6 (Prakash et al. 2012), Calcite sludge (Merrikhpour and Jalali 2012), Rice straw (Ding et al. 2012), Meranti wood (Rafatullah et al. 2012), Nauclea diderrichii seed (Omorogie et al. 2012), Modified Lawny grass (Chen et al. 2011), Acacia nilotica (Waseem et al. 2012), Walnut shell (Almasi et al. 2012), Grapefruit biomass (Bayo et al. 2012), Macrocystis pyrifera (Cazon et al. 2012), Algae (Sulaymon et al. 2012), Modified Cashew nut shell (Kumar et al. 2012 a, b), Rice bran (Chen et al. 2012), Sawdust (Bouziane et al. 2012), Orange peel (Masoudi et al. 2012) etc. have recently been utilized for the removal of Cd(II) from aqueous solution.|$|E
40|$|The {{currently}} used biomaterials for surgical implantation include stainless steel, titanium and its alloys. However, {{due to the}} <b>non-degradability</b> and the mismatch of the mechanical properties between these metallic implants and human bone, there maybe a long-term adverse effect of inflammation or stress shielding effect. This may lead to bone loss which brings with {{a higher risk of}} implant failure. To avoid this problem, implants made of biodegradable materials are the alternatives. Due to the poor mechanical properties of biodegradable polymer especially for load-bearing area, biodegradable metal is used instead. Magnesium is the potential candidate since it is degradable with mechanical properties similar to human bone whilst magnesium ion is an essential element to human bodies. With the advantages of using magnesium for implantations, it can be potentially used for fracture fixation implant and bone substitutes. However, its rapid degradation and release of hydrogen gas may inhibit its use. Hence, modification is required. In this project, plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition (PIII&D) using aluminium oxide as the plasma source was conducted on the magnesium alloys. The corrosion resistance properties of the plasma-treated magnesium alloy were found to display significant improvement in immersion test especially at early time points. The plasma-treated sample was compatible with osteoblasts. Cells attached and grew on the treated sample but not the untreated sample. The animal study showed consistent results with the cell study, and there was a significant increase in bone formation around the treated sample when compared to the untreated sample. The other potential application of magnesium is its usage as a bone substitute. Due to the limitations of autografts and allografts, synthetic bone substitutes are developed. The ideal bone substitutes should have similar properties to those found with autografts. However, no such bone substitutes presently exist; hence, a novel hybrid material is fabricated in this project through the addition of magnesium granules into a biodegradable polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). The immersion test showed that an apatite layer composed of magnesium, calcium, phosphate and hydroxide was formed on the hybrids but not on pure PCL, which suggested that the hybrids were osteoinductive and osteoconductive. The compression test showed that the mechanical properties were enhanced with the incorporation of magnesium granules into pure PCL and were still maintained after 2 months of immersion. Osteoblasts grew well on the PCL-Mg hybrids. The addition of smaller amounts of magnesium granules (0. 1 g PCL-Mg) resulted in higher ALP activity and up-regulation of different bone markers when compared to the pure PCL. Finally, the animal studies showed that more new bone formation was found around the 0. 1 g PCL-Mg hybrids especially at early time points, which suggested that the healing time could be shortened. In conclusion, fracture fixation implants and novel bone substitutes based on magnesium were developed in this project. The aluminium oxide coating was able to improve the corrosion resistance properties of magnesium alloy by suppressing the release of magnesium ions. The PCL-Mg hybrids were found to be biodegradable, biocompatible, osteoconductive, osteoinductive and mechanically matched to human bone properties. published_or_final_versionOrthopaedics and TraumatologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
