25|$|Once the United States {{asserted}} {{that it was}} a party to the case, Gray concluded, the courts had no jurisdiction and should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the case. Once the United States interposed itself between Kaufman and Strong and the plaintiff, the courts should not have ordered trial to proceed against them, either. Because the courts had no jurisdiction, the dissenters refused {{to address the issue of}} the validity of the title.|$|E
25|$|In the English-speaking world, {{many people}} who {{otherwise}} might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of the landing at Suvla Bay know something of its history through the song And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda written in 1972 by Eric Bogle and covered by numerous artists including the Clancy Brothers, Joan Baez and the Pogues. The song, while emotionally charged and vivid, is not an accurate historical account of the landing and subsequent events. Suvla also appears in the traditional Irish song The Foggy Dew commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising.|$|E

25|$|In general practice, {{after one}} confesses to one's spiritual guide, the parish priest (who {{may or may}} <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> the confession) covers {{the head of the}} person with his Epitrachelion (Stole) and reads the Prayer of Absolution, asking God to forgive the {{transgression}} of the individual (the specific prayer differs between Greek and Slavic use). It is not uncommon for a person to confess his sins to his spiritual guide on a regular basis but only seek out the priest to read the prayer before receiving Holy Communion.|$|E
500|$|Strawberry Panic! {{was one of}} {{the premier}} titles in the Light Novel and Strawberry (for yuri manga) {{production}} lines when it was licensed for English language distribution by Seven Seas Entertainment. In an interview with Seven Seas Entertainment founder Jason DeAngelis, he was posed the question, [...] "How do you attract a fan base for a novel before its release in English?" [...] His response was, [...] "We try to choose titles that are already well-known, like Pita-Ten, Shinigami no Ballad or Strawberry Panic!....In terms of attracting a fan base, though, in the end it's all about word-of-mouth. If the material is great, it will stand out on its own and find its audience. The small format that we're publishing these books in is frankly stunning, and it will definitely attract fans who may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of the property otherwise." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012–13 season, former Scottish footballer Pat Nevin said of Mkhitaryan, [...] "Eleven {{goals in}} eight league matches already is fantastic, {{but when you}} add {{that he is a}} midfielder, it is phenomenal. You may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> of him yet, even if all the scouts at the top European clubs have, but you soon will. He has pace, skill, a rocket of a shot and the ability to arrive in the box like Frank Lampard. This all singles him out as a player who must be watched or more {{importantly}} marked." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that. But," [...] Amos insisted, [...] "for the most part, for a Tori record, it’s pretty upbeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Simeon expounded a {{different}} view on the report in [...] that Eldad and Medad remained in the camp. When God ordered Moses in [...] to gather 70 of the elders of Israel, Eldad and Medad protested {{that they were not}} worthy of that dignity. In reward for their humility, God added yet more greatness to their greatness; so while the other elders' prophesying ceased, Eldad's and Medad's prophesying continued. Rabbi Simeon taught that Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die and Joshua would bring Israel into the Land of Israel. Abba Hanin taught in the name of Rabbi Eliezer that Eldad and Medad prophesied concerning the matter of the quails in [...] calling on the quail to arise. Rav Nahman read [...] to teach that they prophesied concerning Gog and Magog. The Gemara found support for Rabbi Simeon's assertion that while the other elders' prophesying ceased, Eldad's and Medad's prophesying continued in the use by [...] of the past tense, [...] "and they prophesied," [...] to describe the other elders, whereas [...] uses the present tense with regard to Eldad and Medad. The Gemara taught that if Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die, then that explains why Joshua in [...] requested Moses to forbid them. The Gemara reasoned that if Eldad and Medad prophesied about the quail or Gog and Magog, then Joshua asked Moses to forbid them because their behavior did not appear seemly, like a student who issues legal rulings in the presence of his teacher. The Gemara further reasoned that according to those who said that Eldad and Medad prophesied about the quail or Gog and Magog, Moses' response in [...] "Would that all the Lord's people were prophets," [...] made sense. But if Eldad and Medad prophesied that Moses would die, the Gemara wondered why Moses expressed pleasure with that in [...] The Gemara explained that Moses must <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> their entire prophecy. And the Gemara interpreted Joshua's request in [...] for Moses to [...] "forbid them" [...] to mean that Moses should give Eldad and Medad public burdens that would cause them to cease their prophesying.|$|E
