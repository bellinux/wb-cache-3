The first plates were shot in November 1948 and the last in April 1958. This survey was performed using 14inch2 (6 degree2) or blue-sensitive (Kodak 103a-O) and red-sensitive (Kodak 103a-E) photographic plates on the 48-inch Samuel Oschin Schmidt reflecting telescope. The survey covered the sky from a declination of +90 degrees (celestial north pole) to -27 degrees and all right ascensions and had a sensitivity to +22 magnitudes (about 1 million times fainter than the limit of human vision). A southern extension extending the sky coverage of the POSS to -33 degrees declination was shot in 1957 - 1958. The final POSS I consisted of 937 plate pairs.|$|E

As of 7 November 2011 a confirmed surtseyan type of eruption phase has started at the fissure. On December 4, 2011 the eruption was ongoing with vigorous phreatic bubbles emerging.|$|R

30|$|As a precautionary measure, the KEC method {{assesses the}} hazard of debris flows at a {{regional}} scale using {{a limited number}} of datasets. Only digital elevation models (DEMs) and expressway design files of the target area were used. The DEMs that were used in the assessment process were those provided by the <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Information <b>Institute</b> (NGII) of Korea, whereas the expressway design files were provided by the Korea Expressway Corporation. Through the application and use of only easily accessible datasets, the KEC hazard assessment method minimizes the need for time-consuming field investigation, and allows rapid hazard assessment of debris flows in large area (administrative sections or nationwide). Accordingly, the DEM for elevation and slope was used to evaluate the watershed information containing topographical route condition of rainfall-induced debris flow. Two indices—the susceptibility value and vulnerability value—were used to evaluate debris-flow hazard.|$|R

30|$|The GIS-based {{data for}} the {{detection}} of suitable CMG cultivation sites were processed as grid-shaped raster data. First, the geographic data required [elevation, also known as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aspect, and slope] were generated using numerical maps (1 : 25, 000; <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Information <b>Institute).</b> The 2010 5 th Forest Type Map (1 : 25, 000; Korea Forest Service) was used to derive data for forest type (tree species), which was used to distinguish bamboo forest and un-stocked forest land from the stocked forest land, and the Forest Soil Digital Map (1 : 25, 000; Korea Forest Service) was used to generate data on organic content, effective soil depth, soil humidity, and drainage. Finally, the raster data for identifying suitable CMG cultivation sites were reclassified after applying weights according to the conditions of each factor. The spatial resolution used in the study (10  m ×  10  m) was higher than that of a previous study (30  m ×  30  m) (Beon et al. 2013). This spatial resolution of 10  m ×  10  m refers to the area of each grid cell of the suitable cultivation site, which corresponds to an actual CMG cultivation area of 100  m 2.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{problem in}} mapping data is the frequent updating of large data sets. To solve this problem, the updating of small-scale data based on large-scale data is very effective. Various map generalization techniques, such as simplification, displacement, typification, elimination, and aggregation, {{must therefore be}} applied. In this study, we focused on the elimination and aggregation of the building layer, for which each building {{in a large scale}} was classified as “ 0 -eliminated,” “ 1 -retained,” or “ 2 -aggregated. ” Machine-learning classification algorithms were then used for classifying the buildings. The data of 1 : 1000 scale and 1 : 25, 000 scale digital maps obtained from the <b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Information <b>Institute</b> were used. We applied to these data various machine-learning classification algorithms, including naive Bayes (NB), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and support vector machine (SVM).

Although elimination is a direct part of the proposed process, generalization operations, such as simplification and aggregation of polygons, must still be performed for buildings classified as retained and aggregated.

The global solar energy reaching the earth's surface can be calculated easily according to the change of latitude, altitude, and sloped surface depending {{on the amount of}} the actual state of the atmosphere and clouds. The high-resolution solar-meteorological resource map with 1 km resolution was developed in 2011 based on GWNU (Gangneung-Wonju National University) solar radiation model with complex terrain. The very high resolution solar energy map can be calculated and analyzed in Seoul and Eunpyung with topological effect using by 1 km solar-meteorological resources map, respectively. Seoul DEM (Digital Elevation Model) have 10 m resolution from NGII (<b>National</b> <b>Geographic</b> Information <b>Institute)</b> and Eunpyeong new town DSM (Digital Surface Model) have 1 m spatial resolution from lidar observations. The solar energy have small differences according to the local mountainous terrain and residential area. The maximum bias have up to 20 % and 16 % in Seoul and Eunpyung new town, respectively. Small differences are that limited area with resolutions. As a result, the solar energy can calculate precisely using solar radiation model with topological effect by digital elevation data and its results can be used as the basis data for the photovoltaic and solar thermal generation...|$|R
