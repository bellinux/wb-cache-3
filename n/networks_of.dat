5|$|Every line stays {{unchanged}} by the curve-shortening flow. Lines are {{the only}} curves that are unaffected by the curve-shortening flow, although there exist more complex stable <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> curves, such as the hexagonal tiling of the plane.|$|E

5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, and the basic cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> family and friends who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E

5|$|Ganesha was {{particularly}} worshipped by traders and merchants, {{who went out}} of India for commercial ventures. From approximately the 10th century onwards, new <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> exchange developed including the formation of trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation.

5|$|In animal cells, two <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> {{intermediate}} filaments {{provide the}} nucleus with mechanical support: The nuclear lamina forms an organized meshwork {{on the internal}} face of the envelope, while less organized support is provided on the cytosolic face of the envelope.

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> the {{affected}} countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{hundreds of thousands of}} Poles concealed and aided hundreds of thousands of their Polish-Jewish neighbors.

5|$|Mari's {{discovery}} in 1933 provided an important {{insight into the}} geopolitical map of ancient Mesopotamia and Syria, due {{to the discovery of}} more than 25,000 tablets that contained important information about the administration of state during the second millennium BC and the nature of diplomatic relations between the political entities in the region.

In July, he cancelled Thunderbirds after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer. The three major US <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> the time– NBC, CBS and ABC– had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price. When NBC withdrew its offer, the other two immediately followed.|$|E
5|$|The Classic {{period is}} largely {{defined as the}} period during which the lowland Maya raised dated monuments using the Long Count calendar. This period marked the peak of {{large-scale}} construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions. The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities. The largest cities had populations numbering 50,000 to 120,000 and were linked to <b>networks</b> <b>of</b> subsidiary sites.|$|E
