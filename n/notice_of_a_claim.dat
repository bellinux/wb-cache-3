6000|$|But {{this did}} not satisfy Key; {{and in a few}} minutes he had mounted his horse and was {{speeding}} towards the Hollow, with a remorseful consciousness of having neglected his colleagues' interests. For himself, in the utter prepossession of his passion for Alice, he cared nothing. As he dashed down the slope to the Hollow, he thought only of the two momentous days that she had passed there, and the fate that had brought them so nearly together. There was nothing to recall its sylvan beauty in the hideous works that now possessed it, or the substantial dwelling-house that had taken the place of the old cabin. A few hurried questions to the foreman satisfied him of the integrity of the property. There had been some alarm in the shaft, but there was no subsidence of the [...] "seam," [...] nor any difficulty in the working. [...] "What I telegraphed you for, Mr. Key, was about something that has cropped up way back o' the earthquake. We were served here the other day with a legal <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> to the mine, on account of previous work done on the ledge by the last occupant." ...|$|E

[...] In March 2016, Sam Wallace, the Telegraph's chief football writer, contrasted the speed with which Chelsea resolved issues with players and managers with the 'disgrace' of its seven-month delay over the proper treatment of Carneiro. Wallace said that the next manager must resolve the problem.|$|E

40|$|The Act defines {{when the}} use of alcohol or a {{controlled}} substance will bar recovery by an injury employee. The Act gives the Workers 2 ̆ 7 Compensation Board greater ability to fine one who commits fraud, deletes the requirement that the Board send <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>claim</b> to the parties, amends the appellate review standard of the Board, and extends the time to schedule hearings. The Act gives injured employees the chance {{to return to work}} with penalizing the employee if the employee is unable to perform work tasks and allows an employer to suspend benefits to an injured employee if the employee refuses to attempt to return to work when the offered job is within the employee 2 ̆ 7 s capabilities. The Act gives employers more choice in deciding how they provide care for injured employees...|$|E
40|$|The article {{argues that}} the Second Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s recent {{decisions}} in Clinton v. City of New York and Monzon v. City of New York reduce the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> § 1983 <b>claim</b> against <b>a</b> municipality. The article highlights that the element of subjectivity required to determine the accrual period <b>of</b> <b>a</b> § 1983 <b>claim</b> restricts {{the utility of the}} claim because it adopts a cultural standard at odds with a racialized societal reality. 	The author discusses whether consideration of plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 testimony, statements of state and local police officials, and media coverage of municipal and state employee actions should factor into determining the accrual <b>of</b> <b>a</b> § 1983 <b>claim.</b> The article concludes suggesting that courts adhere to <b>a</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> § 1983 <b>claim</b> founded on facts connecting the municipal action to the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s injury, instead <b>of</b> basing <b>notice</b> on inferences regarding connections between individual municipal actors and the municipality...|$|R
5000|$|Considered {{whether a}} {{document}} {{prepared for a}} third party was privileged. In this instance the third party was an insurance company, but the judgment bears relevance for all third parties because it sheds light on how {{the concept of the}} “dominant purpose” <b>of</b> <b>a</b> document will be interpreted in such circumstances. In this instance, the document was <b>a</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> potential <b>claim</b> under <b>an</b> insurance contract, sent to the insurer, who would then send it on to their legal advisors to obtain an opinion on the merits of the potential claim. The Court of Appeal decided that the document attracted litigation privilege because {{at the time it was}} created, litigation had commenced and the document was created for the dominant purpose of obtaining advice in relation to that litigation. It was held that, when looking at the dominant purpose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> document, it was necessary for the Courts to take a wider view; the entire context of the creation of the document should be considered. In particular, the Court of Appeal held that it was important to look at the motivation of the party requiring the document to be created (which was that it would be used by the insurer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice) and not simply the intention of those composing or preparing the document (which was in order to fulfil its obligation to notify the insurer). The document prepared for the third party was therefore held to be privileged ...|$|R
