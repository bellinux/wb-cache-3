40|$|Although the {{influence}} of nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>addition</b> on grassland plant communities has been widely studied, it is still unclear whether observed patterns and underlying mechanisms are constant across biomes. In this systematic review, we use meta-analysis and metaregression to investigate {{the influence}} of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> (here referring mostly to fertilization) upon the biodiversity of temperate mountain grasslands (including montane, subalpine and alpine zones). Forty-two studies met our criteria of inclusion, resulting in 134 measures of effect size. The main general responses of mountain grasslands to <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> were increases in phytomass and reductions in plant species richness, as observed in lowland grasslands. More specifically, the analysis reveals that negative effects on species richness were exacerbated by dose (ha(- 1) year(- 1)) and duration of N application (years) in an additive manner. Thus, sustained application of low to moderate levels of N over time had effects similar to short-term application of high N doses. The climatic context also played an important role: the overall effects of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on plant species richness and diversity (Shannon index) were less pronounced in mountain grasslands experiencing cool rather than warm summers. Furthermore, the relative negative effect of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on species richness was more pronounced in managed communities and was strongly negatively related to N-induced increases in phytomass, that is the greater the phytomass response to <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> the greater the decline in richness. Altogether, this review not only establishes that plant biodiversity of mountain grasslands is negatively affected by <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> but also demonstrates that several local management and abiotic factors interact with <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> to drive plant community changes. This synthesis yields essential information for a more sustainable management of mountain grasslands, emphasizing the importance of preserving and restoring grasslands with both low agricultural N application and limited exposure to N atmospheric deposition...|$|E

40|$|Nitrogen {{deposition}} {{rates in}} southern California {{are the highest}} in North America and have had substantial effects on ecosystem functioning. We document changes in the belowground C cycle near ponderosa pine trees experiencing experimental nitrogen (<b>N)</b> <b>addition</b> (50 and 150 kg N ha− 1  a− 1  as slow release urea since 1997) at two end-member sites along a pollution gradient in the San Bernardino Mountains, California. Despite considerable differences in N deposition between the two sites, we observed parallel changes in microbial substrate use and soil enzyme activity with <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> Δ 14 C measurements indicate that {{the mean age of}} C respired by the Oa horizon declined 10 – 15 years with <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> at both sites. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> caused an increase in cellulolytic enzyme activity at the polluted site and a decrease in ligninolytic enzyme activity at the unpolluted site. Given the likely differences in lignin and cellulose ages, this could explain the difference in the age of microbial respiration with <b>N</b> <b>addition.</b> Measurements of fractionated soil organic matter did not show the same magnitude of changes in response to <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> as were observed for respired C. This lesser response was likely because the soils are mostly composed of C having turnover times of decades to centuries, and 9 years of N amendment were not enough to affect this material. Consequently, Δ 14 C of respired CO 2  provided a more sensitive indicator of the effects of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> than other methods. Results suggest that enhanced N deposition alone may not result in increased soil C storage in xeric ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced {{deposition}} of atmospheric nitrogen (N) resulting from anthropogenic activities has negative impacts on plant diversity in ecosystems. Several mechanisms {{have been proposed}} to explain the species loss. Ion toxicity due to N deposition-induced soil acidification has been suggested {{to be responsible for}} species loss in acidic grasslands, while few studies have evaluated the role of soil-mediated homeostasis of ions in species loss under elevated N deposition in grasslands with neutral or alkaline soils. To determine whether soil-mediated processes are involved in changes in biodiversity induced by N deposition, the effects of 9 -year <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on soil properties, aboveground biomass (AGB) and species richness were investigated in an Inner Mongolia steppe. Low to moderate <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rate (2, 4, 8 g N m − 2 yr − 1) significantly enhanced AGB of graminoids, while high <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rate (≥ 16 g N m − 2 yr − 1) reduced AGB of forbs, leading to an overall increase in AGB of the community under low to moderate <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> rates. Forb richness was significantly reduced by <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> at rates greater than 8 g N m − 2 yr − 1, while no effect of <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> on graminoid richness was observed, resulting in decline in total species richness. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> reduced soil pH, depleted base cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K +) and mobilized Mn 2 +, Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + and Al 3 + ions in soils. Soil inorganic-N concentration was negatively correlated with forb richness and biomass, explaining 23. 59...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Plant {{growth and}} {{ecosystem}} processes in semi-arid and arid areas are typically limited by nutrient and water availability. Alleviation of these resource stresses by future increases in reactive nitrogen and precipitation may affect internal plant nutrient cycling. The effect of increased nitrogen and water supply on foliar N and P concentrations, resorption efficiency and proficiency in four dominant species was studied in semi-arid grassland in northern China. Four treatments (Control, <b>N</b> <b>addition,</b> water addition and N plus water additions) were replicated in five 4 × 4 m plots per treatment. We found significant interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and resorption variables. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> and water addition increased N concentration {{but had no}} effect on P concentration in green leaves. Both <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> and water addition reduced plant N resorption proficiency. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> increased and water addition {{had no effect on}} P resorption proficiency. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> and water addition decreased N resorption efficiency while increasing P resorption efficiency, but responses to N and water addition differed among species. <b>N</b> <b>addition</b> significantly interacted with water addition to affect N resorption efficiency and proficiency but did not affect that of P. These results suggest that species identity, N availability and water availability interact to affect plant nutrient resorption processes. Our analyses provide a better understanding of plant internal nutrient retranslocation in response to poten-tial changes in nitrogen and water availability...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} series of {{experiments}} investigating some aspects of seasonal C and nutrient cycling and microbial community responses in an alpine heathland under three environmental pressures: N deposition represented by <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> at four levels (0, 10, 20, 50 kg N ha - 1 yr - 1), climate change simulated by open top chambers (OTCs) and accidental burning (one low intensity fire event that occurred in autumn 1999). The Culardoch experimental site was used, which is located on an alpine heathland in the Eastern Cairngorms mountains, Scotland. The responses studied were related to litter decomposition dynamics, soil processes and the soil microbial community. Mass loss and nutrient status during decomposition of litter from the plots (“native”) and collected outside the plots (“standard”) were studied. Litter decomposition was not affected significantly by the treatments. Despite the decrease in initial C:N ratio by <b>N</b> <b>additions,</b> this treatment affected only phosphomonoesterase activity and a trend for increasing glucosidase and xylosidase activity with increasing <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> was seen. OTC impacts were limited to effects on P cycling in “native” decomposing litter in the later stages of decomposition and more P was accumulated in litter from the plots with the OTCs. Burning affected N cycling in “native” decomposing litter (more N was accumulated in litter incubated in the burnt plots) and mass loss, C, N and P content in “standard” litter. Increased cellulolytic activity was observed in litter from the burnt plots. Those changes were attributed to shifts in the bacterial and fungal communities due to burning and warming treatments, while <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> had only a minor effect on microbial community structure. Decomposition phase had the greatest effect on microbial community structure suggesting that a succession of communities occurred during decomposition. One {{of the most important}} findings was the lack of interactive effects among the three main treatments, indicating that they act independently on particular components of the ecosystem.

40|$|Nonmethane {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) are reactive, low molecular weight gases that can have significant effects on soil and atmospheric processes. Research into biogenic VOC sources has primarily focused on plant emis-sions, with few studies on VOC emissions from decomposing plant litter, another potentially important source. Like-wise, {{although there have been}} numerous studies examining how anthropogenic increases in nitrogen (N) availability can influence litter decomposition rates, {{we do not know how}} VOC emissions may be affected. In this study, we measured the relative contribution of VOCs to the total carbon (C) emitted from decomposing litter and how N amendments affected VOC emissions. We incubated decomposing litter from 12 plant species over 125 days, measuring both CO 2 and VOC emissions throughout the incubation. We found that VOCs represented a large portion of C emissions from a number of the litter types with C emissions as VOCs ranging from 0 % to 88 % of C emissions as CO 2. Methanol was the dominant VOC emitted, accounting for 28 – 99 % of total VOC emissions over the incubation period. <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> increased CO 2 production in 7 of the 12 litter types by 5 – 180 %. In contrast, <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> decreased VOC emissions in 8 of the 12 litter types, reducing net VOC emissions to near zero. The decrease in VOC emissions was occasionally large enough to account for the increased CO 2 emissions on a per unit C basis, suggesting that <b>N</b> <b>additions</b> may not necessarily accelerate C loss from decomposing litter but rather just switch the form of C emitted...|$|R
