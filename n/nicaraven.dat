40|$|<b>Nicaraven,</b> a {{hydroxyl}} radical-specific scavenger {{has been}} demonstrated to attenuate radiation injury in hematopoietic stem cells with 5 Gy γ-ray exposures. We explored the effect and related mechanisms of <b>nicaraven</b> for protecting radiation injury induced by sequential exposures to a relatively lower dose γ-ray. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were given <b>nicaraven</b> or placebo within 30 min before exposure to 50 mGy γ-ray daily for 30 days in sequences (cumulative dose of 1. 5 Gy). Mice were victimized 24 h after the last radiation exposure, and the number, function and oxidative stress of hematopoietic stem cells were quantitatively estimated. We also compared the gene expression in these purified stem cells from mice received <b>nicaraven</b> and placebo treatment. <b>Nicaraven</b> {{increased the number of}} c-kit+ stem/progenitor cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood, with a recovery rate around 60 - 90 % of age-matched non-irradiated healthy mice. The potency of colony forming from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as indicator of function was completely protected with <b>nicaraven</b> treatment. Furthermore, <b>nicaraven</b> treatment changed the expression of many genes associated to DNA repair, inflammatory response, and immunomodulation in c-kit+ stem/progenitor cells. <b>Nicaraven</b> effectively protected against damages of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells induced by sequential exposures to a relatively low dose radiation, via complex mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nicaraven,</b> a {{chemically}} synthesized hydroxyl radical-specific scavenger, {{has been}} demonstrated to protect against ischemia-reperfusion injury in various organs. We investigated whether <b>nicaraven</b> can attenuate radiation-induced injury in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which is the conmen complication of radiotherapy {{and one of the}} major causes of death in sub-acute phase after accidental exposure to high dose radiation. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were exposed to 1 Gy c-ray radiation daily for 5 days in succession (a total of 5 Gy), and given <b>nicaraven</b> or a placebo after each exposure. The mice were sacrificed 2 days after the last radiation treatment, and the protective effects and relevant mechanisms of <b>nicaraven</b> in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with radiation-induced damage were investigated by ex vivo examination. We found that post-radiation administration of <b>nicaraven</b> significantly increased the number, improved the colony-forming capacity, and decreased the DNA damage of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. The urinary levels of 8 -oxo- 29 -deoxyguanosine, a marker of DNA oxidation, were significantly lower in mice that were given <b>nicaraven</b> compared with those that received a placebo treatment, although the levels of intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in the bone marrow cells did not differ significantly between the two groups. Interestingly, compared with the placebo treatment, the administration of <b>nicaraven</b> significantly decreased the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and TNF-a in the plasma of mice. Our data suggest that <b>nicaraven</b> effectively diminished the effects of radiation-induced injury in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{radiation}} protection from <b>Nicaraven</b> after whole-body irradiation {{was investigated in}} C 3 H mice. <b>Nicaraven</b> is a free radical scavenging agent, which was shown to improve brain edema and blood flow. <b>Nicaraven</b> was injected intraperitoneally in mice before and/or after whole-body irradiation with 640 cGy or 740 cGy using Toshiba Lineac LMR- 4 C (4 MV, 6. 45 × 10 (- 2) C/㎏/min). The 30 day survival ratio was improved significantly by <b>Nicaraven</b> (P≦ 0. 02). Endogenous spleen colony formation was investigated after 640 cGy. The agent was injected before (pre), after (post) or before and after irradiation (pre-post), and compared with the untreated group (control). Nine days after irradiation, the mean colony formation was 2. 00 (pre), 3. 09 (post), 4. 31 (pre-post) and 1. 47 (control). The differences between pre and post (p≦ 0. 01), between pre-post and control (p≦ 0. 01) and between post and control (p≦ 0. 05) were significant. <b>Nicaraven</b> induced recovery of leukocyte and lymphocyte counts after irradiation, but not that of erythrocytes. The effect of the agent on mice liver mitochondrial lipid peroxidation was also investigated. The lag time was not shortened, but reduction of the TBA value was observed. <b>Nicaraven</b> was not only recognized as a radioprotector, but its ability to promote recovery from {{the damage caused by}} irradiation was also suggested...|$|E
