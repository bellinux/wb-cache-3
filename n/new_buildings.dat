5|$|Carre's Grammar School is a {{selective}} secondary school for boys in Sleaford, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. Founded on 1 September 1604 by an indenture of Robert Carre, {{the school was}} funded by rents from farmland and run {{by a group of}} trustees. The indenture restricted the endowment to £20 without accounting for inflation, causing the school to decline during the 18th century and effectively close in 1816. Revived by a decree from the Court of Chancery in 1830, <b>new</b> <b>buildings</b> were constructed at its present site and the school re-opened in 1835. Faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools and declining rolls, Carre's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its Classical curriculum by affiliating with Kesteven County Council in 1895. Following the Education Act 1944, school fees were abolished and Carre's became Voluntary Aided. <b>New</b> <b>buildings</b> were completed in 1966 to house the rising number of students.

Foundation status followed and the school became an Academy in 2011; a multi-Academy trust with Kesteven and Sleaford High School was formed in 2015.|$|E
