5|$|Entertainment Weekly, the Los Angeles Times, and The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> <b>Review</b> {{considered}} Middlesex one of {{the best}} books of 2002, and some scholars believed the novel should be considered for the title of Great American Novel.

Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{historian}} Omer Bartov, {{writing for}} The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> <b>Review,</b> judged The Holocaust Industry to be marred {{by the same}} errors he denounces in those who exploit the Holocaust for profit or politics:It is filled with {{precisely the kind of}} shrill hyperbole that Finkelstein rightly deplores in much of the current media hype over the Holocaust; it is brimming with the same indifference to historical facts, inner contradictions, strident politics and dubious contextualizations; and it oozes with the same smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority... Like any conspiracy theory, it contains several grains of truth; and like any such theory, it is both irrational and insidious.|$|E

25|$|The American {{historian}} John Lukacs {{in a very}} unfavourable {{book review}} in the edition of 19 August 1977 of National Review called Hitler's War a worthless book while Walter Laqueur when reviewing Hitler's War in The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>Book</b> <b>Review</b> of 3 April 1977 accused Irving of selective use of the historical record in Hitler's favour. Laqueur argued that Hitler's War read more like a legal brief written by a defence lawyer who was attempting to exonerate Hitler before the judgement of history, than a historical work.|$|E
