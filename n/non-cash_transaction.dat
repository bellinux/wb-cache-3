The {{check is}} a popular form for the {{non-cash}} payment and {{accounts for more than}} 50 % of the <b>non-cash</b> <b>transactions.</b> Magnetic ink character recognition system can recognize the check magnetic code automatically and get the information of the bank and account. In magnetic ink character recognition system, the recognizing algorithm is mostly based on correlation coefficient. The computational cost of this algorithm is very high. This paper has proposed a new algorithm based on the peak-valley code and peak-valley distance after analyzing the characteristics of magnetic code signals in E- 13 B standards to simplify the calculations and system design. Firstly, the magnetic code signal is normalized and separated into magnetic character signals by the thresholds of peak and valley. Secondly, the features of the peak-valley code and peak-valley distance of each magnetic character signal are extracted, then the recognition based on peak-valley code and the nearest neighbor recognition algorithm based on peak-valley distance are utilized to recognize the magnetic code. The recognition results and statistical parameters from a large number of experiments show that the new method has high recognition rate, good robustness and low computational cost...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{non-cash}} payment schemes {{is particularly}} widespread in France where {{the number of}} <b>non-cash</b> <b>transactions</b> is in fact well above the European average. Though they have different features corresponding to users’ varying needs (payments may be face-to-face, remote or recurring, for instance), non-cash payment schemes generally consist of an instrument that generates a payment order combined with the technical and organisational arrangements that enable this order to be processed. Putting these arrangements in place requires close co-operation between all participants of the payment «network», i. e., naturally, credit institutions that hold accounts for debtors and beneficiaries, and also their technical service providers. The Everyday Security Act of 15 November 2001 entrusts the Banque de France with a specific task with regard to overseeing the security of non-cash means of payment.

Recent research in rural Kenya has shown that social capital is endogenous. Further, the research has found three valid instruments, ts, including {{the religion of the}} household head, lobbying of leaders variable, and proportion of people voting for correcting the endogeneity problem. Using a model of the probability of a rural household being poor, the paper focuses on the issue whether ownership of the aggregate social capital asset helps households to reduce their level of poverty. The paper uses primary data collected from a sample of 340 households from Nyeri district. Instrumental variable and control function approach models are used ed to correct for the endogeneity of aggregate social capital and the heterogeneity bias over poverty status. The results indicate that aggregate social capital affects poverty status positively and significantly. This finding is consistent with recent emp empirical irical results suggesting that there is evidence in the study area that social capital enables households to meet their basic needs through non <b>non-cash</b> cash <b>transactions,</b> thus reducing their probability of being poor. The <b>non-cash</b> cash <b>transactions</b> are presumed to reduce ce transactions demand for cash and to facilitate household savings. Further, the results show that the estimate of the instrumented aggregate social capital from the IV model is higher than the corresponding estimate from the CFA model suggesting the need of controlling for the endogeneity of social capital.

40|$|Book {{entries are}} {{vehicles}} used in accounting to accommodate <b>non-cash</b> <b>transactions,</b> timing differences and provisions. The use of book entries {{is a normal}} activity in accounting and may {{have their origin in}} accrual accounting. The management of a company may apply creative accounting techniques in the form of earnings management, in particular, adopting the practices of income smoothing and taking the so-called ‘big bath’. These practices may result in the financial manager or accountant misusing book entries. This could then lead to information of a different integrity to that which would have resulted had these creative accounting practices not been performed in the company. The question addressed in this dissertation and for which an answer is sought, is whether there is any notable difference in the integrity issues of information supplied through the accounting process and created by real transactions (real events) as opposed to information created by book entries (artificial events). The hypothesis underlying this dissertation is: The integrity of information created by book entries is based on subjective opinions because it is based on future events therefore it {{is not the same as}} integrity of information created by real transactions that is based on historical events. The new science is concerned with new guidelines, amongst other things, regarding reality, observation, objectivity, predictions and relationships among events. These new guidelines could be seen as explaining certain aspects which is relevant to the field of accounting. The attributes of a book entry are not based on reality, but are based on subjective predictions of future transactions etc. Another similarity is that a book entry is often not objective but is based on subjective observation. Notable differences were observed in the integrity of the information emerging from a real, historical event and a future event. These differences were established through the application of two research methods, namely, the use of a questionnaire and the analysis of the financial statements of 30 companies listed on The JSE Securities Exchange South Africa (JSE). The influence of book entries on certain ratios was considered, and the ratios influenced by two major book entries, namely, depreciation provision and deferred taxation, differ substantially in interpretation when the two book entries are reclassified. The results of the questionnaire also indicate that a large proportion of the financial managers in practice believe that book entries substantially influence the integrity of information.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Payment {{systems can}} be defined as a funds {{transfer}} system processing third party payments, supervised by a central bank or appropriate Regulatory Authority. (S. W. I. F. T., 1997). Therefore the importance of a well managed system, through regulatory methods, as well as self-regulation by the industry, cannot be over emphasized. According to Humphrey, (1996 : 923), the composition of <b>non-cash</b> <b>transactions</b> consists of the following five payment instruments. The paper-based transactions are composed of cheques and paperbased giros payments. The electronic transactions consist of electronic giro, debit card (POS), and credit card payments. According to Vives, (1998 : 168) there are normally two goals when a country wants to change its payment system, either it wants to increase efficiency, or it wants to reduce risk. If there is a conflict between risk and efficiency, the less risky solution must prevail. Credit risk and systemic risk poses the greatest challenges to payment systems. Credit risk exists when credit was granted to a participating member, which cannot fulfil its debt at the stage of payment need to be made. Systematic risks encompass situations in which the credit or liquidity problems for one or more market participants create substantial credit or liquidity problems for participants elsewhere in the financial system. (Emmons, 1997 : 11). In order to create international standards in addressing the risk issues involved the Bank of International Settlements was established. The Bank's predominant tasks are to promote the co-operation of central banks and to provide additional facilities for international financial operations, and to create and maintain stability of international monetary and financial systems. The Bank of International Settlements published the Lamfallussy report. From the findings of this report a series of policy recommendations regarding netting schemes. The Basle Committee was established by the Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten countries as a result of serious failures and disturbances in the international currency and banking markets, with the main objective to improve the collaboration between bank supervisors world wide. The objective is met by using three different methods, namely. Exchange information on national supervisory arrangements, improving the effectiveness of techniques for supervising, and the setting of minimum supervisory guidelines and recommendations and recommended statements of best practices, expecting authorities to take steps to implement in their respective countries. To enable secure international payments the Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) was created, with the mission to provide technology-based communication services across all financial markets through member banks and their market infrastructures so that they can meet their own and their end-customers' needs. There is a growing awareness among central banks of the need to ensure the integrity, the security and the stability of their country's payment system. The central bank's main function was to regulate the country's currency circulation, to facilitate' payment transactions and to pursue a credit and monetary policy serving the interest of the country as a whole. Because of their importance for the smooth operation of commerce of financial markets, central banks often own and/or operate large value payment networks themselves rather than leave this function solely to commercial banks. (Sato et a/., 1995 : 37). Commercial banks, or their agents, perform {{the vast majority of the}} clearing and processing of payment in developed countries, as well as providing the payment facilities to clients. The United States central bank is the main exception to this division of responsibility as it provides settlement service as well as check processing and over one-half of all Automatic Clearing Houses and wire processing services. (Sato et a/., 1995 : 32). The re-entry of South Africa in the global trade in the early 1990 s created new opportunities and challenges for the country. With the existing established payment system, South Africa provides a gateway to the Southern African countries. There are a number of fundamental changes in the financial markets, which have an impact on payment and settlement systems. The first important factor is the high speed of technological progress. Secondly, the fundamental change in financial markets concerns the internationalisation of financial flows. From a central bank point of view, these developments, although in principle to be welcomed because of their contribution to the effect of allocation of financial resources, require close attention, as the interrelationships between worldwide financial markets could also give rise to a propagation of risks. (Koning, 1998 : 19). South Africa's payments system, as a well-functioning system, compares favourably with the best in the world; this is an essential requirement for participation in the international finance and trading. The challenge the South African banks face is the social responsibility to uplift the community on the one side, and compliance with the international rules and legislation on the other. In accordance to the minimum requirements set by the Lamfallussy report. The Reserve Bank of South Africa enforced strong policies via the Banking Council of South Africa, as well as the different committees and associations dedicated to certain payment systems. The South African Reserve Bank intent to provide an Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill in order to promote and regulate electronic communication and transactions. The Banking Council set certain criteria that will be implemented from the first of January 2002 on the item limits applicable to the certain electronic methods of payment. Councils and associations in the banking sector are established, self-regulatory as well as government controlled, to enforce rules and regulations to reduce the risk involved in the industry and comply with international requirements. A strong legal framework and the enforcement of certain risk prevention methods, for instance the enforcement of item limits and the change in the law on the crossing of cheques prove the commitment to participate internationally. The strong movement to same day settlement, (especially in high value payments via the SAMOS system), show that the payment industry in South Africa is on an ongoing process of implementing new procedures to comply with the international standards. Electronic money {{can be defined as}} stored value or prepaid products in which a record of funds or value available to the consumer is stored on a device in the consumer's possession. (Bank of International Settlements, 2001 : 1). Consumers benefit from the ability to use payment methods that are inexpensive, convenient, and accessible. (Bank of International Settlements, 1997 : 6). The participation in the payment processes by non-financial entities, coupled with the design and widespread use of unknown digital form of monetary value poses serious threats to the central bank's ability to control monetary policy and safeguard financial stability. Card based e-money schemes have been combined with functionality's such as access control, holder identification or local transportation ticketing. Network-based e-money schemes are operational or under trail in a limited number of countries. The existing payment system legislation applies to networkbased schemes. The South African Reserve Bank needs to constantly monitor and analyse the existing and new different methods of payment systems in order to create a low risk, stable, safe and a trade supportive environment for the improvement of its own economy, as well as for the Southern African region. Specific attention needs to be given to the high-value payment systems in order to reduce systemic risk. The prevalent factor is the real time settlement of the SAM OS (South African Multi Option Settlement) system. Finally, regulators need to coordinate actions, through the international and local platforms provides, to implant financial discipline, manage risk and support cross-border and regional trade. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Betaalstelsels kan gedefinieer word as 'n opdragte- of fondsoorplasingstelsel vir die maak van betalings aan 'n derde party, wat gereguleer word deur 'n sentrale bank of regering. (SWIFT, 1997). Die belangrikheid van 'n goedgereguleerde stelsel, deur middel van wetgewing, sowel as selfregulering deur die industrie, kan nie oorbeklemtoon word nie. Humphry (1996 : 923) beskryf die samestelling van nie-kontant betaalstelsels as die volgende vyf instrumente. Die papier gebaseerde transaksie wat uit tjeks, papier-gebaseerde "giro' bestaan. Elektroniese transaksies bestaan uit die elektroniese "giro", debiet- en kredietkaarte. Volgens Vives (1998 : 168) is daar normaalweg twee doelwitte wanneer verandering aan 'n betaalstelsels aangebring word, naamlik die verbetering in doeltreffendheid, of die vermindering van risiko, waar die laer risiko gewoonlik die voorkeur sal kry. Kredietrisiko en sistemiese risiko hou die grootste uitdagings vir betaalstelsels in. Kredietrisiko ontstaan waar krediet aan 'n deelnemende lid van 'n stelsel verleen word en die ander party nie kan presteer op die tydstip van betaling nie.
