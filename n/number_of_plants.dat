5|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> are {{poisonous}} to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both Linaria vulgaris and Linaria dalmatica), {{and wild}} celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous, {{as well as}} ivy and oak tree leaves.|$|E
5|$|Rhododendrons and hemlocks {{typically}} grow {{close to}} Catawissa Creek, while hardwood trees grow higher up in Catawissa Creek's river valley. In the late 1800s, a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> resembling fucoids were discovered along Catawissa Creek {{near the border}} of Main and Catawissa Townships.|$|E
5|$|There are 27 known populations {{within this}} region, but only nine of these populations contain more than 10 {{individual}} plants, and only five populations {{have more than}} 100. Ten populations are now presumed extinct. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> is estimated at around 1000.|$|E

5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates from a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Reports on {{the number}} of populations and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants. In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; surprisingly, only fifty plants could be found in the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports of the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have ranged from 340 to 580.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Feed-in tariffs in the United Kingdom in 2010 stimulated {{the first wave}} of utility-scale projects, with c. 20 plants being completed before tariffs were reduced on 1 August 2011 following the 'Fast Track Review'. A second wave of installations was undertaken under the UK's Renewables Obligation, with the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> connected by the end of March 2013 reaching 86. This is reported to have made the UK Europe's best market {{in the first quarter of}} 2013.|$|E

5|$|Plants {{provide the}} greater part of the food for people and their {{domestic}} animals: much of human culture and civilisation came into being through agriculture. While a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have been used for food, a small number of staple crops including wheat, rice, and maize provide most of the food in the world today. In turn, animals provide much of the meat eaten by the human population, whether farmed or hunted, and until the arrival of mechanised transport, terrestrial mammals provided {{a large part of the}} power used for work and transport. A variety of living things serve as models in biological research, such as in genetics, and in drug testing. Until the 19th century, plants yielded most of the medicinal drugs in common use, as described in the 1st century by Dioscorides. Plants are the source of many psychoactive drugs, some such as coca known to have been used for thousands of years. Yeast, a fungus, has been used to ferment cereals such as wheat and barley to make bread and beer; other fungi such as Psilocybe and fly agaric mushrooms have been gathered as psychoactive drugs.|$|E

25|$|Waldridge Fell is a Site of Special Scientific Interest located {{immediately}} south-west of Chester-le-Street in {{the northern}} part of County Durham, England.

25|$|Atropine occurs {{naturally}} in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> of the nightshade family including deadly nightshade, Jimson weed, and mandrake. It was first isolated in 1833. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. A one-milligram vial costs between US$0.06 and US$0.44, wholesale, in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Cyanides are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants.</b> Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules {{in the form of}} cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to use {{preparations}} of powerful, highly toxic herbicides including 2,4-D, amitrole and bromacil to control the outbreak. Officers using knapsack sprayers were deployed to deal with smaller infestations, while large areas of cannabis were sprayed from small crop dusting aircraft. By 1971, only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> were found by the regular summer patrols of field officers, that could easily be pulled by hand. The eradication of the infestation was finally declared successful in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The first {{commercial}} tower power plant was PS10 in Spain with {{a capacity of}} 11MW, completed in 2007. Since then a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have been proposed, several have been built {{on a number of}} countries (Spain, Germany, U.S., Turkey, China, India) but several proposed plants were cancelled as photovoltaic solar prices plummeted. A solar power tower is expected to come online in South Africa in 2014. Ivanpah Solar Power Facility in California generates 392 MW of electricity from three towers, making it the largest solar power tower plant when it came online in late 2013.|$|E
25|$|John Gerard, also spelt John Gerarde, (c. 1545–1612) was a {{botanist}} and herbalist. He {{maintained a}} large herbal garden in London. His chief notability is {{as the author}} of a large (1,484 pages) illustrated Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes. First published in 1597, it was the most widely circulated botany book in English in the 17th century. Except for the additions of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> from his own garden and from North America, Gerard's Herbal is largely an unacknowledged English translation of Rembert Dodoens's herbal originally published in 1554, itself also highly popular (in Dutch, Latin, French and other English translations).|$|E
