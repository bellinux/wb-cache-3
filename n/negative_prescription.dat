I was in any case conscious that I could not long hold a situation which the caprice, rather than the judgment, of the public, had bestowed upon me, and preferred being deprived of my precedence by some more worthy rival, to sinking into contempt for my indolence, and losing my reputation by what Scottish lawyers call the <b>negative</b> <b>prescription.</b> Accordingly, those who choose to look at the Introduction to Rokeby, will be able to trace the steps by which I declined as a poet to figure as a novelist; as the ballad says, Queen Eleanor sunk at Charing Cross to rise again at Queenhithe.|$|E
60|$|Dorothea {{herself had}} no dreams of being praised above other women, {{feeling that there}} was always {{something}} better which she might have done, if she had only been better and known better. Still, she never repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses which could have marred it. No life would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion, and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity which she had not the doubtful pains of discovering and marking out for herself. Will became an ardent public man, working well in those times when reforms were begun with a young hopefulness of immediate good which has been much checked in our days, and getting at last returned to Parliament by a constituency who paid his expenses. Dorothea could have liked nothing better, since wrongs existed, than that her husband should be in the thick of a struggle against them, and that she should give him wifely help. Many who knew her, thought it a pity that so substantive and rare a creature should have been absorbed into the life of another, and be only known in a certain circle as a wife and mother. But no one stated exactly what else that was in her power she ought rather to have done--not even Sir James Chettam, who went no further than the <b>negative</b> <b>prescription</b> that she ought not to have married Will Ladislaw.|$|E

5000|$|Alliance {{theory is}} based on the incest taboo: {{according}} to it, only this universal prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards exogamy. Thus, inside a given society, certain categories of kin are forbidden to inter-marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside of their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. This theory echoes with Freud's Totem and Taboo (1913). But the incest taboo of alliance theory, in which one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the <b>negative</b> <b>prescriptions</b> of the prohibition have positive counterparts. The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds affinity. This global phenomenon {{takes the form of a}} [...] "circulation of women" [...] which links together the various social groups in one whole: society.|$|R
40|$|The Arab codes {{give the}} law of {{obligations}} the prominent place it occupies in the civil law system. These codes recognize (liberative or <b>negative)</b> <b>prescription</b> {{as a mode of}} barring claims as a result of inaction for a period of time. In addition, the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts of 2004 (PICC 2004) provides that prescription extinguishes an action to enforce a claim of right. The {{purpose of this article is}} to conduct a comparative exercise by analyzing similarities and differences between Arab civil codes and the PICC 2004. Arab civil codes and the PICC 2004 wrestle with the same concept, prescription, in more or less the same terms. However, the value of studying the PICC 2004 along with Arab civil codes is even greater because they do differ. The article concludes by arguing that certain prescription provisions in Arab civil codes are unclear and antiquated. Arab countries can reconcile their civil codes with more recent international legal instruments, such as the PICC 2004, without jeopardizing their own traditions and values...|$|E

2500|$|The {{alliance}} theory (or {{general theory}} of exchanges) is the name given to the structural method of studying kinship relations. It finds its origins in Claude Lévi-Strauss's Elementary Structures of Kinship (1949). According to Levi-Strauss, the universal prohibition of incest pushes human groups towards exogamy where certain categories of kin are forbidden to marry. The incest taboo is thus a negative prescription; without it, nothing would push men to go searching for women outside of their inner kinship circle, or vice versa. In a process akin to the division of labour which makes exchange necessary, one's daughter or sister is offered to someone outside a family circle, and starts a circle of exchange of women: in return, the giver is entitled to a woman from the other's intimate kinship group. Thus the <b>negative</b> <b>prescriptions</b> of the prohibition have positive counterparts. The idea of the alliance theory is thus of a reciprocal or a generalized exchange which founds affinity, just as economic exchange due to the division of labour resulted in organic solidarity. This global phenomena {{takes the form of}} a [...] "circulation of women" [...] which links together the various social groups in one whole: society. Lévi-Strauss emphasizes this a system of generalized exchange based on indirect reciprocity. A generalized system does not involve a direct or balanced dyadic exchange and hence presupposes an expansion of trust.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} an {{elaboration}} on some central themes and arguments from my recent book, Chronopathologies: Time and Politics in Deleuze, Derrida, Phenomenology and Analytic Philosophy (Rowman and Littlefield 2012). There is hence {{an element of}} generality to this essay that the book itself is better able to justify. But a short programmatic piece has its own virtues, especially {{for those of us}} who are time poor (which is pretty much everyone in contemporary academia). Moreover, it adds a dimension to the above book by more explicitly situating it in relation to what is an emerging view in some recent scholarship (such as John McCumber, Len Lawlor, David Hoy, and before this Liz Grosz) that time is central to the identity of continental philosophy, as well as considering some of the work that in different ways contests this kind of interpretation of the identity of continental philosophy (e. g. Simon Glendinning, and, tacitly, Paul Redding). In continuing to side with the former over the latter, I will also develop my argument that time is one of the most significant factors in the divided house that I think ontemporary philosophy remains, and I conclude by offering a series of <b>negative</b> <b>prescriptions</b> regarding how we might better avoid particular chronopathologies, or time-sicknesses, that are endemic to these philosophical trajectories, and that are also present (to greater and lesser degrees) in the majority of individual philosophers standardly labeled analytic and continental. To the extent that such sicknesses are at least partly inevitable, akin to a transcendental illusion, this paper consists in a call to be more attentive to this tendency, and to the methodological, metaphilosophical, and ethico-political consequences that follow from them...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{relationships}} between candidate and examiner characteristics, {{the texts of}} examiner reports on Ph. D. theses and examiner recommendations made on theses. The data were related to 804 examiner reports on 301 theses submitted at three Australian universities. Thesis topics ranged across ten Broad Fields of Study or discipline areas. Simple bivariate analyses were first undertaken to identify candidate, examiner and university variables {{significantly related to the}} examiner recommendation—three candidate variables, examiner location and, in some cases, the university attended were identified. Next, these variables were regressed on examiner recommendation. The text categories were then factor analysed to confirm five constructs identified in previous work—positive summation, <b>negative</b> summation, <b>prescription,</b> formative evaluation and dialogic elements. These were added to the regression equation. A multilevel regression analysis with examiner recommendation as response variable indicated that four of the five constructs (not including the dialogic elements construct), holding a scholarship and two examiner-country variables explained a total of 43 % of the variance in examiner recommendation on the thesis.

40|$|The quantum {{mechanics}} of closed {{systems such as}} the universe is formulated using an extension of familiar probability theory that incorporates negative probabilities.

Members of such sets can be assigned extended probabilities that are sometimes <b>negative.</b> A <b>prescription</b> for extended probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all histories that can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets of histories that are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of settleable bets. This formulation is compared with the decoherent (consistent) histories formulation of quantum theory. Prospects are discussed for using this formulation to provide testable alternatives to quantum theory or further generalizations of it.

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The {{direction}} {{and intensity of}} consumer attitudes toward prescription prices by varying socio-economic positions and age groups were measured by use of the semantic differential technique. The potential relationships between consumer attitudes toward prescription prices and (1) consumer prescription experience, (2) select consumer knowledge, (3) select consumer beliefs, and (4) a consumer value were investigated. A random sample of 150 families was selected and the wife within each family group was interviewed utilizing a prepared questionnaire. The respondents were grouped into nine family classes by varying socio-economic positions and age groups, and were dichotomized according to varying family prescription experience, select respondent knowledge, and select respondent beliefs. The {{results indicated that the}} general direction of respondent attitudes toward <b>prescription</b> prices was <b>negative</b> in all family classes regardless of socio-economic position or age group. The results were determined as showing no significant differences between attitude means of respondents representing families with above and below average prescription experience in terms of frequency and expenditures. The results were determined as showing that respondents with basically a correct knowledge of prescription prices and prescription pricing procedures had significantly more <b>negative</b> attitudes toward <b>prescription</b> prices than respondents with basically an incorrect knowledge. The results were determined as showing that respondents who accepted selected beliefs concerning (1) physician rebates, (2) the average prescription price, and (3) pharmacy profits, generally had significantly more <b>negative</b> attitudes toward <b>prescription</b> prices than respondents who did not accept the selected beliefs.

40|$|Do {{physicians}} {{respond to}} financial incentives? We address this question {{by analyzing the}} prescription behavior of physicians who are allowed to dispense drugs themselves through onsite pharmacies. Using administrative data comprising over 16 million drug prescriptions between 2008 and 2012 in Upper Austria, a na&#x 0308;ive comparison of raw figures reveals that self-dispensing GPs induce 33. 2 % higher drug expenses than others. Our identification strategy rests on multiple pillars: First, we use an extensive array of covariates along with multi-dimensional fixed effects which account for patient and GP-level heterogeneity as well as sorting of GPs into onsite pharmacies. Second, we use a novel approach {{that allows us to}} restrict our sample to randomly allocated patient-GP matches which rules out endogenous sorting as well as principal-agent bargaining over prescriptions between patients and GPs. Contrary to our descriptive analysis, we find evidence that onsite pharmacies have a small <b>negative</b> effect on <b>prescriptions.</b> Although self-dispensing GPs seem to prescribe sligthly more expensive medication, this effect is absorbed by a much smaller likelihood to prescribe something in the first place, causing the overall effect to be negative...|$|R
2500|$|A CDC report {{published}} in 2000 showed {{problems with the}} Pregnancy Prevention Program and showed {{that the increase in}} prescriptions was from off-label use, and prompted Roche to revamp its program, renaming it the [...] "Targeted Pregnancy Prevention Program" [...] and adding label changes like requirements for two pregnancy tests, two kinds of contraception, and for doctors to provide pharmacists with prescriptions directly; providing additional educational materials, and providing free pregnancy tests. The FDA had another advisory meeting in late 2000 that again debated how to prevent pregnant women from being exposed to the drug; dermatologists testified about the remarkable efficacy of the drug, the psychological impact of acne, and demanded autonomy to prescribe the drug; others argued that the drug be withdrawn or much stricter measures be taken. [...] In 2001 the FDA announced a new regulatory scheme called SMART (the System to Manage Accutane Related Teratogenicity) that required Roche to provide defined training materials to doctors, and for doctors to sign and return a letter to Roche acknowledging that they had reviewed the training materials, for Roche to then send stickers to doctors, which doctors would have to place on prescriptions they give patients after they have confirmed a <b>negative</b> pregnancy test; <b>prescriptions</b> could only be written for 30 days and could not be renewed, thus requiring a new pregnancy test for each prescription.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) {{are common}} {{bacterial}} infections dominated by lower UTI in women (LUTIW). Symptoms only are insufficient for diagnosis and accordingly, near patient diagnostic tests confidently confirming significant bacteriuria are desirable. The nitrite test (NIT) has low sensitivity, while bacterial and leukocyte counts disjunctively paired in urine sediment microscopy (SED) have high sensitivity. Similar symptomatic cure rates are found post antibiotic vs. placebo therapy {{in patients with}} <b>negative</b> cultures. Consequently, <b>prescription</b> on symptoms only implies unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Aims: to evaluate the diagnostic outcomes of NIT, SED and NIT disjunctively paired with SED (NIT+SED) vs. urine culture, with special focus on bladder incubation time (BIT), and to assess if NIT+SED can reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy. Methods: A diagnostic, primary care, multicentre study including 1070 women with symptoms suggestive of lower UTI. Results: Significant bacteriuria was found in 77 %. The BIT highly influenced the diagnostic outcomes and the optimal duration was 4 h with sensitivity of 66, 90 and 95 % for NIT, SED and NIT+SED, respectively. SED performed only in NIT negative specimens could reduce unnecessary antibiotics by 10 % vs. prescription on symptoms only. The number needed to test with SED to reduce one unnecessary antibiotic course was five patients at BIT 4 h and six patients at 3 h or overall. Conclusion: The BIT highly influences the diagnostic outcomes with the highest accuracy of NIT+SED. Diagnosis of LUTIW with NIT+SED can reduce unnecessary antibiotic therapy and subsequently decrease antimicrobial resistance.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of national and international warnings on the prescription rates of cough and cold medicines (CCMs) in the youngest children (< 2 years) in the Netherlands and Italy. METHODS: Analysis of outpatient electronic medical records of children < 2 years in Italy and the Netherlands was carried out. Age and country specific prescription prevalence rates were calculated for the period 2005 - 08. Comparisons of prescription rates in 2005 (pre) and 2008 (post) warnings were done by means of a chi-square test. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 99176 children < 2 years of age. After international warnings, overall prescription rates for CCMs decreased slightly from 83 to 77 / 1000 person years (P= 0. 05) in Italy and increased in the Netherlands from 74 to 92 / 1000 children per year. Despite the international warnings, prescription rates for nasal sympathomimetics and opium alkaloids increased in the Netherlands (P < 0. 01). In Italy a significant decrease in the prescription rates of opium alkaloids and other cough suppressants (P < 0. 01) was observed, and also a significant reduction in use of combinations of nasal sympathomimetics. CONCLUSION: Despite the international safety warnings and <b>negative</b> benefit-risk profiles, <b>prescription</b> rates of cough and cold medicines remain substantial and were hardly affected by the warnings, especially in the Netherlands where no warning was issued. The hazards of use of these medicines in young children should be explicitly stipulated by the European Medicines Agency and all national agencies, in order to increase awareness amongst physicians and caretakers and reduce heterogeneity across the EU. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention. These symptoms result in impairments for individuals across multiple settings and are developmentally inappropriate. While common during childhood, symptoms {{have been shown}} to persist into adulthood for 50 % or more of those diagnosed before reaching age 18. Although prescription stimulants {{have been shown to}} benefit those with ADHD, increased popularity of prescription stimulant misuse among those without ADHD has been reported, despite the potentially harmful side effects that may accompany this use. Specifically, nonmedical use of prescription stimulants during adolescence led to increased risk of crime commitment and increased risk for subsequent addictions to other substances. Despite the <b>negative</b> effects of <b>prescription</b> stimulants on those misusing them, as many as 7 % of undergraduate college students reported prescription stimulant medication misuse. The present NIH R 01 funded study, Trajectories Related to ADHD in College (TRAC) is a 5 -year longitudinal study conducted by Dr. Arthur Anastopoulos at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (Lead Principal Investigator), Dr. George DuPaul at Lehigh University (Co-Principal Investigator), and Dr. Lisa Weyandt at the University of Rhode Island (Co-Principal Investigator). Through my work on this study, it became clear that although research concerning the patterns of misuse among college students has been performed and documented, the association between those with ADHD and nonmedical use of prescription stimulants has not been well studied. More specifically, research exploring the relationship between the severity of ADHD symptoms and prescription stimulant misuse is sparse. Therefore, the aim of this honors thesis is to assess the misuse among students both with, and without, ADHD, and to explore whether males and females differ in reported rates of prescription stimulant misuse...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{society is}} going through a series of changes as a result of globalization. Transformations in the {{cultural}} aspect of society are reflected in the change of norms, which include "the <b>negative</b> <b>prescriptions</b> (categorical prohibitions) concerning people's behavior, the violation of which results in the appropriate sanctions" (Sotsiologia: Entsiclopedia 2003), - the taboo. Publications on the topic of taboo in mass media, productions of films with the titles containing the word "taboo", Internet blogs and journals written by representatives of different ethnic cultures in English and Russian have served as the material for the present analysis aimed at understanding how globalization affects the transformations in content and structure of proscriptive norms in different cultures. The investigation shows that the changes in the taboo systems are realized both in the violation of the prohibitive norms - detabooisation, and in the emergence of new taboos. Both aspects are expressed in verbal and non-verbal forms. One of the brightest manifestations of non-verbal violation of the traditional prohibitions is relationships between sexes: sexual relationships in younger age and before marriage, group- and homosexual love have become a norm in many world cultures. Another example of non-verbal break of taboo is global spread of obscene gestures. In verbal communication taboo is realized in the avoidance of particular language and themes in certain communicative situations. (Sternin 2000) Among the themes which are no more considered to be forbidden in different cultures are sexual relationships and connected with it naming certain parts of the human body; diseases connected with the intimate parts of the body. Parents not loving their children is no longer considered to be a shameful theme which has developed into a popular topic of a 'child-free' lifestyle. The result of the verbal detabooisation is the widely-discussed reduction of restrictions on the use of obscene language. A new kind of breaking the taboo is the way of using obscene language in the internet with the help of 'liturgatives' (term by G. Gusseinov 2008) - crossing out the text which might be perceived as indecent. The other tendency in the way taboo systems are changing is emergence of new taboos. Internet is one of the generators of new taboos, e. g., the notion of a password has gone beyond the military or detective discourse and has become part of everyday use. Analysis of the material shows among the new non-verbal taboos are the natural smell of the body, public display of a child's naked body. The globalization of young age as a value of society is leading to the rejection of old age. New taboos are also caused by the global spread of the concept of tolerance which is manifested in the use of euphemisms for the ethnic names. There is also evidence that the concept of tolerance underlies avoidance of naming unpleasant things on the whole. Taboos as well as norms are situational, that is the system of permitting and prohibiting norms regulates communication in different situations. The investigation shows that the notion of situational appropriacy is being transformed. Changes are observed in institutional discourse, e. g. in the Russian academic discourse the refusal from impersonality is caused by the influence of the English language academic culture. Changes in the fundamental values of society caused by globalization are also reflected in subcultures, e. g. the use of obscene language is considered to be the norm in rap texts irrespective of the language they are written in. "Rebellion against the norms" (Bauman 2000) is fed by mass media. Thus, numerous reality shows have lifted the prohibition to discuss and display personal life in public. The shift of the focus from the socially important aspects of life to the personal ones is the illustration of the spreading individualism as a globalizing value. Mass media have also broken the conventional restrictions on the display of violence which has become commonplace on TV and in cinema. Due to the fundamental power of taboo, descriptions of breaks of taboo are often accompanied by the epithet "shocking" and its synonyms. However, {{due to the nature of}} detabooisation regular and repetitive violation of prohibition leads to the loss of its power and to the conversion of the taboo into the norm. Detabooisation also results from the possibility of breaking norms as prohibition can only have power when the breach of it is followed by punishment. In modern society, due to the spread of multi-culturalism and pluralism of values the issue of sanctions has become questionable. Besides, due to the spread of tolerance as one of the key concepts of modern society communicative response is being limited. Discursively, the urge to break taboos is strengthened by the rational argumentation which plays off against the irrational nature of taboo. Analysis has shown that the changes in the taboo systems in different cultures are connected with the global process of emancipation. Modern world has placed freedom in the first place in the list of its values (Z. Bauman 2001) which can be illustrated by the frequency of appeal to the concept of freedom as an argument in favour of breaking taboos. The concept of freedom is often verbalized with the help of lexical units with the meaning of 'being beyond the boundaries' and interpreted with the help of the metaphor "open - close". Presumably, striving for the rejection of internal moral restrictions and the blurring of the boundaries are the interconnected aspects of one trend of globalization. Many values which underlie the process of detabooisation reflect the predominant influence of western cultures on the other world cultures as one of the dimensions of globalization. Analyzed discourse about transformations in the prohibitive norms not infrequently refers to the influence of American culture. Having its roots in the core of linguo-culture taboo is the reflection of fundamental values of society. Naturally, radical global changes in the norms provoke resistance of cultures affected. Like many other aspects of resistance to globalization, the opposition to the transformation of cultural prohibiting norms to a significant extent appeals to the threat of ethnic or national disintegration. In sum, the current tendencies of detabooisation and the emergence of new taboos are caused by the process of globalization and reflect the transformations in the value systems of the world cultures...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comBackground: The National Breast Cancer Audit is an initiative of the Breast Section of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons collecting surgical information in early breast cancer. It is managed {{in conjunction with the}} Australian Safety and Efficacy Register of New Interventional Procedures – Surgical. An overview of results for invasive breast cancer from January 1999 until December 2004 is presented to provide preliminary data for participating surgeons. Methods: Invasive breast cancer cases were retrieved from the National Breast Cancer Audit database for the 274 participating breast surgeons in Australia and New Zealand. Data for a variety of clinical parameters were analysed to provide an overview of the diagnostic, histological, surgical and adjuvant therapy management issues. Results: There were 25 026 cases of invasive breast cancer. Annual percentages of mammographically detected cancers from 1999 to 2004 did not differ significantly. Breast-conserving surgery rates also remained stable at 60 %. Margins were involved in 5 % of patients; an additional 9 % had final margins of less than 1 mm. Radiotherapy followed breast-conserving surgery in most cases (86 %). Patients undergoing mastectomy with large tumours (> 5 cm) underwent radiotherapy in 71 % of cases. When at least four lymph nodes were positive, radiotherapy followed mastectomy in the majority (75 %) of cases. The most frequently carried out axillary procedure was a level 2 dissection. Chemotherapy was received by 78 % of oestrogen receptor negative, axillary node positive, postmenopausal patients. Tamoxifen was used in the majority (83 %) of oestrogen receptor positive cases. Conclusion: Surgeons contributing their invasive breast cancer data show a high quality of treatment. Some further improvement may be possibly related to excision margins and tamoxifen prescription for oestrogen receptor <b>negative</b> cancers. Chemotherapy <b>prescription</b> might also warrant further investigation.
