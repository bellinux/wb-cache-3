5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel. The technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
25|$|Later helmets {{include a}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> where the airline is connected, which {{prevents}} potentially fatal helmet squeeze if {{the pressure in}} the hose is lost.|$|E
25|$|A {{main supply}} valve with <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> which {{supplies}} gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a quarter-turn valve, as it must be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to lock sites using pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> during the loading or transferring of chemicals or hazardous waste. Pneumatic <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> {{have a longer}} service life when compared to pneumatic bladder systems.|$|R
50|$|That the <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> for {{the surface}} supply gas {{connection}} on the bailout manifolds are functioning correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Air {{was drawn}} from outside the smokebox through a pair of <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> into the exhaust ports, from where it was {{compressed}} into the steam chests.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} in pressure between {{the surface and}} the diver can be so great that if the air line is cut at the surface {{and there is no}} <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> the diver would be partly squeezed into the helmet by the external pressure, and injured or possibly killed.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{regulator}} and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback arrestor and/or <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.|$|E
25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} {{hydrostatic}} pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-return</b> <b>valves</b> were fitted which, {{under certain}} conditions, caused {{both ends of}} the {{high-pressure}} cylinder to be in communication, with the result that the piston would be floating and the low-pressure cylinders would be receiving high-pressure steam, thus converting the engine to simplex working.|$|R
25|$|Another {{alternative}} is the Fluidyne engine (Fluidyne heat pump), which uses hydraulic pistons {{to implement the}} Stirling cycle. The work produced by a Fluidyne engine goes into pumping the liquid. In its simplest form, the engine contains a working gas, a liquid, and two <b>non-return</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Valve {{positions}} are operating conditions {{determined by the}} position of the disc or rotor in the valve. Some valves are made to be operated in a gradual change between two or more positions. Return <b>valves</b> and <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> allow fluid to move in 2 or 1 directions respectively.|$|R
25|$|A <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> {{is usually}} fitted to the {{breathing}} hoses where they {{connect to the}} mouthpiece. This prevents any water that gets into the mouthpiece from going into the inhalation hose, and ensures that once it is blown into the exhalation hose that it cannot flow back. This slightly increases the flow resistance of air, but makes the regulator easier to clear.|$|E
25|$|A problem {{mostly of}} {{historical}} interest, but still relevant to surface supplied divers who dive with the helmet sealed {{to the dry}} suit. If the air supply hose is ruptured near or above the surface, the pressure difference between the water around the diver and {{the air in the}} hose can be several bar. The <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> at the connection to the helmet will prevent backflow if it is working correctly, but if absent, as {{in the early days of}} helmet diving, or if it fails, the pressure difference will tend to squeeze the diver into the rigid helmet, which can result in severe trauma. The same effect can result from a large and rapid increase in depth if the air supply is insufficient to keep up with the increase in ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an exhaust valve working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the exhaust valve by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E
5000|$|With {{the crank}} and {{connecting}} rod system, all elements for constructing a steam engine (invented in 1712) — Hero's aeolipile (generating steam power), the cylinder and piston (in metal force pumps), <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> (in water pumps), gearing (in water mills and clocks) — were known in Roman times.|$|R
50|$|Managing {{fire water}} {{frequently}} {{requires that the}} water be contained on site and then removed from site for specialised treatment. One of the recognised techniques is to contain the fire water in the drainage system using pneumatic bladders or lockable <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> which can be activated either automatically or manually.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine oil}} system {{is of the}} dry sump type, a {{combined}} pressure and scavenge oil pump {{is driven by the}} inlet camshaft gear, later versions of the T140 employed additional integral <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent oil draining into the sump. The frame of the T140 serves as the engine oil reservoir.|$|R
25|$|Before {{putting on}} the dry suit, the male diver puts on a condom catheter, {{which is similar to}} a condom except that it is made of thicker {{material}} with a cuff or adhesive ring to prevent it from slipping off, and its end connects to a built-on drain tube. After putting it on, he attaches the end of the tube to a drain hose in the crotch of the suit. This hose leads to a fitting through the front of one thigh of the suit, either with a screw-down outlet valve (P-valve), opened for use, or a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent water from flowing back in if the hose gets disconnected. There may also be a non-return equalisation valve allowing gas from inside the suit to flow into the hose to avoid squeeze during descent The female diver puts on an external catching device {{in the form of a}} wide-rimmed, low-profile, elongated cup. The rim is affixed onto the skin surrounding the labia with medical grade glue. The cup's outlet connects to the drain hose with similar fitting on the suit.|$|E
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve.</b> This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the disaster at Sutton Wick, the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> was redesigned to make such an error impossible. Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, after the crash, [...] "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads {{at either end of}} all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other. Items like a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense." [...] Nevertheless, Perry wrote, [...] " [...] would be amazed how many people have still tried {{to do so in the}} forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible." ...|$|E
50|$|Pipe {{fittings}} are moulded {{and come}} in many sizes: tee 90° equal (straight and reducing), tee 45°, cross equal, elbow 90° (straight and reducing), elbow 45°, short radius bend 90° socket/coupler (straight and reducing), union, end caps, reducing bush, and stub, full face, and blanking flanges.Valves are moulded and also come in many types: ball valves (also multiport valve), butterfly valves, spring-, ball-, and swing-check <b>non-return</b> <b>valves,</b> diaphragm valves, knife gate valve, globe valves and pressure relief/reduction valves.Accessories are solvents, cleaners, glues, clips, backing rings, and gaskets.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{rectification}} {{is often}} required in solar-energy water heating systems {{in order to}} prevent unwanted heat leaks which occur at night as a result of reverse thermosyphonic motions from the store to the solar-energy collector. Conventional methods of accomplishing such a thermal rectification are reviewed, and novel <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> for this purpose and their potential applications are described. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} an {{enhanced}} Mid-Deck Tanker {{and consists of}} a series of centre and wing tanks that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper wing tanks form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by <b>non-return</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
500|$|A Board of Inquiry {{investigated}} the crash {{and found it}} was caused by loss of power from Nos. 1 and 2 engines, both mounted on the port wing. George Ward told the House of Commons that [...] "the four fuel tanks {{on the port side}} of the Beverley feed into a collector box from which the two port engines are fed. From the available evidence, including inspections of part of the aircraft's fuel system, it is clear that a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> between No. 1 (port) tank and the collector box had been fitted in reverse and that the fuel supply from Nos. 3 and 4 (port) tanks were switched off throughout the flight." [...] Ward continued, saying that the loss of power from No. 1 was caused by it being shut down as a precautionary measure, and the fuel starvation to No. 2 engine was caused by an incorrectly fitted <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the supply line from No. 1 fuel tank. No. 2 fuel tank had been isolated and two smaller fuel tanks in the port wing had not been selected during the flight.|$|E
2500|$|Sutton Wick air crash, {{in which}} a wrongly-fitted <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> caused fuel {{starvation}} on an RAF Blackburn Beverley transport aircraft in 1957, leading it to crash and burst into flames near Abingdon-on-Thames ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanism}} of the twin hose regulator is packaged in a usually circular metal housing mounted on the cylinder valve behind the diver's neck. The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of corrugated rubber hoses to and from the mouthpiece. The supply hose is connected {{to one side of the}} regulator body and supplies air to the mouthpiece through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve,</b> and the exhaled air is returned to the regulator housing on the outside of the diaphragm, also through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> on the other side of the mouthpiece and usually through another non-return exhaust valve in the regulator housing - often a [...] "duckbill" [...] type.|$|E
50|$|Drains of {{all sizes}} can be fitted with systems {{available}} with extension brackets that cater for drain depths from 500 mm to over 2.5m deep.There are also pneumatically controllable flap valves or pneumatically controlled <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> which can be fitted to existing soil waste systems. Again containment is controlled by application of pneumatic pressure {{in the event of}} a spill.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 Roy Fedden {{designed}} a piston engine gas starting system, {{this was in}} use on the Bristol Jupiter engine by 1922. A system used in early Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines ducted high-pressure air from a ground unit through a camshaft driven distributor to the cylinders via <b>non-return</b> <b>valves,</b> the system had disadvantages which were overcome by conversion to electric starting.|$|R
5000|$|Check valve or clack valve: a <b>non-return</b> stop <b>valve</b> {{by which}} water enters the boiler.|$|R
2500|$|The {{generic name}} [...] " [...] valve" [...] {{used in the}} UK derives from the {{unidirectional}} current flow allowed by the earliest device, the thermionic diode emitting electrons from a heated filament, by analogy with a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in a water pipe. The US names [...] "vacuum tube", [...] "electron tube", and [...] "thermionic tube" [...] all simply describe a tubular envelope which has been evacuated ("vacuum"), has a heater, and controls electron flow.|$|E
2500|$|In the [...] "single-hose" [...] {{two-stage}} design, {{the first}} stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about [...] to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about [...] above ambient pressure. [...] The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from {{the first stage}}, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. [...] The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> on the second stage housing. The first stage typically {{has at least one}} outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the <b>non-return</b> <b>valve</b> in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. [...] Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a comprehensive modelling and simulation of a heat-driven gravity-assisted solution pump for an aqua ammonia absorption refrigeration unit. The pump {{is essentially a}} hermetic vessel located at an intermediate elevation between the absorber and generator. It is connected to both components with vapour and liquid tubes. The flow in the vapour tubes is controlled by solenoid valves, while a regulating <b>valve</b> and two <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> are incorporated in the liquid tubes. The developed pump overcomes the leakage problem which is still a major constraint in developing ammonia-water refrigeration and heat pumping systems of small capacities. The simulation results revealed that {{the diameter of the}} pump vessel has no effect on its flow rate. The elevation differences have a slight effect on the flow rate. The most important parameters are the diameter of the liquid tubes and the pressure loss coefficients of the incorporated regulating and <b>non-return</b> <b>valves.</b> The obtained results pave the way to implement this type of solution pumps in the development of small capacities ammonia-water absorption refrigeration units...|$|R
50|$|The High Volume Pump has the {{capability}} of delivering large volumes of water over great distances utilising additional pumps. They can pump 7,000 litres/min and hose can be deployed utilising the 1 km hose boxes at a maximum speed of 25 mph. It also carries a variety of ancillary equipment including, hose adaptors, 5-way manifolds, Y-pieces, gate <b>valves,</b> <b>non-return</b> <b>valves,</b> water safety equipment, harnesses & lanyards, hose ramps, change of direction equipment, edge protection, sack trolley and lighting, cones and tape.|$|R
50|$|The diver {{breathes}} {{from the}} rebreather circuit through a bite-grip mouthpiece or an oro-nasal mask {{which may be}} part of a full-face mask or diving helmet.The mouthpiece is connected {{to the rest of the}} rebreather by breathing hoses. The mouthpiece of a diving rebreather will usually include a shutoff valve, and may incorporate a dive/surface valve or a bailout valve or both. On loop configured rebreathers the mouthpiece is usually the place where the <b>non-return</b> <b>valves</b> for the loop are fitted.|$|R
