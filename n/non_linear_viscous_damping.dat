40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} and seismic analysis of Qiandao lake {{submerged floating tunnel}} (SFT) is addressed with {{particular attention to the}} mooring system, to dissipation issues and to the spatial variability of the excitation, within a numerical procedure developed by the research group to perform the step-by-step dynamic analysis of discretized non-linear structural systems. The procedure, which can handle arbitrary external loading allowing for multiple-support seismic excitation, is enhanced by enriching the mooring cables model adding non-linear hydrodynamic loads. Different dissipation models account for hydrodynamic damping, structural damping and radiation damping which are included, respectively, as non-linear forces, as <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> equivalent to <b>linear</b> hysteretic by means of an iterative procedure, and as <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping.</b> A possible solution is here studied to define an adequate cable discretization in order to correctly model nonlinear geometric effects and to avoid fictitious compressions. A uniformly modulated random process, whose spatial variability is governed by a single coherency function, is deemed adequate to model multi-support seismic input for the given structure.

To suppress the problematic vibrations and to minimize the potential high cost of maintenance or repair, passive damping system have been widely employed. In most investigations the damper was modelled as a pure <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> device or as a <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> with internal stiffness perfectly anchored to the deck. Other authors evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} damping system introducing the effects of the flexibility in the damper support. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the use of Targeted-Energy-Transfer (TET) devices for cable vibration suppression; a new family of devices is proposed in which a nonlinear elastic stiffness force mechanism and device, modelled as a power-law elastic spring element, is placed in parallel with a <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damper.</b> The imperfect anchorage to the deck is also taken into account by an elastic support.

A minimum condition imposed to the identified dissipated energy leads to the distinction of the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> component from the other damping mechanisms. The estimated values obtained from the experimental tests show a significant influence of the damage level on the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> coefficient.

40|$|Heerema Marine Contractors is {{constructing}} a new semi-submersible crane vessel, the Sleipnir. Due to low initial stability, semi-submersibles may present significant wave induced resonant motions in heave, roll and pitch. For practical reasons, especially the roll motion {{could play a}} limiting factor for future lift operations of the Sleipnir. In order to study the hydrodynamic behaviour of the Sleipnir, model tests in waves have been performed atMaritime Research Institute Netherlands. In the tested sea states low frequent second order roll has been observed. In order to evaluate {{the impact of the}} low frequent motions of the Sleipnir it is important to create an accurate (low frequent) simulation model. The aim of this thesis is to investigate if a low frequency roll motion simulation model, in the frequency and time domain, can be created. It is challenging to predict the low frequent second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements due to two main non-linear phenomenons. In the first place, the (<b>viscous)</b> roll <b>damping</b> is considered to be non-linear. In the second place, the second order wave forces in the vertical plane, which have not been investigated extensively in the past, are non-linear phenomena. A calculation method in order to simulate the low frequency roll motions is created. This simulation method makes use of a first and second order hydrodynamic date base, first and second order moment spectra and a moment transfer function in order to define the roll motion spectrum. In order to implement <b>viscous</b> roll <b>damping</b> in the frequency domain method, a linearization of the roll damping is necessary. First empirical <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> values have been obtained for the three tested sea states. The frequency domain method predicts the roll motion energy in good agreement with the measurements, using the empirical <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> roll <b>damping</b> values, for the three tested sea states. In order to predict the low frequent roll motions for any sea state, a calculation scheme is proposed. In this calculation scheme, a linear roll damping prediction method based on linearization techniques, is incorporated. However, the investigated linearization techniques do not predict the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> in agreement with the measurements. The energy in the rollmotion response spectrumis highly dependent on the amount of added <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> in the calculation. Therefore, it will be hard, due to inaccurate <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> predictions assigned to the linearization techniques, to estimate the low frequency second order roll motions in good agreement with the measurements. In the time domain simulations non-linear <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> terms are incorporated by means of a linear and quadratic damping coefficient. Still water decay test simulations show a very good agreement with the measurements when using damping coefficients obtained from decay tests. However, the statistics of the simulated model tests are not in exact agreement with statistics of the model tests. Possible causes for this mismatch are discussed. It must be noted that the time domain simulations have been validated with only one sea state. It is recommended to validate the time domain model for more sea states. Although the model tests and simulation methods show significant second order roll motions, which are undesirable for performing a heavy lift, it must be realized that a combination of the tested conditions (very low initial stability, long crested beam waves) will be very rare during a future heavy lift of the Sleipnir. Additionally it is noted, that the tested sea states exceed the typical heavy lift operability limit, used by Heerema.

The analytical approach to solving the ˇSKODA 21 Tr low-floor trolleybus model vibrations is a suitable complement of the model based on a numerical solution. Vertical vibrations are numerically solved on the trolleybus multibody model created in the alaska simulation tool. Both virtual trolleybus models are used for the simulations of driving on the track composed of vertical obstacles.

40|$|Vibration {{isolators}} {{are often}} assumed to possess <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> which has well known consequences for their performance. However, damping may {{be designed to}} be or prove to be nonlinear. This study investigates the effect of cubic damping, {{as an example of}} damping nonlinearity, in a single degree of freedom (SDOF) vibration isolation system. The response behaviour due to two excitation types, namely harmonic and broadband excitations, was examined. For harmonic excitation, the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) was applied to yield approximate closed form solutions and simplified analytical expressions implicitly show the influence of cubic damping for particular frequency regions. The HBM solutions were verified using direct numerical integration. The presence of cubic damping proves to be beneficial for the force excited case. It reduces response amplitude around the resonance frequency and has similar response to an undamped system in the isolation region. In contrast, for base excitation, the cubic damping is detrimental at high excitation frequencies as the base excitation and isolated mass move almost together. The effect becomes more pronounced for larger excitation amplitudes. The case of base excitation was then considered for broadband excitation. The responses using direct numerical integration were presented using power spectral densities. In contrast to harmonic excitation, the amplitude of the response does not appear to approach that of the input. Instead, a higher effective cubic damping results in a higher vibration level of the isolated mass at frequencies below the resonance frequency. It also does not reduce explicitly the response amplitude around the resonance frequency unlike the <b>linear</b> <b>viscous</b> <b>damping.</b> For a constant displacement amplitude random excitation, the excitation frequency bandwidth is found to be a significant factor in the level of effective cubic damping. A broader excitation bandwidth results in a higher level of cubic damping force. The theoretical and numerical results for both harmonic and broadband excitation were validated experimentally. The experimental investigation was performed using a SDOF base excited vibration isolation system possessing a simple velocity feedback control active damper to reproduce the nonlinear damping force. The predictions were shown to be in good agreement with measurements thereby verifying the effects of cubic damping on a SDOF system undergoing harmonic and broadband base excitation...|$|R
