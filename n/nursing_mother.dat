Breastfeeding a child while pregnant with another may be considered a form of tandem feeding for the <b>nursing</b> <b>mother,</b> as she provides nutrition for two.|$|E

Two thematic categories were built: Exclusive maternal breastfeeding {{in the perception of}} <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> and The potentialities and difficulties regarding maternal breastfeeding: perceptions of <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> Results indicate that not only do <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> consider the practice of exclusive maternal breastfeeding as beneficial due to the high biological value of maternal milk for the child, but also highlight several factors that can determine the course of breastfeeding, pervading economic, social, cultural and emotional dimensions...|$|R

25|$|Breastfeeding {{research}} {{focuses on}} diverse aspects such as prevalence, HIV transmission, pharmacology, costs, benefits, immunology, contraindications, and comparisons to synthetic breast milk substitutes. Factors related to {{the mental health of}} the <b>nursing</b> <b>mother</b> in the perinatal period have been studied. While cognitive behavior therapy may be the treatment of choice, medications are sometimes used. The use of therapy rather than medication reduces the infant's exposure to medication that may be transmitted through the milk. In coordination with institutional organisms, researchers are also studying the social impact of brestfeeding throughout history. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to foster the increase of the breastfeedingrates in the different countries.|$|E

But he approved an expedition, to be led by Captain David Buchan, to recover a boat and other fishing gear that had been stolen by the Beothuk. John Peyton Jr. led one of the groups. His father was John Peyton Sr., a salmon fisherman known for his hostility toward the small tribe. On a raid, Peyton's group killed Demasduit's husband Nonosbawsut, then ran her down in the snow. She pleaded for her life, baring her breasts to show she was a <b>nursing</b> <b>mother.</b> They took Demasduit to Twillingate, where Peyton Jr. earned a bounty on her. Her baby died.

40|$|The Affordable Care Act of 2010 {{was a major}} reformation of the American {{healthcare}} system, and {{it included}} several laws aimed at helping different groups of Americans. One such law, the Reasonable Break Time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> law, was written {{with the intention of}} affording breastfeeding mothers the opportunity to pump breast milk at work. The purpose of this essay is to critique the Break time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> Law, to discuss its shortcomings, and to present logical policy alternatives. Although noble in its intentions, this law does not do enough to protect <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers.</b> It is limited to the workplace and only applies to employers with 50 or more employees. This paper will recommend an extension of the Break Time for <b>Nursing</b> <b>Mothers</b> Law to all employees, protection of <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> {{for a longer period of}} time, and accommodations for pumping and breastfeeding in public places. Increased breastfeeding of infants would have a profound positive impact on childhood illness, rates of obesity, and mental health for American children and families. This paper will also, advocate for federal legislation that promotes and encourages breastfeeding for its known public health benefits...|$|R

40|$|Background: For {{over two}} decades, the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) has {{promoted}} breastfeeding practices supported by adequate government legislation in Nigeria through decree 41 of 1990. The {{objective of this}} study was therefore to assess the breastfeeding pattern among <b>mothers</b> <b>nursing</b> infants aged 3 - 6 months in Abraka, Delta State, Nigeria. Method: This is a health facility based cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from June 2010 to March 2011 among two hundred and twenty <b>mothers</b> <b>nursing</b> infants aged 3 - 6 months who presented at the immunization clinic in government hospital, Abraka. The <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> were selected by a systematic sampling technique (1 in 3). The study instrument was a pre-tested semi-structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Result: Two hundred and twenty <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> with mean age of 27. 9 ± 5. 6 years were studied. Over a third of the <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> had acquired secondary (41. 8 %) and tertiary (36. 8 %) education respectively; while 6. 4 % and 15. 0 % had nil formal education and primary education respectively. Over half (60. 5 %) of the <b>nursing</b> <b>mothers</b> practiced mixing feeding (breastfeeding with concurrent complementary feeding), while 20. 9 % and 18. 6 % of them practiced predominant breastfeeding (breastfeeding with concurrent water) and exclusive breastfeeding respectively.
