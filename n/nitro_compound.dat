50|$|Alkyl and aryl <b>nitro</b> <b>compounds</b> behave differently.

50|$|The Bechamp {{reaction}} is broadly applicable to aromatic <b>nitro</b> <b>compounds.</b> Aliphatic <b>nitro</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are more difficult}} to reduce, often remaining as the hydroxylamine.

50|$|Nitrobenzene is {{a simple}} example of a <b>nitro</b> <b>compound.</b> In {{aromatic}} nitration reactions a C-H bond is broken, leaving the two electrons on the carbon atom. These two electrons {{are added to the}} nitronium ion, reducing it to nitrite.|$|E
