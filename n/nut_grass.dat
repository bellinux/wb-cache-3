The present investigation {{was carried out}} in Mashhad, Iran, to study the effect of weeds, which emerged naturally in a multi species community along side with melon, on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the crop during 2007. Thirty five plots were selected randomly in a girded filed. Weeds were allowed to compete freely with melon by the harvest time in 32 plots. The other 3 plots were weeded during crop development. Weed sampling was conducted prior to melon harvesting. Density, frequency and dry mater were recorded species-wise. Maximum melon plant growth and yield indices were also recorded. Stepwise multivariate regression equations were established to determine the competitive relation between population and dry matter of each weed species and melon characteristics. Results revealed that dry matter had more significant relation with characteristics under study compare to weed density. Weeds showed two adverse competitive responses. According to their effects on melon traits, weeds were divided in antagonistic and synergistic groups.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} glyphosate tolerant cotton {{in the last}} 10 years has substantially modified the weed control practices used in irrigated and dryland cotton crops. Data on changes in the weed populations, infestation levels and flora, and control tactics were compiled from field and industry surveys to compare changes in the weeds and practices used since the introduction of herbicide tolerant cotton. The focus was on three regions: Darling Downs with 36 % dryland cotton grown, Gwydir (12 %) and Lower Namoi (9 %). Across the crop rotations, flaxleaf fleabane had increased dramatically in both dryland and irrigated systems, and there were more residual weeds in dryland than irrigated systems, particularly for bladder ketmia, flaxleaf fleabane, sowthistle and barnyard grass. The main weeds surviving within glyphosate tolerant crops, prior to implementation of remedial actions, were cow vine, flaxleaf fleabane, <b>nut</b> <b>grass,</b> bladder ketmia and barnyard grass, although relative importance differed between the regions. The approach to weed control {{over the last decade}} moved from pre-emptive use of residual pre-emergent herbicides to tactics for control of weed seedlings and survivors of glyphosate applications. Weed management practices were similar across the regions but differed somewhat between dryland and irrigated crops. The weed flora shift, threat of glyphosate resistant weeds, and the extent of weeds surviving in the other components of the rotation indicate the need for a more strategic approach to weed management to be applied across the whole cropping system...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different concentrations of aqueous extract of underground constructions of nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) in herbaceous cuttings and softwood peach of Chimarrita and Chiripá cultivars. The cuttings were collected from mother plants, to obtain the extract were used 50 grams of underground structures for sedge herbaceous cuttings and 100 grams in the extract intended for softwood cuttings. The herbaceous cuttings and softwood remained immersed in the extract for 40 minutes. In herbaceous followed were placed in commercial substrate. As for the softwood cuttings were also packed in commercial substrate and medium sand. The experimental design was completely randomized with arrangement of treatments in a factorial design. They compared the factors concentration of the extract, with levels 0 %; 25 %; 50 %; 75 %; 100 % to 5 doses, cultivating factor: 2 Chimarrita and Chiripá, with 3 repetitions. Evaluation of rooting occurred after 45 days for softwood cuttings and after 80 days for softwood. We evaluated the results of the response variables: number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves, leaf length, number of roots, root length and number of calluses. For qualitative variables: types of cuttings and varieties, the results were subjected to analysis of variance and mean comparison test by Tukey test at 5 % error probability. We conclude that the aqueous extract of underground constructions of <b>nut</b> <b>grass</b> L. was not effective in promoting the rooting of herbaceous cuttings and softwood peach cultivars chimarrita and chiripá.

2500|$|Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies {{are larger}} than those that reside in the American Rocky Mountains. This is due, in part, to the {{richness}} of their diets. In Yellowstone National Park in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of whitebark pine <b>nuts,</b> tubers, <b>grasses,</b> various rodents, army cutworm moths, and scavenged carcasses. [...] None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, {{it is not uncommon}} to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing [...] Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and clams with sedge grass and berries. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies. Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at Brooks Falls in Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are also very experienced in chasing the fish around and pinning them with their claws. At such sites such as Brooks Falls and McNeil Falls in Alaska, big male grizzlies fight regularly for the best fishing spots. Grizzly bears along the coast also forage for razor clams, and frequently dig into the sand to seek them. During the spring and fall, directly before and after the salmon runs, berries and grass make up the mainstay of the diets of coastal grizzlies.|$|R
