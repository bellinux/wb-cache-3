50|$|Hewitt D. Crane (1927-2008) was an American {{engineer}} {{best known}} for his pioneering work at SRI International on ERMA (Electronic Recording Machine, Accounting), for Bank of America, magnetic digital logic, <b>neuristor</b> logic, the development of an eye-movement tracking device, and a pen-input device for computers.|$|E
50|$|Research at HP Labs on Mott memristors {{has shown}} that while they can be non-{{volatile}}, the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the phase transition temperature can be exploited to fabricate a <b>neuristor,</b> a biologically-inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons. In September 2013 they presented models and simulations that show how the spiking behavior of these neuristors {{can be used to}} form the components required for a Turing machine.|$|E
40|$|A <b>neuristor</b> R-junction is {{provided}} by coupling <b>neuristor</b> lines by paths of varying resistance so that a pulse being propagated on one line when coupled to {{a portion of the}} second line through a relatively high resistive path will place the second line in the refractory mode thus preventing the propagation of a pulse through that portion of second line; however the same pulse coupled to another portion of the second line through a lower resistance path will cause a pulse to be produced in the second line and propagated in that portion of second line which is not in the refractory mode. Various logic and storage circuits are included in the disclosure...|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} activity on Josephson junctions opened {{a wide variety}} of very stimulating subjects in which Barone was deeply involved. These range from the use of Josephson junctions as <b>neuristors</b> and soliton propagation in “long” Josephson structures, to fluctuations phenomena, from light sensitive junctions and proximity effect to the development of innovative superconducting devices.|$|R
40|$|Electrical switching, manifesting {{itself in}} the {{nonlinear}} current-voltage characteristics with S- and N-type NDR (negative differential resistance), is inherent {{in a variety of}} materials, in particular, transition metal oxides. Although this phenomenon has been known for a long time, recent suggestions to use oxide-based switching elements as <b>neuristor</b> synapses and relaxation-oscillation circuit components have resumed the interest in this area. In the present review, we describe the experimental facts and theoretical models, mainly {{on the basis of the}} Mott transition in vanadium dioxide as a model object, of the switching effect with special emphasis on the emerging applied potentialities for oxide electronics...|$|E
40|$|Perception, decisions, and sensations are all encoded into trains {{of action}} {{potentials}} in the brain. The relation between stimulus strength and all-or-nothing spiking of neurons {{is widely believed}} to be the basis of this coding. This initiated the development of spiking neuron models; one of today's most powerful conceptual tool for the analysis and emulation of neural dynamics. The success of electronic circuit models and their physical realization within silicon field-effect transistor circuits lead to elegant technical approaches. Recently, the spectrum of electronic devices for neural computing has been extended by memristive devices, mainly used to emulate static synaptic functionality. Their capabilities for emulations of neural activity were recently demonstrated using a memristive <b>neuristor</b> circuit, while a memristive neuron circuit has so far been elusive. Here, a spiking neuron model is experimentally realized in a compact circuit comprising memristive and memcapacitive devices based on the strongly correlated electron material vanadium dioxide (VO 2) and on the chemical electromigration cell Ag/TiO 2 -x/Al. The circuit can emulate dynamical spiking patterns in response to an external stimulus including adaptation, which {{is at the heart of}} firing rate coding as first observed by E. D. Adrian in 1926...|$|E
