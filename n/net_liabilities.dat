40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the path of}} the UK's international investment position (IIP) {{with the rest of the}} world. The paper shows that both UK assets and liabilities grew considerably during the past decade. Liabilities always outstripped assets during this period, mainly reflecting the persistent current account deficits, which meant that the UK consistently ran a <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position. Although the size of the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position increased over the decade, its growth has been volatile. The paper presents a model which shows that in the long term flows had driven the changes to the UK’s net IIP, while the volatility in the short term was driven by other changes. The model showed that in 2008 exchange rate effects were the main driver of the UK’s improved <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position; this was because sterling depreciated sharply against all three major currencies. The deterioration in the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position in 2009 and 2010 was explained mainly in terms of price effects, as equity markets began to recover; but also exchange rate effects as sterling began to rally, particularly against the euro; and flows as investors turned to UK gilts in preference to euro denominated government debt...|$|R

We use empirical techniques {{that allow us to}} quantify the relative importance of permanent and transitory innovations. We find that transitory shocks contribute considerably to the variation in all three variables for a horizon up to a year, and their contribution remains significant for a horizon up to five years. A permanent shock – that we interpret as a technological shock – dominates the variation of all variables at longer horizons. In response to this shock, <b>net</b> foreign <b>liabilities,</b> <b>net</b> output and consumption all increase – consistent with the effect of productivity gains raising domestic return to capital and thus generating an inflow of foreign capital. Conversely, shocks that cause net output and consumption to increase temporarily are accompanied by short-run accumulation of net foreign assets – in contrast with traditional model predicting procyclical current account deficits in response to temporary output fluctuations. Instead, our results are qualitatively consistent with predictions of the intertemporal approach to the current account. consumption smoothing; current account; international adjustment mechanism; intertemporal approach to the current account; net foreign wealth; permanent-transitory decomposition...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives a {{reassessment}} of {{the sustainability of}} the reformed Hungarian pension system with a special focus on whether {{the introduction of the}} fully funded pillar in 1998 has led to any improvement in the sustainability of the pension system. After {{a brief description of the}} 1997 / 1998 reform of the Hungarian pension system, we present results from simulations with a revised pension model. Our results show that 1) the pension system, in its present form, is unsustainable with <b>net</b> implicit public <b>liabilities</b> in the system around 240 % of GDP, unless corrective measures are taken. 2) The series of policy measures taken since the 1997 / 1998 reform account for nearly three-fourths of the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> implicit in the pension system, reflecting a policy reversal: an alarming tendency of undoing the progress made by the reform in terms of improving the system’s sustainability. 3) The funded pillar can help in lowering <b>net</b> implicit <b>liabilities</b> if the transition costs involved in the reform are financed by budgetary adjustment. 4) The returns recorded so far in the private pension funds fall short of expectations and, on the condition that these low returns persist, the second pillar is projected to provide annuities that do not make up for the reduction in benefits received from the public pillar. This conclusion is valid even if we compare a hypothetical balanced full pay-as-you-go (PAYG) system with a sustainable multi-pillar system. ageing, pension system, social security, fiscal sustainability. ...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{tries to}} analyze the {{accounting}} challenges that the implementation of EU Emissions Trading Scheme has risen. On 2 December 2004, IASB has issued an interpretation regarding the accounting of the GHG emissions allowances (IFRIC 3 „Emission Rights”). This interpretation should have been effective for annual periods beginning after 1 March 2005, {{the first year of}} the EU Emission Trading Scheme implementation. Less than a year after it was issued, IFRIC has withdrawn IFRIC 3. In December 2007, IASB has started a new project in order to provide guidance on accounting for carbon allowances called Emissions Trading Schemes Project. In the absence of an accounting standard regarding the accounting of these emissions allowances a diversity of accounting practices have been identified. Nowadays, there are three main accounting practices for the recognition of the emissions allowances and the GHG emissions liabilities: IFRIC 3 approach, the government grants approach and the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> or off balance sheet approach. The accounting treatment of greenhouse gas emissions allowances by Romanian companies resembles the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> or off balance sheet approach. Finance Ministry Order no. 1118 / 2012 states that GHG emission certificates should be recognized as fixed assets (if the entity is expecting a profit in the long term) or in the category of short term investments (if the entity is expecting a profit in the short term). The accounting of the greenhouse gas emissions allowances described above is applicable mainly to traders of such certificates and not for the installations in the scope of the EU ETS directive, which should recognize GHG emissions off balance sheet, at their nominal value (nil if received for free). The shortfall or excess of allowances will be recognized in the profit or loss as they are bought or sold by the entity (the accounting treatment imposed by Finance Ministry Order no. 3055 / 2009) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} some long-run {{aspects of}} the Swiss balance of payments, highlighting two macroeconomic phenomena that make Switzerland stand out among other countries: first, it has had a persistent current account surplus and the largest ratio of net foreign assets to GDP in the world; second, its real interest rates have been significantly {{lower than those of}} most other industrialized countries, earning it the label “interest rate island”. These two distinctive features may be related, and ultimately both may result from an excess of national savings over investment for many years. The real interest differential may largely be attributed to a foreign exchange rate risk premium, which compensates Swiss residents for holding net assets in foreign currency and foreign residents for bearing <b>net</b> <b>liabilities</b> in Swiss francs. ...|$|E

Under the pay as you go system, the benefits to the elderly at the introduction of the pension system are equal to the sum of the present discounted value of net burden of all generations born thereafter. Also, the pay as you go pension system has a huge amount of net pension debt, which must be borne by future generations. The paper points out that shifting to a funding system is an issue of how many years the repayment of such <b>net</b> <b>liabilities</b> should desirably be spread over. Finally, although consumption tax is generally thought to be a desirable revenue source of the pension system, we point out this idea is incorrect from a theoretical view point...|$|E

Secondly, the paper assesses whether the relationship between net interoffice accounts and domestic policy-steered rates depends on cross-sectional differences in the funding structure of global banks. Using US banks' balance sheets data collected by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the results highlight the importance of domestic repo borrowings in explaining net interoffice accounts, especially for larger banks during the crisis. On the other hand, a negative relationship between policy rates and net interoffice accounts is observed only for those global banks with a relatively higher share of repo borrowings...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{demographic}} change, {{the fiscal}} sustainability of pension schemes financed on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) basis is of more interest for policy makers than ever.

With comparable data about the unfunded accrued-to-date pension liabilities of social security pension schemes soon being available due to a recent update of the international System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), we present a simple framework for accounting of paygo pension schemes using these estimates of accrued-to-date liabilities. Additionally we incorporate another definition of liabilities, the current workers' and pensioners' <b>net</b> <b>liabilities</b> (CWL).

40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case of portfolio investment transactions, we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign direct investment positions that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s <b>net</b> <b>liability</b> position increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas revaluations and other adjustments explain the remaining 47, 3 %.
