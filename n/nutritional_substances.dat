25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or <b>nutritional</b> <b>substances</b> to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male-transferred material increases female longevity. Male-transferred material also increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.|$|E

The whole process is biochemically sound and mediated by microbial metabolic activities that produce heat, water, CO 2 {{and results in}} mineralization, transformation, and humification (Shilev et al. 2007). The technology is cheaper and sustainable {{in terms of its}} requirements for ingredients, manpower, energy, water, time, resource integration, and reproducibility.

After production of good-quality compost using windrows, biofortification of the raw product can be done with the use of beneficial microbial inoculants (plant growth-promoting bacteria, mycorrhiza, and biocontrol fungi) (Muttalib et al. 2016). Enrichment of raw compost material with organic inputs like humic acid, amino acids, phytohormones, mineral nutrients (zinc, iron, boron), phytonutrients, botanicals and vermicompost can further add value to the products that can help in organic farming (Mohler and Johnson 2009).|$|R

40|$|Gene-environment {{interaction}} {{is behind the}} pathogenesis of most widespread diseases, and nutrition is among the environmental factors with the highest impact on human health. The mechanisms involved in the interaction between nutritional factors and the genetic background of individuals are still unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether resveratrol (RES), an antioxidant polyphenol of red wine, can influence the activity of PPARalpha in the rat hepatoma cell line McArdle-RH 7777. PPARalpha is a transcriptional factor that regulates gene expression when activated by endogenous or exogenous long-chain fatty acids. Its activation results in significant protection from cardiovascular diseases in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: By means of the electromobility shift assay (EMSA), we observed that PPARalpha is redox-sensitive as it displays reduced DNA-binding activity following in vivo treatment of the cells with 1 mmol/L diethylmaleate (DEM), a glutathione-depleting agent. This finding could be relevant considering the important role of redox balance in pathological and physiological processes. We also observed a dual effect of 100 mumol/L RES on PPARalpha activity: it was able to prevent, to a large extent, the DEM-induced reduction of DNA-binding activity at earlier time points, when the effect of DEM was stronger, but it depressed PPARalpha activity at later time points, when the effect of DEM was greatly reduced. CONCLUSION: A <b>nutritional</b> <b>substance,</b> such as RES, is able to influence the activity of gene-regulating factors, but the net effect is difficult to predict when the compound involved has multiple biological properties. Caution is therefore warranted before drawing conclusions about the potential benefits of RES for human health...|$|R

50|$|Male sperm {{offers many}} {{nutrients}} to increase a female's lifetime and egg production. These nutrients include acids or sodium. Male sperm also protects females and their eggs from predators. The females would also gain a net {{benefit from a}} male's sperm. Female recipients are supposed to produce bigger offspring than those females who did not receive nuptial gifts. The eggs of female spiders who receive nuptial gifts may hatch {{at a higher rate}} than those without nuptial gifts. Historically, nuptial gifts were seen as <b>nutritional</b> <b>substances</b> given to females from males during mating. The male benefits from a net fitness. Although the gifts are costly to find or produce, the gifts will increase attraction and copulation with other females. One of the more recently identified costs to males is reduced running speed due to gift-carrying. This cost may be exacerbated in areas of high predation. Nuptial gifts can benefit a male by increasing his paternity share when females are promiscuous. In some insects, nuptial gifts allow the male to copulate longer and transfer more sperm to the female. In fruit flies, katydids, and scorpion flies, nuptial gifts contain substances that reduce a female’s receptivity to additional matings. While nuptial gifts also may boost female fecundity, from a male’s perspective, such investment will only be beneficial if it increases the number of his own offspring. In bell crickets, nuptial gifts may be necessary to avoid injury or death by cannibalizing females. This additional benefit allows gift-giving males to surpass the fitness of other males. In this way, females are exploiting the inherent sexual dimorphism of their species.|$|E

Glucose is an essential <b>nutritional</b> <b>substance</b> for brain function sustenance, which cannot be synthesized by the brain. Its transport primarily depends on the glucose transporters on the brain capillary endothelial cells. In this paper, the brain-targeted properties of glucose-modified liposomes using polyethylene glycols with different chain lengths as the linkers were compared and evaluated to establish an optimized drug-delivery system. Methods: Coumarin 6 -loaded liposomes (GLU 200 -LIP, GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP) composed of phospholipids and glucose-derived cholesterols were prepared by thin-film dispersion-ultrasound method. The BBB model in vitro was developed to evaluate the transendothelial ability of the different liposomes crossing the BBB. The biodistribution of liposomes in the mice brains was identified by in vivo and ex vivo nearinfrared fluorescence imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy and further analyzed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Glucose-derived cholesterols were synthesized and identified, and coumarin 6 -loaded liposomes were prepared successfully. The particle sizes of the four types of glucose-modified liposomes were around or smaller than 100 nm with a polydispersity index less than 0. 300. GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP achieved higher cumulative cleared volumes on BBB model in vitro after 6 hours compared with GLU 200 -LIP (P &lt; 0. 05) and were significantly higher than that of the conventional liposome (P &lt; 0. 001). The qualitative and quantitative biodistribution results in the mice showed that the accumulation of GLU 1000 -LIP in the brain was the highest among all the groups (P &lt; 0. 01 versus LIP). Conclusion: The data indicated that GLU 400 -LIP, GLU 1000 -LIP, and GLU 2000 -LIP all possess the potential of brain targeting, among which GLU 1000 -LIP, as a promising drug-delivery system, exhibited the strongest brain delivery capacity.

50|$|Agricultural soil {{scientists}} study {{ways to make}} soils more productive. They classify {{soils and}} test them {{to determine whether they}} contain nutrients vital to plant growth. Such <b>nutritional</b> <b>substances</b> include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. If a certain soil is deficient in these substances, fertilizers may provide them. Agricultural soil scientists investigate the movement of nutrients through the soil, and the amount of nutrients absorbed by a plant's roots. Agricultural soil scientists also examine the development of roots and their relation to the soil. Some agricultural soil scientists try to understand the structure and function of soils in relation to soil fertility. They grasp the structure of soil as porous solid. The solid frames of soil consist of mineral derived from the rocks and organic matter originated from the dead bodies of various organisms. The pore space of the soil is essential for the soil to become productive. Small pores serve as water reservoir supplying water to plants and other organisms in the soil during the rain-less period. The water in the small pores of soils is not pure water; they call it soil solution. In soil solution, various plant nutrients derived from minerals and organic matters in the soil are there. This is measured through the cation exchange capacity. Large pores serve as water drainage pipe to allow the excessive water pass through the soil, during the heavy rains. They also serve as air tank to supply oxygen to plant roots and other living beings in the soil. In short, agricultural soil scientists see the soil as a vessel, the most precious one for us, containing all of the substances needed by the plants and other living beings on earth.|$|E
