40|$|Zinc has {{traditionally}} been the metallic material most widely used to protect steel against atmospheric corrosion due to its ability to afford cathodic protection to steel in all types of <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> In recent decades, aluminium and zinc/aluminium alloy coatings have been used instead of zinc in certain atmospheric applications. Although these coatings present some advantages over zinc, they {{are not able to}} cathodically protect steel substrates in all types of <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> The present paper assesses the cathodic protection afforded by Al (flame spraying), Al/ 13 Si (hot dipping), 55 Al/Zn (hot dipping), Zn/ 15 Al (flame spraying), Zn/ 5 Al (hot dipping), Zn (hot dipping), Zn (discontinuous hot dipping) and Zn (electroplating). Aluminium and aluminium-rich alloy coatings (55 %Al/Zn) provide cathodic protection to the steel substrate only in atmospheres that are highly contaminated with chloride ions (> 100 mg Cl- m- 2 day- 1) where these coatings become active. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Exposure {{tests in}} <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> are an {{indispensable}} means {{for determining the}} behaviour and durability of metallic materials in the atmosphere. The corrosion behaviour of bare aluminium and anodised aluminium with three different coating thicknesses has been evaluated for two years' exposure in two <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> of very different corrosivities: one urban and the other marine. Several techniques {{have been used to}} evaluate changes in the specimens during exposure, but special attention is paid to the direct measurement of corrosion by gravimetry and its indirect estimation by the comparatively much more sensitive electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The results show that if no demands are placed on the conservation of its appearance, aluminium may be used without protection even in atmospheres of medium or high corrosivity. The anodising and sealing of aluminium alloys, above an ill-defined minimum thickness threshold, is an appropriate solution to prevent localised corrosion of aluminium and to conserve its appearance, even in aggressive atmospheres.

40|$|The {{study of}} new paint {{systems that are}} less harmful to the {{environment}} and to man than traditional solvent-borne systems, but have identical anti-corrosive characteristics, is an issue of great interest at the present time. The authors of this work have taken advantage of the opportunity to use different <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> in the Ibero-American region to study the behaviour of new water-borne, high-solids and powder paint systems, with and without pre-treatment. The study has involved coatings exposure in 7 <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and different laboratory accelerated tests. It was completed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis, and adhesion, water up-take and electrochemical measurements. It has been concluded that water-borne acrylic paint systems incorporating primers pigmented with zinc phosphate and others show deficient behaviour in marine atmospheres, but better behaviour in industrial atmospheres. In marine atmospheres, water-borne epoxy paint systems, including zinc-rich primers, together with epoxy and epoxy-polyurethane high-solids paint systems, present the most efficient anti-corrosive behaviour. The coatings obtained with epoxy and epoxy-polyester powder paints only show good behaviour, when applied on an adequate pre-treatment, in atmospheres of low to medium corrosivity category (C 2 -C 3). Finally, the best correlation was observed between the results of natural exposure in marine atmospheres, salt spray and water up-take measurements. It was not possible to verify good correlation between natural exposure and prohesion, adhesion and electrochemical tests. The latter are highly sensitive to the chemical nature of coatings, and seem to be significantly more useful when comparing coatings with more identical nature. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2001.

40|$|Photochemical {{aspects of}} low ozone levels {{observed}} in the marine atmospheric boundary layers are discussed. It is suggested by using photochemical box model that catalytic loss of ozone involving iodine radical of biogenic origin {{is one of the}} primary causes of observed levels of ozone. Estimated iodine cycle is so effective that the seasonal variations in ozone in the lower troposphere over the ocean might be quite largely affected by the local sources of oraganic iodine compounds. To test the above hypotheses, observational evidences of anti-correlation relationships in the concentraions between ozone and iodine compounds would be required. It is also important to more investigate organic iodine burden in the <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and oceans...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} solventborne paint systems applied on carbon steel and hot-dip galvanized steel {{in a wide range}} of atmospheric exposures. The study has involved paint systems exposure for 3. 5 years in eight <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> The atmospheric conditions cover from temperate rural climates to tropical severe marine and Antarctic coastal regions. The paint systems included several alkyds formulated with a variety of pigments (anticorrosive and barrier), epoxies, chlorinated rubber, and zinc-rich (ethyl silicate and epoxy). It has been concluded that in rural and urban atmospheres alkyd systems afford equivalent anticorrosive protection of steel to the epoxy/polyurethane system. The toxic red lead pigment may be replaced in long linseed-oil alkyd primer paints by non-toxic pigments, such as a mixture of micaceous iron oxides (MIO) and black iron oxides or zinc phosphate, without affecting the anticorrosive properties of the paint system. In aggressive atmospheres (industrial, marine), paint systems including zinc-rich primers or applied on galvanized steel must be used, especially in surface regions with coating faults (scribes).

40|$|The {{effect of}} an abrupt {{change in the}} {{relative}} humidity on the viability of airborne Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been examined. When the microbial aerosols were permitted to equilibrate in air held at either low or high humidities and were then subjected to a sudden shift to a mid-range humidity, a significant loss (> 90 %) of the colony-forming units per liter of aerosol occurred within 8 min. In contrast, {{a change in the}} relative humidity of more than 18 % in either direction from a lethal mid-range humidity noticeably decreased the rate of biological decay. Double humidity shifts (i. e., from dry to a mid-range level and then to a high humidity range) were very detrimental, with very few survivors after 8 min. These results indicate that the biological stability of airborne M. pneumoniae may be easily modified by a sudden change in the relative humidity, such as occurs in <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres.</b> This increased sensitivity brought about by producing changes in relative humidity through the lethal humidity range may provide a method whereby the control of these organisms in naturally contaminated indoor air environments may be eventually achieved...|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} some of {{the main}} results obtained in different marine atmospheres by Working Groups 1 and 2 (dedicated to anticorrosive protection of steel by paint coatings) of the Ibero-American PATINA network, developed {{in the context of the}} CYTED Programme. As marine <b>atmospheres</b> it includes <b>natural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> with a salinity level above S 1 classification of ISO standard 9223 (> 3 mg Cl- m- 2 day- 1), and sulphur dioxide contamination only up to classification P 1 of the same standard (maximum of 35 mg SO 2 m- 2 day- 1). Consideration is also made of accelerated tests traditionally used to assess the anticorrosive behaviour of the substrate/paint coatings contemplated in the study, namely salt spray, artificial weathering and different cycles involving ultraviolet radiation, humidity, temperature and different contamination conditions. The substrates were steel, hot-dip galvanised steel and electrogalvanised steel (Zincorr® sheet). The paint systems applied on these substrates, with or without pretreatments, were solventborne, waterborne, high solid and powder paint systems. As a result it has been possible to conclude which of the studied anticorrosive coating types were the most suitable for each of the different types of marine atmospheres considered in the study. © 2006 Elsevier B.
