5000|$|Electric {{starting}} {{is available}} for small engines and is found primarily on high-feature garden machinery and larger generators particularly where {{there is already a}} complex electrical system and there may be a need for auto-starting on demand. However, a self-retracting rope-pull mechanism called a recoil starter is the predominant method of starting small engines; it does not require a battery to power a starter motor, nor an alternator to keep a battery charged. Before the invention of the recoil starter, a <b>notched</b> <b>pulley</b> was attached to the engine's flywheel; the operator would manually wind a rope around the pulley then jerk the rope to rotate the engine so that it would start. Another starting method briefly popular in the 1960s was the [...] "impulse" [...] or [...] "wind-up" [...] starter. These were operated by winding a heavy spring by means of a rotating crank handle equipped with a sprag clutch, then releasing the spring's tension by means of a lever or knob so that it would spin the engine. These were discontinued when safety problems became apparent: it was possible to leave the starter wound up and ready to start the engine unintentionally, even long after the crank was wound up, if the release were jarred.|$|E
