50|$|Badminton {{shoes are}} {{lightweight}} with soles of rubber or similar high-grip, <b>non-marking</b> materials.|$|E
50|$|Boat {{shoes are}} used by sailors, as the name suggests; however, since the 1970s they have become casual {{footwear}} in coastal areas of the United States, Canada, Argentina, Australia, China, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Some boat shoes today have traditional white, <b>non-marking</b> soles, though many others today have dark <b>non-marking</b> soles. They usually have a moc-toe (like a moccasin) construction.|$|E
50|$|The HypervenomX Proximo has {{the exact}} same upper as the Hypervenom Phantom II. The only {{difference}} is use of a <b>non-marking</b> rubber sole for traction on indoor or turf courts.|$|E
5000|$|To store {{information}} onto a physical surface, the data must {{be transformed into}} a series of marks, using a modulation code. The codes used in most optical disc systems are binary, meaning that resulting surface has only two states: marks and <b>non-marks.</b> The following figure illustrates the EFM code used in CDs and DVDs: ...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the lack}} of central door locking and Mark 1 stock not meeting the latest rolling stock safety {{expectations}} various rules now (...) govern their usage. In particular vehicles lacking central door locking require a steward to be present in each vehicle. Train companies are also recommended to run Mark 1 stock with more robust <b>non-Mark</b> 1 stock at either end to act as a barrier in the case of collisions.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of railtour {{companies}} have waivers to operate Mark 1 carriage stock on railtour duties. The conditions usually involve the fitting of central door locking and having either a non-passenger or <b>non-Mark</b> 1 carriage {{at the ends of}} the train. This is often achieved by running with a locomotive {{at each end of the}} train, instead of just at the front, which also reduces the need to run-round at minor terminus stations, many of which lost their run-round facilities when locomotive hauled trains of Mk1 or Mk2 coaches gave way to multiple unit operation on service trains.|$|R
5000|$|The ball. For leagues {{that play}} on hardwood, {{the ball is}} {{generally}} covered with suede or a similar <b>non-marking</b> covering. The harder surface generally makes the ball [...] "bouncier" [...] {{and more difficult to}} control, which in turn tends to make scoring goals more complicated.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{restrictions}} {{on the type of}} mobility assisting equipment used by wheelchair competitors except that it cannot interfere with the movement of the other player. Players in wheelchair classes may chose to compete with roller bars attached to their chair, or have <b>non-marking</b> tires positioned under their footrest.|$|E
50|$|Boat shoes (also {{known as}} deck shoes) are {{typically}} canvas or leather with <b>non-marking</b> rubber soles {{designed for use}} on a boat. A siping pattern is cut into the soles to provide grip on a wet deck; the leather construction, along with the application of oil, is designed to repel water; and the stitching is highly durable. Boat shoes are traditionally worn without socks.|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) During {{the past}} decade the optical disc has become {{increasingly}} popular. Write-once optical recording systems will mainly be used in data storage systems in which archival aspects or mass storage requirements prevail. In write-once optical data storage one is faced with an asymmetry between marks and <b>non-marks</b> due to a practical lower limit of the mark size. In some optical fibre communications {{there is also an}} asymmetry present in injection lasers and it may be feasible to use asymmetrical codes. In this study information theoretical methods are used to find values of channel capacity for sequences complying with binary asymmetrical runlength constraints. Different coding methods are used to construct encoders and decoders for generating and decoding these sequences with high values of efficiency. The power spectra of maxentropic binary asymmetrical runlength limited sequences complying with different runlength constraints are also investigated...|$|R
5000|$|All {{students}} are required to wear full uniform at all times excluding special occasions. Inside the school building, outerwear is not permitted to be worn over the uniform. The female uniform consists of a plaid kilt, Oxford white crested shirt, navy crested pullover, navy socks, and black shoes. The male uniform consists of twill navy pants, Oxford white crested shirt, navy crested pullover, navy socks, and black shoes. The P.E. uniform consists of shorts, T-shirt, and <b>non-marking</b> running shoes.|$|E
5000|$|Most contra dances do {{not have}} a strict dress code. [...] No special outfits are worn, but {{comfortable}} and loose-fitting clothing that does not restrict movement is usually recommended. [...] Lightweight skirts are often worn, at some dances by men as well as women, as these have a very pretty effect when swinging or twirling. [...] However, low, broken-in, soft-soled, <b>non-marking</b> shoes, such as dance shoes, sneakers, or sandals, are recommended and, in some places, required. [...] As dancing can be aerobic, dancers are sometimes encouraged to bring a change of clothes.|$|E
50|$|When {{the shoe}} was introduced, {{it was the}} first low-top {{basketball}} shoe to feature an all-leather upper and the now famous rubber shelltoe. With its rubber toe protection and <b>non-marking</b> sole, the shoe caught the attention of some of the best players from the NCAA and NBA, most notably Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Within {{the first few years of}} its introduction, the Superstar was being worn by over 75% of all NBA players; proof of its revolutionary technology which remains today. Over the course of the next few years, it would advance from the court to the streets and, consequently, further into the public's consciousness.|$|E
40|$|Failing to mark {{patented}} articles as such could limit {{damages in}} an infringement suit. But {{the current state}} of marking law includes a meaningless distinction between marking requirements for patented articles and marking requirements for articles that are associated with patented methods. This differential treatment creates loopholes for avoiding the consequences of <b>non-marking</b> and degrades the policy objective of requiring marking—providing notice. Congress should act to ensure that patent owners cannot skirt their duty to the public by selecting to associate an inventive article with method patents or claims. Although similar critique has been issued in the past, the continued use of loopholes and conflicting precedent render the issue pertinent today. This Comment surveys the relevant interpretations of the marking statute, the loopholing techniques available to creative patentees, and advocates for a change in the law...|$|E
40|$|The sports ball {{market is}} a multi-million dollar industry; {{original}} equipment manufacturers are continually trying to develop sports balls {{and in order to}} achieve improvement in performance they often utilize launch and/or flight monitors to allow consistent measurement and benchmarking of their balls under test. This paper introduces a laser tracking system (LTS), which has been specifically designed for soccer ball tracking. This LTS combines two different concepts together in an innovative optical solution to allow the system to track an arbitrarily moving soccer ball in a completely non-contact and <b>non-marking</b> methodology, tracking a ball in real time up to approximately 10 [*]m/s. The system was programmed to act as a launch monitor capable of reporting the ball launch velocity and launch angle. In order to achieve the fully functional LTS, the hardware and software choices are clearly outlined, as well as describing the tracking methodology used to achieve the real-time tracking capability...|$|E
40|$|We present Mark-It, a marking user {{interface}} that reduced {{the time to}} decompose a set of CAD models exhibiting a range of decomposition problems {{by as much as}} fifty percent. Instead of performing about 50 mesh decomposition operations using a conventional UI, Mark-It allows users to perform the same operations by drawing 2 D marks {{in the context of the}} 3 D model. The motivation for this study was to test the potential of a marking {{user interface}} for the decomposition aspect of the meshing process. To evaluate Mark-It, we designed a user study that consisted of a brief tutorial of both the <b>non-marking</b> and marking UIs, performing the steps to decompose four models contributed to us by experienced meshers at Sandia National Laboratories, and a post-study debriefing to rate the speed, preference, and overall learnability of the two interfaces. Our primary contributions are a practical user interface design for speeding-up mesh decomposition and an evaluation that helps characterize the pros and cons of the new user interface. Keywords: meshing, decomposition, marking user interface, gestural commands, time-to-mesh, postWIMP 1...|$|E
40|$|Lane detections and {{tracking}} are crucial stages {{for a great}} number of Advance Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), for instance for road lane following or robust ego localization. In these applications, the most important module is probably the lane marking primitives extraction algorithm. Since several decades, a lot of approaches have been proposed in order to achieve this task. Unfortunately, it is yet difficult to guarantee robust results from these extraction algorithms in case of bad weather conditions, degraded lane markings, or due to intrinsic limitations of cameras. In this paper we propose an approach in order {{to improve the quality of}} the lane marking extraction. By extraction, we mean the classification of the image pixels into two classes: marking and <b>non-marking.</b> The extraction is generally the first step of a marking detection system, so its efficiency has a strong impact on the performances of the whole system. The proposed algorithm is based on the combination of two different extraction algorithms. In order to validate the quality of this work, some tests and evaluations are provided and allow to prove the efficiency of such an approach. The evaluation is performed on camera images and then on synthetic images. The results with camera and synthetic images are compared and discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUp until quite recently, {{research}} on Iranian languages {{tended to be}} conducted in rather distinct disciplines, often with little interaction among them. A major turning point in bringing scholars from all theoretical persuasions together was the “First International Conference on Iranian Linguistics”, held in June 2005 at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. It inaugurated a tradition of interdisciplinary linguistic {{research on}} Iranian languages that we are proud {{to continue with the}} present volume. The 13 chapters of this volume represent a selection of the papers presented at the “Third International Conference on Iranian Linguistics”, held in September 2009 at the Université Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris. Part one, historical and comparative Iranian syntax, contains chapters by Saloumeh Gholami, Nicholas Sims-Williams, Antje Wendtland, Agnes Korn, and Arseniy Vydrin. The first three contributions treat the morpho-syntax of two extinct East Iranian languages, revealing a fruitful and innovative synthesis of philological investigations with insights from syntactic typology. Korn’s chapter covers both synchronic and diachronic aspects of a typologically unusual development in a broad range of Iranian languages, while Vydrin’s chapter surveys the expression of counterfactuality within Iranian from a largely synchronic perspective, but informed with areal-typological explanations. Part two, the morpho-syntax of lesser-know Iranian languages, contains contributions by Daniel Paul, Gregory Stump and Andrew Hippisley, and two joint contributions, Oleg Belaev and Arseniy Vydrin, and David Erschler and Vitaly Volk. They reflect a growing interest in the “smaller” Iranian languages, not only as a source for comparative and historical Iranian philology, but also for the insights they offer for general linguistic theory. Part three, the linguistics of Modern Persian, presents new insights on aspects of Modern Persian. Naderi and Oostendorp’s contribution presents an OT-based re-assessment of epenthetic consonants, while Ganjavi revisits the issue of marking vs. <b>non-marking</b> of direct objects. Pirooz looks at control in finite subordinate clauses, while Deravi and Dommergues present the results of an empirical investigation of code-switching by highly proficient Persian-French bilinguals. Taken together, these contributions represent the dynamic and rapidly growing nature of Iranian linguistics, a field which has united linguists of all persuasions who share a strong commitment to the scientific investigation of Iranian languages, their structure, history and use...|$|E
40|$|A high {{incidence}} of road accidents has been recorded in Saudi Arabia in recent years (Traffic Department Statistics 1991). Various factors might have accounted for this high rate of road accidents; {{the aim of this}} research, therefore, was to examine what factors contribute to road accidents in the country. In pursuit of this aim, a review of relevant literature on factors related with road accidents in many countries of the world was undertaken. Through this review, a list of road, vehicle and driver-related variables was selected for investigation in this study. The target population for the study was 4, 100 drivers in Eastern Saudi Arabia who had been involved in road accidents in the period. Out of this population, a sample of 600 drivers was selected. The instrument used to collect data for the study was a questionnaire which requested demographic information on factors which had caused them to have an accident, and questions analysing habitual driving behaviour. Drivers were also tested on their knowledge of road signs. Returns were received from 484 drivers, 81 % of the study sample. Two statistical techniques, chi square and correlation coefficient Spearman Brown formula, were utilised to test the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable - the number of road accidents. The findings of the study show that certain variables were significantly associated with road accidents in Saudi Arabia. Among the significant variables were the age of the driver, education level, profession, violation record, vehicle ownership, joy-riding, poor eye sight, sun haze, sand storm, long hours driving, non-observance of speed limit, emerging and exiting from roads without signals, presence of stray animals, <b>non-marking</b> of the road, non-familiarity with the road, lack of regular checking of vehicles, lack of regular servicing of vehicles and driving under medication. The variables that were not significant include marital status, non-possession of a licence, mechanical fault, reversing, non-alertness to others' errors, use of high beam lights while driving, non-lighting of the roads, passengers' behaviour, ear disorder. Conclusions were drawn as to deficiencies in driver training in Saudi Arabia and inadequacies of supervision by the law enforcement agents. It is recommended that policy makers should make intensive efforts in organising training programmes and seminars for drivers and curriculum of driving schools should be expanded. Measures for improving enforcement of traffic regulations are made, and it is suggested that an Islamic insurance policy for vehicles should be introduced in the country. Finally, suggestions are made for further research...|$|E
