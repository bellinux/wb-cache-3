25|$|The {{environmentally}} ubiquitous L-alanine derivative, β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) {{has long}} {{been identified as a}} neurotoxin which was first associated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism–dementia complex (ALS/PDC) in the Chamorro people of Guam. The widespread occurrence of BMAA can be attributed to cyanobacteria which produce BMAA as a result of complex reactions under nitrogen stress. Following research, excitotoxicity appears to be the likely mode of action for BMAA which acts as a glutamate agonist, activating AMPA and NMDA receptors and causing damage to cells even at relatively low concentrations of 10 μM. The subsequent uncontrolled influx of Ca2+ then leads to the pathophysiology described above. Further evidence of the role of BMAA as an excitotoxin is rooted in the ability of NMDA antagonists like MK801 to block the action of BMAA. More recently, evidence has been found that BMAA is misincorporated in place of L-serine in human proteins. It should be noted that a considerable portion of the research relating to the toxicity of BMAA has been conducted on rodents. A study published in 2016 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 gene (a condition which in humans is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease), found that vervets orally administered BMAA developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer's Disease including amyloid beta plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have correlative decreases in these pathology features.This study demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease {{as a result of a}} gene/environment interaction. While BMAA has been detected in brain tissue of deceased ALS/PDC patients, further insight is required to trace neurodegenerative pathology in humans to BMAA.|$|E

40|$|Heparan sulfate {{proteoglycans}} (HSPGs) {{have been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in the formation and persistence of senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> in dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT). We performed a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of the HSPGs agrin, perlecan, glypican- 1, and syndecans 1 – 3 in the lesions of DAT brain neocortex and hippocampus. Using a panel of specific antibodies directed against the protein backbone of the various HSPG species and against the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side-chains, we demonstrated the following. The basement membrane-associated HSPG, agrin, is widely expressed in senile plaques, <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> and cerebral blood vessels, whereas the expression of the other basement membrane-associated HSPG, perlecan, is lacking in senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> and is restricted to the cerebral vasculature. Glypican and three different syndecans, all cell membrane-associated HSPG species, are also expressed in senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> albeit at a lower frequency than agrin. Heparan sulfate GAG side chains are also associated with both senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> Our results suggest that glycosaminoglycan side chains of the HSPGs agrin, syndecan, and glypican, but not perlecan, may play an important role in the formation of both senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> In addition, we speculate that agrin, because it contains nine protease-inhibiting domains, may protect the protein aggregates in senile plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> against extracellular proteolytic degradation, leading to the persistence of these deposits...|$|R
50|$|A {{recent study}} looked for {{correlation}} between the quantitative aspects of Alzheimer's disease (neuron loss, neuritic plaque and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> load) and aggression frequently found in Alzheimer's patients. It was found that only an increase in <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> load was associated with severity of aggression and chronic aggression in Alzheimer's patients. While this study does indicate a correlation between NFT load and severity of aggression, it {{does not provide a}} causative argument.|$|E

50|$|Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} condition {{characterized by}} two hallmarks: senile plaques and the <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle.</b> Senile plaques are extracellular aggregations of amyloid-b (Aβ) protein. Neuroﬁbrillary tangles are collections of hyperphosphorylated tau protein associated with microtubules found within neurons. Senile plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles are widespread throughout brain tissue and mirror other pathological changes associated with AD.|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by the presence of 2 neuropathological lesions: <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> composed of tau proteins which are highly phosphorylated and phosphorylated on uncommon sites, and amyloid plaques, containing the Aß peptides generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Reduction of some APP proteolytic derivatives in Alzheimer's disease such as sAPPα fragment has been reported and sAPPα has been shown to affect tau phosphorylation. To investigate in vivo the effect of absence of APP protein and its fragments on tau phosphorylation and the formation of <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> we have generated mice deleted for APP gene and overexpressing a human mutant tau protein and developing <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> (APPKOTg 30 mice). These APPKOTg 30 mice showed more severe motor and cognitive deficits, increased tau phosphorylation, increased load of <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> and increased p 25 / 35 ratio in the brain, compared with Tg 30 mice. These data suggest that APP and/or its proteolytic derivatives interfere with the formation of <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> in a transgenic mouse model that will be useful for investigating the relationship between APP and tau.

Additionally, neocortical NFT frequency in the AD+DLB group tended to parallel the severity of other types of tau cytopathology.|$|E
50|$|Staging in Alzheimer's {{disease was}} {{described}} by Braak in 1991. Braak stages I and II are used when <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain, stages III and IV when there is also involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and V and VI when there is extensive neocortical involvement. This {{should not be confused}} with the degree of senile plaque involvement, which progresses differently.|$|E
50|$|A study {{performed}} in 2015 with vervets (Chlorocebus sabaeus) in St. Kitts, which are homozygous for the apoE4 gene (a condition which in humans {{is a risk}} factor for Alzheimer's disease), found that vervets orally administered BMAA developed hallmark histopathology features of Alzheimer's Disease including amyloid beta plaques and <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> accumulation. Vervets in the trial fed smaller doses of BMAA were found to have correlative decreases in these pathology features. Additionally, vervets that were co-administered BMAA with serine were found to have 70% less beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles than those administered BMAA alone, suggesting that serine may be protective against the neurotoxic effects of BMAA. This experiment represents the first in-vivo model of Alzheimer's Disease that features both beta-amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau protein. This study also demonstrates that BMAA, an environmental toxin, can trigger neurodegenerative disease {{as a result of a}} gene/environment interaction.|$|E
40|$|In Alzheimer disease, {{neuronal}} degeneration {{and the presence}} of <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> correlate with the severity of cognitive decline. <b>Neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> contain the antigenic profile of many cell cycle markers, reflecting a re-entry into the cell cycle by affected neurons. However, while such a cell cycle re-entry phenotype is an early and consistent feature of Alzheimer disease, the mechanisms responsible for neuronal cell cycle are unclear. In this regard, given that a dysregulated cell cycle is a characteristic of cancer, we speculated that alterations in oncogenic proteins {{may play a role in}} neurodegeneration. To this end, in this study, we examined brain tissue from cases of Alzheimer disease for the presence of BRCA 1, a known regulator of cell cycle, and found intense and specific localization of BRCA 1 to <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> a hallmark lesion of the disease. Analysis of clinically normal aged brain tissue revealed systematically less BRCA 1, and surprisingly in many cases with apparent phosphorylated tau-positive <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> BRCA 1 was absent, yet BRCA 1 was present in all cases of Alzheimer disease.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{nature of}} <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was studied by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence techniques. Five antiserums, including anti-humanbrain- 2 -cycle-purified-microtubule-fractions (2 × MT), anti-calf-brain- 2 × MT, anti-sea-urchin-egg-tubulin, antibeef-brain-tubulin, and anti-human-brain-neurofilament(NF) - 210 -kilodalton(kd) -protein were tested for their binding to <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> The antihuman- 2 × MT serum stained structures resembling <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles,</b> neurites of neuritic plaques, and microglialike cells in SDAT brains, but no such staining pattern was detected in normal brain sections. In neurons isolated from SDAT brains, about 40 % of the tangles were labeled by the anti-human- 2 ×MT serum with an identical pattern. Other antiserums tested did not preferentially bind tanglelike structures in tissue sections and bound {{to less than}} 5 % of the tangles in isolated neurons. These {{results suggest that the}} antigenic sites of tubulin and NF proteins are not shared by <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> Different from the calf preparation, the human- 2 × MT fractions contained a prominent protein band that was identical to ferritin in molecular weight and cross-reacted with anti-human- 2 × MT and anti-human-ferritin serums. However, antiserums to this ferritinlike protein, or anti-ferritin, did not stain <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> Although neither the calf 2 × MT nor two other human MT fractions failed to elicit an antiserum that stained tangles, these fractions were able to remove the antihuman- 2 × MT serum activity that binds to tangles.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most of the neuropathological {{studies in}} brain aging {{were based on}} the {{assumption}} of a symmetrical right-left hemisphere distribution of both Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology. To explore the impact of asymmetrical lesion formation on cognition, we performed a clinicopathological analysis of 153 cases with mixed pathology except macroinfarcts. METHODS: Cognitive status was assessed prospectively using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale; neuropathological evaluation included assessment of Braak <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> and Ass deposition staging, microvascular pathology, and lacunes. The right-left hemisphere differences in neuropathological scores were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The relationship between the interhemispheric distribution of lesions and Clinical Dementia Rating scores was assessed using ordered logistic regression. RESULTS: Unlike Braak <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> and Ass deposition staging, vascular scores were significantly higher in the left hemisphere for all Clinical Dementia Rating scores. A negative relationship was found between Braak <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle,</b> but not Ass staging, and vascular scores in cases with moderate to severe dementia. In both hemispheres, Braak <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> staging was the main determinant of cognitive decline followed by vascular scores and Ass deposition staging. The concomitant predominance of Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology in the right hemisphere was associated with significantly higher Clinical Dementia Rating scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the cognitive impact of Alzheimer disease and vascular lesions in mixed cases may be assessed unilaterally without major information loss. However, interhemispheric differences and, in particular, increased vascular and Alzheimer disease burden in the right hemisphere may increase the risk for dementia in this group...|$|E
40|$|The major intracytoplasmic lesion of Alzheimer’s {{disease is}} the <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> (NFT), which is {{primarily}} composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs).

40|$|<b>Neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> and {{senile plaques}} are the {{principal}} pathological features of Alzheimer disease. <b>Neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles</b> and the neurites of senile plaques contain paired helical filaments (PHF) that consist of two 10 -nm filaments twisted into a double helix. The precursor proteins of PHF are not fully known. To identify these precursors, numerous immunochemical studies {{have been carried out}} during the past decade. Two apparently conflicting results have been reported. (i) Some, but not all, monoclonal antibodies to neurofilaments stained <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> (ii) Polyclonal antibodies prepared to PHF purified in NaDodSO 4 because of their unusual insolubility did not recognize normal proteins, including neurofilaments, on electrophoretic transfer blots of human brain homogenates.

Recently, we reported that polyclonal PHF antibodies include antibodies to tau proteins, a family of heat-stable microtubule-associated phosphoproteins, and that antibodies to tau stain Alzheimer <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangles.</b> Those monoclonal neurofilament antibodies that recognize tangles are reported to be directed against phosphorylated epitopes.

40|$|The amyloid cascade {{hypothesis}} of Alzheimer’s disease postulates that accumulation of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) precedes <b>neurofibrillary</b> <b>tangle</b> formation or neuronal {{loss in the}} cortex. Although this temporal profile has been proved in the neocortex by silver staining and immunocytochemical methods, CA 1 of the hippocampus exhibits a distinct temporal profile during normal aging: the formation of neurofibrillary tangles precedes senile plaque formation. This temporal profile has been further confirmed by two-site enzyme immunoassay (EIA) quantitation of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -dissociable Aβ 42; neurofibrillary tangles are already present despite undetectable levels of SDS-dissociable Aβ 42. However, when the same specimens were subjected to Western blotting, many cases with or without neurofibrillary tangles showed some accumulation of SDS-stable Aβ dimers that cannot be detected by EIA.
