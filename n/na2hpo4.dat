50|$|Disodium {{phosphate}} (DSP), or {{sodium hydrogen}} phosphate, is the inorganic compound with the formula <b>Na2HPO4.</b> It {{is one of}} several sodium phosphates. The salt is known in anhydrous form as well as forms with 2, 7, 8, and 12 hydrates. All are water-soluble white powders; the anhydrous salt being hygroscopic.|$|E
50|$|Isolation of the FeMo {{cofactor}} from nitrogenase is {{done through}} centrifugal sedimentation of nitrogenase into the MoFe protein and the Fe protein. The FeMo cofactor is extracted by treating the MoFe protein with acids5. The first extraction {{is done with}} N,N-dimethylformamide and the second by a mixture of N-methylformamide and <b>Na2HPO4</b> before final sedimentation by centrifugation.|$|E
5000|$|Acid salt is a {{class of}} salts formed by the partial {{neutralization}} of diprotic or polyprotic acids. Because the parent acid is only partially neutralized, one or more replaceable hydrogen atoms remain. Typical acid salts have one or more alkali (alkaline) metal ions {{as well as one}} or more hydrogen atoms. Well known examples are sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4), monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), and disodium phosphate (<b>Na2HPO4).</b> Often acid salts are used as buffers.|$|E
5000|$|Polymeric sodium {{phosphates}} are formed upon heating mixtures of NaH2PO4 and <b>Na2HPO4,</b> which induces a condensation reaction. The specific polyphosphate generated {{depends on the}} details of the heating and annealling. One derivative is the glassy (i.e., amorphous) Graham's salt. Crystalline high molecular weight polyphosphates include Kurrol's salt and Maddrell's salt (CAS#10361-03-2). These species have the formula NaPO3nNaPO3(OH)2 where n can be as great as 2000. In terms of their structures, these polymers consist of PO3− [...] "monomers", with the chains are terminated by protonated phosphates.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{addition}} of salts or nucleoside triphosphates to histone IV solutions induces conformational {{changes in the}} histone molecule. These conformational changes are investigated by measurement of the fluorescence anisotropy of the histone tyrosine emission, the circular dichroism (CD) of the peptide bond and of the tyrosine CD. Changes induced by <b>Na₂HPO₄,</b> NaH₂PO₄, Na₂SO₄, NaCl 0 ₄, NaCl, MgCl₂, NaF, ADP, ATP, GTP, CTP and. TTP are investigated. Salt induced conformational changes are separated into two steps which occur on vastly different time scales. There is a change which is very fast and recorded simply as a rise. At sufficiently high salt concentration the fast change {{is followed by a}} slower one which takes minutes to hours depending on solution conditions. CD results demonstrate that a-helix formation accompanies the fast step. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicate that other conformational folding, to which the CD is insensitive, and histone dimerization also occur in the fast step. Equations are developed for a quantitative comparison of the salts studied. The slow step is found to be highly co-operative having a sharp onset at a given salt concentration followed by a steep rise to a maximum. CD spectra and kinetic CD measurements demonstrate that the slow step involves intermolecular β-sheet formation. Both static and kinetic measurements indicate that {{there is more than one}} process occurring in the slow step. Nucleoside triphosphates induce conformational changes at nucleotide concentrations which are of the same order of magnitude as the histone concentration. ATP and GTP interact with histone IV so strongly that plots of fractional conformational change versus nucleotide/histone are indistinguishable over a four fold range of histone concentrations. CTP and TTP are less effective but are at least two orders of magnitude more effective than any of the inorganic salts studied...|$|E
