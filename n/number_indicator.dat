5000|$|The Daegu subway fire {{compelled}} Korail {{to introduce}} flame-resistant interiors for passenger safety. As a result, from 2004, the 2nd batch trains (except 1-53, 1-57, 1-63, and 1-65) and 3rd batch trains were overhauled with fire-retardant interiors. SLS overhauled {{some of the}} 1st batch cars, most of the 2nd batch trains and a few 3rd batch cars. Meanwhile, Rowin overhauled 2nd batch trains 1-62, 1-64, and all other 3rd batch cars. The original Mylar roll film front destination signs, side destination signs, and run <b>number</b> <b>indicators</b> were replaced with LED displays (trains 1-42~1-48 received LCD run <b>number</b> <b>indicators).</b> All trains received the new Korail livery.|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} pays {{interest on}} the bond (1.25% per year as at July 2016). Interest is paid into a fund from which a monthly lottery distributes tax-free prizes to bondholders whose numbers are selected randomly. The machine that generates numbers is ERNIE, for Electronic Random <b>Number</b> <b>Indicator</b> Equipment. Prizes range from £25 to £1,000,000. Between 2005 and 2009, there were two £1m prizes each month and the minimum prize was £50, but prizes were reduced after the 2009 drop in interest rates. A second £1m prize was reintroduced in August 2014.|$|E

The aim of the bank was to allow ordinary workers a facility [...] "to provide for themselves against adversity and ill-health", and to provide the government with access to debt funding. As an example, savings certificates were issued in World Wars I and II to help finance the war effort.

40|$|Abstract. Results of {{differential}} scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies of Se 85 Te 15 –xPbx (x = 4, 6, 8 and 10) glasses have been reported and discussed in this paper. The results have been analyzed {{on the basis of}} struc-tural relaxation equation, Matusita’s equation and modified Kissinger’s equation. The activation energies of structural relaxation lie in between 226 and 593 kJ/mol. The crystallization growth is found to be one-dimensional for all compositions. The activation energies of crystallization are found to be 100 – 136 kJ/mol by Matusita’s equation while 102 – 139 kJ/mol by modified Kissinger’s equation. The Hruby <b>number</b> (<b>indicator</b> of ease of glass forming and higher stability) is the highest for Se 85 Te 9 Pb 6 glass while S factor (indicator of resis-tance to devitrification) is highest for Se 85 T 7 Pb 8 glass at all heating rates in our experiment. Further the highest resistance to devitrification has the highest value of structural activation energy and the activation energy of crystallization is maximum for the most stable glass by both Matusita’s equation and the modified Kissinger’s equation...|$|E

40|$|It is wide the {{discussion}} involving {{the importance of}} production adjustment activities in general, {{to the concept of}} sustainable development. Among the agricultural activities, the agroforestry systems have been considered sustainable, coming as alternatives to the intensive systems of agricultural production. To monitor the sustainability of agricultural activities, includings AF, the literature emphasizes the biophysical indicators, in detriment of the socioeconomical ones. Seeking to define a list of socio-economical indicators that can be adapted to the several models recommendations of AF a study was developed, supported by specialists and technicians and wide literature review. The conclusions were: the categories related to the operation of the systems had the largest <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> in the socioeconômic component, with larger concentration in the endogenous operations of the system, followed by the endogenous and exogenous resources; the largest <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> suggested in the category operation of the system was in the descriptors health and nutrition, employment, habitation and sanity and economic analysis; in the category operation of exogenous systems, there were certain larger <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> for the descriptors commercialization and rural infrastructure; practically there was no difference among the <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> obtained for the agroforestry systems with and without the animal component...|$|R
40|$|To {{research}} any phenomenon {{one has to}} find empirical {{indicators of}} it. If the research is to be thorough, the indicators mus be such as to test as many aspects as possible of the phenomenon studied. This {{does not mean that}} maximum <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> is necessary for a full study of the phenomenon. On the contrary, it is usually desirable to have a minimum <b>number</b> of <b>indicators.</b> However, it is imperative that the minimum <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> be such that they do not exclude any of the essential aspects of the phenomenon. If one or a few indicators are unable to capture the nature of the phenomenon, then it is logically imperative that more indicators be used. S metimes a battery of indicators may be necessary. The exact <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> should not be chosen either arbitrarily or on purely theoretical grounds, but should be selected as a conclusion of a thorough empirical study. The study should include a great variety of indicators and reduce the number to the minimum only as a consequence of empirical testing (Lazarsfeld and Henry, 1968). Ethnicity is a complex phenomenon.

40|$|Objective: Poor {{documentation}} following {{lumbar puncture}} (LP) {{had always been}} a matter of concern. This study aimed to investigate the documentation pattern of neurology house officers, registrars (Regs), and specialist Regs following LP in a major teaching hospital. Materials and Methods: Total hundred patient records were examined in the light of a carefully designed proforma containing 15 important indicators of good-quality LP documentation. Result: Mean <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> overall documented by doctors was found to be 6. 24 ± 3. 0037. The mean <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> recorded by house officers was 5. 11 ± 3. 01 and Regs was 7. 56 ± 3. 28. A total of 33 % LPs were performed without a documented consent.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of public policies aims {{to assess the}} usefulness and goodness of public intervention. The evaluation is usually done with indicators that measure the degree of achievement of the objectives planned, and the cultural management processes carried out by {{both public and private}} agents. For an indicator system to be effective, it is necessary to establish a strategic choice that meets two requirements: it should faithfully represent all the criteria of the decision maker and the <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> should not be very high. However, in many practical applications the <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> with which we work is usually high, thus it is not very operational. Therefore, to reduce the <b>number</b> of <b>indicators</b> is necessary to rank them so that choosing the first ones guarantees greater success according to different criteria.
