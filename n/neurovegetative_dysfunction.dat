40|$|A close {{correlation}} {{exists between}} the pathomechanism and localisation of calcareous bursitis and calcification of tendons and tendon sheaths. Recent descriptions emphasise this fact and give calcifying bursitis. tendinitis and paratendinitis the common name of periarthritis calcarea (Mark#{ 243 } 1956, B#{ 225 }nki 1964). Calcareous bursitis is frequently encountered in the shoulder region but it is rarely found elsewhere. Eufinger (1957) mentioned only the subdeltoid bursa as being affected. Hamilton (1951) described thirteen cases of bursitis under the name ofcalcinosis; in six ofhis cases the shoulder was affected; in the rest other parts were involved. Calcification ofa bursa is viewed by pathologists as a dystrophic process (Anderson 1961). Deposition of calcium-holding material in the wall and cavities of the bursa is preceded by regressive changes in the tissues. The oxygen supply and nutrition of {{the walls of the}} bursa decrease with an increase of their calcium-holding capacity. According to Rabb (1923) increased carbon dioxide saturation of damaged tissues leads to calcium deposition. This occurs most commonly in infective and degenerative conditions. Claessens and Faure (1963) divided bursitis into two major groups: post-traumatic and infective. Rheumatic bursitis belongs to the second group and includes cases in which bacterial infection cannot be proved. In the course of chronic inflammation the wall of the bursa thickens and in consequence of insufficient nutrition degenerative changes take place. Frequently inflammatory and degenerative changes are present simultaneously (Abbertini 1929). Para-articular calcification and ossification occur in neurotrophic disorders. Symmetrical bursitis (GUnther 1913, Holzweissig 1925) and bilateral tendon calcifications (Albertini 1929) suggest a possible neurological basis for the lesions. Exner (1957) regarded <b>neurovegetative</b> <b>dysfunction</b> as a cause of pathological calcification. Other authors too (Gaule 1895, Meye...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Evaluating {{patients}} who have had surgical management of acoustic neuroma has relied heavily on the surgeon's viewpoint for determining success. However, {{the perspective of the}} surgeon may be {{different from that of the}} patient. Thus, a recent increased interest in terms of quality of life has been documented by the literature on this specific topic essentially through the use of a questionnaire. The objective of this paper was to review this topic in our series of patients operated on for acoustic neuroma to ascertain the personal and social impact that surgery has had on their lifestyle. Design: This retrospective study was devoted to increasing statistics to provide more detailed and valid information during the counselling phase. Methods: This study was carried out on 82 {{patients who}} underwent surgery for acoustic neuroma between 1988 and 1997. Each patient was recalled and assessed for his/her postoperative quality of life. Detailed information was requested on the initial postoperative facial, vestibular, and hearing functions; their evolution; and their social consequence. Finally, at the end of the interview, each patient was invited to give a final comment on his/her opinion regarding the outcomes of surgery and preoperative information. Results: Facial function showed a grade I-III in 85. 4 % of cases, with postoperative <b>neurovegetative</b> <b>dysfunction</b> (taste and lacrimation) in 43 %. Audiologic abnormalities (worsening hearing and tinnitus) were complained of in 90 % and 57 % of the cases, respectively. Twenty-three percent of the patients had various degrees of gait instability; 6 % reported postoperative headache at 1 -year follow-up. Social consequence (reduced work ability, vocational change, new education, state pension, etc.) was not influenced by surgery in 80 %. Conclusions: Our experience is in general agreement with previously reported statistics. It is interesting to note that our patients exhibited more disturbances linked to the sensory component of facial nerve. In contrast, dysequilibrium had a less negative influence. These outcomes suggest the importance of thorough preoperative counselling in candidates for surgery for acoustic neuroma in order to motivate them and, at the same time, to reduce their psychological discomfort...|$|E
40|$|Costa-Silva JH, Zoccal DB, Machado BH. Chronic {{intermittent}} hypoxia alters glutamatergic {{control of}} sympathetic and respiratory {{activities in the}} commissural NTS of rats. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 302 : R 785 -R 793, 2012. First published December 28, 2011; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpregu. 00363. 2011. -Sympathetic overactivity and altered respiratory control are commonly observed after chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) exposure. However, the central mechanisms underlying such <b>neurovegetative</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> remain unclear. Herein, we hypothesized that CIH (6 % O- 2 every 9 min, 8 h/day, 10 days) in juvenile rats alters glutamatergic transmission in the commissural nucleus tractus solitarius (cNTS), a pivotal site for integration of peripheral chemoreceptor inputs. Using an in situ working heart-brain stem preparation, we found that L-glutamate microinjections (1, 3, and 10 mM) into the cNTS of control rats (n = 8) evoked increases in thoracic sympathetic nerve (tSN) and central vagus nerve (cVN) activities combined with inhibition of phrenic nerve (PN) activity. Besides, the ionotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonism with kynurenic acid (KYN; 250 mM) in the cNTS of control group (n = 7) increased PN burst duration and frequency. In the CIH group (n = 10), the magnitude of L-glutamate-induced cVN excitation was smaller, and the PN inhibitory response was blunted (P < 0. 05). In addition, KYN microinjections into the cNTS of CIH rats (n = 9) did not alter PN burst duration and produced smaller increases in its frequency compared with controls. Moreover, KYN microinjections into the cNTS attenuated the sympathoexcitatory response to peripheral chemoreflex activation in control but not in CIH rats (P < 0. 05). These functional CIH-induced alterations were accompanied by a significant 10 % increase of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 1 (NMDAR 1) and glutamate receptor 2 / 3 (GluR 2 / 3) receptor subunit density in the cNTS (n = 3 - 8, P < 0. 05), evaluated by Western blot analysis. These data indicate that glutamatergic transmission is altered in the cNTS of CIH rats and {{may contribute to the}} sympathetic and respiratory changes observed in this experimental model.
