40|$|A {{thesaurus}} may {{be viewed}} as a graph, and document retrieval algorithms can exploit this graph when both the documents and the query are represented by thesaurus terms. These retrieval algorithms measure the distance between the query and documents by using the path lengths in the graph. Previous work with such strategies has shown that the hierarchical relations in the thesaurus are useful but the non-hierarchical relations are not. This paper shows that when the query explicitly mentions a particular <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relation,</b> the retrieval algorithm benefits from the presence of such relations in the thesaurus. Our algorithms were applied to the Excerpta Medica bibliographic citation database whose citations are indexed with terms from the EMTREE thesaurus. We also created an enriched EMTREE by systematically adding non-hierarchical relations from a medical knowledge base. Our algorithms used at one time EMTREE and, at another time, the enriched EMTREE in the course of ranking documents from Excerpta Medica against queries. When, and only when, the query specifically mentioned a particular <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relation</b> type, did EMTREE enriched with that relation type lead to a ranking that better corresponded to an expert's ranking...|$|E

The Sri Lankan cum Sinhalese Buddhist state has since independence resisted all significant attempts by the Tamil political leadership at power sharing. Most constitutional lawyers and progressive Sri Lankan opinion (Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, etc.) hold that short of a separate state, administrative power should be devolved {{in the form of a}} federal state, so as to give autonomy to the northeast of Sri Lanka, while the forces of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism have sought to justify the centralized state by recourse to the history of Buddhism and the Sinhalese on the island. Such arguments have drawn on the ontological potential of the cosmic order of Sinhalese Buddhism, which is fundamentally hierarchical in intent. Here I argue that the diffused nature of this cosmic order provides the ontological grounding for a decentralized state structure that can accommodate ethnic difference in a <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relation.</b> Thus, the legacy of Sinhalese Buddhism can be rescued from the forces of Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism.

40|$|This thesis studies George Bataille’s oeuvre in {{the light}} of its {{relation}} to the social sciences. It demonstrates that Bataille aims at providing a theory of revolution, namely of the revolutionary subject, by elaborating a political jargon which is strongly rooted in French sociology. The first part of the thesis analyses the way in which, during the 1930 s, the notions of ‘the sacred’, ‘the heterogeneous’, ‘dépense’, ‘transgression’, ‘communication’ and ‘sovereignty’ progressively develop, differently crossing and overlapping. The second part focuses on the conceptual role played by science along this path, in order to explain Bataille’s re-elaboration of the ‘concepts’ and ‘facts’ provided by the social sciences. Finally, it is precisely by pinpointing the peculiar position of the subject of science that I have tried to interpret Bataille’s sovereign subject as a ‘revolting subject’. Beyond any possible attempt of prescribing a political use of Bataille’s thought, what emerges from my research is a practice of the subject, primarily of the political subject. The political subject is conceived as what cannot undergo a reduction to the category of utility. On the contrary, it is precisely through an obsessively repeated revolt against such a process of reduction that the political subject, as a single individual, can be involved in a <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relation</b> of communication ultimately irreducible to the existing state of things...|$|E
40|$|Premised on {{the fact}} that nothing ever does {{actually}} perish, this manuscript is an analysis of transformation, shaped through a variety of substances, objects, temporalities, qualities, metaphors, and phenomenological ways of being in the world—and being perceived in the world. I examine material objects undergoing various kinds of transformations and the people involved in those material metamorphoses, paying close attention to the intersections of humans and non-human objects in processes of change, stasis, temporal movement, and spatial organization. My research centers on the Roma minority in Bulgaria, markedly overrepresented in the waste labor sector, which has come to occupy the role of Europe’s “social waste. ” I denaturalize links between Roma and trash by focusing on waste in its discursive, metaphorical, historical, and material dimensions. I ask the simple and enduring question: how does change happen? Using waste as the conceptual connector, I explore transformation on three planes, which move in and out of each other. First, I look at transformation —of tangible things categorized as waste —into other categories of material, into money, into heat, into energy. Second, I look at waste transformations over time. I explore how Bulgaria changed both in terms of European Union harmonization procedures and reactive measures to those policies, from the socialist period through 2014. Third, I trace the possibilities of—and hindrances to—transformations of the humans dealing with waste. I see these three kinds of transformation—material, temporal, social—as ongoing projects in planar, <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relation</b> with each other. I highlight how material transformations of things (i. e. soda cans into money, trash bags into municipal heat) take shape as part of human-material processes that refuse, reject, and inhibit the changing social positions of those involved in such waste practices. Ultimately, I show that the utopian project of Europeanization—enmeshed within larger processes of electoral mobilization, capitalist development, neoliberal work regimes, environmental degradation, and unequal distributions of wealth and infrastructural access—is predicated on the categorical linkages of humans and things (i. e. waste and social trash) but, in practice, puts into stark relief differentials for transformation between humans and non-human objects...|$|E

This paper describes a bottom-up approach for automatically suggesting ontology link types. The presented method extracts verb vectors from semantic relations identified in the domain corpus, aggregates them by computing centroids for known relation types and stores the centroids in a central Knowledge Base (KB). Comparing verb vectors extracted from unknown relations with the stored centroids yields link-type suggestions. Domain experts evaluate these suggestions, refining the KB and constantly improving the components accuracy. Using four sample ontologies on ’energy sources’, this paper demonstrates how link-type suggestion aids the ontology design process.

40|$|To {{assume that}} dance {{as an art}} form is about {{creating}} and displaying sequences of movement in space is to undermine choreography’s potential as a way of thinking through movement. The interdisciplinary relations between philosophy and dance explored in this research introduce a framework for exploring new possibilities of thinking through choreographic practice. How can dance be perceived as thought, considered as an experimental process, where the articulation between practice and theory becomes fundamental? The cinematic reversal of the subordination of time to movement proposed by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze in his time-image concept offers a paradigmatic shift which has the potential to find profound resonance in the perception of movement in dance. This research explores how this shift informs a new perspective on choreography by discussing the implications of approaching choreographic composition through the lenses of Deleuze’s Pure Optical and Sound Image. As part of the practical choreographic investigation undertaken in this research, I have sought to challenge the conditions of the act of ‘seeing’ dance and to create an ‘opening condition’ for the use of choreography. To maintain an ‘open condition’ within the the practice of choreography, it is necessary to acknowledge the constant becoming of its materials that depend on <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> and on duration itself.

40|$|With the “social turn” of {{language}} {{in the past decade}} within English studies, ethnographic and teacher research methods increasingly have acquired legitimacy as a means of studying student literacy. And with this legitimacy, graduate students specializing in literacy and composition studies increasingly are being encouraged to use ethnographic and teacher research methods to study student literacy within classrooms. Yet few of the narratives produced from these studies discuss the problems that frequently arise when participant observers enter the classroom. Recently, some researchers have begun to interrogate the extent to which ethnographic and teacher research methods are able to construct and disseminate knowledge in empowering ways (Anderson 2 ̆ 6 Irvine, 1993; Bishop, 1993; Fine, 1994; Fleischer. 1994; McLaren, 1992). While ethnographic and teacher research methods have oftentimes been touted as being more democratic and nonhierarchical than quantitative methods—-which oftentimes erase individuals lived experiences with numbers and statistical formulas—-researchers are just beginning to probe the ways that ethnographic and teacher research models can also be silencing, unreflective, and oppressive. Those who have begun to question the ethics of conducting, writing about, and disseminating knowledge in education have coined the term “critical” research, a rather vague and loose term that proposes a position of reflexivity and self-critique for all research methods, not just ethnography or teacher research. Drawing upon theories of feminist consciousness-raising, liberatory praxis, and community-action research, theories of critical research aim to involve researchers and participants in a highly participatory framework for constructing knowledge, an inquiry that seeks to question, disrupt, or intervene in the conditions under study for some socially transformative end. While critical research methods are always contingent upon the context being studied, in general they are undergirded by principles of <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relations,</b> participatory collaboration, problem-posing, dialogic inquiry, and multiple and multi-voiced interpretations. In distinguishing between critical and traditional ethnographic processes, for instance, Peter McLaren says that critical ethnography asks questions such as “[u]nder what conditions and to what ends do we. as educational researchers, enter into relations of cooperation. mutuality, and reciprocity with those who we research?” (p. 78) and “what social effects do you want your evaluations and understandings to have?” (p. 83). In»the same vein, Michelle Fine suggests that critical researchers must move beyond notions of the etic/emic dichotomy of researcher positionality in order to “probe how we are in relation with the contexts we study and with our informants, understanding that we are all multiple in those relations” (p. 72). Researchers in composition and literacy stud¬ies who endorse critical research methods, then, aim to enact some sort of positive transformative change in keeping with the needs and interests of the participants with whom they work...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{pressure}} of competition and the expectations of consumers, game developers are in a race to create {{the biggest and most}} detailed worlds in their productions. Nowadays, thanks to the evolution of computer hardware, great amounts of detail to be put in those worlds, and this trend is not expected to end any time soon. But that detail has to be created by hand most of the time and that is becoming a very costly activity, to such an extent even that it is becoming unprofitable. Cannibal Game Studios develops software to make content creation easier and more cost-efficient, and from that company came the assignment for this work. This work focuses on the creation of one particular type of content: architectural structures. The goal of this work is stated as follows: Create an approach and a prototype system that will speed up the creation of architectural structures. The first part of the work consisted of researching two related subjects and developing an approach based on the findings of the research. The first is the domain of architectural structure creation. The research explores the process of architectural structure creation and the problems that exist in it. The development of a new approach should not only solve the problems, but it should also fit in with the existing processes and design principles. Through interviews with game developers in the Netherlands, an understanding was gained of these matters and a set of requirements was created that the approach should fulfill. The second subject of research pertains to the existing approaches that have been developed to solve the identified problems. The most relevant existing approaches are based on procedures and a selection of those approaches is reviewed in order to discover their strengths and weaknesses. While all approaches have their benefits, they also exhibit several shortcomings. With {{the development of a new}} approach that satisfies the requirements of the games industry, it is important to use their benefits in our advantage and to keep their shortcomings in mind in order to provide a more complete solution. This led to the inception of an instance-based modeling approach that allows users to specify procedures for the design of a structure through (real-time) interaction with a special instance of that design. In this approach, designs are specified and instances of the design can be created by a procedural system. The approach defines structures in terms of components and relations between those components. The instantiation process for the instance of a structure instantiates, forms, and positions instances of components based on their relation definitions to other components. The approach uses patterns to govern the repeated instantiation of components. Patterns are used in a similar fashion to select component instances as parents for instantiated connections relations. One of the most interesting concepts of the approach is that it allows components to have non-hierarchic relations to several other components. This approach shields the user from coding abstract rules and presents a familiar 3 D modeling interface instead. In the second part of this work, a prototype system was implemented based on this new approach. This was done based on the software framework of Cannibal Game Studios, which includes a 3 D game Engine and a content editor framework. For the prototype, it was decided to use connections as the relations between components of a structure, and curves as the component shape type to use. During the development of the prototype, it became apparent that the procedural instantiation logic was much more complex to create than anticipated. It proved to be the biggest challenge in the project to keep instances of a component up-to-date in real-time when the design of the component was modified. The result of this work is in the first place a new approach for Computer-Aided Design for architectural structures that allows users to create procedural structure designs in a non-technical way. It also allows users to easily create and work with <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> between components in the design. In the second place it has led to the creation of a prototype system that serves as a proof of concept for this approach. Although the prototype is not complete enough to be considered a usable product, it does prove that an implementation of the proposed approach can actually be realized. Aside from the complete approach, even the individual concepts of the approach that were implemented in the system have value to the content creation process. Future work can be performed in two ways. The first is to improve the current implementation by making it more efficient and by adding more features. These features would include more interaction functionality to make the system more user-friendly, and more functional features to make it more flexible and complete. Some examples of the latter are the implementation of more shape types and more relation types. The second way in which future work can be done is to develop the approach itself further. For instance, other ways of relation specification can be explored on both the technical and the user interface level.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{want to address}} a central {{conundrum}} in non-hierarchical organizing: How do we both recognize difference—that we are not all the same—without subjecting difference to its standard placement in our symbolic structures—difference as a necessary support to, but always lesser than, the same? In order to organize non-hierarchically, must we all be the same? If not, {{how can we be}} different [...] and not lesser [...] as we organize non-hierarchically? How can hierarchical relations not be reconstituted among and between the different as they organize together? To answer these questions I want to look at three bodies of work which deal the most comprehensively with the assumptions underlying hierarchy and how we might organize non-hierarchically: the work of Helen Brown and her focus on the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing in the construction of a flexible non-hierarchical social order, based on the achievement of equality through sameness; the work of the French philosopher, linguist and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray and her focus on the reconfiguration of the symbolic structures of Western thought through addressing ‘the question of the age which must be thought’ [...] sexual difference [...] and by extension difference and its relationship to sameness; and finally, the work of the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective, who draw on Irigaray in their theorizing of affidamento or entrustment, a non-hierarchical relationship between the woman who knows and the woman who wants. It is a relationship which, by authorizing a place from which the female subject may speak, is the basis for the reconfiguration of the symbolic structure from hierarchy to contiguity, or for sexual difference next to sexual difference, difference next to difference, creating the conditions of possibility for contiguous organizing. How, then, are non-hierarchical organizing practices to be achieved? Helen Brown’s work on the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing in order to produce the flexible social order which underpins non-hierarchical organizing, as carefully done as it is, founders in two ways. First, the teaching, learning and sharing of all the skills of organizing is indeed a first step towards <b>non-hierarchical</b> <b>relations,</b> but it is not enough because it fails to confront its central dilemma—it depends on the rhetoric of sameness to confer equality, so difference among and between women must be repressed, rather than understood as a source of creativity. Secondly, it founders on the relationship between the one who teaches and the one who learns, between the woman who knows and the woman who wants. How is this relationship between those who want to learn and those who already know different organizing skills to be structured, other than hierarchically? How, in particular, are we to organize non-hierarchically among and between the different, without eventually succumbing to some form of hierarchical organizing? In her work on sexual difference, the French philosopher Luce Irigaray directly confronts this question of difference as necessarily always lesser than the Same if the construction of the Same is to retain its coherence. In her analysis of our symbolic structures [...] our languages, the stories, myths, religions and philosophies we tell ourselves to make sense of our world [...] she maintains that we can rethink these symbolic structures to make a place for sexual difference—and by extension, difference—as contiguous in relationship to each other rather than as hierarchical in relationship to the Same. This Same or the One is theoretically neutral, but is in effect masculine. It is the face of the man who sees himself reflected in the mirror of theory, and, mistaking himself as the sole representative of the human, erases his own sexual difference, and women, leaving no place for sexual difference, and difference, as other than a necessary, but erased, construct. In our present symbolic structures, Irigaray argues, women hold the place of difference. They are only objects; they lack a place from which to speak and name their actions as subjects. Thus, as long as women are without a place in the symbolic structures from which to speak as subjects, as long as sexual difference and difference have no place other than as lesser, hierarchy will inevitably reassert itself. The work of the Milan Women’s Bookstore Collective and their theorizing of affidamento or entrustment can provide us with some understanding of how we might go about rethinking the theoretical and practical exemplification of contiguous organizing practices. Entrustment provides us with a way of rethinking the relationship of the woman who knows to the woman who wants as other than hierarchical. It is a relationship based on reciprocity and on honouring the authority of the woman who knows, authority meaning the place from which to speak in the symbolic structure as the female subject, the female subject next to, but not lesser than, the male subject. It means that a place is created where one had not existed before, for sexual difference, and by extension, for difference, to exist in a relationship of contiguity: for sexual difference next to sexual difference, difference next to difference. To the MWBC, honouring the authority of the woman who knows in a reciprocal relationship with the woman who wants, means that in the act of organizing together, we at the same time reconfigure our symbolic structures, where the difference between the woman who wants and the woman who knows can exist in contiguous rather than in hierarchical relations. As Kate Young has stressed, the most effective organizing is the least hierarchical, and thus the most attentive to how difference can be reconfigured as contiguous. And in so doing, we reconfigure symbolic structures as contiguous: difference next to difference, sexual difference next to sexual difference, where the woman as subject finally speaks, and where hierarchy is no longer inevitable as we organize together...|$|R
40|$|With {{the removal}} of the Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) from the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2012, several states legalized wolf hunting as part of {{wildlife}} management programs and the protection of livestock. However, the legalization of wolf hunting has created much conflict between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in the Great Lakes region. Many Anishinaabeg, or Ojibwe, in the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan object to the state-sanctioned wolf hunting because of their long-standing religious and ecological relationship to wolves as relatives. In the Anishinaabe creation story, the Creator Gitchi Manitou sent Ma 2 ̆ 7 iingan, or Wolf, as a brother and companion to the original human, where the lives of Anishinaabe peoples and wolves would forever become intertwined. While the wolf hunting conflict appears to be one between religion and the broader secular state, it is a complex issue, involving historical religious conceptions of land and power among Anishinaabe and non-Indigenous Americans. Power and traditional ecological knowledge in Anishinaabe culture originates from non-human sources, where humans must establish relationships with other-than-human beings to survive and achieve bimaadiziwin, or 2 ̆ 2 the good life. 2 ̆ 2 In a bimaadiziwin framework, wolves are a source of power, knowledge, and well-being for humans, suggesting that they and other non-human beings are valid models of potential ways in which humans may develop ecological models and environmental relations. A methodology based on Indigenous environmental theory and non-human power may provide a broader and more inclusive framework for environmental conflicts, incorporating the roles of all the beings that are indigenous in a certain area. In my thesis, I will show how the wolf-hunting conflict in the Great Lakes region is an example of clashing hierarchical and <b>non-hierarchical</b> systems of <b>relations</b> and knowledge, and explore how an Anishinaabe wolf-based epistemology and ontology is a valid non-hierarchical ecological model for the Great Lakes region and beyond...|$|R
40|$|Science and Technology (S and T) {{information}} {{presents a}} rich resource, essential for managing {{research and development}} (R and D) programs. Management of R and D {{has long been a}} labor-intensive process, relying extensively on the accumulated knowledge of experts within the organization. Furthermore, the rapid pace of S and T growth has increased the complexity of R and D management significantly. Fortunately, the parallel growth of information and of analytical tools offers the promise of advanced decision aids to support R and D management more effectively. Information retrieval, data mining and other information-based technologies are receiving increased attention. In this thesis, a framework based on text mining techniques is proposed to discover useful intelligence implicit in large bodies of electronic text sources. This intelligence is a prime requirement for successful R and D management. This research extends the approach called Technology Opportunities Analysis (developed by the Technology Policy and Assessment Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, in conjunction with Search Technology, Inc.) to create the proposed framework. The commercialized software, called VantagePoint, is mainly used to perform basic analyses. In addition to utilizing functions in VantagePoint, this thesis also implements a novel text association rule mining algorithm for gathering related concepts among text data. Two algorithms based on text association rule mining are also implemented. The first algorithm called tree-structured networks is used to capture important aspects of both parent-child (hierarchical structure) and sibling <b>relations</b> (<b>non-hierarchical</b> structure) among related terms. The second algorithm called concept-grouping is used to construct term thesauri for data preprocessing. Finally, the framework is applied to Thai S and T publication abstracts toward the objective of improving R and D management. The results of the study can help support strategic decision-making on the direction of S and T programs in Thailand. Ph. D.

40|$|This dissertation, Not To Repeat History: Racialization and Combinatory Textuality in Contemporary Asian American and African American Experimental Writing, {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} textual strategies and political imagination at work in Asian American and African American experimental writers Nathaniel Mackey, Myung Mi Kim, and Ed Roberson. Providing {{one of the first}} cross-cultural studies of contemporary Asian American and African American experimental writing, I contend that these writers pit two aspects of literary form against each other so as to stage a confrontation between the experience of racism and the possibility of escaping its logic. I argue that all of these writers turn to serial literary forms as a way of imitating what they take to be the power of racism to make individuals merely identical. At the same time these writers imagine the building blocks of textuality as sites of provisional abundance, either because of the traditionally combinatory possibilities of texts, or because those possibilities are made evident anew once texts are brought into relation with other media (for example in relation to music). I call this relation between serial literary forms and combinatory textual possibilities "racial constructivism. " In other words, I argue that the poets share an understanding of racialized identities as both interchangeable and discontinuous, and so counterpose a combinatorial textuality which imagines both space and time for grief, renewal, or repair. My dissertation argues that inasmuch as these imaginings of the resources of textuality for poetry are pitted against an experience of racism as departicularizing, the poets help us to move beyond the antinomy of a postmodern "poetics of form" and a postnationalist "politics of cultural difference. " My first chapter, entitled "An Axiomatic Chorus: Improvisation and Imagined Identities in Nathaniel Mackey's From A Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate," argues that Nathaniel Mackey's interest in musical improvisation pushes past texts in order to return to them with a renewed sense of combinatory possibilities. By utilizing the epistolary novel form, and refusing linear narrative development in favor of oblique chains of association, and taking jazz improvisation as a model for black experimental literary practice, Mackey not only produces a restless variety of figures for expressive force but also invents a digressive form spacious enough to hold them all in tension. In Mackey's epistolary novel series, From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate, the protagonist N. writes letters to an interlocutor known only as "The Angel of Dust," whose responses are alluded to but absent from the texts. In these letters, N. chronicles the performances of an imagined group of avant-garde jazz musicians, the "Molimo m'Atet," and searches for linguistic analogues to musical improvisation. While readers are kept guessing as to whether the anonymity or pseudonymity of the "Angel of Dust" names an imagined muse, an addiction, or perhaps Mackey himself, the combination of the particulate metaphor of dust with the implicit animating power of "angel" provides a compact description of the novels' assemblage of figures out of permutable textual building blocks. I argue that the novel series both embodies and diagnoses the limits of such a constructivist impulse by revealing how such combinatory literary strategies mime racialization processes in order to overcome them. I argue that at key moments in the novel series, this racial constructivism is problematized by the protagonists' immobilizing experiences of contingency and automaticity In my second chapter, "`What is nearest is destroyed': Myung Mi Kim's `Thirty and Five Books' and Racial Comparison," I show how Myung Mi Kim's interest in the "recombinatory power of language" (Kim, Statement 251) functions both as a metaphor for cultural hybridization and as a set of formal strategies capable of representing interracial conflict and the dissolution of intercultural social bonds. In this chapter, I analyze an underexamined feature of the poet's works in a poem entitled "Thirty and Five Books" from a more recent volume, Dura [...] the essential political ambiguity of the poem's use of "recombinatory" or serial forms, the problem of the comparability of nonwhite communities during the 1992 Los Angeles riots, and finally the significance of the systems of counting, accounting, and measurement which permeate the poem. "Thirty And Five Books" takes this interest in "accounts and recounting" and interrogates the hierarchical racial schemas which structured media representations of interracial conflict between African American and Asian American communities during the Los Angeles riots in 1992 {{in the wake of the}} acquittal of four police officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney King. I contend that the systems of measurement and classification which organize so much of the poem are inseparable from the poem's vision of <b>non-hierarchical</b> social <b>relations</b> modeled after the linguistic hybridity of what the poet calls a "A banter English. "My third chapter, "Infinite Regressions: Ed Roberson, Serial Identities, and the 1960 s Civil Rights Movement Lunch Counter Sit-Ins," performs an extended close reading of Roberson's poem "Sit In What City We're In," from the author's 2006 book City Eclogue. Roberson's poem reimagines the waves of 1960 s lunch counter sit-in's as an opportunity to pose fundamental questions about the nature of racial representation in the post-civil rights era. Roberson does this by reconfiguring the sit-ins in space and in time: spatially, by tracking how mirrors behind a lunch counter create an infinite regress of reflected images of protestors and counterprotestors alike; and temporally, by reconnecting the evanescent figure of the city to the earth and enduring cyclical geological processes. Roberson's poem "Sit In What City We're In" commemorates the lunch counter sit-in movement which swept the south in the 1960 s by dilating the moment and the movement in space and time and by refusing the kind of distanced, spectatorial historical framing which would safely consign the antiracist ideals of the civil right movement to the past. Instead, Roberson reimagines the scene of the sit-ins as what I want to call a failed dialectic of racial recognition in which the promise of formal equality, desegregation, and equal protection gives way to a meditation on the homogenizing force of such ideals. I argue that Roberson stages the civil rights sit-ins as a moment of conflict between an integrationist politics in pursuit of equal citizenship rights and a later pluralist multicultural politics of recognition which emphasize cultural difference rather than similarity. As a result, the poem, and I would argue the City Eclogue as a whole, pioneers a novel mode of historical recollection which reveals both the appearance of the past in the present, and vice-versa. Finally I argue that Roberson's interest in the figure of the city, and the anonymity of urban life, allows the poem to represent the promise of formal equality as fundamentally compatible with segregated social relations...|$|R
