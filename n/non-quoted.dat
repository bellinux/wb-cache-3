By exploiting these differences in relative importance, model fit can be improved without adding any new infonnation. Perfonnance can be increased further by directly adjusting for group related factors, e. g. by including a measure offmancial health of the group as a whole.

40|$|Most {{corporate}} finance research {{is based on}} an Anglo-Saxon corporate environment where capital markets in general and stock markets in particular are large and well established. A recent development in the Corporate Finance literature is the growing awareness that insights from the classic Anglo-Saxon based theories are not always equally valid {{in other parts of the}} world. An extensive literature has been developed on the influence of corporate governance, ownership structure and market structure on corporate decision making (i. e. leverage, investment policy, going public/private transactions, etc., etc.) and on corporate performance indicators (i. e. firm growth, shareholder value, productivity, profitability, etc., etc.). This dissertation contributes in several ways to this quickly developing research by analyzing how existing theories can be related to a corporate environment that is characterized by less important stock markets and predominantly private companies. More specific the research focuses on the impact of ownership control and/or identity, product market competition and financial pressure/flexibility on corporate decision making in a typical continental European country, viz. Belgium. Conventional wisdom suggests that the public offering represents a stage in the growth phase of a corporation and, therefore, all private firms with growth prospects eventually go public to finance investments. Most studies indicate that, from the perspective of the company, the motives for going public mainly reflect different aspects of the three major advantages of being quoted: the information production/transparency, the disciplining pressure in public financial markets, and the reduction in financing constraints. It is believed that at a certain stage in the growth of the company the benefits of a stock listing will outweigh the increased agency costs of going public due to the separation of ownership and control. While this explanation appears both plausible and intuitively appealing, it fails to explain the presence of large well established private companies in especially continental European countries. These firms are equivalent in size as well as economic importance to their quoted counterparts and easily meet the minimum listing requirements of all major European stock exchanges. It is therefore an intriguing question how these firms cope with the lack of transparency, market disciplining and financial resources that are all available to quoted companies. This dissertation will try to shed more light on the success and the failures of the dominant corporate model of Continental Europe by investigating the financial and strategic consequences of remaining private. In the first Chapter we investigate empirically whether there is a difference in performance between quoted and <b>non-quoted</b> companies and how the public stock market affects the functioning of the main determinants of firm performance, viz. product market competition, financial pressure and ownership identity (family versus non-family controlled firm). Within our sample of quoted and large <b>non-quoted</b> Belgian firms over the period 1992 - 2003, we find that the impact of determinants on performance does indeed depend on whether the company is quoted or not. Specifically, after controlling for the endogenous nature of some of the variables, we find that competition, financial pressure (although not always significant) and family ownership have a positive impact on corporate performance in publicly quoted firms. These results are similar to the literature where samples of mainly public companies are used. By contrast, competition, financial pressure and family ownership negatively influence performance in large private firms. We also find that overall, quoted firms perform better, and that this improved performance may be explained by the difference in the functioning of performance drivers in a quoted versus a <b>non-quoted</b> environment. Our results support the hypothesis that, competition and financial pressure amplify existing financing constraints in <b>non-quoted</b> companies, leading to problems of underinvestment and loss of productivity. Furthermore, our findings about family ownership are in line with recent understanding that the typical agency problems of private companies decrease the effectiveness of family control as an organizational structure. Overall, this first Chapter shows that competition and financial pressure need an appropriate environment in order to benefit firm performance and that at least in the case of family firms, agency issues improve when listed. The second Chapter empirically investigates more in detail how and why conclusions from the previous Chapter concerning financing constraints and underinvestment of private companies are valid. We try to establish how the stock market may impact on the investment policy of large firms by comparing quoted with large unlisted firms. By using the concept of investment-cash flow sensitivity, we will disentangle whether companies are faced with either problems of asymmetric information or agency costs of free cash flow. We study this on our set of large Belgian companies that produce consolidated accounts over the period 1992 - 2003. Our findings indicate that although investment ratios of quoted and unquoted firms are on average very similar over the entire sample period, companies differ significantly in the way they build up their capital stock. Investment by public companies is little cash flow sensitive and listed firms react relatively quickly to growth opportunities. By contrast, unquoted firms invest whenever cash flow is available and actively time external debt financing. Specifically, as lender evaluation typically improves with the borrower’s outlook and a firm’s capacity to carry debt increases, unlisted firms use high growth years to borrow and finance increased investment spending. This way, cash flow sensitivity in <b>non-quoted</b> companies proves to be significantly lower when growth is high as compared to low growth periods. Hence, contrary to what is generally accepted in the literature, a drop in cash flow sensitivity when growth opportunities improve need not indicate free cash flow problems, but may be consistent with capital constrained firms timing their increased demand for external financing. Overall, the findings in this Chapter show that the dynamics of investment policy strongly influence cash flow sensitivity. Finally, results indicate that for firms to survive in an unquoted environment, it is important that, either investment needs are not excessive or that, in case of higher needs, postponement of investment to high cash flow periods is feasible. When these former conditions are met, going public can no longer be considered a necessary phase in financing the growth cycle of every company and remaining unquoted can be a viable strategic choice to some. In Chapter 3 we extend the research question of Chapter 2 towards the influence of competition on investment policy. We combine the findings from Chapter 1, that competitive pressure affects quoted and <b>non-quoted</b> companies differently, with the conclusion from Chapter 2 that investment spending in quoted and unquoted firms differs significantly in its dependence on the availability of cash flow. In Chapter 3 we study if and how quoted and unlisted firms differ in the way their investment decisions are influenced by the competitive pressure they are facing. We show that, as assumed in Chapter 2, financial flexibility becomes more important when postponing investment is no longer possible or feasible. Theory predicts that competition has a strong influence on the value of postponing investment. It has empirically been shown that this value of waiting increases with industry concentration, where firms are presumably least likely to lose investment opportunities to competitors. In Chapter 3 however, we extend this empirical result of market concentration by using competitive strategy interactions. We show that when industry competition is appeasing (i. e. in strategic substitutes) and/or when market concentration is high, competition does not lead to a loss in productivity for unlisted firms, although cash flow sensitivity of investment is significant. However, when competition within the industry is aggressive (i. e. in strategic complements) and/or market concentration is low, <b>non-quoted</b> companies become significantly more cash strapped. Furthermore this increase in cash flow sensitivity proves to be caused by underinvestment problems, indicating that these firms are unable to react upon their rival’s moves. In line with this result, unlisted firms also prove to suffer losses in factor productivity. Hence, contrary to what is often accepted in the literature, competition is not necessarily enhancing investment opportunities or productivity. This conclusion could already be drawn in Chapter 1 but in Chapter 3 we are able to show when and why competitive pressure distorts productivity. It appears that competition can even have a negative impact on listed companies. Specifically when competition is appeasing and market concentration is high, listed firms show a positive cash flow sensitivity of investment. Furthermore, additional tests to distinguish underinvestment from overinvestment issues indicate that this sensitivity for quoted companies is generally caused by overinvestment. However, as market concentration decreases, and especially when competitive behavior in the industry becomes aggressive, this cash flow sensitivity disappears. Simultaneously total factor productivity improves for these firms, indicating that listed firms not only withstand fierce competition better than their unlisted peers, but even benefit from its disciplining impact. In sum, Chapter 3 shows that the intensity of competition (market concentration) as well as its nature (competitive strategy interactions) have a different impact on companies’ investment behavior depending on whether they are quoted or not. On top we show that these observed differences in investment behavior also translate into differences in corporate performance, defined as total factor productivity. This way we are able to shed more light on the relationship between competition and performance, as found in Chapter 1, and broaden the understanding of the influence of a stock listing on this relationship.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} main {{determinants}} of Italian banks' cost efficiency {{over the period}} 1993 - 1996, by employing a Fourier-flexible stochastic cost frontier {{in order to measure}} X-efficiencies and economies of scale. Quality and riskiness of bank outputs are explicitly accounted for in the cost function and their impact on cost efficiency levels is evaluated. The results show that mean X-inefficiencies range between 13 and 15 per cent of total costs and they tend to decrease over time for all bank sizes. Economies of scale appear present and significant, being especially high for popular and credit co-operative banks. Moreover, the inclusion of risk and output quality variables in the cost function seems to reduce the significance of the scale economy estimates. Following Spong et al. (1995) a profitability test is undertaken that allows for the identification of banks that are both cost and profit efficient. The results suggest that the most efficient and profitable institutions are more able to control all aspects of costs, especially labour costs. Finally, the data are pooled to carry out a logistic regression model in order to examine bank- and market-specific factors that influence Italian banks' inefficiency. Confirming Mester (1993, 1996), inefficiencies appear to be inversely correlated with capital strength and positively related to the level of non-performing loans in the balance sheet. The analysis also shows that there is no clear relationship between asset size and bank efficiency. Finally, it is possible to infer that quoted banks seem to be on average more efficient than their <b>non-quoted</b> counterparts. ...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{communication}} {{relies on}} electronic messages {{organized in the}} form of discussion threads. Emails, IMs, SMS, website comments, and forums are all composed of threads, which consist of individual user messages connected by metadata and discourse coherence to messages from other users. Threads are used to display user messages effectively in a GUI such as an email client, providing a background context for understanding a single message. Many messages are meaningless without the context provided by their thread. However, a number of factors may result in missing thread structure, ranging from user mistake (replying to the wrong message), to missing metadata (some email clients do not produce/save headers that fully encapsulate thread structure; and, conversion of archived threads from over repository to another may also result in lost metadata), to covert use (users may avoid metadata to render discussions difficult for third parties to understand). In the field of security, law enforcement agencies may obtain vast collections of discussion turns that require automatic thread reconstruction to understand. For example, the Enron Email Corpus, obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of the Enron Corporation, has no inherent thread structure. In this thesis, we will use natural language processing approaches to reconstruct threads from message content. Reconstruction based on message content sidesteps the problem of missing metadata, permitting post hoc reorganization and discussion understanding. We will investigate corpora of email threads and Wikipedia discussions. However, there is a scarcity of annotated corpora for this task. For example, the Enron Emails Corpus contains no inherent thread structure. Therefore, we also investigate issues faced when creating crowdsourced datasets and learning statistical models of them. Several of our findings are applicable for other natural language machine classification tasks, beyond thread reconstruction. We will divide our investigation of discussion thread reconstruction into two parts. First, we explore techniques needed to create a corpus for our thread reconstruction research. Like other NLP pairwise classification tasks such as Wikipedia discussion turn/edit alignment and sentence pair text similarity rating, email thread disentanglement is a heavily class-imbalanced problem, and although the advent of crowdsourcing has reduced annotation costs, the common practice of crowdsourcing redundancy is too expensive for class-imbalanced tasks. As the first contribution of this thesis, we evaluate alternative strategies for reducing crowdsourcing annotation redundancy for class-imbalanced NLP tasks. We also examine techniques to learn the best machine classifier from our crowdsourced labels. In order to reduce noise in training data, most natural language crowdsourcing annotation tasks gather redundant labels and aggregate them into an integrated label, which is provided to the classifier. However, aggregation discards potentially useful information from linguistically ambiguous instances. For the second contribution of this thesis, we show that, for four of five natural language tasks, filtering of the training dataset based on crowdsource annotation item agreement improves task performance, while soft labeling based on crowdsource annotations does not improve task performance. Second, we investigate thread reconstruction as divided into the tasks of thread disentanglement and adjacency recognition. We present the Enron Threads Corpus, a newly-extracted corpus of 70, 178 multi-email threads with emails from the Enron Email Corpus. In the original Enron Emails Corpus, emails are not sorted by thread. To disentangle these threads, and as the third contribution of this thesis, we perform pairwise classification, using text similarity measures on <b>non-quoted</b> texts in emails. We show that i) content text similarity metrics outperform style and structure text similarity metrics in both a class-balanced and class-imbalanced setting, and ii) although feature performance is dependent on the semantic similarity of the corpus, content features are still effective even when controlling for semantic similarity. To reconstruct threads, it is also necessary to identify adjacency relations among pairs. For the forum of Wikipedia discussions, metadata is not available, and dialogue act typologies, helpful for other domains, are inapplicable. As our fourth contribution, via our experiments, we show that adjacency pair recognition can be performed using lexical pair features, without a dialogue act typology or metadata, and that this is robust to controlling for topic bias of the discussions. Yet, lexical pair features do not effectively model the lexical semantic relations between adjacency pairs. To model lexical semantic relations, and as our fifth contribution, we perform adjacency recognition using extracted keyphrases enhanced with semantically related terms. While this technique outperforms a most frequent class baseline, it fails to outperform lexical pair features or tf-idf weighted cosine similarity. Our investigation shows that this is the result of poor word sense disambiguation and poor keyphrase extraction causing spurious false positive semantic connections. In concluding this thesis, we also reflect on open issues and unanswered questions remaining after our research contributions, discuss applications for thread reconstruction, and suggest some directions for future work...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} recent developments in the corporate finance l iterature is the growing realization that insights from the classic US b ased finance theories are not always equally valid {{in other parts of the}} world. An extensive literature has been developed on the links between issues such as corporate governance, ownership structure or legal framew ork and all types of corporate finance decisions (leverage, dividend pol icy, firm growth, investment policy, etc., etc.). This dissertation adds different aspects to this quickly developing research area by analyzing effects related to two main issues: the presence of internal capital ma rkets within (mostly) private Belgian business groups and the 1997 Belgi an bankruptcy legislation reform. The emergence of internal capital markets is a direct consequence of the fact that different business entities are interlinked through common ow nership. Most of the theoretical and empirical research on this subject has concentrated on US conglomerates and South-East Asian business group types, such as the Japanese keiretsu or the Korean chaebol. More recently, business groups in emerging markets have been receiving more r esearch attention as well. Somewhat surprisingly, research on Continenta l European business groups is still limited. Especially the role of unqu oted groups has received little attention in the corporate finance liter ature, sometimes due to lack of data, other times driven by  in our opi nion  an underestimation of the phenomenons importance. Depending on t he strictness of the definition, between 30 and 50 % of all top 10, 000 co mpanies in Belgium are part of a group structure. The vast majority of t hese groups do not have an exchange quoted component. For all of these f irms, accounting data driven models  which are by definition the only t ype available for <b>non-quoted</b> companies  often do not yield the same qua lity of results as they would for comparable stand-alone companies, beca use individual group member financial statements do not reflect all rele vant information. In the first Part of this dissertation we demonstrate this in two different research settings: the debt source mix of group me mber companies (Chapter 1), and the effect of groups and internal capita l markets on bankruptcy prediction (Chapters 2 and 3). In Chapter 1, we show that internal capital markets within private busin ess groups are used to optimize the debt source mix of subsidiaries thro ughout the group. Novel to the debt source literature, we include bi-level variables, using financial statements of individual large opera ting subsidiaries and consolidated data of the group as a whole. We focu s on the determinants of the two most important sources of debt financin g for <b>non-quoted</b> group member companies, viz. bank debt and intra-gro up debt. As a benchmark, we also examine determinants of bank debt for c omparable stand-alone companies. We find that bank debt use of group mem ber companies is far lower as compared to that of stand-alones. All test s (univariate, tobit regressions and system of equations regressions) co nsistently point to a pecking order of intra-group debt over bank debt. We find that the use of intra-group debt increases with the depth of the internal capital markets (i. e. subsidiaries of larger, older, less leve red groups use more intra-group debt). As the possibility of providing i ntra-group debt diminishes (i. e. as the financial health of the group de creases), more bank debt is used at subsidiary level, especially by thos e member companies that are able to borrow at the lowest costs: larger f irms with many tangible assets to be given as collateral. Our findings a re consistent with the existence of a group-wide optimization process mi nimizing overall financing costs. As shown in the first Chapter, internal capital markets are actively use d in Belgian business groups. This implies that the legally independent companies that are part of the group are economically linked. This could be important for all finance applications that use company level accoun ting data. One of the best known applications is the assessment of corpo rate failure, which clearly is of interest to lending banks, clients, su ppliers, etc. The bankruptcy prediction literature largely ignores owner ship related elements and implicitly assumes all companies are independe nt entities. Using a sample of medium and large sized companies, we show in Chapter 2 that this assumption is not always justified. Most of the popular bankruptcy predictors, such as measures of liquidity, leverage o r profitability have more predictive power for stand-alone companies tha n for group member firms. After univariate tests and univariate regressi ons, we build optimized specifications of multivariate logistic regressi on models. Without adding any new variables, predictive accuracy can be increased by estimating separate models for stand-alone companies and gr oup subsidiaries. We also find that the addition of group-related variab les, including a dummy for group membership or the Altman (1993) Z-scor e of the business group significantly increases model performance. These group corrections are shown to improve the fit of some well-known natio nal and international prediction models. Chapter 3 applies the same approach as Chapter 1, viz. using bi-level data (at subsidiary level and ultimate owner level) to the ideas develo ped in Chapter 2. We extensively show how the presence of an internal ca pital market could influence bankruptcy prediction models performance. Using the logit models from Chapter 2 as a benchmark, we extend the anal ysis with key group level variables (size, age, leverage, profitability, etc.). This detailed owner level information greatly improves the model fit and predictive success rates. Vuong tests confirm that the relative content of information is significantly improved, even when compared to models that are already group corrected in the way described in the pre vious Chapter. We find that financially sound groups tend to support wea k subsidiaries, thus increasing the latters survival chances. If the fi nancial situation of the group itself is precarious, it continues to sup port core activity subsidiaries, but it may terminate non-core businesse s. Our results are consistent with, and also add to recent theoretical a nd empirical findings from the internal capital markets literature. While Chapters 2 and 3 focus on company and group specific factors which can explain or predict whether or not a company will file for bankruptc y, it is important to note that the bankruptcy process is not independen t of the legal framework in which a company operates. Key aspects of ban kruptcy legislation can determine company survival chances as well. Ther efore, the 1997 reform of the Belgian bankruptcy system is the subject o f the second Part of the dissertation. The main goal of the 1997 reform was to transform the liquidation-biased 19 th century bankruptcy rules into a system that encourages corporate r estructuring and preserves employment as much as possible. In Chapter 4, we use time-series methodology to assess if the reform has indeed lead to lower aggregate bankruptcy rates while correcting for variations in t he general state of the economy. Specifically, we estimate distributed l ag models that control for macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, i nflation, business cycle indicators, etc. and find that aggregate bankru ptcy rates are significantly lower in the post-reform period. Novel to t he literature, we separately analyze the impact for different types of s mall and micro businesses, split up according to legal form and industry. This allows us to distinguish between the effects of different aspects of the reform (the most important of which are the introduction of anti -domino measures, the new reorganization code and the formation of chamb ers of commercial research). We find that the positive impact of the ref orm is somewhat more pronounced for stock corporations (mostly small bus inesses) than for partnerships (mostly micro firms), and that the reform has only lowered bankruptcy rates in manufacturing and trade industries. These findings support the notion that the anti-domino part of the ref orm may have been the most effective. The final Chapter analyzes in detail one of the key pieces of the reform, viz. the 1997 reorganization procedure. Recent theoretical studies indicate that the ex ante probability of success for the reform was low because dual chapter (i. e. both formal liquidation & formal reorganizati on procedures) bankruptcy systems should be most efficient in market-bas ed economies, while single chapter systems (i. e. formal liquidation only) are preferable in bank-based countries. Next to a descriptive analysis, we estimate logit models to distinguish between (a) companies that fil e for reorganization and companies filing for liquidation and, (b) betwe en companies that successfully draft a reorganization plan that is confi rmed by the court versus companies that do not. Using hazard models, we also look into the determinants of the length of time unsuccessful compa nies are protected by the reorganization procedure before liquidation. N ew to the empirical literature, we add variables on debt source mix, gro up membership (cf. Chapters 1  3) and redundancy pay. We confirm that, compared to foreign equivalents, the Belgian reorganization procedure ha s very low usage and success rates. Our evidence suggests that the prote ction granted by the reorganization procedure, is often used by the deci sion-making equity/bank coalition, not in an effort to effectively reorg anize as a going concern, but to bide time to find a suitable buyer for the companys assets. Overall, the reorganization procedure has certainl y not succeeded in achieving its policy goal of offering a realistic alt ernative for formal liquidation. nrpages: 181 status: publishe...|$|E
