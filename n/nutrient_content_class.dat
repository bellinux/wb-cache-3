40|$|The aim of {{this report}} was to examine {{if there has been}} any {{substantial}} changes in <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> of plant foods available on the market over time. The background is a debate in Swedish media concerning changes in <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> as a consequence of e. g. depletion of the soil. The work has concentrated on identifying both factors that influence the actual <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> of plant foods and on factors that only influence the published nutrient data. The influence of development and changes in analytical procedures over time is discussed. Further there are examples on how calculations, definitions and other procedures in data compilation might influence published nutrient data.

40|$|What {{is already}} {{known about this}} subject Food {{marketing}} has come under scrutiny for its likely contribution to promoting unhealthy eating and obesity in children. There is limited published evidence regarding the effects of food packaging promotions on children. <b>Nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims and sports celebrity endorsements on food packs influence adults to prefer energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) products bearing such promotions, especially among the majority who do not read the nutrition information panel. What this study adds This study experimentally tested pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to three common food marketing techniques: <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims, sports celebrity endorsements and premium offers. On-pack <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims made pre-adolescents more likely to choose EDNP products and increased perceptions of their <b>nutrient</b> <b>content.</b> Sports celebrity endorsements made pre-adolescent boys more likely to choose EDNP products. Objectives To assess pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s responses to common child-oriented front-of-pack food promotions. Methods Between-subjects, web-based experiment with four front-of-pack promotion conditions on energy-dense and nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods: no promotion [control]; <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims; sports celebrity endorsements (male athletes) and premium offers. Participants were 1302 grade 5 and 6 children (mean age 11 years) from Melbourne, Australia. Participants chose their preferred product from a randomly assigned EDNP food pack and comparable healthier food pack then completed detailed product ratings. Child-oriented pack designs with colourful, cartooned graphics, fonts and promotions were used. Results Compared to the control condition, children {{were more likely to}} choose EDNP products featuring <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims (both genders) and sports celebrity endorsements (boys only). Perceptions of nutritional content were enhanced by <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims. Effects of promotions on some product ratings (but not choice) were negated when children referred to the nutrition information panel. Premium offers did not enhance children 2 ̆ 7 s product ratings or choice. Conclusions <b>Nutrient</b> <b>content</b> claims and sports celebrity endorsements influence pre-adolescent children 2 ̆ 7 s preferences towards EDNP food products displaying them.

40|$|Objectives: To survey {{existing}} literature comparing <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> of organic and conventional crops using statistical methods to identify significant differences and {{trends in the}} data. Design: Published comparative measurements of organic and conventional <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> were entered into a database for calculation. For each organic-to-conventional comparison, a percent difference was calculated: (organic 2 conventional) /conventional 3 100. For nutrients where there was adequate data, the Wilcoxon signed-rank {{test was used to}} identify significant differences in <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> as represented by the percent difference. Mean percent difference values were also calculated for each significant nutrient by study and by vegetable for the most frequently studied vegetables. The <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> of the daily vegetable intake was calculated for both an organic and conventional diet. Results: Organic crops contained significantly more vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus and significantly less nitrates than conventional crops. There were nonsignificant trends showing less protein but of a better quality and a higher content of nutritionally significant minerals with lower amounts of some heavy metals in organic crops compared to conventional ones.

The scope of study are focus on small scale production of soybean products. Small scale industry normally lack of good production because of the less technologies and experiences. Therefore,there is no specific data about <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> in soybean foods that attached to the food packaging The primary analysis are bases on the conventional method;Kjedahl’s method to determine the protein contents,Soxhlet’s method to determine the fat contents,fiber method to determined the fiber contents and ash method to determine the ash content in soybean products. By using NIR,it cans analysis and determines the pattern of <b>nutrient</b> <b>content</b> in soybean products and compares the <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> between NIR analysis and primary method analysis. From the experiment, the results between primary analysis and NIR analysis have small error and it almost similar as it discuss in chapter 4.

However, most farming practices, such as burning of vegetation and conventional tillage in dambo gardens, may reduce soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrient dynamics. We evaluated the effects of simulated burning, vegetation clearing and clipping, and conventional tillage in dambo gardens on SOC, <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass production over a 3 -year period. The results showed that clearing and clipping of vegetation and conventional tillage reduced SOC, soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass yields, while burning increased SOC and soil <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents.</b> For the 0 – 10 cm depth, conventional tillage, clearing and clipping resulted in a 37 %, 34 % and 18 % decrease in SOC, respectively, after three seasons, burning resulted in a 25 % increase in SOC, while there were no changes in the control after 3 years. For the 0 – 40 cm depth, the average change in SOC was 32 %, 25 % and 16 % for conventional tillage, clearing and clipping, respectively. Locally and regionally, conventional tillage, clearing and clipping reduce SOC, <b>nutrient</b> <b>contents</b> and biomass production in dambos.
