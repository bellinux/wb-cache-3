50|$|<b>Par</b> <b>value,</b> {{in finance}} and accounting, means stated value or face value. From this come the {{expressions}} at par (at the <b>par</b> <b>value),</b> over <b>par</b> (over <b>par</b> <b>value)</b> and under <b>par</b> (under <b>par</b> <b>value).</b>|$|R
50|$|Also, <b>par</b> <b>value</b> still {{matters for}} a {{callable}} common stock: the call price is usually either <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{or a small}} fixed percentage over <b>par</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even in jurisdictions {{that permit}} {{the issue of}} stock with no <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of a stock may affect its tax treatment. For example, Delaware permits the issue of stock either {{with or without a}} <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> but by {{choosing}} to assign a <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> a corporation may significantly reduce its franchise tax liability.|$|R

5000|$|Because <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{was such}} an {{unreliable}} indicator of the actual value of stock, and because high <b>par</b> <b>values</b> could create liability for investors if the corporation went into bankruptcy, corporate lawyers began advising their clients to issue stocks with low <b>par</b> <b>values.</b> The legal capital or [...] "stated capital" [...] of the corporation would still be determined based on <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> but the balance sheet would include the investment over <b>par</b> <b>value</b> as a capital surplus, and everything would still balance.|$|R
50|$|Many common stocks issued {{today do}} not have par values; those that do (usually only in jurisdictions where <b>par</b> <b>values</b> are {{required}} by law) have extremely low <b>par</b> <b>values</b> (often the smallest unit of currency in circulation), for example a penny <b>par</b> <b>value</b> on a stock issued at USD$25/share. Most jurisdictions do not allow a company to issue stock below <b>par</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of stock certificates, face <b>value</b> is the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of the stock. In {{the case of}} common stock, <b>par</b> <b>value</b> is largely symbolic. In the case of {{preferred}} stock, dividends may be expressed {{as a percentage of}} <b>par</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In accounting, the <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{allows the}} company to put a de minimis value for the stock on the company's {{financial}} statement. <b>Par</b> <b>value</b> {{is also used to}} calculate legal capital or share capital.|$|R
50|$|The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> {{of stock}} has no {{relation}} to market value and, as a concept, is somewhat archaic. The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of a share is the value stated in the corporate charter below which shares of that class cannot be sold upon initial offering; the issuing company promises not to issue further shares below <b>par</b> <b>value,</b> so investors can be confident {{that no one else}} will receive a more favorable issue price. Thus, <b>par</b> <b>value</b> is the nominal value of a security which is determined by the issuing company to be its minimum price. This was far more important in unregulated equity markets than in the regulated markets that exist today, where a stock issuance prices must usually be published. The <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of stock remains unchanged in a bonus stock issue but it changes in a stock split.|$|R

Ontologically, regulation of no <b>par</b> <b>value</b> shares is one of alternatives to solve the crisis of capital market. Etiologically, the regulation will give the value of benefits in term of providing easiness to perform corporate action, simplification of accounting, no distinction between issued shares and outstanding shares, the shares price is not determined by the nominal price but the market price, it remains to be traded, the company may still do a rights issue to obtain fresh funds even during crisis and they can use mandatory and optional system.

40|$|The FASB has converged SFAS 123 R with IFRS No. 2, which {{simultaneously}} defines {{that the}} value of stock compensation is an expense under fair value method that must be recognized in the current statement of operations. However, under the fair value method, volatility of the market value of stock is easily subjected to the business cycle, political condition, managerial behavior, and macroeconomic factors, which results in a poor explanatory index than <b>par</b> <b>value</b> method. This paper limits the research target to stock option and restricted stock as incentive vehicles only, and investigates separately influence of stock compensation on firm's financial performance under <b>par</b> <b>value</b> and fair value. According to the empirical results, growth, firm size, and fixed asset turnover are all significant and positively correlated with EPS; debt ratio is significant and negatively correlated with EPS. Stock compensation presented in <b>par</b> <b>value</b> is significant in t value and increases EPS by 0. 68 % while stock compensation presented in fair value is not. Stock compensation presented in <b>par</b> <b>value</b> of 60. 5 % R-square seems that there’s no better explanation on the firm’s financial performance than that in fair value of 60. 2 %. Therefore, using the fair value method does not deviate the influence of stock compensation on firm's financial performance.
