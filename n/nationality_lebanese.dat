5000|$|<b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality</b> {{law is the}} law {{governing}} the acquisition, transmission and loss of Lebanese citizenship. Lebanese citizenship is the status of being {{a citizen of the}} Republic of Lebanon and it can be obtained by birth or naturalisation. The <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality</b> is transmitted by paternity (father) (see Jus sanguinis). Therefore, a Lebanese man who holds Lebanese citizenship can automatically confer citizenship to his children and foreign wive (only if entered in the Civil Acts Register in the Republic of Lebanon). Under the current law, descendants of Lebanese emigrants can only receive citizenship from their father and women cannot pass on citizenship neither to their children nor foreign spouses. On 12 November 2015, the Parliament of Lebanon approved a draft law that would allow [...] "foreigners of Lebanese origin to get citizenship", the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Gebran Bassil announced on 5 May 2016 the beginning of the implementation of citizenship law for Lebanese diaspora.|$|R

40|$|Today and {{throughout}} its history, Lebanese politics {{has been marked}} by the struggle to unite a diverse community within a single political entity, as citizens of a single nation-state. Rather than challenging the country’s demographic divisions and installing a shared identity, Lebanon has developed a complex political system based on the proportional representation of different sects. Under such a system, demography matters and the attribution of citizenship becomes part of a numbers game. As such, since its inception, Lebanese citizenship policy has stood out {{as one of the most}} controversial areas of domestic law. It is against this backdrop that many thousands face exclusion and have been left stateless. Statelessness is indeed a significant problem in the country, affecting many people who were left out of the country’s original body of citizens and their descendants, as well as individuals and groups with other profiles. Children of Lebanese mothers who are unable to acquire a nationality from their father are often left stateless because of the very limited acceptance of maternal jus sanguinis. Real and entrenched obstacles to birth registration are hampering the recognition of <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality</b> for children across different segments of society. And safeguards against statelessness which are present in <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality</b> law function poorly and often do not ensure access to nationality in practice. This working paper explores some key stages in the development of Lebanese citizenship policy. A particular focus is on how the aforementioned numbers game has contributed to the appearance, resolution and, recently, the potential re-emergence of cases of statelessness. The paper concludes that the country is stuck in a stalemate in terms of debating any – even relatively simple – amendments to citizenship policy that might improve this situation. This, the paper concludes, is impeding access to nationality for persons with strong links to the country, and even for some who are clearly entitled to Lebanese citizenship under the terms of the law, perpetuating and prolonging statelessness in many cases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper examined the religious influence {{on the lives of}} a group of young Australian-Lebanese adults who attended a Maronite 1 Catholic Church in Sydney, Australia. Data gathered through qualitative methods of in-depth and focus group interviews were collated using grounded theory, to reveal how religion defined a pattern of beliefs and morals and how it offered spirituality and social structures that guided these thirty three young Maronite adults. It was revealed that the Maronite Catholic faith of these young adults was tightly interwoven with <b>nationality</b> and <b>Lebanese</b> culture. Maronite identity Religious identity can be an influential part of people’s lives, giving members of a faith tradition a sense of belonging to a community of believers with a distinctive history. So when asked what features / markers distinguish a Maronite, a majority of {{the participants in this study}} claimed that the Maronites belonged to an Eastern Catholic Rite and Antiochean Church. Being Maronite was connected with the notion of being other, of belonging to a smaller Catholic group, which appeared to be more favourable than claiming affiliation with the larger Roman Catholic Church. However a small number of the participants stated it was just part of the Catholic Church without any defining difference. An overwhelming number of the participants in this study did associate their Maronite Catholic identity with a nation. I believe the most important thing to that question is that the part of being Maronite is that we are the Christians who exist in the Middle East … I’d be very strong on th...|$|R

50|$|Lebanese {{women are}} {{considered}} to have more rights and freedom compared to {{other women in the}} Arab World. Women in Lebanon are able to dress more liberally and move around with relative ease in certain parts of the country, unlike other countries in the region. Lebanese women enjoy almost equal civil rights as men. However, due to the large number of officially recognized religions in Lebanon, Lebanese family matters are governed by at least 15 personal statute codes. Lebanese women have legal protection that varies depending on their religion. In Muslim families, marriageable age can be as soon as the child reaches puberty and polygamy is allowed. Muslim women can legally marry Christian or Jewish men; for example a Lebanese Catholic man can marry a Muslim lady on the condition of getting their children baptised, otherwise, the couple may opt for civil marriage performed abroad, which can be registered at any Lebanese Embassy, thus giving it official recognition (this is a particularly popular option, with Cyprus usually acting as the destination of choice).Children born to a Lebanese woman and a man from another country will not have their children granted <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{lung cancer}} are {{increasingly}} seeking complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) {{to improve their}} physiological and psychological well-being. This study aimed to assess CAM use among lung cancer patients in Lebanon. Using a cross-sectional design, 150 lung cancer patients attending the Basile Cancer Institute at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were interviewed. Participants completed a questionnaire addressing sociodemographic characteristics, lung cancer condition, and use of CAM. The main outcome of interest was “use of any CAM therapy since diagnosis. ” Prevalence of CAM use was 41 %. The most commonly used CAM modality among study participants was “dietary supplements/special foods. ” Results of the multiple logistic regression analyses showed that CAM use was positively associated with <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality</b> and paying for treatment out of pocket and was negatively associated with unemployment and having other chronic diseases. About 10 % of patients used CAM on an alternative base, 58 % did not disclose CAM use to their physician, and only 2 % cited health professionals as influencing their choice of CAM. This study revealed a prevalent CAM use among lung cancer patients in Lebanon, with a marginal role for physicians in guiding this use.

A study {{was conducted on the}} Lebanese individual 2 ̆ 7 s social identity development. Based on a study of the theories of the psychology of social identity development, four Lebanese Identity development stages were proposed where an individual 2 ̆ 7 s social identity progresses from an unintegrated Lebanese, sectarian group identity, towards a more integrated Lebanese Identity. ^ To test the validity of these stages, two research studies, a qualitative and a quantitative study, were conducted to explore the Lebanese social identity. In the qualitative study, open ended interviews of a number of Lebanese community leaders were conducted and analyzed. While the four proposed identity stages were reflected in the subjects 2 ̆ 7 views, the majority of their views reflected a higher stage of identity development where the emphasis was on a civic society and the satisfaction of the individual 2 ̆ 7 s rights and needs as a basis of the integrated Lebanese social identity. These results were in agreement with the proposed Lebanese Identity development stages. ^ Moreover, a quantitative research study examined the relationship between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s various socio-economic factors and their level of identity development. The results revealed that there is a strong relationship between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s level of identity development and the following socio-economic variables: Sectarian identity, profession, level of education, source of data collection, and nature of dual <b>Lebanese</b> <b>nationality.</b> In general, it was concluded that individuals had higher levels of Lebanese Identity development when they enjoyed a more secure life, had higher levels of communication and exposure to others in society as well as higher levels of education. ...|$|R
40|$|The word {{menopause}} {{means the}} end of ovulation at about 45 - 50 years of age. There is {{a decline in the}} ability of the ovaries to respond to gonadotropic hormone from the pituitary. This leads to cessation of the ovulation and therefore cessation of menstrual cycle. As a result of this many changes may appear and go on for a variable length of time and cover a complex of symptoms and bodily changes. This study was carried out to investigate the common signs and symptoms experienced by women during menopause and to find out if there is any socio-cultural factors that affect the changes occurring during the menopause years. A sample of 400 women representing four Arab <b>nationalities,</b> Saudi, Egyptian, <b>Lebanese</b> and Palestine, each woman was interviewed for the following: Biosocial and Obstetric data, women’s knowledge about menopause and disorders experienced during menopause. The results show {{that the majority of the}} sample were housewives, married and having from five to ten pregnancies, and there were significant differences (p< 0. 05) between nationality and a variety of symptoms and disorders experienced by the four Arab groups, Saudi, Egyptian, Lebanese and Palestinian women. Saudi women experienced hot flushes, night sweat, arthritic disorders, headache, and insomnia most, while decline in sexual interest & weight gain were more common among Egyptian women and weight gain was also common in Palestinian women. Vaginal changes in color of skin were found to be more among Lebanese women. As regards the association of education to the prevalence of symptoms the study found that women lower level of education experienced more symptoms than those of higher education. These differences are statistically significant (p< 0. 05). The study shows that 30 % of the university graduates had complete knowledge about menopause compared to 10 % of the housewives but in general the whole sample tended to have low level of knowledge about menopause. It was found that occupation had no significant relation. The result of this study indicated the importance of information related to menopausal changes.
