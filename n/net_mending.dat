The town {{represents}} an American Indian community similar to what the English explorers investigated and surveyed during their voyages to Roanoke Island {{and the surrounding area}} in the late 16th century. Visitors follow paths that wind through the park. Homes, agricultural areas and work shelters line the paths. Two longhouses represent the historical homes of American Indians from the region. One of the longhouses stretches more than 30 feet long and interprets the home of a leader from the community. A smaller and partially completed longhouse includes an interactive component that invites visitors to help complete the structure. Both areas contain interactive exhibits that focus on the developing relationship between the American Indian and English people during the late 16th century. The ceremonial dance circle is also located here. The exhibit has a planting and harvesting area where visitors can learn the advanced nuances of American Indian farming techniques. Three work shelters include activities like cordage (rope) making, mat and basket weaving, <b>net</b> <b>mending,</b> food preparation, tanning hides, fishing, boat building and gathering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background There {{has been}} recent large {{scale-up}} of malaria control interventions in Ethiopia where transmission is unstable. While household ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has increased greatly, {{there are concerns}} about inadequate net use. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with net use at two time points, before and after mass distribution of nets. Methods Two cross sectional surveys were carried out in 2006 and 2007 in Amhara, Oromia and SNNP regions. The latter was a sub-sample of the national Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS 3 R). Each survey wave used multi-stage cluster random sampling with 25 households per cluster (224 clusters with 5, 730 households in Baseline 2006 and 245 clusters with 5, 910 households in MIS 3 R 2007). Net ownership was assessed by visual inspection while net utilization was reported as use of the net the previous night. This net level analysis was restricted to households owning at least one net of any type. Logistic regression models of association between net use and explanatory variables including net type, age, condition, cost and other household characteristics were undertaken using generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM). Results A total of 3, 784 nets in 2, 430 households {{were included in the}} baseline 2006 analysis while the MIS 3 R 2007 analysis comprised 5, 413 nets in 3, 328 households. The proportion of nets used the previous night decreased from 85. 1 % to 56. 0 % between baseline 2006 and MIS 3 R 2007, respectively. Factors independently associated with increased proportion of nets used were: LLIN net type (at baseline 2006); indoor residual spraying (at MIS 3 R 2007); and increasing wealth index at both surveys. At both baseline 2006 and MIS 3 R 2007, reduced proportion of nets used was independently associated with increasing net age, increasing damage of nets, increasing household net density, and increasing altitude (> 2, 000 m). Conclusion This study identified modifiable factors affecting use of nets that were consistent across both surveys. While net replacement remains important, the findings suggest that: more education about use and care of nets; making nets more resistant to damage; and encouraging <b>net</b> <b>mending</b> are likely to maximize the huge investment in scale up of net ownership by ensuring they are used. Without this step, the widespread benefits of LLIN cannot be realized. </p...|$|E

40|$|India is {{endowed with}} a {{continental}} shelf of 0. 5 million km 2 and an {{exclusive economic zone}} (EEZ) of about 2 million km 2. Almost half (39 %) of the Indian population utilizes the marine fisheries resources. India ranked sixth worldwide in total fish production (4. 95 million t) and second in inland fish production (2. 24 million t) during 1995 - 96. Fish production expanded from 0. 75 million t in 1950 - 51 to 4. 95 million t in 1995 - 96, giving a significant increase at a cumulative growth rate of 4. 2 % per annum. Marine fish production increased from 0. 53 million t in 1950 - 51 to 2. 71 million t in 1995 - 96. The contribution of the fisheries sector to the total gross domestic product (GDP) improved from 0. 75 % in 1980 - 81 to 1. 28 % in 1994 - 95, with marine fisheries providing employment opportunities both in the production and post-harvest sectors. Subsidiary employment in fishing includes boat building and repair, <b>net</b> <b>mending,</b> repair of engines and supply of diesel, kerosene and other essential items. Women are mostly engaged in post-harvest operations like <b>net</b> <b>mending,</b> fish processing, packing and selling of fish and fish products. The contribution to foreign exchange earnings by the fishery sector substantially increased from Rs 46 crores in 1960 - 61 to Rs 4 697 (US$ 121 *) in 1997 - 98. India exports about 55 types of marine products to different countries in Southwest Asia, Europe and USA. The total quantity of marine product exports rose from 97 200 t in 1987 - 88 to 307 337 t in 1994 - 95 giving an equivalent export value of Rs 53 000 lakhs to Rs 357 500 lakhs**. The marine fishing sector can be classified into: (a) non-motorized artisanal sector using country craft with traditional gear; (b) motorized sector; (c) mechanized sector using inboard engines of 50 to 120 HP; and (d) deep sea fishing with bigger boats (25 m and above) and engines of 120 HP and above. In 1996, India had a total fishing fleet of 238 125 units comprising 160 000 traditional craft, 31 726 motorized craft (converted from traditional) and 46 918 mechanized vessels operating different gear combinations. For artisanal fishing, the use of canoe and boat seine in Kerala provided the highest net income of Rs 0. 10 lakh with an annual catch of 51 t and an initial investment of Rs 0. 85 lakh. In motorized fishing, canoe and ring seine in Kerala offered a net income of Rs 0. 98 lakh with an annual catch of 220 t and an initial investment of Rs 5. 0 lakh. All major fishing units in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have higher profits not because of higher levels of fish catch but due to a better fish price. In the motorized sector, {{the increase in the}} price of fish over the years is greater than the increase in fuel expenditure. Small trawlers, purse seiners, dol-netters, gillnetters, pair trawlers and sona boats are the major types of mechanized fishing units operating in the inshore waters (up to 50 m depth). Trawlers and gillnetters are mostly operated along the Indian coasts whereas the fishing fleet mentioned above is confined to certain regions only. A small trawler (32 Ã† - 36 Ã†) has a net income of Rs 0. 90 lakh with an annual catch of 72 t and initial investment of Rs 5. 2 lakh in Karnataka. A purse seiner has a net earning of Rs 3. 14 lakh per year with an annual catch of 280 t and an average investment of Rs 10 lakh. However the average value of fish caught in a purse seiner is Rs 4. 29 per kg set against the break-even cost of Rs 3. 16 per kg. To assess the economic sustainability of Indian marine fisheries in the period 1985 to 1998, the surplus production model or Schaefer Model was applied. Based on this, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 2 353 726 t with an estimated effort of 984 586 annual fishing hours (AFH). Using the Fox surplus production model, MSY was equal to 2 973 752 t with an effort of 6 126 232 AFH. Note that actual yield during that period was 2 441 043 t with an effort of 12 97 092 AFH. This is indicative of over-fishing in the Indian Sea and Bay of Bengal. A number of management strategies can be applied to reduce the fishing pressure on the coastal areas of India. These are: (a) a ban of certain fishing gear and restricted entry to over-exploited fishing grounds; (b) the promotion of alternative/subsidiary income and emphasizing the importance of mariculture/aquaculture; (c) effective implementation of small scale fishery development projects like infrastructure and service facilities; (d) coastal zone management including protection of marine habitats; and (e) information dissemination and education on the importance of fisheries resources.

Despite the hardships in their livelihood they cope with double workburden to overcome the terrible situation. They work as domestic household workers but it is not considered work. According to traditional and cultural beliefs men are not allowed to do the household works so they are the women who have to do besides productive works in fisheries as setting the <b>nets</b> in Lake, <b>mending</b> <b>nets</b> and marketing of fish. The results showed that when a man tries to help his wife his sisters and mother disapprove which also shows there is hidden mystery as women’s enemy are women themselves. In many instances their multiple roles, their need to contribute to family income in poverty striken households are also main reason for their coping strategies. They are overworked but their contribution is unrecognized and undervalued. They have the dual working roles in fisheries as both in productive and reproductive fields...|$|R

50|$|Breton was {{essentially}} a painter of rustic life, especially {{in the province of}} Artois, which he quit only three times for short excursions: in 1864 to Provence, and in 1865 and 1873 to Brittany, whence he derived some of his happiest studies of religious scenes. His numerous subjects may be divided generally into four classes: labour, rest, rural festivals and religious festivals. Among his more important works may be named Women Gleaning, and The Day after St Sebastian's Day (1855), which gained him a third-class medal; Blessing the Fields (1857), a second-class medal; Erecting a Calvary (1859), now in the Lille gallery; The Return of the Gleaners (1859), now in the Luxembourg; Evening and Women Weeding (1861), a first-class medal; Grandfather's Birthday (1862); The Close of Day (1865); Harvest (1867); Potato Gatherers (1868); A Pardon, Brittany (1869); The Fountain (1872), medal of honour; The Bonfires of St John (1875); Women <b>mending</b> <b>Nets</b> (1876), in the Douai museum; A Gleaner (1877), Luxembourg; Evening, Finistère (1881); The Song of the Lark (1884); The Last Sunbeam (1885); The Shepherd's Star (1887); The Call Home (1889); The Last Gleanings (1895); Gathering Poppies (1897); The Alarm Cry (1899); Twilight Glory (1900).|$|R

Drachmann (Fig.  1, top) is one of many portrayals Krøyer did of his friend, the Danish writer and painter Holger Drachmann (1848 – 1908) [1]. Krøyer’s friend and fellow Skagen-painter Michael Ancher (1849 – 1927) {{depicted}} Krøyer while working on the final stages of the painting (Fig.  1, bottom). It took Krøyer 4 years to complete the large portrait, which was unusual given the fact that Krøyer was known for his ability to work rapidly. At the time being though, he was struggling with mental illness, and was hospitalised several times [1]. In contrast, the earlier portrait Christoffer from 1886 (Fig.  2, left) {{is an example of a}} rapidly executed painting, depicting a local fisherman working in a dark interior. The portrait clearly shows the influence of the realistic model painting and the concept “Valeur”, to which Krøyer was introduced during his stay at Léon Bonnat’s atelier. Krøyer gave the portrait as a gift to his friend, the French painter Ernest Baillet (1853 – 1902) as evidenced by the inscription in the upper left corner (Fig.  2, right). Both of the paintings are today a part of the collection at The Art Museums of Skagen.|$|R

60|$|Ferdinand {{arrived at}} Volendam. It was a fishing village, only three miles across country from Monnickendam, but the route, by steam tram and canal, was so circuitous, that, with luggage, it took one {{two hours to}} get from place to place. He had walked over there with Valentia, and it had almost tempted them to desert Monnickendam. Ferdinand took {{a room at the}} hotel and walked out, trying to {{distract}} himself. The village consisted of a couple of score of houses, built round a semi-circular dyke against the sea, and in the semi-circle lay the fleet of fishing boats. Men and women were sitting at their doors <b>mending</b> <b>nets.</b> He looked at the fishermen, great, sturdy fellows, with rough, weather-beaten faces, huge earrings dangling from their ears. He took note of their quaint costume--black stockings and breeches, the latter more baggy than a Turk's, and the crushed strawberry of their high jackets, cut close to the body. He remembered how he had looked at them with Valentia, and the group of boys and men that she had sketched. He remembered how they walked along, peeping into the houses, where everything was spick and span, as only a Dutch cottage can be, with old Delft plates hanging on the walls, and pots and pans of polished brass. And he looked over the sea to the island of Marken, with its masts crowded together, like a forest without leaf or branch. Coming {{to the end of the}} little town he saw the church of Monnickendam, the red steeple half-hidden by the trees. He wondered where Valentia was--what she was doing.|$|R
