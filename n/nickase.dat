40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} for {{hybridization}} analysis of nucleic acids is proposed {{on the basis}} of the ability of site-specific nickases to cleave only one DNA strand. The method is based on the use of a labeled oligonucleotide with the recognition site of the <b>nickase</b> hybridized with the target (DNA or RNA) at an optimal temperature of the enzyme (55 °C). The two shorter oligonucleotides formed after the cleavage with the <b>nickase</b> do not complex with the target. Thus, a multiple cleavage of the labeled oligonucleotide takes place on one target molecule. The cleavage of the nucleotide is recorded either by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (when a radioactive labeled oligonucleotide is used) or by fluorescence measurements (if the oligonucleotide has the structure of a molecular beacon). The new method was tested on <b>nickase</b> BspD 6 I and a radioactive oligonucleotide complementary to the polylinker region of the viral DNA strand in bacteriophage M 13 mp 19. Unfortunately, <b>nickase</b> BspD 6 I does not cleave DNA in the RNA–DNA duplexes and therefore cannot be used for detection of RNA targets. Key words: site-specific nickases, hybridization of nucleic acids, restriction endonucleases, molecular beacons Site-specific nickases are a new class of enzymes. Nickases recognize a specific sequence (site) on a doublestranded DNA and cleave only one of the DNA strands in a strictly determined manner. This class of enzymes includes only three members so far.

Clustered, {{regularly}} interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) are highly efficient genome editing tools. 1 – 3 CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas 9) RGNs are directed to genomic loci by guide RNAs (gRNAs) containing 20 nucleotides that are complementary to a target DNA sequence. However, RGNs can induce mutations at sites that differ {{by as many}} as five nucleotides from the intended target 4 – 6. Here we report that truncated gRNAs, with shorter regions of target complementarity < 20 nucleotides in length, can decrease undesired mutagenesis at off-target sites by as much as 5000 -fold or more without sacrificing on-target genome editing efficiencies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) -directed design of a DNA-nicking system that enables {{selective}} and quantitative cleavage of one strand of duplex DNA at a designated site, thus mimicking natural <b>nickases</b> and significantly extending their potential. This system exploits the ability of pyrimidine PNAs to serve as openers for specific DNA sites by invading the DNA duplex and exposing one DNA strand for oligonucleotide hybridization. The resultant secondary duplex {{can act as a}} substrate for a restriction enzyme, which ultimately creates a nick in the parent DNA. We demonstrate that several restriction enzymes of different types could be successfully used in the PNA-assisted system we developed. Importantly, the enzyme cleavage efficiency is basically not impaired on such artificially generated substrates, compared with the efficiency on regular DNA duplexes. Our design originates a vast class of semisynthetic rare-cleaving DNA <b>nickases,</b> which are essentially absent at present. In addition, we show that the site-specific PNA-assisted nicking of duplex DNA can be engaged in a rolling-circle DNA amplification (RCA) reaction. This new RCA format demonstrates the practical potential of the novel biomolecular tool we propose for DNA technology and DNA diagnostics.

In this study, we examined and verified the <b>nickase</b> of mutated CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas 9) to modulate the specific target gene in chicken DF 1 cells.

40|$|SummaryThe CRISPR-Cas 9 {{system has}} the {{potential}} to revolutionize genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), but its advantages and pitfalls are still poorly understood. We systematically tested the ability of CRISPR-Cas 9 to mediate reporter gene knockin at 16 distinct genomic sites in hPSCs. We observed efficient gene targeting but found that targeted clones carried an unexpectedly high frequency of insertion and deletion (indel) mutations at both alleles of the targeted gene. These indels were induced by Cas 9 nuclease, as well as Cas 9 -D 10 A single or dual <b>nickases,</b> and often disrupted gene function. To overcome this problem, we designed strategies to physically destroy or separate CRISPR target sites at the targeted allele and developed a bioinformatic pipeline to identify and eliminate clones harboring deleterious indels at the other allele. This two-pronged approach enables the reliable generation of knockin hPSC reporter cell lines free of unwanted mutations at the targeted locus...|$|R

40|$|Horizontal gene {{transfer}} (HGT) in bacteria and archaea occurs through phage transduction, transformation, or conjugation, {{and the latter}} is particularly important for the spread of antibiotic resistance. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci confer sequence-directed immunity against phages. A clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harbors a CRISPR spacer that matches the <b>nickase</b> gene present in nearly all staphylococcal conjugative plasmids. Here we show that CRISPR interference prevents conjugation and plasmid transformation in S. epidermidis. Insertion of a self-splicing intron into <b>nickase</b> blocks interference despite the reconstitution of the target sequence in the spliced mRNA, which indicates that the interference machinery targets DNA directly. We conclude that CRISPR loci counteract multiple routes of HGT and can limit the spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria.

40|$|Plasmids {{containing}} a direct repeat of plasmid R 388 oriT {{are capable of}} site-specific recombination, which results in deletion of the intervening DNA. This reaction occurs in the presence, {{but not in the}} absence, of the region of R 388 implicated in DNA processing during conjugation. This region contains three genes, trwA, trwB, and trwC. By using mutants of each of the three genes, it was demonstrated that only trwC is required for the oriT-specific recombination. Further analysis showed that the N-terminal 272 amino acids of the protein are sufficient to catalyze recombination. TrwC is also capable of promoting intermolecular recombination between two plasmids containing oriT, suggesting that double-strand breaks in both plasmid DNAs are involved in the process. Additionally, intramolecular recombination between R 388 oriT and R 46 oriT did not occur in the presence of both <b>nickases.</b> This suggests that the half-reactions at each oriT are not productive if they occur separately; therefore, an interaction between the recombination complexes formed at each recombining site is required.

However, mutagenic events caused by error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) -mediated repair are introduced with equal or higher frequency at the nuclease cleavage site. Furthermore, unintended mutations can also result from NHEJ-mediated repair of off-target nuclease cleavage sites. Here, we describe a simple and general method for converting engineered ZFNs into zinc finger <b>nickases</b> (ZFNickases) by inactivating the catalytic activity of one monomer in a ZFN dimer. ZFNickases show robust strand-specific nicking activity in vitro. In addition, we demonstrate that ZFNickases can stimulate HDR at their nicking site in human cells, albeit at a lower frequency than by the ZFNs from which they were derived. Finally, we find that ZFNickases appear to induce greatly reduced levels of mutagenic NHEJ at their target nicking site. ZFNickases thus provide a promising means for inducing HDR-mediated gene modifications while reducing unwanted mutagenesis caused by error-prone NHEJ...|$|R
40|$|Laminopathies are a {{group of}} genetic {{diseases}} affecting the nuclear lamina of metazoan cells with mutations in the genes LMNA, LMNB 1, and LMNB 2, which code for intermediate filament proteins called lamins. In LMNA alone, more than 180 mutations causing at least 14 diseases exist displaying a variety of phenotypes. Classical Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a progeroid, or accelerated aging, laminopathy caused by a de novo heterozygous point mutation in LMNA (c. 1824 C 3 ̆eT). The disease affects multiple organ systems resulting in apparent accelerated aging and early death due to atherosclerotic complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke. At the subcellular level, HGPS causes stiffening of the nuclear envelope, an increase in mechanosensitivity, inhibited DNA repair, aberrant chromatin organization, and other complications. Here, the CRISPR-Cas 9 genome editing system {{has been used to}} successfully incorporate the HGPS mutation into the human HT 1080 fibroblast cell line using paired D 10 A mutant Cas 9 <b>nickases</b> guided by truncated guide RNAs (tru-gRNAs) with low levels of off-target mutagenesis.

40|$|Parvoviral rolling hairpin {{replication}} generates palindromic genomic concatemers whose junctions {{are resolved}} to give unit-length genomes {{by a process}} involving DNA replication initiated at origins derived from each viral telomere. The left-end origin of minute virus of mice (MVM), oriL, contains binding sites for the viral initiator <b>nickase,</b> NS 1, and parvovirus initiation factor (PIF), {{a member of the}} emerging KDWK family of transcription factors. oriL is generated as an active form, oriLTC, and as an inactive form, oriLGAA, which contains a single additional nucleotide inserted between the NS 1 and PIF sites. Here we examined the interactions on oriLTC which lead to activation of NS 1 by PIF. The two subunits of PIF, p 79 and p 96, cooperatively bind two ACGT half-sites, which can be flexibly spaced. When coexpressed from recombinant baculoviruses, the PIF subunits preferentially form heterodimers which, in the presence of ATP, show cooperative binding with NS 1 on oriL, but this interaction is preferentially enhanced on oriLTC compared to oriLGAA. Without ATP, NS 1 is unable to bind stably to its cognate site, but PIF facilitates this interaction, rendering the NS 1 binding site, but not the nick site, resistant to DNase I. Varying the spacing of the PIF half-sites shows that the distance between the NS 1 binding site and the NS 1 -proximal half-site is critical for <b>nickase</b> activation, whereas the position of the distal half-site is unimportant. When expressed separately, both PIF subunits form homodimers that bind site specifically to oriL, but only complexes containing p 79 activate the NS 1 <b>nickase</b> function...|$|E

To perform its distinct activities in timely coordinated manner, NS 1 was suggested to be regulated by posttranslational modifications, in particular phosphorylation. In fact, NS 1 replicative functions are dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation, most likely due to alteration of the biochemical profile of the viral product as determined by comparing native NS 1 with its dephosphorylated counterpart. Through the characterization of NS 1 mutants at individual PKC consensus phosphorylation sites for their biochemical activities and <b>nickase</b> function, {{we were able to}} identify two target atypical PKC phosphorylation sites, T 435 and S 473, serving as regulatory elements for the initiation of viral DNA replication. Furthermore, by dissociating the energy-dependent helicase activity from the ATPase-independent trans esterification reaction using partially single-stranded substrates, we could demonstrate that atypical PKC regulation of NS 1 <b>nickase</b> activity occurs at the level of origin unwinding prior to trans esterification...|$|E
30|$|An {{alternative}} {{approach is to}} take advantage of the Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> that contains mutations in one of the two nuclease domains, HNH or RuvC, which cleave the DNA strand complementary and noncomplementary (respectively) to the sgRNA (Gasiunas et al., 2012; Jinek et al., 2012). A pair of Cas 9 nickases could generate two single-strand breaks adjacent to each other on opposite DNA strands when guided by two properly designed sgRNAs (Mali et al., 2013 a; Ran et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2014). The paired nickases exhibit higher specificity in editing because the generation of DSBs requires two independent binding events, whereas the nuclease Cas 9 requires only one binding event. A similar strategy is to fuse DNA-endonuclease-dead Cas 9 (dCas 9) to the dimerizing FokI nuclease. The dCas 9 -FokI fusion is an RNA-guided nuclease that cleaves DNA only when a pair of FokI domains is sufficiently close to form a dimer. Efficient cleavage occurs when two target sites are spaced approximately 13 – 25  bp apart (Guilinger et al., 2014; Wyvekens et al., 2015). Moreover, because the FokI nuclease activity relies on dimerization, this strategy also reduced unwanted mutagenesis compared to the Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> (Guilinger et al., 2014; Wyvekens et al., 2015). However, these approaches improve CRISPR specificity at the cost of reduced efficiency.|$|E

The subunit arrangement of its Fo domain has not been yet described in detail. At present, the research on ATP synthase research is focused mostly on revealing {{the structure of the}} proton channel a so {{that it is possible to}} precisely define the molecular mechanism of the ATP synthase rotation generation. The role of the supernumery subunits of Fo domain represents another unresolved issue. These proteins specific for eukaryotic ATP synthases are not essential for synthetic activity, instead they are putatively involved in assembly or stabilization of the enzyme complex. One of such subunits is the nuclear encoded MLQ protein (or also 6. 8 kDa proteolipid or MP 68), which is conserved only in vertebrates. The aim of this diploma thesis was to reveal the role of this subunit in the structure, assembly and function of the F 1 Fo-ATP synthase. For these purposes, cellular model of the HEK 293 line with the deficiency of the MLQ protein was established employing the CRISPR/Cas 9 method with paired <b>nickases</b> (the knock-out MLQ, MLQ KO) as part of the thesis.

50|$|Zinc-finger <b>nickases</b> (ZFNickases) {{are created}} by inactivating the {{catalytic}} activity of one ZFN monomer in the ZFN dimer required for double-strand cleavage. ZFNickases demonstrate strand-specific nicking activity in vitro and thus provide for highly specific single-strand breaks in DNA. These SSBs undergo the same cellular mechanisms for DNA that ZFNs exploit, but they show a significantly reduced frequency of mutagenic NHEJ repairs at their target nicking site. This reduction provides a bias for HR-mediated gene modifications. ZFNickases can induce targeted HR in cultured human and livestock cells, although at lower levels than corresponding ZFNs from which they were derived because nicks can be repaired without genetic alteration. A major limitation of ZFN-mediated gene modifications is the competition between NHEJ and HR repair pathways. Regardless {{of the presence of}} a DNA donor construct, both repair mechanisms can be activated following DSBs induced by ZFNs. Thus, ZFNickases is the first plausible attempt at engineering a method to favor the HR method of DNA repair as opposed to the error-prone NHEJ repair. By reducing NHEJ repairs, ZFNickases can thereby reduce the spectrum of unwanted off-target alterations. The ease by which ZFNickases can be derive from ZFNs provides a great platform for further studies regarding the optimization of ZFNickases and possibly increasing their levels of targeted HR while still maintain their reduced NHEJ frequency.|$|R

While the regulation of this gene editing reaction has been partially elucidated, the low frequency with which repair occurs has hampered development toward clinical application. In this work a CRISPR/Cas 9 complex is employed to induce double strand DNA breakage at specific sites surrounding the nucleotide designated for exchange. The result is a significant elevation in ssODN-directed gene repair, validated by a phenotypic readout. By analysing reaction parameters, we have uncovered restrictions on gene editing activity involving CRISPR/Cas 9 complexes. First, ssODNs that hybridize to the non-transcribed strand direct {{a higher level of}} gene repair than those that hybridize to the transcribed strand. Second, cleavage must be proximal to the targeted mutant base to enable higher levels of gene editing. Third, DNA cleavage enables a higher level of gene editing activity as compared to single-stranded DNA nicks, created by modified Cas 9 (<b>Nickases).</b> Fourth, we calculated the hybridization potential and free energy levels of ssODNs that are complementary to the guide RNA sequences of CRISPRs used in this study. We find a correlation between free energy potential and the capacity of single-stranded oligonucleotides to inhibit specific DNA cleavage activity, thereby indirectly reducing gene editing activity. Our data provide novel information that might be taken into consideration in the design and usage of CRISPR/Cas 9 systems with ssODNs for gene editing...|$|R

Site-specific approaches require {{a high level}} of knowledge at both the DNA and protein levels to implement highly specified genetic changes, while untargeted approaches require more extensive characterization after a desired mutant phenotype is screened or selected from a pool of randomly generated mutants. Localized mutagenesis techniques, such as error-prone PCR, have been developed to confine mutation to a specific region of DNA and offer an attractive compromise between untargeted and site-specific methods. However, inefficiencies in cloning, transformation, and library construction can make such approaches time consuming. We have developed a system for tunable mutagenesis localized to plasmid vectors based on the controlled overexpression of error-prone DNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) in growing Escherichia coli cells. We showed that mutation is elevated and confined to a target vector in our system due to co-expression of a DNA <b>nickase</b> and placement of its recognition site on target vectors. We provide evidence that this system's mechanism involves error-prone replication by Pol IV during the homologous recombination repair process, a mechanism previously proposed for stationary phase Pol IV-dependent mutation. In addition to providing mechanistic understanding, experiments with our system in diverse strain backgrounds helped to identify polB and mutS deletion backgrounds in which mutation was elevated, and confirmed the requirement for a toxin-antitoxin system encoded by the yafNOP genes, located downstream of chromosomal dinB, encoding Pol IV. We also examined the effects of different numbers of <b>nickase</b> recognition sites and the addition of chi sites to our target vectors, leading to increased mutation rates. Finally, we employed another localized mutagenesis technique to optimize our Pol IV and <b>nickase</b> overexpression system, showing that optimal mutation rates are achieved at lower copy numbers when the expression system is plasmid-borne. In the course of designing and improving our system, we developed new techniques to support mutation research.

It binds specifically to target DNA motifs; has site-specific single-strand <b>nickase,</b> intrinsic ATPase, and helicase activities; trans regulates viral and cellular promoters; and exerts cytotoxic stress on the host cell. To investigate whether these multiple ac-tivities of NS 1 depend on posttranslational modifications, in particular phosphorylation, we expressed His-tagged NS 1 in HeLa cells by using recombinant vaccinia viruses, dephosphorylated it at serine and threonine residues with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, and compared the biochemical activities of the purified un(der) phosphorylated (NS 1 O) and the native (NS 1 P) polypeptides.

In the presence of endogenous protein kinases found in replication extracts, NS 1 O showed all func-tions necessary for resolution and replication of the 3 * dimer bridge, indicating reactivation of NS 1 O by re-phosphorylation.

Clostridium cellulolyticum is a promising candidate for consolidated bioprocessing; however, its genetic manipulation {{to reduce the}} formation of less-valuable acetate is technically challenging due to the essentiality of acetate-producing genes. Here we developed a Cas 9 nickase-assisted chromosome-based RNA repression to stably manipulate essential genes in C. cellulolyticum. Our plasmid-based expression of antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules targeting the phosphotransacetylase (pta) gene successfully reduced the enzymatic activity by 35 % in cellobiose-grown cells, metabolically decreased the acetate titer by 15 and 52 % in wildtype transformants on cellulose and xylan, respectively. To control both acetate and lactate simultaneously, we transformed the repression plasmid into lactate production-deficient mutant and found the plasmid delivery reduced acetate titer by more than 33 %, concomitant with negligible lactate formation. The strains with pta gene repression generally diverted more carbon into ethanol. However, further testing on chromosomal integrants that were created by double-crossover recombination exhibited only very weak repression because DNA integration dramatically lessened gene dosage. With {{the design of a}} tandem repetitive promoter-driven asRNA module and the use of a new Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> genome editing tool, a chromosomal integrant (LM 3 P) was generated in a single step and successfully enhanced RNA repression, with a 27 % decrease in acetate titer on cellulose in antibiotic-free medium. These results indicate the effectiveness of tandem promoter-driven RNA repression modules in promoting gene repression in chromosomal integrants.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cells (hESCs) are an invaluable tool for studying human embryonic development and have great potential for drug development as well as cell replacement therapies. Progress in hESC research is greatly hindered by the difficulty of generating genetically modified hESC lines. Recently the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat- (CRISPR) CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas 9) system from Streptococcus pyogenes was shown to facilitate genetic engineering, but its applicability in gene targeting with long donor templates in hESCs has not been demonstrated, yet. The main objective {{of this study was}} to develop a strategy for rapid production of faithful hPSC fluorescent reporter lines. hESCs were targeted upstream to the stop codons of the pluripotency transcription factors NANOG and OCT 4 to generate NANOG-VENUS (NV) and OCT 4 -mCHERRY (OC) reporter lines expressing NV and OC fusion proteins, respectively. Homologous recombination was facilitated by targeting a site proximal to the insertion site with RNA-guided nucleases or double <b>nickases.</b> Furthermore the strategy involved the use of short homology arms to allow employing customizable synthetic DNA blocks and a promoter trap approach for positive selection to increase the targeting efficiency. The strategy allowed rapid and robust production of hESC reporter lines with high targeting efficiencies, though a double reporter line could not be derived in a single targeting step. In the NV reporter VENUS faithfully reflected NANOG expression, but further analyses are required to confirm the precision of the OC reporter. Despite low qualities of the CRISPR targets, mutations were only detected in a single off-target locus that was completely homologous to the target. However, at the on-target sites concomitant mutations were observed that could be prevented in the targeted allele by mutating the protospacer adjacent motif sequences in the homology arms. In conclusion, the CRISPR-Cas 9 tool from S. pyogenes is a simple and highly efficient tool that facilitates gene targeting using long donor templates.

Here we demonstrate and characterize the ability of CRISPR-Cas derived nickases to direct targeted recombination of both small and large genomic regions flanked by repetitive elements in Escherichia coli. While CRISPR directed double-stranded DNA breaks are highly lethal in many bacteria, we show that CRISPR-guided <b>nickase</b> systems can be programmed to make precise, nonlethal, single-stranded incisions in targeted genomic regions. This induces recombination events and leads to targeted deletion. We demonstrate that dual-targeted nicking enables deletion of 36 and 97 Kb of the genome. Furthermore, multiplex targeting enables deletion of 133 Kb, accounting for approximately 3 % of the entire E. coli genome. This technology provides a framework for methods to manipulate bacterial genomes using CRISPR-nickase systems. We envision this system working synergistically with preexisting bacterial genome engineering methods...|$|E
30|$|Including an {{exciting}} {{piece of work}} published in this volume of Protein and Cell, two groups demonstrated that base editing {{can be applied to}} generate mouse models with precise modification very efficiently (Kim et al., 2017). Kim and colleagues used BE 3 system, which is composed of Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> linked to APOBEC 1 domain and uracil glycosylase inhibitor (rAPOBEC 1 -nCas 9 -UGI) (Komor et al., 2016). They delivered BE 3 enzyme into mouse zygotes in either mRNA or protein form by either microinjection or electroporation (Qin et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016). Although some mice with precise C to T substitution were obtained, indel mutations were also identified quite often in these mice, potentially due to the Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> activity (Kim et al., 2017). In comparison, Liang and colleagues took a more cautious approach. First they used BE 2 system composed of dCas 9, therefore will not generate DNA single strand nick. Second, they incorporated five point mutations into dCas 9 to improve its specificity (Kleinstiver et al., 2016) and named the system HF 2 -BE 2. After introducing this enzyme into mouse zygotes, efficient base editing was observed in both embryos and live born mice, consistent with Kim et al.’s results. Although dCas 9 was used in this system, they still identified indel mutations in some founder mice, which is not totally surprising considering activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is known to play important roles in class-switch recombination (CSR) at immunoglobulin loci (Delker et al., 2009). Unexpectedly, they found cytidine deamination outside of the sgRNA recognition sequence, albeit proximal (named as proximal-site deamination). This phenomenon has not been reported in previous studies in cell lines (Komor et al., 2016; Nishida et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016). Comparing to plasmid transfection, microinjection will deliver much more enzyme into the zygotes, and higher enzyme activity might lead to cytidine deamination in proximal region.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMembers of the Parvoviridae family all encode a {{non-structural}} protein 1 (NS 1) that directs replication of single-stranded viral DNA, packages viral DNA into capsid, {{and serves as}} a potent transcriptional activator. Here we report the X-ray structure of the minute virus of mice (MVM) NS 1 N-terminal domain at 1. 45 Å resolution, showing that sites for dsDNA binding, ssDNA binding and cleavage, nuclear localization, and other functions are integrated on a canonical fold of the histidine-hydrophobic-histidine superfamily of nucleases, including elements specific for this Protoparvovirus but distinct from its Bocaparvovirus or Dependoparvovirus orthologs. High resolution structural analysis reveals a <b>nickase</b> active site with an architecture that allows highly versatile metal ligand binding. The structures support a unified mechanism of replication origin recognition for homotelomeric and heterotelomeric parvoviruses, mediated by a basic-residue-rich hairpin and an adjacent helix in the initiator proteins and by tandem tetranucleotide motifs in the replication origins...|$|E
40|$|Homology {{directed}} repair (HDR) -based {{genome editing}} via selectable long flanking arm donors can be hampered by local transgene silencing at transcriptionally silent loci. Here, we report efficient bi-allelic modification of a silent locus in patient-derived hiPSC by using Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> and a silencing-resistant donor construct that contains an excisable selection/counter-selection cassette. To identify {{the most active}} single guide RNA (sgRNA) /nickase combinations, we employed a lentiviral vector-based reporter assay to determine the HDR efficiencies in cella. Next, we used the most efficient pair of sgRNAs for targeted integration of an improved, silencing-resistant plasmid donor harboring a piggyBac-flanked puro Delta tk cassette. Moreover, we took advantage of a dual-fluorescence selection strategy for bi-allelic targeting and achieved 100 % counter-selection efficiency after bi-allelic excision of the selection/counter-selection cassette. Together, we present an improved system for efficient bi-allelic modification of transcriptionally silent loci in human pluripotent stem cells...|$|E
40|$|Designer nucleases such as TALENS and Cas 9 {{have opened}} new {{opportunities}} to scarlessly edit the mammalian genome. Here we explored several parameters that influence Cas 9 -mediated scarless genome editing efficiency in murine embryonic stem cells. Optimization of transfection conditions and enriching for transfected cells {{are critical for}} efficiently recovering modified clones. Paired gRNAs and wild-type Cas 9 efficiently create programmed deletions, which facilitate identification of targeted clones, while paired gRNAs and the Cas 9 D 10 A <b>nickase</b> generated smaller targeted indels with lower chance of off-target mutagenesis. Genome editing is also useful for programmed introduction of exogenous DNA sequences at a target locus. Increasing {{the length of the}} homology arms of the homology-directed repair template strongly enhanced targeting efficiency, while increasing the length of the DNA insert reduced it. Together our data provide guidance on optimal design of scarless gene knockout, modification, or knock-in experiments using Cas 9 nuclease...|$|E
40|$|SummaryTargeted {{genome editing}} {{technologies}} have enabled {{a broad range}} of research and medical applications. The Cas 9 nuclease from the microbial CRISPR-Cas system is targeted to specific genomic loci by a 20 nt guide sequence, which can tolerate certain mismatches to the DNA target and thereby promote undesired off-target mutagenesis. Here, we describe an approach that combines a Cas 9 <b>nickase</b> mutant with paired guide RNAs to introduce targeted double-strand breaks. Because individual nicks in the genome are repaired with high fidelity, simultaneous nicking via appropriately offset guide RNAs is required for double-stranded breaks and extends the number of specifically recognized bases for target cleavage. We demonstrate that using paired nicking can reduce off-target activity by 50 - to 1, 500 -fold in cell lines and to facilitate gene knockout in mouse zygotes without sacrificing on-target cleavage efficiency. This versatile strategy enables a wide variety of genome editing applications that require high specificity...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} P 1 recombination enhancement function (Ref) {{protein is}} a RecA-dependent pro-grammable endonuclease. Ref targets displacement loops formed when an oligonucleotide is {{bound by a}} RecA filament and invades homologous double-stranded DNA sequences. Mechanistic details of this reaction have been explored, revealing that (i) Ref is <b>nickase,</b> cleaving the two target strands of a displacement loop sequentially, (ii) the two strands are cleaved in a prescribed order, with the paired strand cut first and (iii) the two cleavage events have different requirements. Cutting the paired strand is rapid, does not require RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis and is promoted even by Ref active site variant H 153 A. The displaced strand is cleaved much more slowly, requires RecA-mediated ATP hydrolysis and does not occur with Ref H 153 A. The two cleavage events are also affected differently by solution conditions. We pos-tulate that the second cleavage (displaced strand) is limited by some activity of RecA protein...|$|E
