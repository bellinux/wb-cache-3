5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{introduced to}} {{areas such as}} Australia or North America, where {{other members of the}} genus are absent, may affect <b>native</b> <b>species</b> through competition for nest holes. In North America, chickadees, nuthatches, woodpeckers, purple martins and other swallows may be affected. In Australia, competitors for nesting sites include the crimson and eastern rosellas. For its role in the decline of local <b>native</b> <b>species</b> and the damages to agriculture, the common starling has been included in the IUCN List of the world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E

5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to <b>native</b> <b>species</b> when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem. Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on <b>native</b> <b>species</b> is Australia, where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern quoll, as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E

5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target <b>native</b> <b>species.</b> In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today.

5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of <b>native</b> <b>species</b> is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, have revealed that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|In the forests, {{endangered}} birds {{such as the}} yellowhead (mohua) and kakariki (New Zealand parakeet) occur, as {{do other}} birds such as the tui, fantail (piwakawaka), and kererū (New Zealand pigeon).

40|$|Chongqing; urban forest; <b>native</b> trees; tree <b>species</b> evaluation; {{analysis}} hierarchy process This paper studied on <b>native</b> tree <b>species</b> {{resources for}} urban forest in Chongqing through field survey methods combining with literature review and visit, {{and then we}} established <b>native</b> tree <b>species</b> resources for urban forest evaluation system by the method of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), confirmed evaluation factors and their weights to evaluate <b>native</b> tree <b>species</b> resources for urban forest objectively and quantificationally. The results showed {{that there were more}} than 2300 <b>species</b> of <b>native</b> trees in Chongqing, including 600 species of trees and 1 700 species of shrubs. Because a grade 1 and 2 native trees such as Celtis sinensis and Cornus controversa have strong resistance, good ecological benefits and high ornamental value, so they should be energetically applied in the city forest construction. A grade 3 native trees such as Salix babylonica are complementary configuration trees. Our results suggest that Chongqing has abundant <b>native</b> tree <b>species</b> resources, which contribute to increase the city forest species diversity, enrich city forest landscape and improve the city environment...|$|R

40|$|Fish species {{diversity}} in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, has declined following {{establishment of the}} introduced fish species in the lake. Most of the <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> have disappeared and the lake is now dominated by the introduced Nile perch, Lates niloticus and the Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. The dominant <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> include Synodontis afrofischeri, Schilbe intermedius, Rastrineobola argentea and Brycinussadleri. Some of the <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> that have disappeared from Lake Nabugabo were reported to occur in lakes Kayugi and Kayanja, which are adjacent to Lake Nabugabo but separated from it by extensive papyrus swamps. The Nabugabo lakes are satellite water bodies in the Lake Victoria basin, which {{is known to have}} experienced fish species changes due to the introduction of the Nile perch Lates niloticus during the 1960 s. The Nabugabo lakes comprising of Lake Nabugabo main, and the smaller lakes Kayanja and Kayugi were investigated between 2000 and 2002 with experimental gill netting to evaluate the potential of these lakes in conservation of fish {{species diversity}}. Results show that some <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> especially Oreochromis esculentus, and Oreochromis variabilis and the haplochromine cichlid Prognathochromis venator that have disappeared from Lake Nabugabo still occur in Lakes Kayanja and Kayugi. Inshore habitats with macrophyte cover were also found to be important habitats for the endangered <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> in the Nabugabo lakes. These lakes and inshore habitats need to be protected to conserve the endangered <b>native</b> fish <b>species</b> and to reduce further decline in fish species diversity...|$|R

40|$|Due to its rapid growth, the {{introduced}} mangrove species Sonneratia apetala from Bangladesh {{has been}} widely used in mangrove restoration in southeastern China since 1985. As an indigenous mangrove species in Hainan, China, Sonneratia caseolaris was also planted in Guangdong Province for afforestation purposes. Both species have developed well in their new habitats, but their ecophysiological differences with the <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species</b> have not been studied. In this study, leaf gas exchange, water and nitrogen use efficiencies of two Sonneratia species were {{compared with those of}} selected <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species</b> (Avicennia marina, Aegiceras corniculatum, Kandelia candel, and Excoecaria agallocha) in Hainan and Shenzhen. The introduced S. apetala maintained lower carbon assimilation rate (A) and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) than the indigenous S. caseolaris. In Shenzhen, the two introduced Sonneratia had comparable photosynthetic rates and water use efficiency (WUE) with the <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species,</b> except that PNUE in S. caseolaris was significantly higher than in the <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species.</b> The two Sonneratia species showed significant overlap in PNUE and long-term WUE. Photosynthetic parameters derived from leaf photosynthetic light-response curves and A-C-i curves also suggested lower carbon assimilation capacities for the introduced Sonneratia than for the <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species</b> in both study sites. The lower light compensation point (LCP) of two introduced Sonneratia in both study sites also indicated a better adaptation to a low light regime than the <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species.</b> The results of photosynthetic capacities indicated that the introduced mangrove species have little competitive advantage over local <b>native</b> mangrove <b>species</b> in their respective new habitats.
