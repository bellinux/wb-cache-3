25|$|In Judaism, {{the day of}} {{judgment}} happens every year on Rosh Hashanah; therefore, the belief in a last day {{of judgment}} for all mankind is disputed. Some rabbis hold {{that there will be}} such a day following the resurrection of the dead. Others hold that there is no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> because of Rosh Hashanah. Yet others hold that this accounting and judgment happens when one dies. Other rabbis hold that the last judgment only applies to the gentile nations and not the Jewish people.|$|E
25|$|The People's Republic of China {{is by far}} {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6–12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.|$|E

Relations with the Menteri Besar of Johor, Othman Saat deteriorated when the latter questioned [...] Iskandar's legitimacy to the throne, which led to an incident which saw the Sultan issuing an order to the Menteri Besar to vacate his office within 24 hours, shortly after Sultan Ismail's death, citing reasons for the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> office space for his own. The Menteri Besar heeded his order, though the Sultan did not move in as he had said. Othman Saat subsequently resigned the following year as the Menteri Besar.|$|E

2500|$|Having an individual’s genomic {{information}} can be significant {{in the process of}} developing drugs as they await approval from the FDA for public use. Having a detailed account of an individual’s genetic make-up can be a major asset in deciding if a patient can be chosen for inclusion or exclusion in the final stages of a clinical trial. Being able to identify patients who will benefit most from a clinical trial will increase the safety of patients from adverse outcomes caused by the product in testing, and will allow smaller and faster trials that lead to lower overall costs. In addition, drugs that are deemed ineffective for the larger population can gain approval by the FDA by using personal genomes to qualify the effectiveness and <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> specific drug or therapy even though it may only be needed by a small percentage of the population., ...|$|E
2500|$|Soviet oil {{continued}} to flow to Germany, mostly by rail from Varna, Bulgaria directly to Wilhelmshaven. [...] German officials noted that over 1,500 tons of oil had been shipped monthly for five months, using about 900 German tank cars exclusively dedicated for that traffic. [...] Hitler characterized the German <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> oil as [...] "most pressing." [...] He however noted that [...] "This {{will not become}} critical as long as Romania and Russia continue their supplies and hydrogenation plants can be adequately protected against air attacks." [...] After the forced Soviet occupation of Romania territories Bessarabia and Bucovina, Germany wanted the 100,000 tons of grain for which they had previously contracted with Bessarabia, guarantees of German property safety in Romania and reassurance that the train tracks carrying Romanian oil would be left alone. [...] However, Germany had captured Norway's molybdenum mines, agreed to an oil-for arms pact with Romania in May and gained rail access to Spain with the capture of France.|$|E

2500|$|At 17:00, Mussolini, {{dressed in}} a blue suit and a soft grey hat, and escorted by several cars bearing agents of the [...] "presidenziale" [...] (which halted outside the villa), arrived at the Villa Savoia. He brought with him {{the law of the}} Grand Council, the OdG Grandi and the letter of Cianetti. The King awaited him {{at the foot of the}} patio stair of the villa. The Duce started to speak, trying to {{convince}} Victor Emmanuel that the OdG had no legal value, and that many of its supporters had changed their minds in the night. The King interrupted him, and told him softly that the country was broken and that the situation required him to quit his post: the new President of the Council of Ministers would be Marshal Badoglio. Mussolini, visibly shaken, answered: [...] "Then is it over? It is over, it is over. But what will happen to me, to my family?". The King assured him that he would personally take care of his security and that of his family. Victor Emmanuel accompanied him to the door, where he met Captain Vigneri. The Duce went to his car, but the captain told him to go to a nearby ambulance, for his security. Mussolini answered that there was no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> but followed the captain. When the rear door opened, he saw three Carabinieri and three policemen sitting on the side banks, and said: [...] "The policemen too? No!" [...] but the captain took his left elbow and led him into the ambulance, which then left the villa's park and rushed through the streets of Rome until reaching the [...] "Podgora" [...] army barracks in Trastevere. After one hour, he was moved to the [...] "Legnano" [...] Carabinieri barracks, in Prati.|$|E
