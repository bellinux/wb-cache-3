5|$|In a {{revision}} of the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial data in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues showed that the oribi is the sister taxon to all other antilopines.

5|$|Although {{authorised}} {{the second}} half of the project – known as Drax Completion – was deferred, because during the project's gestation the Board's energy mix policy shifted to working towards a majority nuclear system. The Board decided in 1977 that construction of the final three units would commence in 1979 with the target of commissioning in 1985/6, as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal, <b>nuclear,</b> <b>and</b> oil. However later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of requirements, in order to secure jobs in the North East's heavy manufacturing industries. The Board agreed to this subject to being compensated.|$|E
5|$|Antilope, Eudorcas, Gazella and Nanger form a clade {{within their}} tribe Antilopini. A 1995 {{study of the}} {{detailed}} karyotype of Antilope suggested that within this clade, Antilope is closest to the Gazella group. A 1999 phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Antilope is the closest sister taxon to Gazella, although an earlier phylogeny, proposed in 1976, placed Antilope as sister to Nanger. In a more recent revision of the phylogeny of Antilopini {{on the basis of}} sequences from multiple <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial loci in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues reexamined the phylogenetic relationships and found Antilope and Gazella to be sister genera distinct from the sister genera Nanger and Eudorcas.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial genes.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a revision of}} the phylogeny of the tribe Antilopini {{on the basis of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial data. They showed that the springbok and the gerenuk (Litocranius walleri) form a clade with saiga (Saiga tatarica) as sister taxon. The study pointed out that the saiga and the springbok could be considerably {{different from the rest of}} the antilopines; a 2007 phylogenetic study even suggested that the two form a clade sister to the gerenuk. The cladogram below is based on the 2013 study.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, a phylogenetic {{analyses}} using <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences {{helped to}} clarify the phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C.cinnabarinum and C.ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily related to the monophyletic Boletales clade, and separate from clades containing most of the gilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Veligaster. Calostoma {{is thought to have}} diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52–115 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E

5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information.

5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans.

A study of <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
5|$|The game is set {{during a}} fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, {{in which both}} sides use <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> {{chemical}} weapons against each other.

Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.|$|E
5|$|After the Planck epoch and {{inflation}} came the quark, hadron, and lepton epochs. Together, these epochs encompassed less than 10 seconds of time following the Big Bang. The observed abundance {{of the elements}} {{can be explained by}} combining the overall expansion of space with <b>nuclear</b> <b>and</b> atomic physics. As the Universe expands, the energy density of electromagnetic radiation decreases more quickly than does that of matter because the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. As the Universe expanded and cooled, elementary particles associated stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, {{in the early part of}} the matter-dominated era, stable protons and neutrons formed, which then formed atomic nuclei through nuclear reactions. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, led to the present abundances of lighter nuclei, particularly hydrogen, deuterium, and helium. Big Bang nucleosynthesis ended about 20 minutes after the Big Bang, when the Universe had cooled enough so that nuclear fusion could no longer occur. At this stage, matter in the Universe was mainly a hot, dense plasma of negatively charged electrons, neutral neutrinos and positive nuclei. This era, called the photon epoch, lasted about 380 thousand years.|$|E
