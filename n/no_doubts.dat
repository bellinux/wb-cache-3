5|$|In August 2016, new {{information}} about Wallenberg's death came to light when the diary of KGB head Ivan Serov surfaced after Serov's granddaughter found the diary hidden in a wall of her house. “I have <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> that Wallenberg was liquidated in 1947” Serov wrote.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> {{about her}} loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws on religion as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> about Henson's doctrinal soundness, {{and persuaded}} him to issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without feeling that they had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E

Alexei Gusev, general director of the Aviakor factory, said that the aircraft's three engines had been repaired and technicians had upgraded the plane's avionics at a recent overhaul the previous year. He said that there were <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> about the plane's airworthiness.|$|E

25|$|As {{the decade}} started Rata Blanca, Horcas, Hermética and J.A.F had very respectable careers. Rata Blanca was internationally approved: in fact, it is {{plausible}} to state that their classic metal sound was more popular outside Argentina than within. Internationally popular {{to a lesser extent}} was Hermética, the arch-rivals of Rata Blanca (both formed in 1987 when V8 disbanded), but there were <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> of their massive following at home. Horcas and J.A.F stayed mostly successful in the local medium, though nonetheless had some overseas exposure.|$|E

It sold only 30,000 copies on its initial release, and the band's record company, Interscope Records, refused to fund {{the release of a}} single from it. <b>No</b> <b>Doubt</b> therefore financed the production of a music video for the song [...] "Trapped in a Box", which was received local airplay in Orange County, California but did not attract mainstream attention. <b>No</b> <b>Doubt</b> recorded their second album, The Beacon Street Collection, in March 1995. It was released independently, because <b>No</b> <b>Doubt</b> had recorded many songs that they knew would not make it onto Tragic Kingdom and were frustrated by a lack of attention from their label. They released two singles from it: [...] "Squeal" [...] and [...] "Doghouse". The Beacon Street Collection sold 100,000 copies. <b>No</b> <b>Doubt's</b> independence shocked their company representative and ensured that the label would finance a third album.|$|R

25|$|There are however <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> {{concerning}} {{the outbreak of}} the plague in late November 1710 in the small village of Lappen just north of Helsingør, populated by fishermen, ferrymen and nautical pilots. The first death attributed to the plague was that of a fisherman's daughter on 14 November; the peak of the plague in Lappen was reached already on 23 December, and while it faded out there in January 1711, it had already spread to or continued in neighboring Helsingør. More than 1,800 people died in Helsingør in 1711, or roughly two thirds of its ~3,000 inhabitants.|$|E

However, the report went on to claim {{that none of the}} cricketers were found guilty. On the reliability of the report, Rajat Sharma, the editor-in-chief of news channel India TV quoted that the channel had <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> about the authenticity of the sting operation and prepared to go to court.|$|E
25|$|Except for Sale all the {{mentioned}} villages {{were lying}} {{in the vicinity of}} Rybnik, thus it is problematic to localise where the settlement was supposed to be. Some historians identify it with Solca. The village had already a church (ecclesia), undoubtedly one of the oldest in the region, perhaps built during the reign of Mieszko I Tanglefoot. Again the village was mentioned in 1229 in the document of Pope Gregory IX issued for Benedictine abbey in Tyniec as Sal, leaving <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> to its localisation close to Orlová. The village with an inn was endowed to Orlová abbey founded in 1268, and attested in the associated document again as Sal. In the next centuries the name of the village evolved into Solec/Solca.|$|E

25|$|The first Bifrenaria {{species to}} be {{described}} was in 1824 by English Botanist William Jackson Hooker, under the name Dendrobium harrisoniae. Three years later, he also described the first small-flowered species, B. racemosa, but placed it in Maxillaria. With these two publications began {{a long series of}} species descriptions and confusing genera creation which generated much doubt for the next two centuries. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew registers the submission of 69 species or subspecific taxa under Bifrenaria since the description of the first species. Among these, twenty are generally accepted but only seventeen are truly well established, with <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> about their limits and classification. Thirteen other species are still accepted but now placed in other genera, and four or five, due to deficiencies in their descriptions, might never be definitely identified.|$|E
25|$|Poirot tells Lord Charles of Lady Julia's offer {{but that}} she is mistaken, as {{she does not know}} that her son was busy with Leonie at the time in question. Poirot {{explains}} that Mrs. Macatta was heard snoring in her room, Mrs. Vanderlyn was heard to call for Leonie from upstairs, and Sir George was with Lord Charles on the terrace. Everyone is accounted except for Carlile and Lord Charles. As Carlile has access to the safe at all times and could have taken tracings at his leisure, only Lord Charles is left. Poirot has <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> that Lord Charles put the plans in his own pocket. His motive is linked back to a denial given some years earlier that he was involved in negotiations with a belligerent foreign power. As he was indeed involved in such activities he must now have been blackmailed to hand over the plans via Mrs. Vanderlyn. Poirot has no doubt that the plans she holds are subtly altered so as to make the design unworkable. Lord Charles confesses to the deception but insists that his motive, refusing to be derailed from leading Britain through the coming world crisis, is pure.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E

25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case: the boy's family was Christian, though without foreign protection. [...] The Greek Christian population of Rhodes, meanwhile, had <b>no</b> <b>doubts</b> that the boy had been murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes. An eyewitness reported: [...] "It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews. The whole island was agitated {{from one end to the}} other."
