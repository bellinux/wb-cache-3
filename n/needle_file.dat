2500|$|They {{were walking}} along the {{promenade}} when the 25-year-old Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni approached them, attempting to peer underneath the empress's parasol. According to Sztáray, as the ship's bell announced the departure, Lucheni seemed to stumble and made a movement with his hand {{as if he wanted}} to maintain his balance. In reality, in an act of [...] "propaganda of the deed", he had stabbed Elisabeth with a sharpened <b>needle</b> <b>file</b> that was [...] long (used to file the eyes of industrial needles) that he had inserted into a wooden handle.|$|E
5000|$|September 10, 1898 - Luigi Lucheni stabs {{to death}} Empress Elisabeth, the consort of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary, with a <b>needle</b> <b>file</b> in Geneva, Switzerland. Lucheni is {{sentenced to life}} in prison and {{eventually}} commits suicide in his cell.|$|E

50|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>files</b> {{are small}} files {{that are used}} in {{applications}} where the surface finish takes priority over metal removal rates but they are most suited for smaller work pieces. They are often sold in sets, including different shapes.|$|R
50|$|Escapement files, {{also known}} as watchmaker's files, are a {{classification}} of short, (very) thin files with bastard-cut or embedded diamond surfaces, similar to <b>needle</b> <b>files</b> in form and function but smaller. Typical dimensions are {{on the order of}} approximately 100-140 mm (4-5 in.) in length and 3-5 mm (- in.) in width. Best used for fine, delicate work on small pieces or mechanisms (such as escapements), escapement files are commonly used by clock and watchmakers, as well as in crafting jewelry.|$|R
50|$|While she {{was waiting}} to board the ship, Lucheni ran {{over to her and}} slammed his body against hers, {{penetrating}} her chest with a sharp <b>needle</b> <b>file</b> (which is now part of the Sisi Museum exhibition at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna). Not realising she was hurt because of her extremely tight corset, and wanting to board as quickly as possible, Elisabeth got to her feet straight away and boarded the steamer. The vessel departed but quickly turned around when it was realised that Elisabeth was injured. She was carried back to the Beau-Rivage hotel on an improvised stretcher and two doctors were summoned, but they pronounced her dead at 2:10 pm.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as <b>needles,</b> endodontic <b>files</b> in root canal therapy, metal posts in root canal-treated teeth, temporary crowns and crowns for deciduous teeth, and arch wires and brackets in orthodontics. The surgical stainless steel alloys (e.g., 316 low-carbon steel) have also been used in some of the early dental implants.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 12 {{he created}} his first dress with his mother’s {{curtains}} due to the scarce resources found on the island. He created not only garments but also the tools needed to make them. He recalls “sharpening his <b>needles</b> with nail <b>files</b> and candle wax… only able to replace them when family members or friends would visit {{not only from the}} United States but from the European community as well.” ...|$|R
60|$|We all {{experienced}} {{at this time}} a severe disappointment in the non-appearance of the Esquimaux from the coast. The captain {{said they would be}} sure to come off to us, as they had always been in the habit of doing so, for the purpose of exchanging ivory and oil for saws, <b>files,</b> <b>needles,</b> etcetera, a large chestful of which is put on board annually for this purpose. The ivory usually procured from them is walrus tusks. These are not very large, and are of inferior quality.|$|R
50|$|Early {{microphones}} did {{not produce}} intelligible speech, until Alexander Graham Bell made improvements including a variable-resistance microphone/transmitter. Bell's liquid transmitter consisted of a metal cup filled with water {{with a small amount}} of sulfuric acid added. A sound wave caused the diaphragm to move, forcing a needle to move up and down in the water. The electrical resistance between the wire and the cup was then inversely proportional to the size of the water meniscus around the submerged <b>needle.</b> Elisha Gray <b>filed</b> a caveat for a version using a brass rod instead of the needle. Other minor variations and improvements were made to the liquid microphone by Majoranna, Chambers, Vanni, Sykes, and Elisha Gray, and one version was patented by Reginald Fessenden in 1903. These were the first working microphones, but they were not practical for commercial application. The famous first phone conversation between Bell and Watson took place using a liquid microphone.|$|R
