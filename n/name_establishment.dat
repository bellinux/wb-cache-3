40|$|The maize milling {{industry}} is highly characterised by continuous growth in maize milling and retailing margins {{in real terms}} (Traub and Jayne, 2004) despite the benefits and opportunities {{brought about by the}} deregulation of the South African maize market in 1997. This may be indicative of the inability of small and medium-scale maize milling enterprises (SMSMMEs) to emerge and compete with large-scale maize millers. This paper examines the constraints faced by SMSMMEs in South Africa. Data were collected {{with the aid of a}} structured questionnaire. Millers were asked to identify the various challenges facing their enterprises. Some key constraints identified were; high transport costs, high maize prices, brand <b>name</b> <b>establishment</b> and government policies such as the compulsory maize meal fortification regulation and high taxes. Other perceived constraints included lack of adequate infrastructure, storage facilities, access to credit and seasonality of maize grain.

40|$|Village {{extension}} {{has been}} pursuant to Article 2 of 2005 No. 73 Government Regulation and 2000 No. 129 Government Regulation. Both mention about village establishment including the compilation of several villages or the nearby parts of village, or the extension from one village into {{two or more}} villages. The formation, extension, elimination and compilation should be aimed at improving public welfare because these consider the improvement to public service, the acceleration of local economic development implementation, the acceleration of area management, the improvement of security and orderliness, and the improvement of compatible relationship between central and local. This phenomenon produces the author’s interest to reveal this condit ion in research titled with Rural Area Extension Process based on 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation of Banjarbaru City. Research aims to examine the process of extension {{and its impact on}} Guntung Payung Village (host village) and Guntung Manggis (village as extension result) after extension, related to this public service. Research locates at Guntung Payung and Guntung Manggis Villages. Research sample includes 3 persons, Sub-Division Head of Banjarbaru City Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Payung Village and Chief of Guntung Manggis Village. Data collection method involves primary and secondary data. Data analysis technique concerns with qualitative measure. Results of research indicate that Guntung Payung Village extends into Guntung Payung Village and Guntung Manggis Village pursuant to 2000 No. 129 Local Regulation in considering administrative fundamental and technical requirement of an extension. Socialization takes 2 or 3 months before the extension and involves all public components in addition to public representation, leader of neighborhood association, and religious figure of Guntung Payung. Socialization involves a meeting to invite all related representative figures of Guntung Payung. The realization of new area extension seems ended in 2004 and it relates to technical and administrative requirements. The idealist of area extension for Guntung Payung Village will be the government of Banjarbaru City, executive or legislative in Sub-Division of Area Development and Agrarian, Chief of Guntung Manggis Village, Chief of Guntung Payung Village, public figure and religious figure. The implementation of area extension complies with 2004 No. 32 Act, and Banjarbaru’s Article 3 of 2003 No. 4 Local Regulation. <b>Name</b> <b>establishment</b> involves some public figures instead of the community. The selection and establishment for Guntung Manggis name consider the history and the location in south of Jalan Ahmad Yani, previously recognized as Guntung Manggis. The impact on Guntung Payung Village ensures the facilitation for administration in which public service seems optimized because the community don’t have to wait too long in the bureaucracy of local government and don’t have to go distant. Administration process gets faster to complete. Public access to government’s public service gets closer and indeed, benefits the community. Government’s public management of development becomes more effective because of the narrower management scope and more optimized governmental program plan to realize. The negative impact emphasizes on the old village in which the employment volume decreases. The yet updated data on extension, ID Card, Post Code, etc, just make it worse...|$|E
