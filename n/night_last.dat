25|$|The return {{excursion}} train {{which was}} due to leave London at ten minutes before twelve on Saturday <b>night</b> <b>last</b> arrived at Bourne between three and four o'clock on Sunday morning. When near the platform at Bourne station the engine came into violent collision with two empty carriages which were standing upon the line, driving them completely through two very strong gates at the South Street crossing, one of the gates being smashed to splinters, and the carriages considerably damaged. There were nine passengers (including two ladies) in the carriage attached to the engine {{and we have not}} heard of anyone sustaining greater injury than a severe shaking. One gentleman's hat was smashed {{to such an extent that}} he has put in a claim for a new one.|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] {{began as}} a 29-page {{untitled}} manuscript that Hemingway cut to seven pages; at first he called the story [...] "One <b>Night</b> <b>Last</b> Summer". In 1924, the seven-page story titled [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was published by the Transatlantic Review in the [...] "Works in Progress" [...] section, along with a piece from James Joyce's manuscript Finnegans Wake. A year later on October5, 1925, [...] "Indian Camp" [...] was republished by Boni & Liveright in New York, in an expanded American edition of Hemingway's first {{collection of short stories}} titled In Our Time, (with capitals) with a print-run of 1335 copies.|$|E
500|$|... "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be the third episode of the season, but NBC programmers moved {{it to the end}} of the season because they felt its slow pace and lack of traditional action was inappropriate early in the series, when the show was trying to woo viewers. The broadcast schedule change led to some consistency and time-line errors, which Homicide producers addressed by adding the words [...] "One hot <b>night,</b> <b>last</b> September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode. Actress N'Bushe Wright makes a guest appearance as a cleaning woman who loses her baby in the police station.|$|E

500|$|... "One of Us" [...] was {{watched by}} 12.09million Americans, ranking Lost as the twentieth most watched {{program of the}} week. Lost {{defeated}} CBS' [...] by 53% among adults 18-49, the largest ever margin of victory for Lost over CSI: NY in original episodes. The ratings were also an increase over the previous episode, and improved the timeslot by 5.7million viewers over the same <b>night</b> <b>last</b> year. Lost was the fifth most watched program for the week in the key adults 18-49 demographic, achieving 5.2million viewers. In the United Kingdom, the episode attracted 1.09 million viewers, and was the second most watched program of the week on the non-terrestrial channels, beaten only by Live FA Cup Football.|$|E
500|$|Writing about The Year of the Sex Olympics in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith {{felt that}} Kneale {{was one of}} the few {{television}} writers whose work was particularly memorable. Once upon a time, Lord Hailsham, proceeding to the chamber of the House in black stockings and full-bottomed wig as Lord High Chancellor, spotted a friend and cried lustily, [...] "Neil!" [...] They say a whole party of American tourists fell to their knees. At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last <b>night...</b> <b>last</b> year... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly the first time I saw The Year of the Sex Olympics by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.|$|E
500|$|Running {{the episode}} out of {{sequence}} produced several notable continuity errors. For example, Bayliss and Pembleton are still working on the Adena Watson murder, which they had stopped investigating in the earlier episode [...] "Three Men and Adena". Additionally, Officer Thormann is seen onscreen working and healthy, although he was blinded in the earlier episode [...] "" [...] {{as a result of}} a gunshot wound to the head that forced him to leave the police department. These consistency errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot <b>night,</b> <b>last</b> September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order. The Watson case depicted in the episode was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series.|$|E

500|$|... "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the first-season finale, while [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was meant to be the third episode. However, NBC programmers felt it was too slow-paced to run so early in the season: the episode takes place entirely within the squad room and lacked traditional police drama action, which NBC executives felt was not appropriate for an early stage when the series was still trying to woo viewers. As a result, [...] "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was shown out of sequence and made the season finale. This created several notable continuity errors. For example, Officer Chris Thormann has not yet been shot and blinded in [...] "Night of the Dead Living", and Tim Bayliss is still working on the Adena Watson case, which was already ended earlier in the season. These errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot <b>night,</b> <b>last</b> September..." [...] {{to the beginning of the}} episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order.|$|E
