40|$|A time-domain method, {{based on}} linear {{velocity}} potential theory, {{is presented to}} study the interaction between <b>narrow-banded</b> random waves and perforated structures. A simple relation is derived to estimate the jet length of flows through the perforated wall. The reflection coefficient of narrow banded random waves from perforated structures is calculated by assuming a Rayleigh distribution of the heights of incident random waves. For reflection of <b>narrow-banded</b> waves from a single-chamber perforated breakwater, {{a comparison of the}} predicted and measured reflection coefficients shows that the method presented in this paper can provide a prediction better than that of regular waves.

40|$|Weinvestigate {{and compare}} stable {{parallel}} algorithms for solving diagonally dominant and general <b>narrow-banded</b> linear systems of equations. <b>Narrow-banded</b> {{means that the}} bandwidth is very small compared with the matrix order and is typically between 1 and 100. The solvers compared are the banded system solvers of ScaLAPACK # 11 # and those investigated by Arbenz and Hegland # 3, 6 #. For the diagonally dominant case, the algorithms are analogs of the well-known tridiagonal cyclic reduction algorithm, while {{the inspiration for the}} general case is the lesser-known bidiagonal cyclic reduction, which allows a clean parallel implementation of partial pivoting. These divide-and-conquertype algorithms complement #ne-grained algorithms which perform well only for wide-banded matrices, with each family of algorithms having a range of problem sizes for whichit is superior.

25|$|Some {{combination}} of porous absorption with these complementary methods is typically preferred for their simplicity, affordability, and convenience, but resonant bass traps {{are more effective}} for absorbing strong room resonances where the aforementioned complimentary methods are inadequate or impractical, particularly when the geometry of the room causes problematic <b>narrow-band</b> resonances that affect the low bass and {{the composition of the}} room boundaries is highly reflective rather than acoustically lossy.|$|E
25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where <b>narrow-band</b> circuits are common.|$|E

Open signals L1OC and L2OC use time-division multiplexing to transmit pilot and data signals, with BPSK(1) modulation for data and BOC(1,1) modulation for pilot; wide-band restricted signals L1SC and L2SC use BOC (5, 2.5) modulation for both data and pilot, transmitted in quadrature phase {{to the open}} signals; this places peak signal strength away from the center frequency of <b>narrow-band</b> open signals.|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a <b>narrow-band</b> filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E
