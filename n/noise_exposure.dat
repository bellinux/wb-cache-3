5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss when they do not wear hearing protection.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the contribution of <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> from personal media player (PMP) use in the workplace to overall employee <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> at a Colorado manufacturing facility. A total of 24 workers’ PMP and background <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> were measured. Twelve PMP users worked in high-background-noise exposure (HBNE) areas and 12 employees worked in low-background-noise exposure (LBNE) areas. The self-selected PMP listening level of each worker was measured using an ear simulator, and the background noise of each employee workstation was measured using a sound level meter (SLM). The workers 2 ̆ 7 self-reported PMP duration of use, PMP listening exposure levels, and background noise levels, were used to estimate the daily occupational <b>noise</b> <b>exposures.</b> The measured background noise levels averaged 81 dBA for HBNE workers and 59 dBA for LBNE workers. The measured, free-field equivalent listening exposure levels were significantly greater for HBNE workers (85 dBA) as compared to LBNE workers (75 dBA) (p= 0. 0006). The estimated mean daily <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> for both groups were below the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value for noise of 85 dBA eight-hour time weighted average (TWA), specifically 84 dBA TWA for HBNE workers and 72 dBA TWA for LBNE workers.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a gray and ductile iron foundry. The employer was concerned about <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> in the knockoff areas of the facility. The foundry had seven knockoff areas where employees separated ductile iron castings from the metal riser and runner gating that remained attached following the casting process. We measured sound levels in the knockoff areas; they were very high. Metal-to-metal contact, shaker conveyors and other equipment, and vibration caused most noise. Employees' time-weighted average <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> {{in all of the}} knockoff jobs we monitored exceeded NIOSH and OSHA occupational exposure limits. Furthermore, time-weighted average <b>noise</b> <b>exposures</b> in all of the knockoff locations were greater than 100 decibels, A-weighted. We observed that most but not all employees working in these areas wore dual hearing protection as recommended by NIOSH and OSHA. Some employees did not fully insert their foam earplugs.

25|$|There is {{a theory}} that vinyl records can audibly {{represent}} higher frequencies than compact discs. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20Hz up to 22,050Hz, and most CD players measure flat within {{a fraction of a}} decibel from at least 20Hz to 20kHz at full output. Turntable rumble obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30kHz {{to be out of the}} range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20Hz to a maximum of around 20,000Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis. By contrast, hearing damage from loud <b>noise</b> <b>exposure</b> typically makes it more difficult to hear lower frequencies, such as three kHz through six kHz.|$|E

SPLs inside the heavy-equipment operator cabs were significantly reduced by 5. 6 – 7. 6 dBA on the full-throttle setting following installation of the SDMats (p< 0. 01).

25|$|Hearing loss in divers is a known {{problem and}} has many factors, {{one of which}} is <b>noise</b> <b>exposure.</b> Open circuit divers produce a high level of {{breathing}} noise by airflow through the regulator during inhalation and bubble noise during exhalation. The primary noise source is exhaust bubbles which can exceed 95dB(A). Voice communications and free-flow demisting push these levels above 100db(A), as communications need to be about 15dB above background to be intelligible. Free-flow helmet noise levels are generally higher than demand systems, and are comparable with demisting noise levels. Rebreather and reclaim systems are significantly quieter, as there is no bubble noise most of the time. The type of headgear affects noise sensitivity and noise hazard depending on whether transmission is wet or dry. Human hearing underwater is less sensitive with wet ears than in air, and a neoprene hood provides substantial attenuation. When wearing a helmet sensitivity is similar to in surface air, as hearing sensitivity is not significantly affected by the breathing gas or chamber atmosphere composition or pressure.|$|E

The changes in exposures were obtained through the modelling of motorised traffic and noise levels in the pre- and post-policy scenarios.
