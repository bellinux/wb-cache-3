40|$|Aim: There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> in neonates born to mothers with pre-existing diabetes. This often necessitates admission to the neonatal intensive care. Guidelines suggest maintaining intrapartum blood glucose levels (BGLs) of 4 - 7 mmol/l in women with diabetes {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> This study assessed whether intrapartum BGLs in women with pre-gestational Type 1 and 2 diabetes were predictive of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> Methods: A retrospective analysis of 261 births delivered at a tertiary hospital in Australia from 2009 to 2014. Results: There were 122 cases of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> (glucose ≤ 2. 6 mmol/l) in 261 births (47 %). The mothers in the <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> group spent less time with BGL in the range 4 – 7 mmol/l [55 ± 37 % vs. 65 ± 35 %, P = 0. 02; odds ratio (OR) 0. 992, P = 0. 03] and more time with BGL in the 7 – 10 mmol/l range (31 ± 34 % vs. 18 ± 27 %, P = 0. 003; OR 1. 013, P = 0. 003) compared with those without <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> Although statistically significant, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that time spent with maternal BGLs in the range 4 – 7 mmol/l [area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 58] or 7 – 10 mmol (AUC = 0. 60) was not strong enough to be a useful clinical predictor of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> HbA 1 c in the second trimester of pregnancy (P = 0. 02, OR 1. 42) and percentage time spent in BGL range of 7 – 10 mmol/l (P = 0. 001, OR 1. 02) were both associated with a risk of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> in a logistic regression model. HbA 1 c in the third trimester (P = 0. 07, OR 1. 28) approached, but did not reach, significance. Conclusions: These data support a BGL range of 4 – 7 mmol/l as an intrapartum target.

40|$|Aim: The first aim of {{this study}} was to look into {{relative}} incidences of known risk factors causing macrosomia, and perinatal complications. The second {{aim of this}} study was to determine the utility of current practise for diagnosing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) in a heterogeneous population group, in Australia. Background: Maternal hyperglycaemia has been implicated as the major cause of neonatal macrosomia, yet clinicians frequently report the birth of large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants in normoglycaemic pregnancies (1). Although maternal diabetes accounts for only a small proportion of LGA infants, the incidence of maternal diabetes increases as the neonatal birth weight above 4000 grams increases (2). A retrospective analysis of 92 LGA births at our centre was performed, to determine relative incidences of GDM and other known aetiologies, followed by their perinatal complications. Methods: This study was an observational, retrospective, single group study. Statistical analysis was performed for the various aetiologies known to be associated with foetal macrosomia. Abnormalities in maternal 50 gram Glucose challenge test (GCT) and 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results in our subjects were tabulated and their degree of association with the overall macrosomia assessed. Results: Male sex and history of previous macrosomia were significant as aetiologies for macrosomia; as did adverse events following a macrosomic birth, such as <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemias,</b> <b>neonatal</b> respiratory distress and post partum haemorrhage. Five subjects were diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes mellitus in the study group, by means of an abnormal 75 gram OGTT. The diagnostic accuracy between the ADIPS and suggested IADPSG (3) diagnostic criteria in helping predict macrosomia, requires evaluation in further studies. Although more cases of GDM may get recognised, this would help initiating treatment measures early, thereby reducing costs involved with perinatal complications and morbidity. Maternal demographic features and perinatal complications with regards to non-GDM LGA infants data will be presented...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} whether the presence of abnormal B-cell nuclei predicts {{the existence of a}} focal or of a diffuse form of persistent neonatal and infantile hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia in a series of 20 infants. METHODS AND RESULTS: Intra-operative frozen sections were performed on small specimens from the pancreatic head, isthmus and tail. In 13 cases, abnormal B-cell nuclei were identified, but even a near-total pancreatectomy was insufficient to cure some of these patients, in whom no focal lesion was detected. On the other hand, abnormal insular B-cell nuclei were not found in seven cases; {{based on the results of}} selective venous catheterization, a limited resection was performed, sufficient to cure each patient, and a focal adenomatous hyperplasia was found in each resected specimen.

40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} the optimal gestational age for delivery in uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies. Study Design: A retrospective analysis of gestational age-specific neonatal {{morbidity and mortality}} data was performed for 254 uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies. Outcome measures included 1 st and 5 th minute Apgar scores, NICU admission, RDS, TTN, sepsis, seizure, hyperbilirubinemia, <b>hypoglycaemia,</b> <b>neonatal</b> length of hospital stay, birthweight and overall outcome. After correcting for confounding variables by regression analysis, adverse variable trends were assessed {{in each of the}} gestational-age- at-birth groups. Results: A significant drop in the incidence of LBW, RDS, TTN and hypoglycaemia, accompanied with the lowest NICU admission rate and neonatal length of hospital stay occurred concordantly at 38 completed weeks of gestation. The incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy decreased significantly by 36 weeks. No correlation was found between advancing gestation and foetal, perinatal or neonatal mortality. Conclusion: Elective delivery in uncomplicated dichorionic twin pregnancies should be delayed until at least 38 completed weeks of gestation as this significantly reduces neonatal morbidity with no impact on mortality. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Carnitine, {{essential}} for fatty acid β-oxidation, is obtained from diet and through de novo biosynthesis. The organic cation/carnitine transporter 2 (OCTN 2) facilitates carnitine cellular transport and kidney resorption. Carnitine depletion occurs in OCTN 2 -deficient patients, with serious clinical complications including cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and hypoketotic <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> <b>Neonatal</b> screening can detect OCTN 2 deficiency. OCTN 2 -deficiency {{is also known}} as primary carnitine deficiency. Carnitine deficiency may result from fatty acid β-oxidation disorders, which are diagnosed via plasma acylcarnitine profiling, but also under other conditions including haemodialysis. Given the importance of the kidney in maintaining carnitine homeostasis, it is not unexpected that longterm haemodialysis treatment is associated with the development of secondary carnitine deficiency, characterised by low endogenous L-carnitine levels and accumulation of deleterious medium and long- chain acylcarnitines. These alterations in carnitine pool composition have been implicated in a number of dialysis-related disorders, including erythropoietin-resistant renal anaemia. The association between erythropoietin resistance and carnitine levels has been demonstrated, with the proportion of medium and long-chain acylcarnitines within the total plasma carnitine pool positively correlated with erythropoietin resistance. Recent research has demonstrated that carnitine supplementation results in a significant reduction in erythropoietin dose requirements in patients with erythropoietin-resistant anaemia. Few studies have been conducted assessing the treatment of carnitine deficiency and haemodialysisrelated cardiac complications, particularly in children. Thus, a study was recently conducted which showed that intravenous carnitine in children receiving haemodialysis significantly increased plasma carnitine...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-infected {{pregnant}} women is highly effective in preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of the virus, but deleterious metabolic and mitochondrial observations in infants born to HIV-infected women treated with ART during pregnancy are periodically reported. Objectives This study addresses {{the concern of}} HIV-ART-induced metabolic perturbations through a metabolomics study of cord blood collected during transitional <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> following birth from newborns either exposed or unexposed to fetal HIV-ART. Methods Proton magnetic resonance spectra from cord blood of 11 in utero HIV-ART-exposed and 14 unexposed newborns, as well as serum from 8 control infants, generated 114 spectral bins which were used to identify significant metabolites by means of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses. Results The metabolite profiles differed significantly between that from the unexposed newborns and that from infants-interpreted to characterize the state of transitional <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> (low glucose and high lactic acid and ketone bodies). Quantitative analysis of potential ATP generation showed no meaningful difference in the global metabolite profiles of HIV-ART-exposed and unexposed neonates, but Volcano plot analysis, affirmed by odds ratios, indicated that exposure to HIV-ART affected the plasma 3 -hydroxybutyric acid and hypoxanthine concentrations. Conclusions The metabolite profile for transitional <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> indicated that HIV-ART did not compromise the exposed neonates to the energy stress of allostasis experienced at birth.

40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> is common, {{affecting}} up to 15 % of newborns, and {{can cause}} brain damage. Currently, there are no strategies, beyond early feeding, to prevent <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> Our aim was to determine a dose of 40 % oral dextrose gel that will prevent <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> in newborn babies at risk. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-finding trial of buccal dextrose gel to prevent <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> at two hospitals in New Zealand. Babies at risk of hypoglycaemia (infant of a mother with diabetes, late preterm delivery, small or large birthweight, or other risk factors) but without indication for admission to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were randomly allocated either to one of four treatment groups: 40 % dextrose at one of two doses (0. 5 ml/kg = 200 mg/kg, or 1 ml/kg = 400 mg/kg), either once at 1 h of age or followed by three additional doses of dextrose (0. 5 ml/kg before feeds in the first 12 h); or to one of four corresponding placebo groups. Treatments were administered by massaging gel into the buccal mucosa. The primary outcome was hypoglycaemia (< 2. 6 mM) in the first 48 h. Secondary outcomes included admission to a NICU, admission for hypoglycaemia, and breastfeeding at discharge and at 6 wk. Prespecified potential dose limitations were tolerance of gel, time taken to administer, messiness, and acceptability to parents. From August 2013 to November 2014, 416 babies were randomised. Compared to babies randomised to placebo, the risk of hypoglycaemia was lowest in babies randomised to a single dose of 200 mg/kg dextrose gel (relative risk [RR] 0. 68; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 47 - 0. 99, p = 0. 04) but was not significantly different between dose groups (p = 0. 21). Compared to multiple doses, single doses of gel were better tolerated, quicker to administer, and less messy, but these limitations were not different between dextrose and placebo gel groups. Babies who received any dose of dextrose gel {{were less likely to}} develop hypoglycaemia than those who received placebo (RR 0. 79; 95 % CI 0. 64 - 0. 98, p = 0. 03; number needed to treat = 10, 95 % CI 5 - 115). Rates of NICU admission were similar (RR 0. 64; 95 % CI 0. 33 - 1. 25, p = 0. 19), but admission for hypoglycaemia was less common in babies randomised to dextrose gel (RR 0. 46; 95 % CI 0. 21 - 1. 01, p = 0. 05). Rates of breastfeeding were similar in both groups. Adverse effects were uncommon and not different between groups. A limitation of this study was that most of the babies in the trial were infants of mothers with diabetes (73 %), which may reduce the applicability of the results to babies from other risk groups. The incidence of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> can be reduced with a single dose of buccal 40 % dextrose gel 200 mg/kg.

40|$|Macrosomia is {{associated}} with considerable neonatal and maternal morbidity. Factors that predict macrosomia are poorly understood. The increased rate of macrosomia in the offspring of pregnant women with diabetes and in congenital hyperinsulinaemia is mediated by increased foetal insulin secretion. We assessed the in utero and neonatal role of two key regulators of pancreatic insulin secretion by studying birthweight and the incidence of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> in patients with heterozygous mutations in the maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) genes HNF 4 A (encoding HNF- 4 alpha) and HNF 1 A/TCF 1 (encoding HNF- 1 alpha), {{and the effect of}} pancreatic deletion of Hnf 4 a on foetal and neonatal insulin secretion in mice. We examined birthweight and hypoglycaemia in 108 patients from families with diabetes due to HNF 4 A mutations, and 134 patients from families with HNF 1 A mutations. Birthweight was increased by a median of 790 g in HNF 4 A-mutation carriers compared to non-mutation family members (p < 0. 001); 56 % (30 / 54) of HNF 4 A-mutation carriers were macrosomic compared with 13 % (7 / 54) of non-mutation family members (p < 0. 001). Transient hypoglycaemia was reported in 8 / 54 infants with heterozygous HNF 4 A mutations, but was reported in none of 54 non-mutation carriers (p = 0. 003). There was documented hyperinsulinaemia in three cases. Birthweight and prevalence of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> were not increased in HNF 1 A-mutation carriers. Mice with pancreatic beta-cell deletion of Hnf 4 a had hyperinsulinaemia in utero and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia at birth.

MethodsFrom 2006 to 2009 all non-gestational diabetes mellitus (non-GDM) pregnant women who delivered macrosomia at the North Australia's Townsville Hospital were retrospectively reviewed by extracting data from clinical record. Glucose tolerance tests results were analysed {{in the light of}} an earlier diagnosis of non-GDM. ResultsNinety-one non-GDM mothers with macrosomia were studied and compared with 41 normoglycemic subjects without macrosomia. Of the subjects with non-GDM macrosomia, 45 (49. 4 %) had normal 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) without further testing, another 8 (8. 8 %) had abnormal GCT but normal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A total of 4 (4. 4 %) subjects had normal GCT and OGTT. Interestingly, 14 out of 16 (87. 5 %) subjects who were tested with OGTT owing to past history of macrosomia had normal results but delivered macrosomic babies.

Clinically, diagnostic criteria include macrosomia, macroglossia, abdominal wall defects, <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia,</b> visceromegalies and hemihyperplasia. Component clinical manifestations also include renal abnormalities, adrenocortical cytomegaly and a characteristic facial appearance, with midface hypoplasia and ear anomalies. Genetically, BWS is associated with disturbances within two different domains on 11 p 15 that are controlled by distinct imprinting control regions (ICR), ICR 1 and ICR 2. The majority of patients have abnormalities within ICR 2. In particular, loss of maternal methylation accounts for 50 60...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{look into}} the glucose {{tolerance}} test characteristics and determine complications in non-gestational diabetes pregnant subjects. Methods: From 2006 to 2009 all non-gestational diabetes mellitus (non-GDM) pregnant women who delivered macrosomia at the North Australia's Townsville Hospital were retrospectively reviewed by extracting data from clinical record. Glucose tolerance tests results were analysed {{in the light of}} an earlier diagnosis of non-GDM. Results: Ninety-one non-GDM mothers with macrosomia were studied and compared with 41 normoglycemic subjects without macrosomia. Of the subjects with non-GDM macrosomia, 45 (49. 4 %) had normal 50 g glucose challenge test (GCT) without further testing, another 8 (8. 8 %) had abnormal GCT but normal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A total of 4 (4. 4 %) subjects had normal GCT and OGTT. Interestingly, 14 out of 16 (87. 5 %) subjects who were tested with OGTT owing to past history of macrosomia had normal results but delivered macrosomic babies. Only 12 subjects had both GCT and OGTT, the rest of the cohort had either of the two tests. Subjects with non-GDM macrosomia had higher frequency of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> 34 % as compared to 10 % in non-macrosomic babies (P= 0. 003). Other feto-maternal complications were similar in both groups. Conclusions: No significant pattern of glucose tolerance characteristics was identified in non-GDM mothers with macrosomic babies. In spite of being normoglycemic significant <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> was recorded in non-GDM macrosomic babies. Further prospective studies on a larger population are needed to verify our findings...|$|E
40|$|While insulin {{has been}} the {{treatment}} of choice when lifestyle measures do not maintain glycaemic control during pregnancy, recent {{studies have suggested that}} certain oral hypoglycaemic agents may be safe and acceptable alternatives. With the exception of metformin and glibenclamide (glyburide), there are insufficient data to recommend treatment with any other oral hypoglycaemic agent during pregnancy. There are no serious safety concerns with metformin, despite it crossing the placenta. When used in the first trimester, there is no increase in congenital abnormalities and {{there appears to be a}} reduction in miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and subsequent gestational diabetes. Studies of the use of metformin in gestational diabetes show at least equivalent neonatal outcomes, while reporting reductions in <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia,</b> maternal hypoglycaemia and weight gain and improved treatment satisfaction. Glibenclamide effectively lowers blood glucose in women with gestational diabetes, possibly with a lower treatment failure rate than metformin. Although generally well tolerated, some studies have reported higher rates of pre-eclampsia, neonatal jaundice, longer stay in the neonatal care unit, macrosomia and <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> There is a paucity of long-term follow-up data on children exposed to oral agents in utero. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the UK National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have recommended that either metformin or glibenclamide can be used to treat gestational diabetes. Metformin is also recommended for use in the pre-conception period by NICE. By contrast, the American Diabetes Association recommends that both drugs should only be used during pregnancy in the context of clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Metformin {{improves}} insulin {{sensitivity and}} reduces hepatic glucose output {{in patients with}} diabetes. It offers potential benefits for pregnant women with gestational or type 2 diabetes because both conditions are associated with increased insulin resistance. Some cohort data are available and randomised trials are currently in progress to compare metformin with insulin, but strong evidence is not yet available to guide management. There are no long-term follow-up data to provide reassurance {{about the safety of}} metformin, given its passage across the placenta, although recent evidence suggests that there is no significant risk of teratogenesis. Limited amounts of metformin are transferred into breast milk, but the risk of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia</b> is negligible. William M. Hagu...|$|E
40|$|It {{is almost}} a century since {{hypoglycaemia}} (a reduction in the glucose concentration of circulating blood) was first described in children, and over 50 years since the condition was first recognized in infants. Nevertheless, controversy still surrounds the definition, significance, and management of <b>neonatal</b> <b>hypoglycaemia.</b> Technological developments such as bedside glucose monitoring have, paradoxically, exacerbated rather than eased the situation. This article reviews the literature on hypoglycaemia of the newborn, and covers the following: historical aspects; glucose homeostasis and metabolic adaptation at birth; the effect of low blood glucose levels on the central nervous system; the definition of hypoglycaemia; screening; prevention; treatment; research needs; and concludes with recommendations for prevention and management...|$|E
