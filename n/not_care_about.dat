5|$|During her premiership Thatcher had the second-lowest average {{approval}} rating (40%) of any post-war Prime Minister. Since {{the resignation of}} Nigel Lawson as Chancellor in 1989, polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party. A self-described conviction politician, Thatcher always insisted that she did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> her poll ratings and pointed instead to her unbeaten election record.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian's {{candidacy}} {{for the head}} coaching job at Notre Dame was unusual {{because he was not}} a Notre Dame graduate, as every head coach since Knute Rockne had been. Parseghian was also an Armenian Presbyterian, making him the first non-Catholic coach since Rockne, who converted in 1925. Joyce made it clear before his hiring that he did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> Parseghian's religion, but simply wanted someone who could lead the football team to success.|$|E
5|$|Peter is {{disappointed}} since Francis did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> him – so {{he gives}} up drinking and does crack instead. Brian notices this, and tells Peter that crack {{is not a}} good substitute for drinking. As a result, Peter sees a hypnotherapist, who helps him discover that Francis was not his biological father. When Peter goes to his mom, Thelma Griffin, about it, she reveals that she had an affair with an Irish man named Mickey McFinnigan and that Mickey is Peter's biological father.|$|E

50|$|Based on longing desire (raga), hostility (dvesha), naivety (moha), or laziness (kausīdya), <b>not</b> <b>caring</b> is {{the state}} of mind not to engage in {{anything}} constructive and not to restrain from activities tainted with confusion.

The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E

Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E

Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the recording room. Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together.

5|$|Styles went on {{to defend}} the {{championship}} against Petey Williams, while Daniels and Joe competed in a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at Genesis. Styles retained the title at the event, while Daniels and Joe's team were the victors in their contest. After Daniels and Joe won their match, Joe assaulted Daniels by bashing him {{over the head with}} a steel chair and slamming him on a steel chair back-first. Daniels was sidelined with an injury in the storyline {{as a result of these}} action. Thereafter, Joe proceeded to carry around a blood stained towel from the attack. Joe's action at Genesis angered Styles in the storyline, as Styles accused Joe of violating the unwritten code of the TNA X Division. Styles followed by challenging Joe to a match at Turning Point for the TNA X Division Championship on the November19, 2005 episode of Impact!, which Joe accepted. On the December3, 2005 episode of Impact!, Joe attacked Styles, claiming he did <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the X Division code.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that {{he will be able to}} walk again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to <b>not</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E
