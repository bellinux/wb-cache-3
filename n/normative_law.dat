40|$|When an act {{is right}} or wrong, {{there may be an}} {{explanation}} why. Different moral theories recognize different moral facts and offer different explanations of them, but they offer no account of moral explanation itself. What, then, is its nature? This thesis seeks a systematic account of moral explanation within a framework of moral realism. In Chapter 1, I develop a pluralist theory of explanation. I argue that there is a prima facie distinctive normative mode of explanation that is essential to moral theory. In Chapter 2, I characterize normative explanation through its formal properties. I then draw on John Mackie’s claim that moral explanations are queer to develop a powerful form of moral scepticism. In Chapters 3 – 4, I reject attempts to reduce normative explanation to logical necessity, metaphysical necessity, or conceptual (analytic) necessity. The failure of these accounts is taken to reinforce Mackie’s scepticism. In Chapter 5, I defend a partial analysis of normative explanation in terms of irreducible <b>normative</b> <b>laws.</b> I argue that irreducible <b>normative</b> <b>laws</b> offer a realist, though non-naturalist, answer to Mackie’s scepticism. The existence of irreducible <b>normative</b> <b>laws</b> then is defended as offering the best realist explanation of why rightness and wrongness supervene on descriptive properties. In Appendix A, I discuss the claim the normative explanation has an essential connection to the motivation of virtuous agents. I defend this claim from certain difficulties posed by Jonathan Dancy’s recent work. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

5000|$|Hildesheimer's {{virtually}} uncontested dominance {{came to an}} end in the mid-1860s. Firstly, {{the disciples}} of Sofer now held senior rabbinical posts and were confident enough. More importantly, he was opposed by a new extremist clique of rabbis, led by Hillel Lichtenstein, who was assisted by his son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger and his disciple Chaim Sofer. These radicals, though all Oberlander, were popular with the hasidim of Unterland. They regarded themselves as the true heirs of Moses Sofer and vehemently opposed any sort of modernization. They appeared on the scene with the publication of Schlesinger's book [...] "Heart of the Hebrew" [...] (Lev ha'Ivri) in 1863. He and his associates believed Hildesheimer's modernist approach to be the true danger for his public perception as strictly pious legitimized secular influences. To them, the Neologs were already totally outside the boundaries of Judaism, and they preached for having them anathematized. Lichtenstein's disciples faced a problem of their own, as their extremist ideology found little support in mainstream Jewish Law: [...] "these issues," [...] wrote Michael Silber, [...] "even most of the religious reforms, fell into gray areas not easily treated within Halakhah. It was often too flexible or ambiguous, at times silent, or worse yet, embarrassingly lenient." [...] To secure his positions, Schlesinger ventured outside of <b>normative</b> <b>Law</b> into the realm of Aggadah (Lore), drawing mainly from Kabbalah and especially the Book of Radiance. In what was considered a relatively moderate statement for him, he wrote [...] "Wherever the Talmud does not conflict with the Book of Radiance, the ruling shall be according to the latter." [...] Their attempt to base their harsh rigidity on these sources irritated the highest Hungarian rabbinical authorities, who while sympathetic to their struggle against modernity could not accept such [...] "unorthodox" [...] means.|$|E

It is a challenging task to include the formalized laws and rules in enterprises since e. g. more than one regulation may affect the terms of privacy concerning one situation. Traditional access control provides a general mechanism for assigning rights to individual users or roles. In the context of privacy this is insufficient; it offers no means to fulfil certain aspects such as limitations to the duration for which private data may be stored. To enforce privacy in enterprises we further need a fine granular access control mechanism on the data entities to ensure that every aspect of privacy can be reflected. This paper provides a novel solution for this by means of ontologies. The usage of ontologies in our approach differs from the conventional form in focusing on generating access control policies which are adapted from our software framework to provide fine granular access on the diverse data sources...|$|R
