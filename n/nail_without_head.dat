60|$|And observe also, that of {{the three}} types of lout, whose {{combined}} chorus and tripudiation leads the present British Constitution its devil's dance, this last and smoothest type is also the dullest. Your operative lout cannot indeed hold his cup of coffee with a grace, or possess himself of a biscuit from Lady Clara's salver without embarrassment; but, in his own mill, he can at least make a needle without an eye, or a <b>nail</b> <b>without</b> a <b>head,</b> or a knife that won't cut, or something of that sort, with dexterity. Also, the middle class, or Smithian lout, at least manages his stockbroking or marketing with decision and cunning; knows something by eye or touch of his wares, and something of the characters of the men he has to deal with. But the Ducal or Marquisian lout has no knowledge of anything under the sun, except what sort of horse's quarters will carry his own, farther weighted with that smooth block or pebble of a pow; and no faculty under the sun of doing anything, except cutting down the trees his fathers planted for him, and selling the lands his fathers won.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{describe}} {{a new technique}} for removing the distal fragments of broken intramedullary femoral <b>nails</b> <b>without</b> disturbing the nonunion site. METHODS: This technique involves the application of an AO distractor prior to {{the removal of the}} nail fragments, with subsequent removal of the proximal nail fragment in an anterograde fashion and removal of the distal fragment through a medial parapatellar approach. Impaction of the fracture site is then performed with a nail that is broader than the remaining fragmented material. RESULTS: Nails were removed from five patients using the technique described above without any complications. After a mean follow-up period of 61. 8 months, none of these patients showed worsened knee osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: The original technique described in this article allows surgeons to remove the distal fragment of fractured femoral intramedullary <b>nails</b> <b>without</b> opening the nonunion focus or using special surgical instruments...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that depth can be {{perceived}} from motion parallax. To produce motion parallax, observers (with head movement) or objects (<b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement) need to move. In previous studies, the magnitude of perceived depth with head movement was compared with that <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement using several corrugated surfaces. It was found that perceived depth with head movement was larger than that <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the influence of discontinuities on the perceived surface. We used stair-like (square-wave) stimuli, and investigated the magnitude of perceived depth with or <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement. We found that: (1) the magnitude of perceived depth increased as the number of square-waves increased. (2) There was a tendency to perceive larger depth with <b>head</b> movement than <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement, but the difference between magnitudes of depth with and <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movements decreased as the number of square-waves increased. (3) Observers tended to perceive 4 - and 6 -step square-wave stimuli as continuous. (4) For the 2 -step square-wave stimulus, observers tended to grossly underestimate the magnitude of depth or could not perceive depth at all. These findings suggest the possibility that perception of increased depth is caused by the perception of surfaces as continuous...|$|R
