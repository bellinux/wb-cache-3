5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Cooper {{made her}} Paralympic debut at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. She {{was in danger of}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1992 Paralympics because of funding issues for the Australian Paralympic Federation. The Federation made an {{emergency}} appeal for funding from the public in order {{to cover the cost of}} transporting the Australian team to Barcelona. A variety of small donations allowed Cooper and other Australian athletes to compete. She won three gold and two silver medals, and broke two world records and three Paralympic records. She was offered a non-residential Australian Institute of Sport Athletes with a Disability swimming scholarship in 1993 and was supported until 2000.|$|E

25|$|The Australian team, however, was {{undergoing}} {{a period of}} transition, with many of their successful players like Shane Warne, Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden and Glenn McGrath having retired {{a couple of years}} prior and former captain and batting mainstay Ricky Ponting woefully out-of-form. The team was now captained by Michael Clarke and had many inexperienced players. Australia's recent record was not inspiring, meekly losing the Ashes series, <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> semifinals of the Cricket World Cup {{for the first time since}} 1992, and drawing two prior Test series against South Africa away and against New Zealand at home. Their coach Tim Nielsen had been sacked and replaced with former South African coach Mickey Arthur. Not many cricket experts and media, even in Australia, were expecting an Australian resurgence against a very formidable India.|$|E

My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E

[...] Tolokonnikova also said, [...] "Whether one likes it or <b>not,</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Olympics in Russia is an acceptance of the internal political situation in Russia, an acceptance of the course taken by a person who is interested in the Olympics above all else — Vladimir Putin." ...|$|E

Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, [...] "I {{want to be an}} NFL starter. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> league to be a No. 2. I think my whole game can go to another level.

During {{the recording}} session, Selena {{was suffering from}} bronchitis. Her father asked her to [...] "just try" [...] and sing the song because several producers had arrived from Los Angeles to watch her record the track. After the recording session, the producers liked Selena's vocal range in the song and decided to use her first take.

500|$|The two hippies, Seth and Munchie, were {{portrayed by}} comic actors Martin Mull and George Carlin respectively. For a while, the staff {{were not sure}} of who would play Munchie. Although they had decided on Mull to play Seth, the staff were [...] "kind of stuck" [...] on who would play Munchie. Carlin was {{suggested}} by Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers, who [...] "really wanted to meet [...] " [...] but ended up <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recording session. Scully stated that Mull and Carlin were [...] "some of the funniest guys that ever lived", and that recording their lines was [...] "a lot of fun". Although it does not occur with most other guest stars in the series, Mull and Carlin recorded their lines together. While the designs of Seth and Munchie were not modeled after anyone in particular, their hair-styles were slightly based on those of Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, owners of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's. Comedian Bob Hope was portrayed by series regular cast member Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among many other characters in the series. Jill St. John and Phyllis Diller were both voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille. The psychedelic version of The Simpsons main theme that plays during the end credits was performed by Yo La Tengo, an American alternative rock band who are friends of Cary's.|$|E

On that episode, he moderated a contract signing between Vince McMahon and Bret Hart for their match at WrestleMania XXVI. In the same episode, Austin met up backstage with his longtime rival Shawn Michaels, who asked Austin whether he believed that Michaels could end the Undertaker's undefeated WrestleMania streak in their upcoming match. Austin replied [...] "Hell yeah I think you can beat the Undertaker, but you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> <b>The</b> streak {{is going to go}} 18–0".

2500|$|On March 12, the Board of Trustees {{released}} what {{it described}} as its final {{statement on the}} ouster of Spanier and Paterno. [...] It said that Spanier not only made unauthorized statements to the press, but failed to tell the board all {{he knew about the}} 2002 incident. [...] It also said that Paterno demonstrated a [...] "failure of leadership" [...] by <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police. [...] The board said it had every intention of sending someone to personally inform Paterno of the decision, but was unable to do so because {{of a large number of}} people surrounding his house. [...] Rather than risk having Paterno learn about the decision via the media, the board decided to order him to leave immediately via telephone.|$|E

2500|$|Under Pennsylvania {{law of the}} time, {{any state}} {{employee}} who learned about suspected child abuse was required to report the incident to his immediate supervisor. In {{the case of the}} 2002 incident, McQueary reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Paterno. [...] In turn, Paterno reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Curley, and also reported it to Gary Schultz, who oversaw the campus police at the time. For these reasons, Paterno and McQueary were not implicated in any criminal wrongdoing, since they did what they were legally required to do. [...] However, once the incident came to light, Paterno was criticized for not reporting the incident to police, or, at least, seeing to it that it was reported. [...] Several advocates for victims of sexual abuse argued that Paterno should have faced charges for <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police himself when it was apparent Penn State officials were unwilling to act.|$|E

2500|$|While his {{administration}} was not immune from problems, Diem {{also appeared to}} have some success in social development during his tenure. His land reform measures for example, while <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extent urged by American advisers (such as more sharply {{limiting the number of}} hectares one farmer could own), {{in the words of one}} historian, [...] "did succeed in breaking up the vast estates in the delta, and it changed the landless peasants in the South from the large majority to a minority. The Communists would later lament that this redistribution of land “seriously interfered” with their subsequent efforts to win over the peasantry through land reform." [...] Ironically, Diem's American backers also failed to provide him with adequate funding to help buy land for redistribution to small peasants. Diem's other reforms emphasized agriculture rather than the forced-draft industrial development of the north, and the general restoration of order under his regime saw rising indicators of prosperity. Rice production for example which had fallen below pre-World War II production levels in 1954, surpassed the previous level by 1959. Production of rubber rose from 54,917 tons in 1954 to 75,374 in 1950, and cattle and pigs registered a threefold jump over the same period. Diem also placed limits on foreign capitalists and the amount of control they could exercise in various sectors. Per one study: ...|$|E
