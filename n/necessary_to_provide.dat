5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG {{would have had to}} be taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a turnback was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a new terminal for the line. When the 63rd Street Connection opened in 2001, the Court Square station was rebuilt to provide a turnback facility for the line, which by then was renamed to G.|$|E
5|$|Once the Regular Army {{had been}} {{organised}} as a continental Expeditionary Force, {{it would be}} <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations.|$|E
5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew rapidly, and in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts. Due to {{the rapid}} spread of Scouting it became <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> some form of local co-ordination. Provincial Councils were formed in South Africa between 1912 and 1916. These councils had no direct {{contact with each other}} and {{reported}} directly to Imperial Scout Headquarters in London.|$|E

5|$|On 20 September, the 31st Division {{advanced}} further inland {{to secure}} an expanded perimeter. This was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> room for additional bivouacs and supply installations after General MacArthur's headquarters decided to expand airfield {{construction on the}} island. The advance met little resistance and was completed in one day. On 22 September, a Japanese force attacked {{the headquarters of the}} 1st Battalion, 167th Infantry Regiment but was easily repulsed. The following day, a company from the 126th Infantry Regiment unsuccessfully attacked a fortified Japanese unit near Wajaboeta on the island's west coast. The 126th resumed its attack on 24 September and secured the position. US forces continued intensive patrolling until 4 October when the island was declared secure. U.S. casualties during the initial occupation of Morotai numbered 30 dead, 85 wounded, and one missing. Japanese casualties were much higher, numbering over 300 dead and 13 captured.|$|E

5000|$|The Patients Association was {{concerned}} that polyclinics could jeopardise the patient-doctor relationship which they regard as a central plank of effective and personalised care and as [...] "central to every patient's experience of healthcare", particularly in those with long-term or complex conditions. They also observed that polyclinics are not <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> one-stop care, something already delivered in the NHS at one stop shops, {{and that they are}} likely to lead to the loss of other health services in rural areas.|$|R

25|$|Unlike plays which echo Manichaeism by {{presenting}} the dichotomy {{of darkness and}} light, Vicente's work juxtaposes the two elements in order to illustrate the necessity of both. Christmas eve, one of his common motifs, is symbolic of his philosophical and religious views: the great darkness borders the divine glory of maternity, birth, forgiveness, serenity, and good will. The darkness is <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> contrast with the light.|$|E

25|$|FBCs {{provide all}} of the {{features}} and functions expected of a typical splice closure that prevents the intrusion of wind-driven rain, dust, and insects. Such a closure, however, permits the free exchange of air with the outside environment. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} condensation will form inside the closure. It is thus <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> adequate drainage to prevent the accumulation of water inside the closure.|$|E

The dogs actually live with their assigned PPD Officers and {{are a part of}} every aspect of the Officerâ€™s home life. This relationship is <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the most effective dog handler rapport. Since the handler and canines are always together, it provides for an efficient response time to incidents when canine support is needed.|$|E
25|$|In some {{consumer}} electronic equipment, {{notably in}} television sets {{in the era}} of valves (vacuum tubes), but also in some low-cost record players, the vacuum tube heaters were connected in series. Since the voltage drop across all the heaters in series was usually less than the full mains voltage, it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a ballast to drop the excess voltage. A resistor was often used for this purpose, as it was cheap and worked with both AC and DC.|$|E

25|$|The two-door Escort Van {{arrived in}} the {{marketplace}} in February 1981, a slightly delayed introduction caused by large remaining stocks of the Mark II Escort Van. The Van has twin rear doors and unusual small side windows behind the front doors, <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> more over-the-shoulder visibility which would otherwise be limited {{by the use of}} the short front doors from the five-door Escort. Derived from the van was a pickup version of the Escort, the Bantam, which was produced in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{paramedic}} is a paraprofessional {{whose primary}} focus {{is to provide}} advanced emergency medical care for critical and emergency patients who access Emergency Medical Services (EMS). This individual possesses the complex knowledge and skills <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> patient care and transportation. Paramedics function {{as part of a}} comprehensive EMS response, under medical oversight. Paramedics perform interventions with the basic and advanced equipment typically found on an ambulance. The paramedic is a link from the scene into the health care system. One of the eligibility requirements for state certification or licensure requires successful completion of a nationally accredited Paramedic program at the certificate or associate degree level. Each state varies in requirements to practice as a paramedic and not all states require licensure.|$|E

25|$|In 1845, the Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company {{took over}} the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal, and {{appointed}} a committee to consider how best to convert them to railways, and what extensions might be <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a comprehensive transport network. The following year, the company became the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, by an Act of Parliament which authorised the new company {{to take over the}} Shrewsbury Canal and to buy the Montgomery Canal and the Shropshire Canal. In 1847, the Shropshire Union Company agreed to the terms of a lease from the London and North Western Railway Company (LNWR), and so lost its independence after little more than a year, but continued to manage the canals under its control.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} days of communication, diplomats and {{military}} commanders understood that it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E
25|$|Stiglitz made early {{contributions}} to {{a theory of}} public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the 'Henry George theorem' {{in reference to the}} radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz's finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by {{at least as much as}} its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a single tax on rents is <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.|$|E
