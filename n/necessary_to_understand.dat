25|$|Usually, {{in order}} to {{understand}} a text, it is <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the spoken language associated with that text. In this way, writing systems are distinguished form many other symbolic communication systems. Once established, writing systems on the whole change more slowly than their spoken counterparts, and often preserve features and expressions which are no longer current in the spoken language. The great benefit of writing systems is their ability to maintain a persistent record of information expressed in a language, which can be retrieved independently of the initial act of formulation.|$|E

25|$|Human {{knowledge}} {{is based on}} stories and the human brain consists of cognitive machinery <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> remember and tell stories. Humans are storytelling organisms that both individually and socially, lead storied lives. Stories mirror human thought as humans think in narrative structures and most often remember facts in story form. Facts {{can be understood as}} smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking. Because storytelling requires auditory and visual senses from listeners, one can learn to organize their mental representation of a story, recognize structure of language and express his or her thoughts.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as more studies on this pathway are <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E

25|$|Thanks {{to rapid}} {{advances}} in proteomics, genomics, and bioinformatics, protease {{research has been}} revolutionized. Degradomics emerged with the concept that proteolysis represents a specific mechanism for achieving cellular control over vital processes beyond control afforded by gene expression and translation and continues to produce the research <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the complex regulation of biology. Where it was thought extracellular proteases degraded extracellular matrix (ECM), these proteases are now known to target and process {{a vast array of}} substrates with diverse roles, redefining protease functions and leading to a shift in interest towards new roles previously unknown to biology. Degradomic studies of human tissue have also contributed to the Human Proteome Project (HPP) of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO).|$|E
25|$|Prediction and {{validation}} of the immunodominant epitope/s of HSP90 beta protein has been demonstrated using sera from infertile women having anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The decapeptide EP6 (380-389)is a major immunogenic epitope of HSP90 followed by EP1 (1-12) and EP8 (488-498). Knowledge of binding epitopes on the autoantigen is <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the subsequent pathologic events. Predicted 3D structures of these peptides demonstrated that they exist in the loop conformation, {{which is the most}} mobile part of the protein. Also, analysis of the sequences of HSP90 beta across several species reveals that EP6 peptide forms a part of a well-conserved motif. A polyclonal antibody generated to the immunodominant epitope- EP6 confirms similar biochemical and cellular immunoreactivity as seen with the patients' sera with anti-HSP90 autoantibodies. The study might generate new tools for the detection of disease-inducing epitopes and a possible therapeutic intervention.|$|E
25|$|A {{predisposing factor}} to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more hydralazine metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of hydralazine are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with hydralazine to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and hydralazine are <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the processes involved in DIL.|$|E
