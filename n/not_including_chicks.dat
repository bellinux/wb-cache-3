50|$|Formation of the {{otic vesicle}} {{has been studied}} {{extensively}} in developmental model organisms <b>including</b> <b>chick,</b> Xenopus, zebrafish, axolotyl, & mouse.

The otic placode in zebrafish, on the other hand, occurs by cavitation; the ectodermal placode condenses and forms an ovoid ball directly below the embryo surface. Otic vesicle formation occurs later, during the 25-30 somite stage in mice.|$|R
