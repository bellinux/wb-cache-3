Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to <b>nurture</b> <b>and</b> encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the indigenous peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling indigenous literature.|$|E

25|$|Eco{{feminism}} is a {{term that}} links feminism with ecology. Its advocates say that paternalistic/capitalistic society {{has led to a}} harmful split between nature and culture. Early ecofeminists propagated that the split can only be healed by the feminine instinct for <b>nurture</b> <b>and</b> holistic knowledge of nature's processes. Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.|$|E

25|$|Wells contemplates {{the ideas}} of nature and <b>nurture</b> <b>and</b> {{questions}} humanity in books such as The Island of Doctor Moreau.

The Island of Doctor Moreau is even darker. The narrator, having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected (unsuccessfully) into human beings, eventually returns to England; like Gulliver on his return from the Houyhnhnms, he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts, slowly reverting to their animal natures.|$|E
