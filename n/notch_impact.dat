During machining it is therefore theoretically possible that in some cases, such as failure of cutting fluid inflow, the temperature of thin wall machined piece may exceed normal temperature considerably. In modern methods of machining using high cutting rates the material may undergo impact loads at elevated temperatures. This type of load can be simulated using the impact bend test, so called Charpy impact test according to European standard EN 10 045 - 1. Unlike common construction AA 6082 alloy, the free machining AA 6262 and AA 6023 aluminium alloys show a significant decrease in <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> strength KU at elevated temperatures. This drop of KU, caused by melting of disperse phases containing low-melting metals, takes place within a certain relatively narrow transition range of temperature.

40|$|Polycarbonate has the {{reputation}} of having a tough breaking behavior, but it is widely unknown that this applies only to special conditions. The impact strength of polycarbonate depends on the temperature, thickness (with a tough brittle transition as thickness increases), contribution of <b>notch</b> tip radius, <b>impact</b> speed, physical blowing agent, molecular weight of the polymer, and processing parameters. Research results indicate that microcellular foams produced by injection molding with physical blowing agent (MuCell TM Technology by Trexel) show a significantly higher <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> strength than compact polycarbonate if the compact material is brittle under the same testing parameters. However, if the compact polycarbonate breaks toughly, the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> strength of the foamed material is always lower. Therefore, it is highly important {{to pay attention to}} the testing parameters and conditions when comparing the toughness of the foam with that of the compact material. The toughness of microcellular foams has similar properties like PC/ABS and PC/PP blend systems, which provides the possibility to combine the higher impact strength with the advantages of microcellular foaming such as weight reduction, lower shrinkage, shorter cycle times, lower clamp forces, and reduced melt viscosity. In order to use technologies and conditions, which are applied in the polymer industry as well, all materials were produced by an injection molding process. Special processing technologies such as gas counter pressure and precision mold opening were used in order to reach microcellular foam structures with cell diameters around 10 μm. These technologies yield exactly adjustable foam morphologies. Special morphologies are required to improve the <b>notched</b> <b>impact</b> strength of the foamed material.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the development of low-activation structural materials to be used in fusion reactors, martensitic Fe 9. 5 Cr alloys, called OPTIFER, have been conceived and meanwhile studied in further detail under a European long-term program. The alloy variants contain varying amounts of W, Ta, Ge and/or Ce as elements substituting the radiologically unfavorable alloying elements of Mo, Ni, Nb and Al. In three production series, thirteen different batches have been produced and analyzed so far. Up to now, the variant of 9. 5 Cr- 1 W+Mn, V, Ta has proved to be the most promising one. For radiological reasons, a W-free (+Ge) version is studied as an alternative. The behavior during transformation and heat treatment more or less corresponds to that of conventional martensitic 9 - 12 % Cr steels. Maximum hardness is achieved as of an austenitization temperature of 950 C. The mechanical properties are strongly dependent on the hardening temperature. Optimum tensile and creep strengths are reached at the reference hardening temperature of 1075 C (+ 750 C annealed) with the <b>notch</b> <b>impact</b> toughness exceeding that of conventional steels.
