Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), observing Gabe's pitiful attempts, tries to imply that Val does not feel the same way, but to no avail. When Gabe does ask Val out, she politely declines and says she does not date co-workers. Darryl hears all of this and decides he will <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> Val either.|$|E

However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> Brown over the claim.

The players were suspended from the team during the investigation. However, the woman did not press charges, and the district attorney opted to <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the matter {{due to a lack of}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates {{were still}} able to {{evacuate}} Winchester (including a hospital), and Averell did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the retreating rebels because he was unsure {{if the rest of}} Confederate General Early's army was nearby.

5|$|The French did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they}} were exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E

The UAC TurboTrain {{had been in}} revenue service in the United States and Canada since 1968, with mixed results. British Rail began testing the APT-E in 1972; {{for a variety of}} reasons, British Rail did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> gas turbine propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} primary education, Morales {{attended the}} Agrarian Humanistic Technical Institute of Orinoca (ITAHO), completing {{all but the}} final year. His parents then sent him to study for a degree in Oruro; although he did poorly academically, he finished all of his courses and exams by 1977, earning money on the side as a brick-maker, day labourer, baker and a trumpet player for the Royal Imperial Band. The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At {{the end of his}} higher education he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> it as a profession.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E
5|$|Although the Polish {{division}} was defeated, the Russian forces did <b>not</b> <b>pursue.</b> This allowed the Poles {{to mount a}} night counterattack. A single machine gun battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time to regroup and receive reinforcements, which {{came in the form}} of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.|$|E

5|$|As he was {{completing}} work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered {{adding another}} story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom {{under the title}} Ulysses. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).|$|E
5|$|Halleck then relayed the {{contents}} of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions {{across from each other}} on the Rappahannock River.|$|E
5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L. Warren, suggests that Hilary was pressed {{to bring the}} case against Battle Abbey by his cathedral chapter, and that Hilary did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the case vigorously. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting, sees {{the case against the}} abbey as the lone exception in Hilary's long career of support for the royal position against the papacy, and argues that the only reason Hilary opposed the king in this respect was that it was Hilary's own rights as a diocesan bishop that were being flouted. Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec was supporting Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
50|$|By 1973, {{the then}} President of the LCMS, Dr. Carl Fisher raised the {{question}} of whether the Lutheran churches in Singapore would operate as a national church separate from the LCMS. The matter was <b>not</b> <b>pursued</b> further until 1984 when the matter was brought up again during a meeting with the Singapore District Council of the LCMS. Even then, this matter was again <b>not</b> <b>pursued</b> further.|$|R

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Lyon {{thought he}} could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his {{cooperation}} and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended dinghy and rowing to Woodman Point on the mainland. The Government did <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.|$|E
5|$|Mallet {{traveled}} to Stockholm on 4 April {{where he met}} with Erik Boheman, the Swedish State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air force would <b>not</b> <b>pursue</b> Allied planes in their airspace, and also that limitations of the transport collaboration meant it would have little benefit for the British.|$|E
