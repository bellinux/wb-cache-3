5|$|Mark {{shows an}} {{interest}} in Paige, but discovers she is dating Tyler. He later learns {{that this is a}} ruse to cover up their involvement with Dimato, who has bought the garage. They eventually regain Mark's trust after helping to bring Dimato to justice, and Mark and Paige reunite. Mark and Tyler's brother Aaron (Matt Wilson) comes to stay with them, and they are later joined by their father Russell (Russell Kiefel), who has a strained relationship with his sons. The Brennans consider buying the garage together, but Tyler later reveals that Russell abused him when he was younger. Mark and Aaron support Tyler and force Russell to leave. Mark and Paige discuss their future together when he admits that he is ready to have children, while she is not. Mark asks Tyler to buy Number 24 with him. They brothers fall out when Tyler learns that Mark tried to protect Aaron from arrest during his investigation into the Erinsborough High fire. While discussing their future, Mark and Paige get engaged. Mark is deeply critical of Paige when she befriends Dimato's lover Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who claims to be on the run from Dimato. The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's fingerprints on them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were trying to set her up and that Paul helped her deal with the situation, and that she did not tell Mark to protect him. Furious at Paige for further lies after promising there would be <b>no</b> <b>secrets</b> between them, Mark calls off the wedding. He later apologises and tries to convince Paige to take him back, but she refuses, wanting to find direction in her life and believing they are too different.|$|E

500|$|Zito {{started playing}} guitar in 1999 {{as a way}} to pass time on road trips. He had not {{considered}} music as a profession until his sister, Sally Zito, asked him to play guitar in her country band with which he played during the offseason from 2002 to 2007. It was then that he began writing songs in preparation for a career after baseball. His 2015 comeback bid found him playing the majority of the season in Nashville, Tennessee, the home of country music. He used his time off to learn from the city's music industry professionals and to pursue songwriting. Zito released his first EP, titled <b>No</b> <b>Secrets,</b> on January 27, 2017. The collection contains six songs either written or co-written by Zito. He later co-wrote and sang vocals for a theme song for the Nashville Sounds, titled [...] "That Sound".|$|E

Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting <b>no</b> <b>secrets,</b> Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he had been talking to was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off.

2500|$|Mata Hari herself {{admitted}} under interrogation {{to taking}} money {{to work as}} a German spy. It is contended by some historians that Mata Hari may have merely accepted money from the Germans without actually carrying out any spy duties. At her trial, Zelle vehemently insisted that her sympathies were with the Allies and declared her passionate love of France, her adopted homeland. In October 2001, documents released from the archives of MI5 (British counter-intelligence) [...] were used by a Dutch group, the Mata Hari Foundation to ask the French government to exonerate Zelle as they argued that the MI5 files proved she was not guilty of the charges she was convicted of. A spokesman from the Mata Hari Foundation argued that at most Zelle was a low-level spy who provided <b>no</b> <b>secrets</b> to either side, stating: [...] "We believe that there are sufficient doubts concerning the dossier of information that was used to convict her to warrant re-opening the case. Maybe she wasn't entirely innocent, but it seems clear she wasn't the master-spy whose information sent thousands of soldiers to their deaths, as has been claimed.".|$|E

2500|$|Blue was {{an almost}} instant {{critical}} and commercial success, peaking in the top 20 in the Billboard Album Charts in September and also hitting the British Top 3. The lushly produced [...] "Carey" [...] was the single at the time, but musically, other parts of Blue departed further from the sounds of Ladies of the Canyon. Simpler, rhythmic acoustic parts allowed a focus on Mitchell's voice and emotions ("All I Want", [...] "A Case of You"), while others such as [...] "Blue", [...] "River" [...] and [...] "The Last Time I Saw Richard" [...] were sung to her rolling piano accompaniment. Her most confessional album, Mitchell later said of Blue, [...] "I have, on occasion, sacrificed myself and my own emotional makeup,... singing 'I'm selfish and I'm sad', for instance. We all suffer for our loneliness, {{but at the time}} of Blue, our pop stars never admitted these things." [...] In its lyrics, the album was regarded as an inspired culmination of her early work, with depressed assessments of the world around her serving as counterpoint to exuberant expressions of romantic love (for example, in [...] "California"). Mitchell later remarked, [...] "At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely <b>no</b> <b>secrets</b> from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong." ...|$|E
