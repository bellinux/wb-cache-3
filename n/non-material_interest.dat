40|$|The {{institution}} of “agricultural exception” involves the legally permitted possibility of departing from the accepted system of protecting plant varieties {{in order to}} secure the interest of farmers. This {{institution of}} the law allows them to pursue their interest by using, in their own farmsteads, harvested material from a protected variety as sowing material without having to obtain the cultivator’s consent, against adequate payment or without the obligation to make any payment. If one perceives agricultural exception in such a way, its legal nature makes it enter into the wider category of statutory licences related to <b>non-material</b> <b>interest.</b> The shape of the institution makes it resemble permitted private use, and in particular permitted public use, i. e. statutory licences related to copyright. However, agricultural exception has a number of properties that make it differ from statutory licences related to industrial property or copyright. The following features make agricultural exception differ from other statutory licences: the specific fundamental nature of the public interest that agricultural exception contributes to (securing the food security of a country), the specific manner of shaping of a limited group of entities the privilege is intended for, resulting from the application of this institution of law (it relates exclusively to farmers), the specific rules related to the direct payment of fees by the entities benefiting from the rule of agricultural exception: the fees are paid directly to the cultivators who are authorised to receive them under their exclusive right to the respective varieties. All these specific features constitute arguments for considering the institution of agricultural exception as a separate statutory licence of the agricultural law...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCorruption is {{analysed}} {{by addressing}} the interrelations between {{the moral and}} political economy regulating state-based welfare provision in Jharkhand, India. On the one hand, the article focuses on the rural elite to show that ‘corrupt' practices are not just guided by financial utility but also by <b>non-material</b> <b>interests,</b> underpinned by a multivarious moral economy. On the other hand, the article shows that the poorest {{in the rural areas}} (adivasis or Scheduled Tribes) keep away from the state, seeing it as beyond the moral pale, and instead resurrect an alternative sovereign structure. The adivasi perspectives are influenced by a political economy of historical experiences of the state and interrelations with the elites. The paper concludes that a particular political economy is intimately connected with a moral economy, and that transformations in political economy affect the moral economy...|$|R
40|$|Constructivism {{challenges}} the prevailing approaches to international relations and security. It attempts to explain, inter alia, how actors acquire their identities, {{and how these}} identities shape actors’ material and <b>non-material</b> <b>interests.</b> These constructed identities and interests further define mutually constructed rules, norms and institutions, which enable states and other actors to act accordingly. For constructivists, actors approach social facts {{in terms of the}} meaning, significance, value and beliefs these actors ascribe to such facts. Once an actor has constructed the social purpose (i. e. its identity and/or interests) of a particular social fact, the actor ascribes new meaning to this fact. The next step for the actor and others would then be to construct social practices based on mutually constructed norms, rules and institutions to engage with this social fact. States, therefore, could have different identities and varying interests at different times (Barnett, 2005 : 251 - 270) ...|$|R
40|$|During the Cold War, {{a battle}} between two major {{political}} ideologies – one promoting democracy and freedom, and the other authoritarian rule – took place. Countries {{on both sides of}} the battle had an arsenal of tools of Hard Power and what today we call Soft Power. The dichotomous conceptualization of power has been with us for a long time, even if we did not perceive it. The end of the Cold War has led to efforts to rethink the concept of power. Thanks to the pioneering and thought-defining works of Joseph Nye, the concept of Soft Power as a fundamental element of our strategic thinking has taken root. Professor Nye started a revolution in redefining our power resources altogether. The power toolbox consists of Hard and Soft Power tools, the former being tools of force and domination that are coercive in nature. Traditionally, people conceive of power as Hard Power, which has been used to make others adopt or follow policies that are beneficial to those who possess such power. Hard Power has been used excessively through the centuries. Superiority in war-fighting capabilities gave powers an edge that put them in positions of coercion and domination either by winning wars or by the threats they posed to others. Soft Power, however, has been part of the power toolbox for centuries too. Throughout history, rulers relied on it to convince and persuade. Soft Power has always accompanied Hard Power. Following wars, the occupying forces often turned to ways to accommodate the material and <b>non-material</b> <b>interests</b> of the occupied. The courts of the Ottoman Empire and Europe used the arts, culture and cuisine to entice, influence and convince the occupied. One could argue that the Catholic Church is a great example of Soft Power. The Vatican has had a disproportionate globa...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{union membership}} {{among members of}} the Danish Trade Union Congress (LO). In contrast to most studies about union futures, it takes a subjective membership perspective by drawing empirically on an original database established by the authors. First, we show that there exists a widespread commitment to the union parallel with a very strong connection to the firm. The values of members are highly individualized, favouring <b>non-material</b> needs and <b>interests</b> and strongly supporting the public welfare system. Secondly, solidarity has changed; it has certainly not disappeared, but, in line with the trends of decentralization of the negotiation system, it has become more oriented towards the narrow relations in the workplace and at the local society level. The thesis of everyday solidarity seems to be confirmed. The relatively strong membership commitment is offset by abundant criticism of the union leaders who, {{in the eyes of the}} members, are primarily running an apparatus more than they are providing activities in which the members can involve themselves and take part democratically. The final judgement is that the unions in Denmark have a future if they articulate and negotiate the interests of their members. This future seems highly conditional upon sensitive listening on the part of the leaders. In creating a fundament for formulating policies, they must hear what members think and want and they must use democratic decision-making procedures congruent with the integrity of their members. Contingent on these measures, unions probably have a good opportunity to survive and develop in a post-industrial society dominated by rules and norms of ’service capitalism’...|$|R
