Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year in operating revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E

Relative information content tests reveal that <b>net</b> and <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> appear to be more value relevant than EVA. Additionally, incremental information tests suggest that EVA unique components add only marginally to the information content of accounting profit. Moreover, EVA does not appear to have a stronger correlation with firms' Market Value Added than the other variables, suggesting that - for our Greek dataset - EVA, even though useful as a performance evaluation tool, need not necessarily be more correlated with shareholder's value than established accounting variables.

This study is an examination of the agency costs that result from the conflict of interests between owners and managers. A nationwide proprietary sample of 242 apartment properties is analyzed to compare agency costs of four distinct types of ownership structures. Agency costs, measured as operating expenses per square foot, are found to be significantly higher for institutional owners than for noninstitutional owners, but not significantly higher in cases where no competition for property management services exists. We conclude that agency costs of property management contracts are significant and the fee provisions of standard property management contracts should be changed to better align the interests of managers and owners.

40|$|Pricing {{commercial}} real estate has its foundations in present value theory. Recent improvements for accessing transaction data have stimulated interest in commercial property hedonic pricing models, the structures of which follow traditions in single-family real estate in that the implicit prices of property characteristics and site-specific variables represent city and national market conditions. Adding present value variables has become increasingly common to account for general market conditions. We test two hedonic pricing models; one that follows the residential tradition and another that departs by incorporating city-specific <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>incomes</b> and the discount rates. Modeling prices in these alternative ways allows for recognition of the relative contributions of property, city, and capital market determinants. Empirical testing relies on a sample of hotel transactions from 2005 – 2010. The responsiveness of hotel cash flows to market changes is an important consideration. We find that models with property characteristics perform {{about the same as}} models that also include present value variables. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that implicit prices corresponding to property characteristics and site-specific variables appear to reflect income streams associated with city and nationwide economic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{real estate}} pricing has its {{foundations}} in present value theory although improved access to transaction data heightened interest in hedonic pricing models. Heretofore, the commercial property versions {{of these models}} follow traditions for pricing non-market rent paying durable assets, principally residential housing. We present a pricing model that departs from tradition by incorporating city-specific <b>net</b> <b>operating</b> <b>incomes</b> and the capitalization rates into the hedonic equation. Property attributes and location characteristics serve as proxies for unobservable, asset cash flows; city incomes account for local cash flow effects; and the capitalization rate represent local and national capital market influences. Modeling commercial real estate in this way allows us to recognize the relative contributions of property, local market, and national market determinants. Empirical testing relies on a sample of hotel transactions from 2005 - 2010. The choice of hotels stems from the responsiveness of these properties’ cash flows to market changes {{in the absence of}} lease friction and the homogeneity of the physical assets. Our model explains nearly 80 percent of the variation in hotel asset prices. We find that prices are collectively determined by property, city income, and capital market characteristics.

The proxy of the firm stock market activity is the stock return. The investigation of this issue is crucial to be investigated due to almost every minute, the stock prices of the public firms are fluctuating significantly and it has been a common phenomenon which often happens in the stock exchange. The factors that cause the volatility of the stock prices still become the subject of debate. The main difference between the last studies is the fundamental factors of the last studies are measured by the financial ratios. Whereas, the fundamental factors of the study are measured with <b>net</b> <b>income,</b> <b>operating</b> cash flow, and equity book value. This is caused by the firms activity parameters which get the main attention from the investors and the creditors are income and cash flow information. On the other hand, if the firm suffers a financial loss, the market acts as if trust to the book value as the future normal revenue that is expected and also as the prediction of the bankruptcy. This study applies the Ohlson (1995) valuation theory. The study hypothesis: first, the systematic risk factor influences positively toward the stock return. Second, the fundamental factors influence positively toward the stock return. Third, the systematic risk factor and the fundamental factors do together influencing positively toward the stock return.
