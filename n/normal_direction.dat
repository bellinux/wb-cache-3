5|$|To date, {{there have}} been two main {{investigations}} conducted by the MPCC in relation to Afghan detainees. The first was launched on 9 February 2007 after a formal complaint by Amir Attaran regarding the treatment of three specific detainees arrested in Kandahar region in April 2006. The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled the detainees appropriately, and were given medical treatment. However, the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one of the detainees became injured, contrary to <b>normal</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E

40|$|The GEOS- 1 {{satellite}} wave {{data have}} been used to determine the wave <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> of chorus emissions in the off-equatorial region of the outer magnetosphere based on the wave distribution function method. The wave <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> with respect to the magnetic field have been discussed as functions of wave frequency normalized by the local gyrofrequency and of the slope, df/dt of an emission. Two different kinds of chorus structures (rising tone and impulsive one) have been treated. A comparison of the present behaviour of off-equatorial wave <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> with the previous equatorial wave normal measurements has enabled us to discuss the generation and propagation mechanism of chorus emissions with different structures (rising tone, falling tone, constant frequency tone and impulsive one), and finally we suggest the future problems to study...|$|R

Zvezda is {{at the rear of}} the station according to its <b>normal</b> <b>direction</b> of travel and orientation, and its engines may be used to boost the station's orbit.

25|$|To {{clean the}} filter, water is passed quickly upward through the filter, {{opposite}} the <b>normal</b> <b>direction</b> (called backflushing or backwashing) to remove embedded or unwanted particles. Prior to this step, compressed air may be blown {{up through the}} bottom of the filter to break up the compacted filter media to aid the backwashing process; this is known as air scouring. This contaminated water can be disposed of, along with the sludge from the sedimentation basin, or it can be recycled by mixing with the raw water entering the plant although this is often considered poor practice since it re-introduces an elevated concentration of bacteria into the raw water.|$|E
25|$|At {{any point}} on a surface a <b>normal</b> <b>direction</b> is {{at right angles}} to the surface because the sphere these are the lines {{radiating}} out {{from the center of the}} sphere. The intersection of a plane that contains the normal with the surface will form a curve that is called a normal section, and the curvature of this curve is the normal curvature. For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures. Any closed surface will have at least four points called umbilical points. At an umbilic all the sectional curvatures are equal; in particular the principal curvatures are equal. Umbilical points can be thought of as the points where the surface is closely approximated by a sphere.|$|E

Compared to other existing, similar algorithms that consider surface foreshortening effects, our algorithm is more efficient since it decomposes a 2 D surface orientation search into two 1 D searches along two pairs of epipolar lines, and more robust since two pairs of stereo images from three cameras are used and the decomposition makes it possible for our algorithm to detect and match surface points near 3 D edges.

[2002] {{provided}} probabalistic {{descriptions of}} the jovian bow shock and magnetopause locations by mapping spacecraft observations to the sub-solar point along model surfaces derived from the MHD simulation of Ogino et al. [1998]. The resulting statistics are strongly affected by the surface models used in the mapping process. Here we analyze {{the quality of the}} surface models used in that mapping by comparing the <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> of the observed boundary crossings to the <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> predicted by the model surfaces. We have identified 116 magnetopause and 132 bow shock crossings in the Galileo data from orbits 0 - 34 using both the plasma wave (PWS) and magnetometer (MAG) data sets. We have determined the boundary <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> for both these newly identified crossings as well as the previously published crossings of Galileo, Ulysses, Voyager and Pioneer. When possible, boundary normals were determined from the MAG data by the minimum variance technique of Sonnerup and Cahill [1967].

The analyzed boundary crossings (130 magnetopause, 156 bow shock) are well distributed in loca...|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} a {{permutation}} is measured as {{the sum of the}} distances between the transformed centroids R (m^(c)_i) and the centroids of the respective planar segments m^(p)_i. Under the assumption that calibration patterns and planes have been accurately detected, then the minimum of the error metric corresponds to the best initialization. Note that other metrics could be employed here as well, e.g., metrics based on <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> or combinations of <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> and centroids. However, we found the metric in Eq. (3) to be sufficient, since the initialization requires only a rough estimate of the spatial relation. In our experiments, the number of permutations K to search through was always low, since most plane candidates are already filtered out using the sizes of the calibration patterns.|$|R

40|$|The {{ditching}} {{characteristics of}} the space shuttle orbiter were examined. Tests were made with a 1 / 20 -scale model in order to determine behavior patterns and accelerations imparted to the ditching vehicle. Ditchings were made with different configurations of weight and gear position. Also the effects of different water surface conditions were investigated. The test results indicated that the favorable conditions for ditching usually involve a landing attitude of 12 deg. Smooth ditchings were always associated with the landing-gear retracted and never with the landing-gear extended. Higher landing mass, generally, resulted in higher acceleration values in both the longitudinal and <b>normal</b> <b>directions.</b> Surface waves tend to increase the pitch accelerations {{but at the same time}} tend to reduce the accelerations in the longitudinal and <b>normal</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{real and}} {{imaginary}} parts of spectral matrices of magnetic field fluctuations near 4 and 5 AU are used separately to generate estimates of hydromagnetic wave <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> over the frequency range 0. 00001 to 0. 01 Hz in the spacecraft frame. Both procedures suggest {{the predominance of}} the Alfven mode over the fast and slow MHD modes among transverse magnetic field perturbations. Both procedures also show that the Alfven mode is more common among transverse perturbations at 4 AU than at 5 AU. Statistical techniques are for estimating uncertainties in computed wave <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> and it is concluded that the real parts of the spectral matrices are more useful than the imaginary parts in specifying wave normals at times of magnetic quiet in the solar wind near 4 and 5 AU...|$|R

2500|$|In certain {{situations}} where strong electroosomotic flow toward the cathode is undesirable, the inner {{surface of the}} capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the <b>normal</b> <b>direction</b> of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode). [...] CE instrumentation typically includes power supplies with reversible polarity, allowing the same instrument {{to be used in}} [...] "normal" [...] mode (with EOF and detection near the cathodic end of the capillary) and [...] "reverse" [...] mode (with EOF suppressed or reversed, and detection near the anodic end of the capillary). [...] One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. [...] The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable vinyl group (e.g. 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free radical initiator. [...] The acrylamide is polymerized in situ, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. [...] Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. [...] Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. [...] For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. [...] A variety of dynamic capillary coating agents are commercially available to modify, suppress, or reverse the direction of electroosmotic flow. [...] Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between [...] "sticky" [...] analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. [...] Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.|$|E
40|$|Detecting the {{dominant}} <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> {{to the decision}} surface is an established technique for feature selection in high dimensional classification problems. Several approaches have been proposed to render this strategy more amenable to practice, but they still show {{a number of important}} shortcomings from a pragmatic point of view. This paper introduces a novel such approach, which combines the <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> idea with Support Vector Machine classifiers. The two make a natural and powerful match, as SVs are located nearby, and fully describe the decision surfaces. The approach can be included elegantly into the training of performant classifiers from extensive datasets. The potential is corroborated by experiments, both on synthetic and real data, the latter on a face detection experiment. In this experiment we demonstrate how our approach can lead to a significant reduction of CPU-time, with neglectable loss of classification performance. 1...|$|R

Between this, the greatest possible and no deviation from the <b>normal</b> <b>direction,</b> every degree could be observed in the tentacles on these several leaves. Notwithstanding the precision with which the tentacles generally were directed, those near the circumference of one leaf were not accurately directed towards some phosphate of lime at a rather distant point {{on the opposite side of}} the disc. It appeared as if the motor [page 246] impulse in passing transversely across nearly the whole width of the disc had departed somewhat from a true course. This accords with what we have already seen of the impulse travelling less readily in a transverse than in a longitudinal direction. In some other cases, the exterior tentacles did not seem capable of such accurate movement as the shorter and more central ones.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{address the problem of}} {{separating}} Lambertian and specu-lar reflection components in order {{to improve the quality of}} surface normal information recoverable using shape-from-shading. The framework for our study is provided by the iterated conditional modes algorithm. We develop a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation method for estimat-ing the mixing proportions for Lambertian and specular reflectance, and also, for recovering local surface normals. The MAP estimation scheme has two model ingredients. Firstly, there are separate conditional measurement den-sities which describe the distributions of surface <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> for the Lambertian and specular reflectance components. The second ingredient is a smoothness prior which models the distribution of surface <b>normal</b> <b>directions</b> over local image regions. We experiment with the method on real-world data. This reveals not only that the method accurately estimates the proportion of specular reflection, but that it also results in good surface normal reconstruc-tion in the proximity of specular highlights. ...|$|R
