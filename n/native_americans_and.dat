The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen.

His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> European Americans.|$|E

The volcano was not analyzed until 1884, when a team from the United States Geological Survey sampled its fulgurite deposits.|$|E

Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil.

Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe species tend to {{concentrate}} sodium chloride and other salts absorbed from the soils {{in which they}} grow in their leaves and stem tissues. <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> early travelers in the American West used this plant as a salt substitute to season wild game. The entire plant is edible, but reported to be very salty and bitter unless well cooked. The juice from the leaves {{was used as a}} poultice for mild skin irritations and burns. Leaves can be used in salads and soups; flowers taste best before blooming. E. lutea has been used for cooking in Peru.|$|E
