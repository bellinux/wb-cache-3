The exact literary category or classification that Duan's large informal narrative would fit into is still debated amongst scholars and historians.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{recreate}} the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, RSP studied <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> such as volcanoes, instead of relying on archived footage of atomic blasts, and recreated the effects digitally. They also replaced the Sydney cityscape on the horizon with views of Nagasaki. The walking bear featured in the Yukon scenes was created with computer graphics by Weta Digital, while Make-Up Effects Group built a 12 foot tall animatronic bear, that was used for shots of the creature dying after it {{had been hit by}} poisoned arrows fired by hunters.|$|E
5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a {{physical}} model of the Enterprise. For the ship's dramatic introduction, the effects team combined motion control shots of the Enterprise model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena,</b> was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about the {{suggested}} techniques is based on laboratory experiments, observations of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena,</b> and on computer modelling techniques. Some proposed climate engineering methods employ methods that have analogues in <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> such as stratospheric sulfur aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei. As such, studies about the efficacy of these methods can draw on information already available from other research, such as that following the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. However, comparative evaluation of the relative merits of each technology is complicated, especially given modelling uncertainties and the early stage of engineering development of many proposed climate engineering methods.|$|E

25|$|Scientific skeptics {{advocate}} critical {{investigation of}} claims of paranormal phenomena: applying {{the scientific method}} to reach a rational, scientific explanation of the phenomena {{to account for the}} paranormal claims, taking into account that alleged paranormal abilities and occurrences are sometimes hoaxes or misinterpretations of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena.</b> A way of summarizing this method is by the application of Occam's razor, which suggests that the simpler solution is usually the correct one. The standard scientific models give the explanation that what appears to be paranormal phenomena is usually a misinterpretation, misunderstanding, or anomalous variation of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena,</b> rather than an actual paranormal phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Several Eskimo peoples had {{beliefs in}} usage of amulets, {{formulae}} (spells, charms).

As for Sirenik Eskimos, {{in one of their}} tales, we find the motif of the effective calling of <b>natural</b> <b>phenomena</b> for help in danger: an eagle is pursuing people on the ice, and a woman begins to talk about calling wind and frost, then at once the river freezes in, and the eagle freezes onto the ice.|$|E
