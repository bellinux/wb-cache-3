5|$|HMS Gorgon was {{the first}} ship {{completed}} and she served as tender to HMS Cambridge, the gunnery school ship at Devonport, from 1874 to 1877. All four ships were commissioned between April and August 1878 during the war scare during the Russo-Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key's Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour. She resumed her duties as tender to HMS Cambridge until she was refitted in 1888–89. All four of the ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve. HMS Gorgon, like all of her sisters, {{was placed on the}} <b>non-effective</b> list in 1901 and sold in 1903 for £8,400.|$|E

25|$|HMS Hydra was {{the second}} ship to be completed, {{although}} she was the last ship of the class launched. She was placed in 1st Reserve after her completion. The ship, along with her sisters, was commissioned between April and August 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key's Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour. Hydra was paid off at Sheerness in August 1878 and served as tender to HMS Duncan. The ship was refitted in 1888–89 and was in Fleet Reserve at Chatham until 1901. All four ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892.

60|$|The {{position}} was hopeless, and on October 13 a council of war was held {{and it was}} determined to open negotiations for a surrender. Two days were spent in negotiations, and it was finally agreed that the army should lay down its arms and {{that it should be}} marched to Boston, and there allowed to sail for England on condition of not serving again in North America during the contest. The Canadians were to be allowed to return at once to their own country. On the 16th the army laid down its arms. It consisted of thirty-five hundred fighting men and six hundred sick and nearly two thousand boatmen, teamsters, and other <b>non-effectives.</b>|$|R
60|$|A few English troops {{arrived from}} Allahabad and at midnight upon the 4th of June, when the natives broke into revolt, {{there were in}} the intrenchments of Cawnpore eighty-three {{officers}} of various regiments, sixty men of the Eighty-fourth Regiment, and seventy of the Thirty-second, fifteen of the First Madras Fusiliers, and a few invalid gunners; the whole defensive force consisting of about two hundred and forty men, and six guns. There were under their charge {{a large number of}} ladies and children, the wives and families of the officers and civilians at the station, sixty-four women and seventy-six children belonging to the soldiers, with a few native servants who remained faithful. The total number of women, children, and <b>non-effectives</b> amounted to about eight hundred and seventy persons.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this point}} there opens a tempting path, and along it {{historical}} precedents, like {{a forest of}} notice-boards, urge us to go. At {{the end of the}} vista poses the figure of Napoleon with [...] "Cæsarism" [...] written beneath it. Disregarding certain alien considerations for a time, assuming the free working out of democracy to its conclusion, we perceive that, in the case of our generalized state, the party machine, together with the nation entrusted to it, must necessarily be forced into passionate national war. But, having blundered into war, the party machine will have an air of having accomplished its destiny. A party machine or a popular government is surely as likely a thing to cause a big disorder of war and as unlikely a thing to conduct it, as the wit of man, working solely to that end, could ever have devised. I have already pointed out why we can never expect an elected government of the modern sort to be guided by any far-reaching designs, it is constructed to get office and keep office, not to do anything in office, the conditions of its survival are to keep appearances up and taxes down,[36] and the care and management of army and navy is quite outside its possibilities. The military and naval professions in our typical modern State will subsist very largely upon tradition, the ostensible government will interfere with rather than direct them, {{and there will be no}} force in the entire scheme to check the corrupting influence of a long peace, to insist upon adequate exercises for the fighting organization or ensure an adequate adaptation to the new and perpetually changing possibilities of untried apparatus. Incapable but confident and energetic persons, having political influence, will have been permitted to tamper with the various arms of the service, the equipment will be largely devised to create an impression of efficiency in times of peace in the minds of the general voting public, and the really efficient soldiers will either have fretted themselves out of the army or have been driven out as political <b>non-effectives,</b> troublesome, innovating persons anxious to spend money upon [...] "fads." [...] So armed, the New Democracy will blunder into war, and the opening stage of the next great war will be the catastrophic breakdown of the formal armies, shame and disasters, and a disorder of conflict between more or less equally matched masses of stupefied, scared, and infuriated people. Just how far the thing may rise from the value of an alarming and edifying incident to a universal catastrophe, depends upon the special nature of the conflict, but it does not alter the fact that any considerable war is bound to be a bitter, appalling, highly educational and constitution-shaking experience for the modern democratic state.|$|R
500|$|HMS Cyclops was {{the third}} ship to be completed, {{although}} she was the lead ship of the class. She was placed in 1st Class [...] after her completion. The ship, along with her sisters, was commissioned between April and August 1878 during the Russo-Turkish War for service with Admiral Sir Cooper Key's Particular Service Squadron in Portland Harbour. Cyclops was paid off at Chatham in August 1878 and refitted in 1887–89. All four ships of the class participated in the annual fleet manoeuvers in 1887, 1889–90 and 1892; in between times they were in Fleet Reserve. HMS Cyclops, like all of her sisters, {{was placed on the}} <b>non-effective</b> list in January 1902, transferred to the E Division of the Dockyard Reserve at Sheerness in May 1902, and sold on 7 July 1903 for £8,400.|$|E
60|$|But the {{brushwood}} {{proved a}} poor defence, {{for many of}} those who stooped behind it, as they ran, suddenly collapsed and dropped, as men are wont to do when hit in the brain. Still, a few were left to push the cart forward. Smoke disconcerted the aim of the defenders to some extent, and terror helped to make the firing wild and <b>non-effective.</b>|$|E
60|$|Out of {{this grand}} total {{there were about}} 400 sick and <b>non-effective</b> with the 1st Division, 300 with the 2nd Division, and 600 (including some of Wood's Irregulars, absent and not {{accounted}} for since the 28th of March) with Wood's Flying Column. So that altogether, deducting, say, 1500, Lord Chelmsford had at his disposal, {{from the middle of}} April, a total of 21,000 troops, of which over 15,000 were European. Colonels Pearson and Wood were made Brigadier-Generals, and the former was to command Number 1 Brigade, 1st Division, and Colonel Pemberton, 3-60th, the other. They both, however, had to give up their commands through sickness, and Colonels Rowland, V.C., C.B., and Clark, 57th Regiment, succeeded them.|$|E
60|$|It will {{be obvious}} that the {{interest}} of this speculation, at any rate, centres upon this great intermediate mass {{of people who are}} neither passively wealthy, the sleeping partners of change, nor helplessly thrust out of the process. Indeed, from our point of view--an inquiry into coming things--these <b>non-effective</b> masses would have but the slightest interest were it not for their enormous possibilities of reaction upon the really living portion of the social organism. This really living portion seems at first sight to be as deliquescent in its nature, to be drifting down to as chaotic a structure as either the non-functional owners that float above it or the unemployed who sink below. What were once the definite subdivisions of the middle class modify and lose their boundaries. The retail tradesman of the towns, for example--once a fairly homogeneous class throughout Europe--expands here into vast store companies, and dwindles there to be an agent or collector, seeks employment or topples outright into the abyss. But under a certain scrutiny one can detect here what we do not detect in our other two elements, and that is that, going on {{side by side with the}} processes of dissolution and frequently masked by these, there are other processes by which men, often of the most diverse parentage and antecedent traditions, are being segregated into a multitude of specific new groups which may presently develop very distinctive characters and ideals.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Non-effective</b> {{conjugation}} is {{the phenomenon}} of meiotic chromosome pairing without chiasmata, including the absence of crossing over. Where these meiosis occurs, it is commonly limited {{to one of the}} two sexes gametogenesis. The most frequent feature of such meiosis is the absence any opening-out of the homologues chromosomes in diakinesis. The four bivalent chromatide are staying parallel until the beginning of the metaphase. <b>Non-effective</b> conjugation is a distinct and specific mechanism that occurs independently in numerous organisms and species. It is rare in higher plants, and not registered in vertebrates [...]|$|E

50|$|Bait {{placed in}} the open, away from a wall, is {{essentially}} <b>non-effective</b> because cockroaches {{are less likely to}} locate it. Twice as much food per day was consumed when it was next to a nest rather than 50 cm away. A small quantity of bait in many locations provides better control than large quantities in a few locations.|$|E
50|$|Reservists {{are obliged}} to {{accumulate}} a minimum of 14 full days of service per year and may not exceed 30 days of unauthorized absence during which no fewer than 3 duty periods were conducted by the reservist's unit. Those failing to adhere to these requirements can be deemed to be <b>Non-Effective</b> Strength and can be subject to administrative action.|$|E
50|$|Effective {{porosity}} : Log effective porosity.

50|$|Initially it {{appeared}} that the BPP would provide a venue for the Communist Party of Indonesia broad cooperation with the Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI). However, as the PNI eventually rejected the invitation to join the BPP, the coalition rapidly became <b>non-effective.</b> The Communist Party on its hand continued to refer to the BPP Common Programme as the basis of its united front work, even after the BPP had ceased to function.|$|E
50|$|On 1 August 1919 Slater {{was granted}} a {{permanent}} commission in the Royal Air Force with the rank of flight lieutenant.

50|$|The drug {{offers a}} small {{residual}} effect in ruminants unless and otherwise it is delivered {{by using a}} slow-release device. This essentially means that on a single administration it will help in killing the parasites which {{are present in the}} host during the time of treatment and also prevent against re-infestations for some more days but not weeks or months. The residual effect is comparatively shorter in non-ruminants. The drug is <b>non-effective</b> against flukes and external parasites at therapeutic dose.|$|E

50|$|Shigeru Ban {{is famous}} for his passion for using paper {{material}} in his projects. Indeed, paper although seemingly soft and <b>non-effective</b> for building, can actually be strong and trustful if used in the right way. Moreover, it is cheap, light and recyclable. Shegeru Ban is also known for his humanistic beliefs and social orientation. He built shelters for refuges in Africa and South America. There he noticed that cheap plastic shelters were too cold for people and it was more appropriate to use paper shelters.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{necessity}} of middle managers {{in an organization}} is questioned. They {{are said to be}} too costly, <b>non-effective</b> and constantly underperforming employees. It has been stated that middle managers do not carry out their main duties of linking the organization and reporting effectively, which leads to a block of communication between different levels of staff. Thus, as rapid growth of globalization put pressures on businesses in terms of cost effectiveness and speed of information flow within the organization, middle management make companies less flexible and competitive.|$|E

50|$|In 1903 Gannet {{was ordered}} to relieve the {{original}} HMS President of 1829, which had served as the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve drill ship in London Docks since 1862, and underwent major alterations to convert her into a drill ship. Renamed HMS President, she took up her new duties as the headquarters ship of the London Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in the South West India Docks in June 1903. In 1909 the ship was renamed President II and {{in the spring of}} 1911, was relieved by HMS Buzzard, again finding herself on the list of <b>non-effective</b> vessels.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{controlling}} using {{hand picking}} and pheromone traps are used. Cultural practices like crop rotation mechanisms, reducing water levels {{are also used}} in controlling. Natural enemies such as parasitoides are very effective and nature loving controlling measures. Techinid fly Sturmiopsis inferens also once used, but now <b>non-effective</b> due to their low abundance. In chemical control, BHC, DDT, fenthion, fenitrothion, quinalphos, phosphamidon sprays and granules of lindane are used. Eggs can eliminate by introducing Trichogramma minutum and Telenomeus species. Apanteles flavipes, Bracon chinensis and Sturmiopsis inferens are effective against caterpillars, whereas Xanthopinpla species and Tetrastichus aygari are used in pupal stages.|$|E
50|$|She was {{commissioned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet on 24 June 1878. After paying {{off into the}} Reserve at Malta in 1883 she was recommissioned in 1885, and served as guardship at Singapore until 1890, when she was demoted to the second class reserve at Malta. After refit and repair she remained in dockyard reserve at Chatham until declared <b>non-effective</b> in January 1902. Three months later, in April 1902, she became a depot-ship at Malta for torpedo-boats, Captain Charles Madden in command. In 1913 she was converted to a store-ship at Devonport {{under the name of}} Orontes until her sale in 1913.|$|E
50|$|A supermartingale is a betting {{strategy}} {{where the}} expected capital after a bet {{is no more}} than the capital before a bet, in contrast to a martingale where the two are always equal. This allows more flexibility, and is very similar in the <b>non-effective</b> case, since whenever a supermartingale d is given, there is a modified function d which wins at least as much money as d and which is actually a martingale. However it is useful to allow the additional flexibility once one starts talking about actually giving algorithms to determine the betting strategy, as some algorithms lend themselves more naturally to producing supermartingales than martingales.|$|E
