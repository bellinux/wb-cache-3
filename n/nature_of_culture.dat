25|$|The {{heterogeneous}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> in Israel is {{also manifested}} in Israeli cuisine, a diverse combination of local ingredients and dishes, with diasporic dishes {{from around the}} world. An Israeli fusion cuisine has developed, with the adoption and continued adaption of elements of various Jewish styles of cuisine including Mizrahi, Sephardic, Yemeni Jewish and Ashkenazi, and many foods traditionally eaten in the Middle East. Israeli cuisine is also influenced by geography, giving prominence to foods common in the Mediterranean region such as olives, chickpeas, dairy products, fish, and fresh fruits and vegetables. The main meal is usually lunch rather than dinner. Jewish holidays influence the cuisine, with many traditional foods served at holiday times. Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday night, is a significant meal in {{a large proportion of}} Israeli homes. While not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the observance of kashrut influences the menu in homes, public institutions and many restaurants.|$|E

[...] Culture is [...] "the imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment."

Human tool-making and language express [...] "similar, if not identical, cognitive processes" [...] and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved.|$|E
2500|$|Burundi {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland), to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups; the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics. [...] However, it is important to note that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> and ethnic groups is always fluid and changing. While the groups might have migrated to the area at different times and as distinctly different ethnic groups, the current distinctions are contemporary socio-cultural constructs. Initially the different ethnic groups lived together in relative peace. The first conflicts between ethnic groups can be dated back to the 17th century, when land was becoming ever more scarce because of the continuous growth in population.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subject matter}} of his work turned toward the rapidly {{approaching}} 500th anniversary in 1992 of Christopher Columbus, and his arrival in North America. He found in this event, a rich source for a discussion on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture,</b> as well as revisions and versions of history. He created at this time,(1989–1992) {{a body of work}} entitled The Columbus Project. Its first stage had exhibition venues in Peterborough, Ontario at both ArtSpace (curated by Shelagh Young), and also the Art Gallery of Peterborough. The second phase of the Columbus Project was an exhibition at The Power Plant in Toronto, curated by Richard Rhodes entitled the Columbus Boat. The exhibition continued on to venues in Italy and the United States. Beam's imagery for the Columbus Project was cross-culturally vast, and contained the primary images of Columbus, and Native peoples, but also images of Martin Luther King, John F. Kennedy, [...] Albert Einstein, and Abraham Lincoln, Italian Christian iconography, diverse animal species, self-portraits and technology (stop lights, rockets). There were two sculptural elements, Voyage a partial reconstruction of the Santa Maria, and the Ampulleta, a [...] hourglass, with one obstructive stone within the sand, as well as several installations, and a video performance of Beam in the Dominican Republic, making a representational graveyard on the beaches where the landing could have taken place.|$|E

50|$|Individualism {{refers to}} people {{regarding}} themselves as individuals, while communitarianism refers to people regarding themselves {{as part of}} a group. Trompenaars research yielded some interesting results and suggested that cultures may change more quickly that many people realize. It may not be surprising to see a country like the United States with high individualism, but Mexico and the former communist countries of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were also found to be individualistic in Trompenaars research. In Mexico, the shift from a previously communitarian culture could be explained with its membership in NAFTA and involvement in the global economy. This contrasts with Hofstede's earlier research, which found these countries to be collectivist, and shows the dynamic and complex <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture.</b> Countries with high communitarianism include Germany, China, France, Japan, and Singapore.|$|E

The comparison shows that mindprints appear in all these areas except for modern art, where mindprints appear only partially and in a distorted or ruined form. In the other areas, mindprints appear {{at a level of}} abstraction which increases with the advance from prehistory to our own time. In other words, Avital anchors the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> in general and that of art in particular in the nature of mind. Furthermore, he hints at the possibility that this system of mindprints is the basis for all general epistemology and ontology, and it seems to exist at all levels of being: physical, biological, social, noetic, at both macro and micro scales.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} culture has {{attracted}} attention in both academic and business circles. It is often argued that organisational culture influences the behaviour of individuals within that organisation. This paper examines the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> organisational <b>culture</b> in hotels. It presents the preliminary findings of research conducted into the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> organisational <b>culture</b> in hotel settings. An organisational culture instrument was developed from issues considered important by hotel workers and items {{present in the}} literature. This instrument was used to collect data from employees from six hotels in Far North Queensland. The data was analysed using a range of analytical procedures, including correlations, Kruska-Wallis tests and multiple regressions, to develop a profile <b>of</b> the organisational <b>culture</b> in hotels. The results indicate that there exists a cosmopolitan hospitality culture which governs the behaviour and performance of hospitality workers. This culture embraces the true <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> hospitality...|$|R
