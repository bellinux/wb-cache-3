Two entertainment areas have remained constant in the section, a proscenium theatre and a stunt and acrobatic space surrounded by water. Currently named Wonderland Theatre, the indoor facility has hosted a variety of stage show revues, ice shows, and now an acrobatic production, Cirque Ambiente. A structure within Arthur's Baye initially featured a pirate diving and acrobatics show, which has changed <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more generic theme; it is currently branded Kinet–X.|$|E

25|$|Owing to a {{declaration}} lodged by the United Kingdom with the EEC in 1982, Gibraltarians {{were to be}} counted as British nationals {{for the purposes of}} Community law. This was notwithstanding that they were not all, at the time, British citizens but many were British Overseas Territories citizens. As such Gibraltarians have enjoyed European Union citizenship from its creation by the Maastricht Treaty. Since 21 May 2002, all Gibraltarians have been granted the right to register a full British citizenship, while those who previously held a British Overseas Territory citizenship automatically were converted <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a full British citizenship. Any child born in Gibraltar after 21 May 2002 will automatically become a British citizen, if just one of its parents is a British citizen or a Gibraltarian resident.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1896, Elsie Kipling was born, the couple's second daughter. By this time, {{according}} to several biographers, their marital relationship was no longer light-hearted and spontaneous. Although they would always remain loyal to each other, they seemed <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fallen into set roles. In {{a letter to a}} friend who had become engaged around this time, the 30‑year‑old Kipling offered this sombre counsel: marriage principally taught [...] "the tougher virtues—such as humility, restraint, order, and forethought." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Chichen Itza they {{excavated}} {{a structure}} {{known as the}} Platform of the Eagles and Jaguars and unearthed a large statue or altar figurine.

Although their derivation of the name is known <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had no association with figures of this type, the name has remained in general use among later archaeologists. This statue would later {{be used as a}} demonstration of Toltec influences at the site, with other examples found at the Toltec capital, Tula. They also documented their excavation of the Platform of Venus with photos as well as plan and cross-section drawings.|$|E

2500|$|During the anti-conscription {{crisis in}} April 1918 O'Brien and his AFIL left the House of Commons and joined Sinn Féin and other prominentaries {{in the mass}} protests in Dublin. Seeing no future for his conciliatory {{political}} concepts in a future election, he believed Sinn Féin in its moderate form had {{earned the right to}} represent nationalist interests. He and the other members of his All-for-Ireland League party stood aside putting their seats at the disposal of Sinn Féin, its candidates returned unopposed in the December 1918 general elections. In an address to the election he had said: [...] "We cannot subscribe to a programme of armed resistance in the field, or even of permanent withdrawal from Westminster; but to the spirit of Sinn Féin, as distinct from its abstract programme, the great mass of independent single-minded Irishmen have been won over, and accordingly they ought <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a full and sympathetic trial for enforcing the Irish nation's right of self-determination." ...|$|E
2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} were <b>now</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> major {{consequences for}} the war in Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vendôme north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that Saint-Simon considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was [...] "now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [...] … for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war." [...] The Duke of Orléans, under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vendôme, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at Villastellone in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces besieging Turin on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies—"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;" [...] wrote Marlborough, [...] "for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days." ...|$|E
