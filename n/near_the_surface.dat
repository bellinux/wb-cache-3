This caused $100,000 worth {{of damage to}} the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt {{as far away as}} Honolulu. This was probably caused by magma movement <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> but there was no surface activity or eruption.|$|E

5|$|The {{observed}} helium to hydrogen {{ratio in}} Vega is 0.030±0.005, {{which is about}} 40% lower than the Sun.

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is warmer than the surroundings at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation and destructive fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built {{exclusively on the}} edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. Demonstration projects are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other demonstration projects are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} for the internal flows of the axial flow stator and diagonal flow rotor.

For the design flow rate, {{the values of the}} axial velocity and the total pressure at stator outlet decrease between <b>near</b> <b>the</b> suction <b>surface</b> and <b>near</b> <b>the</b> hub <b>surface</b> by <b>the</b> influence of corner wall. For the flow rate of 80 - 90 % of the design flow rate, the corner separation of the stator between <b>the</b> suction <b>surface</b> and <b>the</b> hub <b>surface</b> is observed, which becomes widely spread for 80 % of the design flow rate. At rotor outlet for 81 % of the design flow rate, the low axial velocity region grows between <b>near</b> <b>the</b> suction <b>surface</b> of rotor and <b>the</b> casing <b>surface</b> because of <b>the</b> tip leakage flow of the rotor...|$|R

5|$|Monodontids {{consist of}} two species: the beluga and the narwhal. They both {{reside in the}} frigid arctic and both have large amounts of blubber. Belugas, being white, hunt in large pods <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and around pack ice, their {{coloration}} acting as camouflage. Narwhals, being black, hunt in large pods in the aphotic zone, but their underbelly still remains white to remain camouflaged when something is looking directly up or down at them. They have no dorsal fin to prevent collision with pack ice.|$|E
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the overlying material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the hadal zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.|$|E

5|$|The corona is {{the next}} layer of the Sun. The low corona, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the Sun, has a {{particle}} density around 1015m−3 to 1016m−3. The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000–2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000–20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists {{to account for the}} temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything below their mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5mm, and was proportional {{to the length of}} the fish.

5|$|The {{existence}} of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere and by solar EUV radiation. However, {{the nature of the}} Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some Galileo measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything. The electron density <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500cm−3. As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede are not well constrained.|$|E
