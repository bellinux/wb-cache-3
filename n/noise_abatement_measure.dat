However, biological limitations regarding biomass density largely limit their shielding efficiency.

The current study is a further elaboration on a previously performed large set of full-wave numerical calculations of tree belt planting schemes, where {{the effect of the}} presence of supporting poles is numerically investigated. It is shown that such poles can be used to give a juvenile non-deep tree belt a reasonable noise abatement, and that specific configurations of supporting poles in between the trees can further optimize its shielding.

The Harmonoise calculation method is used to calculate noise values for the study area while a Geographical Information System (GIS) is utilised as a platform upon which levels of noise exposure are estimated. Residential exposure is determined for Lden and Lnight while worker exposure is determined for Lden. In order to analyse the potential of traffic management as a <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measure,</b> traffic was redirected from the main residential areas to alternative road links and the revised exposure levels were determined. The results show that the extent of noise exposure in Dublin is considerable, and in relative terms, it is worse for the night-time period. In addition, the results suggest also that traffic management measures have the potential to lead to significant reductions in the level of noise exposure provided that careful consideration is given to the impact of traffic flows on residential populations...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{pollution}} due to {{highway traffic}} has drawn {{the attention of}} transportation agencies worldwide. Noise pollution is an irritant to residents, especially in urban areas near roads with high traffic volume. In addition to its adverse effects {{on the quality of}} life, traffic noise can induce stress that could lead to sleep disturbance and anxiety. Traditionally, noise barrier walls have been used for highways to mitigate traffic noise. However, using barrier walls as a <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measure</b> has proven to be very expensive. In addition to the cost, noise barrier walls are not always effective because they must break the line of sight to work properly, which is not always possible in case of intersections or driveways. Therefore, researchers especially from Europe and USA have been very proactive to reduce the noise at source. A number of research studies show traffic noise can be reduced by using an alternative surface type or changing texture of the pavement while complying with other requirements of sustainability, i. e., safety, structural durability, construction and maintenance costs. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the research conducted on this subject. A review of the tire-pavement noise generation and amplification mechanism, various traffic noise measurement methods and correlation among these methods, in addition to the abatement techniques used by various agencies to reduce pavement noise, is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Airports in The Netherlands are {{subjected}} to tangent environmental laws to restrain pollution and noise nuisance. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is one airport dealing with this regulatory framework but nevertheless they are resolute to continue growth with respect to aircraft movements. To cope with the law related to aircraft noise, the department Stakeholder Strategy and Development (SSD) of AAS {{is responsible for the}} implementation of Noise Abatement Measures (NAMs). NAMs are used to minimize aircraft noise as to be able to maximize the number of aircraft movements within the environmental law as set by the Dutch government. SSD demands to be able to visualize the effect of a NAM by measuring aircraft noise with its Noise Monitoring System (NOMOS). However, in practice it appears that the effect of a NAM to the exposed noise level cannot easily be determined since the total set of measurements show a high degree of scattering. This is caused by the fact that many other parameters are contributing to the exposed noise level as, for example, engine setting and aircraft configuration. Therefore, AAS encounters difficulties evaluating the effectiveness of implemented noise reducing measures using the noise levels as measured by NOMOS. Hence, the research question becomes: How can the distinctiveness between noise measurements effectively be improved as to evaluate the direct effect of a <b>Noise</b> <b>Abatement</b> <b>Measure</b> to the measured noise level? As a first step towards answering this question, aircraft mass m and aircraft engine setting N 1 were identified which were expected to mask the effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Then, the Peak Find Method (PFM) is developed to determine N 1 from the associated acoustic time series as retrieved from NOMOS. Thirdly, aircraft mass m was found {{to be very difficult to}} determine from aircraft performance theories. Therefore, the lift-off speed at take-off Vlof 2 is taken as an aircraft mass representative. With the two predictors N 1 and Vlof 2 available and the measured maximum loudness levels Lmax retrieved from NOMOS, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is carried out to assess the effect of the two predictors to variations in Lmax. Last, the identified MLRA model is used to subtract the contribution of N 1 and Vlof 2 from the received noise levels, hence leaving the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Initial correlation analysis showed no correlation between N 1 and Lmax and neither between Vlof 2 and Lmax. While the MLRA model is based upon the identified values of the predictors, it was therefore not expected that the high variations in Lmax would decrease when using these predictors, bearing in mind the results of both correlation analysis. And ultimately, by using the MLRA model only 7 % of the total variation in Lmax could be explained, which turned out to be too less to evaluate the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level.

This analysis is used by the municipality of Amsterdam to formulate an action plan. In the END, a lower limit of 55 dB for noise calculations is suggested.

40|$|Aircraft {{noise is}} already a major {{constraint}} at many airports. Increase in airport capacity can often only be achieved if <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> are taken to protect people living around the airport. For active <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> basically two means of noise reduction exist. On the one hand, noise generated by airframe and engine can be reduced. On the other hand, noise impact can be decreased by increasing {{the distance between the}} aircraft generating the noise and noise sensitive areas on the ground. The latter can be achieved either by lateral avoidance of such areas or by a higher vertical flight profile. The paper deals with a steeper approach profile to increase altitude of the aircraft during approach. To allow a standard 3 ° landing and thus a higher rate of applicability the vertical approach profile is divided into 2 segments. It starts at about 8000 ft AGL with a 4, 5 ° slope. At about 1500 ft AGL the approach slope transitions into a standard 3 ° slope, intercepting the glide slope from above. The flyability of this approach has been tested in different fullflight training simulators of TUIfly, Condor and Lufthansa.

40|$|At many office {{workplaces}} employees must perform verbal tasks, such {{as reading}} or writing text. Often they must {{do so in the}} presence of background speech due to conversations or phone calls among colleagues. Background speech has been shown to impair cognitive performance in laboratory studies. It is assumed that these negative effects can be generalized to real life office tasks and, therefore, a decline in employees' efficiency is expected to occur in ambient speech. Current approaches to predicting performance effects of background speech focus on its physical characteristics and consider speech as a complex time-varying acoustic signal with a certain frequency characteristic. Here, impairments of performance have been mostly tested using simple short term-memory tasks, such as remembering a series of digits. However, verbal office tasks, like reading, are far more than remembering single items in their correct order, as words need to be stored and connected to understand and derive information. Analogously, background speech is defined by more than its physical characteristics since coherent narration comprises informational content based on semantics, syntax, and pragmatics that might contribute to performance decrements in office tasks. In the current paper, we present two experiments that explored the interrelation between background speech coherence and its impact on reading comprehension as a verbal task. The results are discussed with respect to <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> in office environments...|$|R
40|$|An {{exploratory}} study bas been undertaken {{to put into}} perspective future impact of road and railway noise until 2050 in The Netherlands, taking into account potential economic and mobitity growth, noise policy and legislation, demography and technical progress. Estimates were made of average noise levels and numbers of annoyed and sleep disturbed people for typical road and railway situations, for three mobility growth scenarios, strong, medium and low. Simplified models were used to make these estimates. The effects of policy instruments such as national noise legislation including continued application of <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> (barriers, quiet roads/tracks and dwelling insulation), European noise limits for vehicles and technical progress were assessed. It {{was found that the}} potential noise impact until 2050 shows a wide range, depending strongly on the growth scenario, policy choices and EU noise legistation. In the strongest mobility growth scenario and with continued noise legislation, an increase in numbers of annoyed and sleep disturbed people is forecast at around 25 % in 2050. Significant reductions in numbers of affected people are forecast only if current regulation is continued, vehicle noise levels decrease further and mobility and population grows little. An effective noise policy at European level and widespread use of quieter vehicles and infrastructure will be required to achieve this even in the low growth scenario...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{took the}} policy-analysis {{framework}} of Marchau and Walker (2005) {{as a starting}} point for assessment and valuation of road and railroad noise impacts and its consequences for noise policy. Four research questions were answered. To what extent can international data on noise, often produced by using different national calculation methods, be compared? And what will it mean for (inter) national noise policy? The literature review shows first that noise calculations in different countries may differ up to 15 dB(A), depending on the situation. This is due to (i) different national calculation methods, (ii) different implementation of those methods in software packages and (iii) different interpretations of the acoustical situation by the experts [...] Secondly, the review showed that different noise indices are in use in the different Member States, usually for no other than historical reasons. Many of the differences are essentially cosmetic, but some are potentially significant in complex situations. The harmonisation of noise indices as initiated by the European Commission is another necessary step in being able to compare noise exposure in different European countries. Thirdly, even if noise calculation methods and noise indices are eventually harmonised throughout Europe, noise standards remain a matter of subsidiarity. All of this makes it hard to assess to what extent citizens in different European Member States are protected against noise. What is the price of noise in various European countries? Are differences in price (partly) due to artefacts, like differences in the noise impacts considered or the monetisation methods used? Is there a gap between the theoretical valuation approaches and the practical application of those approaches? This study shows firstly that guidelines for monetisation of traffic noise exist predominantly in the central and north-western part of Europe. Monetisation of road traffic noise is more common than monetisation of railroad noise. Secondly, the study shows that not all noise effects are dealt with. Thirdly, prices differ. The different prices being attached to noise in various countries are mainly due to different unit values applied to the same impacts. Fourthly, the experience in the Netherlands shows that in spite of there being guidelines on monetisation, noise is often not monetised at all. So the application of these guidelines to noise falls short. There is a gap between theory and practice, at least in the Netherlands. When applying monetising methods, what are the costs and benefits of (possible) <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> in the Netherlands? What does the ex ante evaluation show to Dutch policy and what are methodological weaknesses? A cost-benefit analysis of a number of (possible) <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> in the Netherlands has been carried out. These measure were all so-called source measures for road and railroad traffic (silent tyres, pavements, trains and railroad tracks). Benefits are calculated according to consumer's preferences for dwellings, and values applied were derived from two different methodologies (hedonic pricing and contingent valuation). Costs were estimated between 1. 4 and 2. 0 billion euros (Net present value 2002) and benefits at between 4. 4 and 11. 6 billion euros, depending on methods and assumptions chosen. Costs are therefore clearly surpassed by benefits. Yet, further research on the most effective mix of measures is recommended, as some hot spots remain, even after implementation of the source measures. A major obstacle for implementing the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> is the problem that in the current context costs will be carried by groups in society (e. g. railroad companies) different from those who will eventually be the beneficiaries (e. g. people living along railroad tracks). The solution for this will be far more a political challenge than a scientific one. Noise policy is often based on acoustic and economic considerations only. Yet, from the literature it is known that non-acoustical factors like noise sensitivity may play an important role in causing annoyance. Is sensitivity to road traffic noise a major factor in the process of moving and settling down. Does it lead to self-selection? And if so, what does it mean for noise policy?. The noise-sensitive people think more often about moving elsewhere. Our research suggests that noise sensitivity is not a major factor in the process of moving and settling down, at least not where road traffic is the major noise source. Other factors related to the dwelling or the neighbourhood probably play a more important role. The question therefore remaining is why people who are noise-sensitive deliberately move into high exposure areas. One explanation might be that people are not aware of being noise-sensitive. This is supported by the weak individual correlation between the 1 -item and the 10 -item test. More information on residential noise levels and one's own noise sensitivity might thus prevent future disappointment. However, due to the limited sample size, external validity is limited.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} of noise levels in cities is today road traffic. The strongest source for all road vehicles {{is most often}} the tyre-road contact. This source position {{close to the ground}} is fortunate with respect to secondary <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures,</b> such as absorbing road surfaces or noise barriers. The first part of this thesis deals with noise reduction possibilitiesusing optimised surface treatments on the ground and on noise barriers, with special attention to low-height barriers. The insertion loss can be significantly improved through optimisation. The amount of improvement depends on barrier geometry, the impedance of the surrounding ground and on the frequency. The largest improvements can be found at low frequencies, but siginificant improvements can also be found at 1 kHz, where the traffic noise spectrum is strongest. A specialized surface on the road and a 1 m high barrier gives 7 dB better insertion loss than a rigid barrier of equal geometry when weighted with a representative traffic noise spectrum. The second part of this thesis studies noise in cities, where a many sources distributed over a large area are responsible for the total noise level. The noise levels on the silent side is in focus, which due to shielding has lower noise levels than the directly exposed side. Two new methods which are suitable for silent side calculations over large areas are presented. The main contribution to the noise level on the silent side is found to propagate over the rooftops of surrounding buildings and not around them. The <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> possibilities in cities are then studied using these models with respect to two features: 1) An increased absorption, and 2) A modified vehicle flow distribution. Both features show a promising noise reduction potential. A reduction of 10 dB may be possible on the silent side through increasing absorption. A traffic concentration to few streets gives larger areas with low levels than an evenly distributed vehicle flow. The amount of reduction is however dependent on the street grid geometry and the existing vehicle flow...|$|R
40|$|Transportation noise can be {{regarded}} as a major environmental impact, particularly in residential areas. Its cost could represent close to 0. 5 % of GDP in the European Union [1]. Considerable amounts of money are spent each year by the community to prevent or limit noise, through both the enforcement of regulations (emission and immission) and the use of economic instruments (charges, incentives). Unfortunately, the financial resources of the community are limited. Consequently, integrating noise concerns into economic decisions clearly needs more rationality [2]. For the economist, this basic issue raises two main problems: ∑ How can noise annoyance be evaluated, and by what methods? What are the limits of these methods: theoretical, practical, ethical? Are these methods acceptable to scientists as well as operators and political decision makers? Can monetary values be transferred from one study and used as inputs into other policy-making activities? ∑ What economic decisions are influenced by the use of monetary values of noise: cost-benefit analysis of infrastructure projects, <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> or policies, compensation of residents exposed to high noise levels, charging for transport infrastructure and, more generally, internalisation of noise costs. 2.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} on four empirical studies which explored the impact of background speech on cognitive performance and subjectively perceived disturbance. Background speech {{is the most serious}} noise problem in shared-room and open-plan offices for employees who are supposed to do silent, concentrated work. Different measures of acoustic office optimization, as well as the outstanding role of the intelligibility of background speech for its disturbance impact, are empirically evaluated. Design/methodology/approach – The article provides a synopsis describing the core empirical results of four of our empirical studies. A survey study among office employees (n = 659) explored the subjective importance of office acoustics. Three experimental studies (n 1 = 20; n 2 = 30; n 3 = 24) evaluated the effects of reduced background speech level, play-back of partial maskers and reduced speech intelligibility on cognitive performance and subjective ratings. Findings – Background speech is subjectively perceived as a severe problem, and the different <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> affect objective performance and subjective ratings differently. Speech intelligibility is – besides level – a key determinant for the acoustic optimization regarding these two dimensions. Research limitations/implications – Practitioners are encouraged to apply the findings and described measures when planning and/or evaluating open-plan offices. Practical implications – It is concluded that different acoustically efficient measures need to be combined to minimize the negative effects of background speech on cognitive performance and subjectively perceived disturbance. The aspired set value for open-office concepts is the lowest possible sound level with a bad intelligibility of the background speech at the same time. Originality/value – The synopsis of several empirical studies allows deriving comprehensive and well-founded information for practitioners involved in the evaluation and/or design of offices environments...|$|R
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird ein akustisches Emissionsmodell für Schienenverkehrslärm vorgestellt. Das Modell ermöglicht die präzise Berechnung von Emissionspegeln unter Berücksichtigung aller relevanten Einflussgrößen. Die Emissionspegel werden als Schallleistungsspektren für fünf Quellenhöhen bestimmt. Das Rollgeräusch wird unter Verwendung von Rauheitsspektren für Rad und Schiene berechnet. Es erfolgt eine Unterteilung des Gesamtrollgeräusches in Oberbau- und Fahrzeuganteile. Der Einfluss verschiedener Oberbautypen wird durch Transferfunktionen berücksichtigt. Für elf Fahrzeugkategorien werden Standardwerte der sekundären Geräuschquellen angegeben. Alle Modellparameter können durch nutzerspezifische Daten beliebig erweitert werden. Die Modellerstellung basiert auf normgerechten, akustischen Messungen der wesentlichen Einflussgrößen: Vorbeifahrtpegel, Rad-/Schienenrauheiten und Gleisabklingraten. Durchführung, Auswertung und Analyse der Messungen werden in dieser Arbeit dokumentiert. Der Einfluss von Rauheiten und Gleisabklingrate auf das Rollgeräusch wird vertieft dargestellt. Weiterführend werden Methoden zur indirekten Messung von Rad- und Schienenrauheiten an vorbeifahrenden Zügen entwickelt. Anhand von Beispielen wird deren Beitrag zur Lärmprognose innerhalb des erstellten Emissionsmodells gezeigt. Within the {{framework}} of the present work, an emissions model for railway noise was developed. It was possible to produce an acoustic emissions model which allows the calculation of sound power levels in 5 source levels. The model calculation takes into account the essential factors influencing noise generation. These primarily include the type of vehicle and type of track, the roughness of wheels and rails, routing parameters and speed of travel. The calculations in the emissions model can be made using standard values or user-specific data. This means {{that it is possible to}} extend the emissions model as required with regard to roughness data, vehicle types and track types. On the basis of extensive acoustic measurements, an emissions model has been generated to map the acoustic characteristics of vehicles, route sections and routing parameters. The present work documents the planning and assessment of the measurement campaigns undertaken, defines the algorithms and validates the emissions model established, using the results of the measurements. The variables for emissions calculations are analysed using numerous examples. The focus of the analysis is the effect of wheel and rail roughness on the acoustic emission properties of rail vehicles. Two methodes for the indirect wheel and rail roughness measurement are presented. Specific examples of applications are used to show how assessment of <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>measures</b> can be carried out using forecasting tools...|$|R

40|$|The European Community has {{stressed}} the importance of achieving a common understanding to deal with the environmental noise through community actions of the Member States. This implies the use of harmonized indicators and specific information regarding the values of indicators, the exceedance of limits and the number of people and dwellings exposed to noise. The D. Lgs. 149 / 2005 in compliance with the European Directive 2002 / 49 /EC defines methodologies, noise indicators and types of outputs required. In this dissertation the work done for the noise mapping of highly trafficked roads of the Province of Bologna will be reported. The study accounts for the environmental noise generated by the road infrastructure outside the urban agglomeration of Bologna. Roads characterized by an annual traffic greater than three millions of vehicles will be considered. The process of data collection and validation will be reported, as long as the implementation of the calculation method in the software and the procedure to create and calibrate the calculation model. Results will be provided as required by the legislation, in forms of maps and tables. Moreover results regarding each road section accounted will be combined to gain a general understanding of the situation of the overall studied area. Although the understanding of the noise levels and the number of people exposed is paramount, it is not sufficient to develop strategies of <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> interventions. Thus a further step will be addressed: the creation of priority maps as the basis of action plans for organizing and prioritizing solutions for <b>noise</b> reduction and <b>abatement.</b> <b>Noise</b> reduction <b>measures</b> are reported in a qualitative way in the annex and constitute a preliminary research. ...|$|R
