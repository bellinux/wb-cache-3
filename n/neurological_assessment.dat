A {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} was conducted to determine the incidence of progres-sive encephalopathy (PE) and its associated clinical manifestations amongst a cohort of HIV infected children attending the HIV/AIDS clinic of the Pediatric Institute, Kuala Lumpur Hospi-tal, Malaysia. <b>Neurological</b> and neurobehavioral <b>assessments</b> were performed in 55 children with HIV over a 24 -month study period. Parameters assessed were physical and <b>neurological</b> <b>assessments,</b> CD 4 counts, CD 4 percentages, RNA viral loads and an IQ assessment at four monthly intervals. PE was diagnosed when patient developed {{at least one of the}} definitive criteria for PE based on the Consensus of Pediatric Neurology / Psychology Working Group, AIDS Clinical Trial 1996. The incidence of encephalopathy was 18. 2 % (n= 10) in 2002. All the patients had hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, abnormal deep tendon reflexes and five had impairment in brain growth. The CD 4 counts and CD 4 percentages were more likely to be associated with PE compared to the non-PE group...|$|R

Assessments include a reliable {{subset of the}} Neurological Evaluation Scale (rNES) and several neuropsychological tests of attention, executive function, memory, and current and premorbid intelligence. Principal components analysis of the rNES yielded two main factors. Of these, CogPer (consisting of more cognitively demanding perceptual tasks) showed stronger relationships than RepMot (consisting of repetitive manual motor tasks) to neuropsychological measures. Customarily, frontal neuropsychological tasks also relate more strongly to CogPer than to RepMot.

40|$|The {{natural history}} of acute stroke is well defined. Predicting outcome in individuals, however, remains difficult, because {{prognostic}} studies examining associations between clinical signs or syndromes and outcome differ in patient selection, timing and choice of <b>neurological</b> <b>assessments</b> and outcome measures.

Until recently, it has not been possible to examine the stroke prognosis, using Osier's approach, with any great accuracy. The advent of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), which is highly sensitive to the pathophysiological changes underlying stroke, offers this possibility as it measures the site and extent of irreversible infarction. This review summarises the results of syndrome or sign-based predictive studies and shows how DWI may explain different outcomes in patients with identical neurological presentations, according to the 'situation and extent of the lesion'...|$|R

Thirty professional boxers underwent <b>neurological</b> <b>assessment</b> and genetic testing for the ApoE4 allele, a known genetic risk factor for dementia, especially late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease. The severity of their cognitive, motor, and behavioral impairments was stratified using the Chronic Brain Injury scale, ranging from 0-9 with a score of greater than 0 identified as abnormal. Among 18 boxers with more than 12 professional bouts, those who possessed at least one ApoE4 allele had a higher CBI score (mean 3.9 ± 2.3) compared to boxers without the allele (mean 1.8 ± 1.2). The remaining boxers with less traumatic exposure had a mean score of 0.33, regardless of ApoE genotype.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Piròg-Garcia's group {{generated}} another {{mouse model}} carrying a mutation previously {{found in a}} human patient. With this new model, {{they were able to}} demonstrate that reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis are significant pathological mechanisms involved in MED and PSACH. In 2010, this mouse model allowed a new insight into myopathy and tendinopathy, which are often associated with PSACH and MED. These patients show increased skeletal muscle stress, as indicated by the increase in myofibers with central nuclei. Myopathy in the mutant mouse results from underlying tendinopathy, because the transmission of forces is altered from the normal state. There is a higher proportion of larger diameter fibrils of collagen, but the cross-sectional area of whole mutant tendons was also significantly less than that of the wild-type tendons causing joint laxity and stiffness, easy tiring and weakness. This study is important because those diseases are often mistaken for neurological problems, since the doctor can detect a muscle weakness. This includes many painful and useless clinical neurological examination before the correct diagnosis.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD), hallmarked by {{a variety}} of motor {{disorders}} and neurological decline, is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Currently, no diagnostic test exists to identify sufferers, and physicians must rely on a combination of subjective physical and <b>neurological</b> <b>assessments</b> to make a diagnosis. The discovery of definitive blood-borne biomarkers would be a major step towards early and reliable diagnosis. Despite attention devoted to this search, such biomarkers have remained elusive. In the present study, we used human protein microarrays to reveal serum autoantibodies that are differentially expressed among PD and control subjects. The diagnostic significance of each of these autoantibodies was evaluated, resulting in the selection of 10 autoantibody biomarkers that can effectively differentiate PD sera from control sera with a sensitivity of 93. 1 % and specificity of 100 %. PD sera were also distinguishable from sera obtained from Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer, and multiple sclerosis patients with accuracies of 86. 0 %, 96. 6 %, and 100 %, respectively.

40|$|Neurological soft signs (NSS) {{in motor}} {{coordination}} and sequencing occur in schizophrenia patients and are an intrinsic {{sign of the}} underlying neural dysfunctions. The present longitudinal study explored the relationships among NSS, psychiatric symptoms, and functional outcomes in 151 Chinese patients with chronic schizophrenia across a 6 -month period. The participants completed <b>neurological</b> <b>assessments</b> at baseline (Time 1), psychiatric interviews at Time 1 and 3 -month follow-up (Time 2), and self-report measures on daily functioning at 6 -month follow-up (Time 3). Two possible (combined and cascading) path models were examined on predicting the functional outcomes. Direct and indirect effects of Time 1 NSS on Time 3 functional outcomes via Time 2 psychiatric symptoms were evaluated using path analysis under bootstrapping. Motor coordination and sequencing NSS did not have significant direct effects on functional outcomes. Motor coordination NSS exerted significant and negative indirect effects on functional outcomes via psychiatric symptoms. These results contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the determinants of functional outcomes by showing significant indirect pathways from motor coordination NSS to functional outcomes via psychiatric symptoms. That motor sequencing NSS did not affect functional outcomes either directly or indirectly may be explained by their trait marking features...|$|R
40|$|Intensive {{rehabilitation}} interventions {{have been}} shown to be efficacious in improving upper extremity function in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP). These interventions are based on motor learning principles and engage children in skillful movements. Improvements in upper extremity function are believed to be associated with neuroplastic changes. However, these neuroplastic changes have not been well-described in children with cerebral palsy, likely due to challenges in defining and implementing the optimal tools and tests in children. Here we documented the implementation of three different <b>neurological</b> <b>assessments</b> (diffusion tensor imaging-DTI, transcranial magnetic stimulation-TMS and functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) before and after a bimanual intensive treatment (HABIT-ILE) in two children with USCP presenting differential corticospinal developmental reorganization (ipsilateral and contralateral). The aim of the study was to capture neurophysiological changes and to document the complementary relationship between these measures, the potential measurable changes and the feasibility of applying these techniques in children with USCP. Independent of cortical reorganization, both children showed increases in activation and size of the motor areas controlling the affected hand, quantified with different techniques. In addition, fMRI provided additional unexpected changes in the reward circuit while using the affected hand...|$|R
