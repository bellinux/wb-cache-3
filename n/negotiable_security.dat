How has the Bank of China used portfolio investment and what strengths and what drawbacks has BOC's approach shown? And so on.

40|$|The basic {{thesis of}} this article is that the {{essential}} origins of the modern ‘financial revolution’ were the late-medieval responses, civic and mercantile, to financial impediments from both Church and State, concerning the usury doctrine, that reached their harmful fruition in the later thirteenth and early fourteenth century. That ‘financial revolution’, in terms of those national institutions for government borrowing and international finance, involving <b>negotiable</b> <b>securities,</b> in the form of annuities or rentes, and bills of exchange, is generally thought to have originated in eighteenth century England; but as James Tracy has earlier shown it first took place, on a fully national basis, in the sixteenth-century Habsburg Netherlands. The major obstacle from the Church was of course the usury doctrine, and more accurately the final evolution of this doctrine in Scholastic theology and canon law, along with the intensification of the campaign against usury from the early thirteenth century. The major obstacles that the State provided, with the spreading stain of ever more disruptive international warfare from the 1280 s, were the nationalistic bullionist philosophies and related monetary-fiscal policies (to finance warfare) that together hindered the international flow of specie in later medieval Europe. For public borrowing, one must begin with the contentious policies of Venice, Florence, and other Italian city states in basing their finances on forced loans, which did pay interest, and thus with the usury controversies that erupted, over not just such loans, but the sale of interest-bearing debt certificates in secondary markets. The alternative solution, found elsewhere – first in northern French towns from the 1220 s [...] and one that would govern European public finance up to the nineteenth century, was to raise funds for urban governments through the sale of rentes, both life-rents (one or two lives) and hereditary or perpetual rents. These were not in fact loans but annuities, and hence they were not usurious, because the buyer of such rentes had no expectation of repayment (unless the government chose to redeem them); instead they represented the purchase of a continuous future stream of income (for at least one lifetime). Those rentiers who sought to regain some part of their invested capital had only one recourse: to seek out buyers in secondary markets. The true efficiency of modern public finance also rested upon the development of such markets and thus upon the development of full-fledged negotiablity; and public finance also depends upon satisfactory instruments to permit low risk, low cost international remittances. The solution to both problems lay {{in the development of the}} negotiable bill of exchange. Such bills, at first non-negotiable, emerged in the late thirteenth century as a response to circumvent not only the usury doctrine (to ‘disguise’ interest payments in the exchange rate) but also the almost universal bans on bullion exports. Yet another barrier that medieval English merchants faced was the virtual absence of deposit-banking because of the crown’s strict monopoly on the coinage and money supply, so that the usual origin of such banking, in private money-changing, was unavailable. Although English merchants sought remedies by using transferable commercial bills, they were not truly negotiable, for they had no legal standing in Common Law courts. But from the late thirteenth century, the Crown was incorporating the then evolving international Law Merchant into statutory law, and it also established law merchant courts, which did give such financial instruments some legal standing. In 1436, a London law-merchant court was the first, in Europe, to establish the principle that the bearer of a bill of exchange, on its maturity, had full rights to sue the ‘acceptor’ or payer, on whom it was drawn, for full payment and to receive compensation for damages. From that precedent, and then from those provided by similar law-merchant court verdicts in Antwerp and Bruges (1507, 1527), the Estates General of the Habsburg Low Countries (1537 - 1541) produced Europe’s first national legislation to ensure the full legal requirements of true negotiability – including the right to sue intervening assignees to whom bills had been transferred in payment. These Estates-General also legalized interest payments (up to 12 %), thus permitting open discounting, another obviously essential feature of modern finance, private and public. Antwerp itself, with the foundation of its Bourse in 1531, became the international financial capital of Europe, especially as a secondary market in national rentes – the very instrument that became the foundation of English public finance, in the form of annuities, from the 1690 s. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} on the need of true and {{accurate}} writing of the Securities as a motive to compliance. In reality, it&# 39;s still a big problem in the securities if the substance {{is different from the}} document. In the case of the carrier&# 39;s loss of occupation when a third party obtains it can bring serious troubles with respect to the validity of the bonds. In reality, bills of lading, freight exchange slips and warehouse securities are documents having evidential function as well as <b>negotiable</b> instruments. These <b>securities</b> are subject to the contract of carriage (custody) and inevitablly has a essential character of carriage(custody) which can not ignore the causal relations (real relationship). This should be considered in interpreting the securities&# 39; credital force. Article 131 of the Commercial Code was revised in 2010. Obviously, the revised law stresses on the wording of the document itself more than substantial fact. However, the problem mentioned above has not been solved eventually. In particular, the essential relation between the carrier and consignor, holder of securities(real relationship) need to clear up the claiming credit of the bill of lading(securities of custody). In essence, the bill of lading is different from the promissary note and check, in that the former is influenced by the real relationship as the latter is not. Bill of lading is subject to the real performance, but the need of protection of its holer is another. About the credital force of the bill of lading, there are several traditional theories performed. But in my opinion, the carrier&# 39;s fiduciary duty should be stressed in this issue additionally. The accurate writing of the transport documents(bills of lading) regarding the factual relationship (type, quality and quantity of cargo, packaging, shipping status, etc.) is absolutely of importance because it is the premise of claims(including claiming issuing bank). I propose that the carrier&# 39;s attachment of the additional material of cargo shipments and samples of photos about the state of shipping. While this is not regulated in the Commercial Act, the attachment of these materials will reduce the trouble between the parties. Though the Commercial Code concerning the bill of lading has been revised, we should try to enhance the credibility of the bill of lading in the international market especially. For example, we should stress on the carrier&# 39;s duty of care in the writing the documents. According to my opinion, {{in the case of the}} discrepancy between the wording and the real transaction, the concrete conclusion may differs from the traditional theories. I hope my proposal above can improve the Korea&# 39;s international transactional surrounding and make the predictability of trade higher in the future...|$|R
