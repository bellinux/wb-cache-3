5000|$|Originally {{the school}} had no mascot (1910 to 1922). From 1922 to 1937 the mascot was the Colts; from 1938 to 1944, the Beaver. In the fall of 1945, after the atomic bombs were dropped, the war ended and many {{employees}} at Hanford donated a day's pay to an effort {{to raise money for}} a military airplane to contribute to the war effort, student decided to change the mascot to a bomb (of traditional elongated shape) painted in the school colors of green and gold (hence 'the Bombers'). After the end of World War II, students and Richland residents learned about the pivotal role the little community played is producing plutonium for the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The actual timeframe belies this however. In June 1944 the campaign by Hanford workers to raise funds for the B-17 was conducted, with nearly 90% of the workers contributing. Upon completion of this warplane, it was flown to the Hanford construction camp (a community which has since been dismantled) and a dedication ceremony was conducted on July 23, 1944 and was documented in the community newspaper. On December 6, 1945 a group of civic-minded residents brought up the idea of purchasing the plane, but the concept never came to fruition. At no time in any documentation in any newspapers during this period was there mention of the high school in reference to this plane, nor was there any mention of it in the high school's yearbook of that year. 1944-1945 was the first official school year of the high school, and the nickname [...] "Beavers" [...] was the name appearing in that year's yearbook. A dented practice bomb painted the school colors of green and gold became the mascot, dragged onto the field at football games and pulled onto the basketball court on a cart. The mascot [...] "The Bombers" [...] is clearly shown in pictures of that year and for many years following. To this date, there are no pictures showing an airplane as a mascot for the school in its early years that have been produced, nor any school yearbooks or newspapers mentioning the warplane. The school was opened before the war ended, and there is no official record anywhere attaching the [...] "Day's Pay" [...] B-17 warplane to the high school {{during the early years of}} the high school. Into the 1950s and 1960s and through the 1980s, lettermen and [...] "Pep Squad" [...] logos awarded were in the distinct shape of a bomb and were colored green with gold lettering or numbers.In later years, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>cloud</b> and phrase [...] "Nuke 'Em," [...] among others, became the unofficial mascots for the school. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>cloud</b> in conjunction with the old civic arms of Richland, WA appeared class rings and similar memorabilia. The civic arms consisted of an escutcheon divided by a Hopi sun symbol divided into four quadrants featuring such things as the PRTR nuclear reactor building, a schematic representation of an atom, and other references to local history and industry. This was typical of 1950's civic pride. The annual civic festival was called [...] "Atomic Frontier Days" [...] and various local businesses had [...] "atomic" [...] in their name. It is unknown whether or when a bomber officially became the mascot of the school. Depictions of bombers were not employed by Columbia High School during the 1950s and 1960s. Rather a bomb was carried into central court and set upright on its fins by a cheerleader during half time. There are claims that a B-17 bomber called [...] "A Day's Pay" [...] is currently the official mascot of the school. In 1988, amidst visits by Tom Brokaw (NBC Nightly News) and Japanese delegates, a vote was taken by the students making the Bomb (with the Mushroom Cloud logo) the official mascot of Richland High School.|$|E

40|$|The best {{examples}} of halo nuclei, exotic systems with a diffuse <b>nuclear</b> <b>cloud</b> surrounding a tightly-bound core, {{are found in the}} light, neutron-rich region, where the halo neutrons experience only weak binding and a weak, or no, potential barrier. Modern direct reaction measurement techniques provide powerful probes of the structure of exotic nuclei. Despite more than four decades of these studies on the benchmark one-neutron halo nucleus Be- 11, the spectroscopic factors for the two bound states remain poorly constrained. In the present work, the Be- 10 (d,p) reaction has been used in inverse kinematics at four beam energies to study the structure of Be- 11. The spectroscopic factors extracted using the adiabatic model, were found to be consistent across the four measurements, and were largely insensitive to the optical potential used. The extracted spectroscopic factor for a neutron in a nlj = 2 s 1 / 2 state coupled to the ground state of Be- 10 is 0. 71 (5). For the first excited state at 0. 32 MeV, a spectroscopic factor of 0. 62 (4) is found for the halo neutron in a 1 p 1 / 2 state. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

40|$|We present spatially-resolved, near-diffraction-limited 10 micron {{spectra of}} {{the nucleus of}} the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, {{obtained}} with Michelle, the mid-IR imager and spectrometer on the 8. 1 m Gemini North telescope. The spectra cover the nucleus and the central 6. 0 " x 0. 4 " of the ionization cones at a spatial resolution of approximately 0. 4 " (approx. 30 parsecs). The spectra extracted in 0. 4 " steps along the slit reveal striking variations in continuum slope, silicate feature profile and depth, and fine structure line fluxes on subarcsecond scales, illustrating in unprecedented detail the complexity of the circumnuclear regions of this galaxy at mid-IR wavelengths. A comparison of photometry in various apertures reveals two distinct components: a compact (radius < 15 pc), bright source within the central 0. 4 " x 0. 4 " and extended, lower brightness emission. We identify the compact source with the AGN obscuring torus, and the diffuse component with the AGN-heated dust in the ionization cones. While the torus emission dominates the flux observed in the near-IR, the mid-IR flux measured with apertures larger than about 1 " is dominated instead by the dust emission from the ionization cones. Many previous attempts to determine the torus spectral energy distribution are thus likely to be significantly affected by contamination from the extended emission. The observed spectrum of the compact source is compared with clumpy torus models, which require most of the mid-IR emitting clouds to be located within a few parsecs of the central engine. We also present a UKIRT/CGS 4 5 micron spectrum covering the R(0) [...] R(4) lines of the fundamental vibration-rotation band of 12 CO.

40|$|Recent {{infrared}} observational {{results for}} {{the nucleus of the}} Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 are reviewed and analyzed in terms consistent with information available at other wavelengths.

Observed reddening of spectral lines implies geometrical optical depths at visual wavelengths of about 7 - 15 if the <b>nuclear</b> dust <b>cloud</b> is approximately spherically symmetric. The dust grains emitting the infrared radiation could be silicates with a 10 -micron optical depth near unity, but this identification is not uniquely established.
