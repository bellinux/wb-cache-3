5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of <b>nasal</b> decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium <b>nasal</b> spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of <b>nasal</b> decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|The head is flattened, triangular, and {{distinct}} from the neck. The snout is blunt, rounded, and raised. The nostrils are large, each {{in the middle of}} a large, single <b>nasal</b> scale. The lower edge of the <b>nasal</b> touches the nasorostral. The supranasal has a strong crescent shape and separates the <b>nasal</b> from the nasorostral anteriorly. The rostral is as broad as it is high.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right <b>nasal</b> passage. While the left <b>nasal</b> passage opens to the blow hole, the right <b>nasal</b> passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E

5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the <b>nasal</b> {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a heat and water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for heat and water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated <b>nasal</b> passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the <b>nasal</b> passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it offers}} the {{greatest}} degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration, tracheal intubation {{is not the only}} means to maintain a patent airway. Alternative techniques for airway management and delivery of oxygen, volatile anesthetics or other breathing gases include the laryngeal mask airway, i-gel, cuffed oropharyngeal airway, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP mask), <b>nasal</b> BiPAP mask, simple face mask, and <b>nasal</b> cannula.|$|E
5|$|Identification of cephalic scales is most {{conveniently}} {{begun with}} reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single <b>nasal</b> scale. The outer <b>nasal</b> (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner <b>nasal</b> (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals {{on both sides of the}} head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale.|$|E
5000|$|The palatal <b>nasals</b> [...] {{appear before}} palatal stops and the velar <b>nasals</b> [...] before velar stops; in these positions, the {{alveolar}} <b>nasals</b> [...] do not occur.

25|$|In Hakka dialects, <b>nasals</b> {{appear in}} both lower and upper {{register}} tones, suggesting a protolanguage with both voiced and voiceless <b>nasals.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the tonal {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low tone <b>nasal</b> prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone <b>nasal</b> is found).|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of <b>nasal,</b> facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed <b>nasal</b> bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened <b>nasal</b> tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{monitored}} airborne contamination through <b>nasal</b> swabs of onsite personnel. Of the 9,837 <b>nasal</b> swabs taken, 335 samples had detectable {{levels of}} alpha particle activity, although none was above acceptable levels. Urinalysis was also performed {{but none of}} the 756 samples displayed any detectable level of plutonium.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the Aslian family, final <b>nasals</b> are pre-stopped. In Northern Aslian {{this has}} gone further, with final <b>nasals</b> merging with the plosive series.|$|R
5|$|The hollow {{crest of}} Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, {{such as a}} visual signal {{allowing}} individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises. The crest and its associated <b>nasal</b> passages have also figured in the debate about dinosaur endothermy, specifically in discussions about <b>nasal</b> turbinates.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the <b>nasal</b> {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and exhalation), although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior <b>nasal</b> chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw. The {{prominent}} <b>nasal</b> arch found in this genus is formed from the paired <b>nasal</b> bones. In profile view, they rise into a rounded hump {{in front of the}} eyes, reaching a height as tall as the highest point {{of the back of the}} skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons.|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>nasals</b> in the Japanese grammar {{has been}} something of a problem for modern phonological theory. <b>Nasals</b> seem to belong to some kind of conspiracy to avoid voiced obstruents in coda position, forcing them to transform into <b>nasals</b> homorganic with the onset of the following syllable. Although this behaviour could be adequately describe...|$|R
5000|$|The post-stopped <b>nasals</b> (orally {{released}} <b>nasals)</b> {{have been}} called [...] "funny nasals". They are distinct from the nasal-stop sequences , e.g. in [...] 'port' vs [...] 'all'.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nasals</b> {{have been}} {{reported}} to have implosive releases; however, phonologically, they are sequences such as , and phonetically, they may be weakened implosive stops rather than implosive <b>nasals.</b>|$|R
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the <b>nasal</b> bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the <b>nasal,</b> which is often termed differently.|$|E
5|$|Air {{that passes}} through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac, then back down through the left <b>nasal</b> passage. This {{recycling}} of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks {{for as long as}} it is submerged.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} distinguishes Sinhala from its sister Indo-Aryan {{languages}} {{is the presence}} of a set of five <b>nasal</b> sounds known as half-nasal or prenasalized stops.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{regionally}} atypical {{features of}} the Sui language include voiceless <b>nasals</b> (hm, hn), palatal stops, postvelar stops, prenasalized stops (mb, nd), and pre-glottalized stops and <b>nasals</b> (i.e. [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The {{acquisition}} of <b>nasals</b> in German {{differs from that}} of Dutch, a phonologically closely related language. German children produce proportionately more <b>nasals</b> in onset position (sounds before a vowel in a syllable) than Dutch children do. German children, once they reached 16 months old, also produced significantly more <b>nasals</b> in syllables containing schwas, when compared with Dutch-speaking children. This may reflect differences in the languages the children are being exposed to, although the researchers claim that the development of <b>nasals</b> likely cannot be seen apart from the more general phonological system the child is developing.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>nasals</b> are {{differentiated}} from stops {{only by a}} lowered velum {{that allows}} the air to escape through the nose during the occlusion. <b>Nasals</b> are acoustically sonorants, as they have a non-turbulent airflow and are nearly always voiced, but they are articulatorily obstruents, as there is complete blockage of the oral cavity. The term occlusive {{may be used as}} a cover term for both <b>nasals</b> and stops.|$|R
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (Eastern Cape Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the <b>nasal</b> bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the <b>nasal</b> passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Cope began doing daily sports {{commentaries on}} what was then WTAE-AM radio in Pittsburgh. His unique <b>nasal</b> voice, with a {{distinctive}} Pittsburgh area accent, was noticed by the Steelers' brass, and he made his debut {{as a member of}} the Steelers' radio team in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and <b>nasal</b> cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened {{the weight of the}} skull, housed a <b>nasal</b> gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent of the skull volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses may not have had any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>nasals</b> or , the unaspirated stops become voiced [...] Unlike {{consonant}} alternation, {{this occurs}} also within a morpheme. The Amur dialect deletes some word-final <b>nasals,</b> {{which leads to}} voiced stops occurring also word-initially.|$|R
