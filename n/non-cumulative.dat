500|$|When {{the ninth}} {{syndicated}} season began on September 13, 2010, the format was overhauled. Ten {{questions were asked}} in round one, each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized {{at the beginning of}} the game, as were the questions themselves.

A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with all the money in their bank, or could walk without completing the round with half that amount (e.g., a contestant who banked $30,000 would leave with $15,000).

50|$|The major {{difference}} between membership categories is the membership dues requirement. Trial Members are offered a free, trial membership for 6 months before being required to become Active, Associate, or Student Members. The most expensive membership category is the Affiliate Member category, which was $460 for one membership year (membership through June 30, 2018) as of April 2017. CPNP offers a student discount through the Student Member category, which is $165 cheaper than the Active Member dues. Membership dues are also stratified based {{on the length of}} membership purchased, also known as a <b>non-cumulative</b> quantity discount; for example, for the Active Membership category, buying two years of membership saves $30, whereas buying three years of membership saves $65.|$|E
50|$|Some {{expressions}} {{are neither}} quantized nor cumulative. Examples of this include collective nouns like committee. A committee may well contain a proper part which {{is itself a}} committee. Hence this expression isn't quantized. It isn't cumulative, either: the sum of two separate committees isn't necessarily a committee. In terms of the mass/count distinction, committee behaves like a count noun. By some accounts, these examples are taken {{to indicate that the}} best characterization of mass nouns is that they are cumulative nouns. On such accounts, count nouns should then be characterized as <b>non-cumulative</b> nouns: this characterization correctly groups committee together with the count nouns. If, instead, we had chosen to characterize count nouns as quantized nouns, and mass nouns as non-quantized ones, then we would (incorrectly) be led to expect committee to be a mass noun. However, as noted above, such a characterization fails to explain many central phenomena of the mass-count distinction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{firm had}} been formed in 1937 as a {{subsidiary}} of the British American Tobacco Company at Eastleigh, near Southampton, to build the Burnelli Flying Wing aircraft under licence, and was renamed Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft Limited in May 1938 by Hugo Cunliffe-Owen having been formed as B.A.O., Ltd. (Aircraft manufacturers and dealers, of Hangar No. 2a, Southampton Airport). The nominal capital was increased by the addition of £49,900 beyond the registered capital of £100.

5000|$|MLTT73 It was {{the first}} {{definition}} of a type theory that Per Martin-Löf published (it {{was presented at the}} Logic Colloquium 73 and published in 1975). There are identity types which he calls [...] "propositions" [...] but since no real distinction between propositions {{and the rest of the}} types is introduced the meaning of this is unclear. There is what later acquires the name of J-eliminator but yet without a name (see pp. 94-95). There is in this theory an infinite sequence of universes V0,...,Vn,... The universes are predicative, a-la Russell and <b>non-cumulative!</b> In fact, Corollary 3.10 on p. 115 says that if A∈Vm and B∈Vn are such that A and B are convertible then m=n. This means, for example, that it would be difficult to formulate univalence in this theory—there are contractible types in each of the Vi but it is unclear how to declare them to be equal since there are no identity types connecting Vi and Vj for i≠j.|$|E

Callable perpetual securities are included provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities are included provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (“cocos”) are excluded, but capital securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those legacy issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both cumulative and <b>non-cumulative</b> coupon deferral provisions, and those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. Securities issued or marketed primarily to retail investors, equity-linked securities, securities in legal default, hybrid securitized corporates, eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the US domestic market), taxable and tax-exempt US municipal securities and DRD-eligible securities are excluded from the index.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the use of a cumulative technique to obtain bronchodilator dose-response curves will cause a greater response than a <b>non-cumulative</b> technique, because sequential doses of drug will penetrate further into the lung. To test this hypothesis we have compared cumulative and <b>non-cumulative</b> dose-response curves for inhaled isoprenaline in 10 subjects with stable asthma, measuring FEV 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). With both techniques there was an increased response with increasing doses of isoprenaline for all the dose-response curves except for the <b>non-cumulative</b> PEFR response, which reached a plateau with the 20 micrograms dose. The area under the dose-response curve for FEV 1 was significantly greater after cumulative administration of isoprenaline than with the <b>non-cumulative</b> technique.

In this Article, we argue that <b>non-cumulative</b> zoning is an idea whose time has passed, if there ever was a convincing case for it at all. The two major justifications for <b>non-cumulative</b> zoning are flawed, and alternative means could achieve the same ends with fewer costs. The large number of nuisance claims engendered by urban manufacturing could be addressed by creating a 2 ̆ 2 right to stink 2 ̆ 2 in certain zones, allowing residential and commercial users to move into these zones but prohibiting them from suing manufacturers who are not violating regulatory laws. As for the second manufacturer-subsidizing justification, subsidies cannot be justified in terms of a subsidizing city 2 ̆ 7 s own welfare unless the external 2 ̆ 2 agglomeration 2 ̆ 2 benefits of manufacturing exceed the cost of the subsidy to the city. Moreover, the broader social perspective also requires that some cities are better able to capture those agglomeration benefits than others, meaning that competition between jurisdictions could result in total increases in wealth. However, <b>non-cumulative</b> zoning is unlikely to achieve either local or broader social efficiency. Its scope is not closely tied to any theory of external benefit; it encourages the inefficient use of land and the substitution of land for other inputs; and it hides the true cost of urban manufacturing subsidies from the public. If urban manufacturing must be subsidized, a direct cash subsidy system would be preferable, particularly if it could be funded directly from taxes on the increased value of land caused by the removal of a <b>non-cumulative</b> zoning designation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{approaches}} to receiver-driven layered multicast have advocated {{the benefits of}} cumulative layering, which can enable coarse-grained congestion control that complies with TCP-friendliness equations over large time scales.

In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we demonstrate that finegrained rate adjustment can be achieved with only modest increases in the number of layers and aggregate bandwidth consumption, while using only a small constant number of control messages to perform either additive increase or multiplicative decrease.
