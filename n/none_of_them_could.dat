He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first time}} came in 1868. On March 4, 1867, John D.

(Flagler's step-brother, the liquor magnate Stephen V. Harkness, was a silent partner.) Transportation costs were {{the key to}} making oil cheaply available to consumers, and cheap oil meant more market share (and more profit). For Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, the question was how to get its refined oil to East Coast cities. At the time, the railroads were engaged in cutthroat competition for refined oil. Rate-cutting was common (with railways often losing money on shipments). Each road also attempted to win more oil freight business by rapidly building up its supply of tank cars, but this left the railroads with an oversupply of cars, which lost them even more money. In 1868, Rockefeller formed a consortium of Cleveland-area refining companies. The consortium agreed to pool their shipments to the East Coast if lower freight rates could be procured. On behalf of the consortium, Henry Flagler reached an agreement with Stone's Lake Shore & Michigan Southern: The consortium would guarantee at least 60 tank cars of refined oil every day, in return for which the LS would cut shipping rates by 30 percent (e.g., offer a [...] "rebate"). The consortium agreed not to ship oil with any other railway unless the LS could not take the oil, and the LS agreed not to offer a rebate to any other refiners unless they could provide at least 60 tank cars of oil a day (which <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could).</b> Stone quickly agreed to the plan, which greatly enhanced Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler's market share.|$|E

60|$|We {{have reason}} to believe, {{as stated in the}} first chapter, that a change in the {{conditions}} of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system, causes or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing. Not that, as I believe, any extreme amount of variability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences, so could Nature, but far more easily, from having incomparably longer time at her disposal. Nor do I believe that any great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage. No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted {{to each other and to}} the physical conditions under which they live, that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> {83} <b>them</b> <b>could</b> anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land.

5000|$|The car {{was first}} tested during the Italian Grand Prix in [...] In testing it proved far {{faster than the}} 312T5 chassis the team were then using and Gilles Villeneuve {{preferred}} it, though he had reservations about the handling. Early unreliability of the turbo engine put paid to Villeneuve's [...] championship hopes but he did score back to back victories in Monaco and Spain, {{as well as several}} podium places. Because of the problematic handling the 126CK was at its best on fast tracks with long straights such as Hockenheim, Silverstone, Monza and the Österreichring. The car proved to be very fast but Gilles Villeneuve found the handling to be very difficult, calling the car [...] "a big red Cadillac". According to Villeneuve's teammate Didier Pironi and English engineer Harvey Postlethwaite, who arrived at Ferrari well into the 1981 season, it was not the chassis that was the main cause of the car's handling problems, but the very bad aerodynamics of the car. Postlethwaite later said that the 126CK [...] "had a quarter of the downforce that the Williams or Brabham had that year". The poor aerodynamics of the car, coupled to the chassis' hard suspension, created a tendency to make the car slide into corners before the ground effect pulled the car back on to the track. This had the undesired effects of exposing the drivers to even larger g-forces than the Williams FW07 or Brabham BT49 and making the car tend to overuse its tyres. The engine had massive turbo lag, followed by a steep power curve; this upset the balance of the chassis; although the engine was the most powerful engine that year, even more so than the Renault. At the Österreichring one gaggle of 6 naturally aspirated, better handling cars formed behind Didier Pironi for a number of laps, followed by three other cars shortly afterwards: <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> however, <b>could</b> find their way past easily due to the Ferrari's power advantage on the very fast Austrian circuit.
