5|$|By mid-March, Marine {{intelligence}} {{began to}} note an exodus of NVA units from the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters {{was the first}} to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did <b>not</b> <b>mean,</b> however that battle was over. On 22 March over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and, once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.|$|E
5|$|Emma later tells Henry {{that she}} thinks the curse is crazy, but that does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> it is not true. She also tells him {{that in order to}} break the curse, they must keep Regina off their trail by making her think that they don't believe in the curse.|$|E
5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it is becoming more adaptable to these modern days.|$|E
6000|$|And hark you, Sire; I catch [...] A sound which, if I err <b>not,</b> <b>means</b> {{the thing}} [...] We have hoped, and hoping, feared fate would not yield! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A fellow can't say {{anything}} without making you cry," [...] he began, trying to appease her. [...] "Why, I did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> anything, Sis. I did n't, sure. I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I truly will; I {{never tell}} tales." [...] And Polly kept her word, feeling sure Fan did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> to deceive her father, since {{she told her}} mother everything.|$|R
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the glans of the clitoris does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri praised {{his team}} for their efforts, {{and said that}} despite a few regrets, they could exit with {{confidence}} from their performance. He commented that the team reaching the final had inspired the city of Turin and the whole of Italy. Allegri added that to improve on the season would <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> winning a treble, but remaining within Europe's top 8 teams for the future.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{believed}} to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of yōkai, or spiritual entity, and the word kitsune is often translated as fox spirit. However, this does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that kitsune are ghosts, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word spirit is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> {{to speak}} to you to-day. But {{sometime}} I did mean to speak; because, whatever I was, I loved you; and I thought you did n't dislike me." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Polly {{held her}} close, saying in that tender voice of hers, [...] "I did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> {{to let a}} lover part this pair of friends if I could help it." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. Come, John, {{you know}} Jack did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> anything; he only {{thought he was}} overdrawing. I still think his bank ought to have cashed that cheque. They must know your position.|$|R
5|$|On November 12, 2010 President Yanukovych {{appointed}} Viktor Baloha (United Centre) Minister of Emergencies and Minister of the Protection of the Population {{from the}} Chernobyl disaster. According to Baloha this did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> his party {{would join the}} coalition. Early 2010 United Centre had rejected any possibility of joining a parliamentary coalition with the Communist Party of Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is a {{major threat}} to edible fish such as cod and tuna. Overfishing {{eventually}} causes population (known as stock) collapse because the survivors cannot produce enough young to replace those removed. Such commercial extinction does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the species is extinct, merely that it can no longer sustain a fishery.|$|E
5|$|The 5-inch/38 {{functioned as}} a dual purpose gun. However, this did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that it possessed {{inferior}} anti-air abilities; as established during 1941 gunnery tests conducted on board North Carolina, the gun possessed the ability to consistently shoot down aircraft flying at , which was twice {{as far as the}} effective range of the earlier single purpose 5-inch/25 anti-air gun.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} several prefixes. Non- <b>means</b> <b>not,</b> re- <b>means</b> again {{or in the}} {{opposite}} direction, and des- means to undo. For example: ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Constant" [...] <b>means</b> <b>not</b> {{depending}} on some variable; not changing as that variable changes. In {{the first case}} above, it <b>means</b> <b>not</b> {{depending on}} h; in the second, it <b>means</b> <b>not</b> depending on x.|$|R
6000|$|... "She did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> {{to tempt}} me, then," [...] he thought, in {{surprise}} and anger. [...] "What did she mean?" [...] and, like a scolded dog, {{he kept his}} troubled watch upon her face.|$|R
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific {{to just a few}} engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the entire class was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|The Percy estates were {{primarily}} {{located in the}} northern counties of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and Cumberland. Even though the title was restored in 1416, and the Percy estates were officially regranted, this did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> the immediate return of all the family possessions. Protracted legal battles followed, particularly with John, Duke of Bedford. Even {{at the time of}} his death, Northumberland had not recovered all the estates once held by his grandfather.|$|E
5|$|The {{album and}} singles {{received}} considerable promotion in the US—where they sold the most copies—and other countries, {{and much of}} this focused on contrasting her with Jessica by highlighting her more rock-oriented image. This image distinction from Jessica did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that the two were not associated in publicity, however; the sisters appeared together in television commercials at {{around the time of}} Autobiographys release, for Pizza Hut and Ice Breakers Liquid Ice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, don't tell me {{you have}} had any sorrows," [...] Felix rejoined. [...] "I did n't suppose it, and I did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> to allude to them. I simply meant that you all don't amuse yourselves." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{implication}} of this approach and the binary nature of determining if a risk from capable and motivated attackers is acceptable or <b>not,</b> <b>means</b> that data cannot easily progress through the GSCP in a linear fashion as it did through GPMS.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick, Ju!" [...] he cried, [...] "we're {{close to}} the sea. I can hear it! Listen! That's where they've went. P'raps we can catch them if we was in time. They did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> to go without us. They've only forgot." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{fact that}} Charles was crowned as Charles XI does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> {{that he was}} the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This {{descendant}} was actually the 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{induction}} phase is to reach a complete remission. Complete remission does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> the disease has been cured; rather, it signifies no disease can be detected with available diagnostic methods. Complete remission is obtained in about 50%–75% of newly diagnosed adults, although this may vary based on the prognostic factors described above. The length of remission depends on the prognostic features of the original leukemia. In general, all remissions will fail without additional consolidation therapy.|$|E
5|$|This does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form {{outside of}} an El Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither an El Niño or a La Niña, {{but it had}} one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E
60|$|I {{was wrong}} {{to ask you to}} go away. I see now that it was {{breaking}} my promise, and I did <b>n't</b> <b>mean</b> to do that. I don't know why things have come to be so different. You never think as I do about anything.|$|R
50|$|Years <b>not</b> listed <b>means</b> {{no one was}} awarded.|$|R
50|$|Higher potency does <b>not</b> {{necessarily}} <b>mean</b> more side effects.|$|R
5|$|Yusa is an {{operator}} in the SSS who conveys {{the state of}} the battlefield to Yuri. She is a calm and gentle mannered girl with a straightforward character. Much like Angel, she does not express her emotions and is called scary by Otonashi and Hinata. She cannot calm down without her earphone. She rarely talks, and she sometimes hurts others' feelings even though she does <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
50|$|The {{knowledge}} gained is <b>not</b> a <b>means</b> of liberation.|$|R
25|$|First, human {{security}} {{and human development}} are both people-centered. They challenge the orthodox approach to security and development i.e. state security and liberal economic growth respectively. Both emphasize people are be the ultimate ends but <b>not</b> <b>means.</b> Both treat human as agents and should be empowered {{to participate in the}} course.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} {{distrust}} and dissatisfaction {{at home for}} many a day past. Berenger could hardly be censured for loving his own wife, and yet his family were by <b>not</b> <b>means</b> gratified {{by the prospect of}} his bringing home a little French Papist, of whom Lady Thistlewood remembered nothing good.|$|R
