60|$|You've made {{a success}} of {{your job and}} of your life. It's <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who can say that. My second {{conclusion}} is that you must be the happiest man alive.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was a fine}} spirit, that," [...] the Bishop declared. [...] "I am {{not sure}} that we are <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> a little over-inclined towards compromises. The sapping away of {{conscience}} is so easy." ...|$|E

50|$|Not {{long after}} the duel, both public opinion and {{legislation}} turned strongly against the custom of duelling, although currently <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> states have laws that specifically ban duelling. The site of the duel is now a registered California Historical Landmark.|$|R
40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{assume that}} sometime before the 1980 s {{and the emergence}} of economic rationalism, neo-liberalism and finance-driven capitalism was a golden age during which most people had permanent full time jobs, manageable workloads, viable communities and family life. Well, <b>not</b> exactly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> says Suzanne Franzway...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, drily, [...] "at least, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> In fact, {{we are not}} averse from graciously {{permitting}} other folks, and now {{and then}} the Press, to proclaim our good deeds for us. I don't know that the more primitive fashion of doing it one's self isn't quite as tasteful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Plotters, every one," [...] said Nehushta, shrugging her shoulders. [...] "The great {{scheme to}} drive the Romans from the Holy City ripens fast, and your {{grandsire}} waters its root. I pray that we may <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> gather bitter grapes from that vine. Have you heard that Caleb is back in Tyre?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you about them directly, Colonel; it is rather a long story. We have had a narrow squeak of it. We got through the storm pretty well, {{but we had a}} bad time of it afterwards, and we owe it entirely to young O'Connor that we are <b>not,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> in a prison at Brest at present." ...|$|E
3000|$|... this {{cohesion}} is <b>not</b> possible [unless <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{have the}} conviction {{and the opportunity}} {{to be able to make}} a place for ourselves in our society].|$|R
2500|$|The letter also {{stressed}} that [...] "it's {{not that we}} aren't a gracious society, or that kindness is <b>not</b> innate in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> But some days it feels like not very many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> believe in or care about expressing kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend General Downright {{has taken}} too much pains, gentlemen," [...] {{interrupted}} our new acquaintance, [...] "your rank and extraction being self-evident. Welcome to Leaplow! I beg {{you will make}} free with my house, my dog, my cat, my horse, and myself. I particularly beg that your first, your last, and all the intermediate visits, will be to me. Well, Mogul, {{what do you really}} think <b>of</b> <b>us?</b> You have now been on shore long enough to have formed a pretty accurate notion of our institutions and habits. I beg you will <b>not</b> judge <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> by {{what you see in the}} streets--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you heard, Allan, {{that among}} the wise some hold that <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is visible at once here on earth within the same house of flesh; that the whole self in its home above, {{separates}} itself into sundry parts, each of which walks the earth in different form, a segment of life's circle {{that can never be}} dissolved and must unite again at last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am truly {{glad to see}} you on {{your feet}} again," [...] the latter said, as Fergus {{followed}} his cousin into the room. [...] "I felt by no means sure that I should ever see you again, on that day after Torgau; but you still look very thin and pulled down. You want rest, lad. We all want rest, but it is <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that can get it." ...|$|E
60|$|I believe of a verity {{that had}} it not been for Hiram Griffin some, if <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would have fallen into the hands of the lobster backs, for it is true that we were sadly confused--frightened if you choose to put it in such words, and had so far lost mastery of {{ourselves}} that but for his holding us up sharply to the work we would have come to grief.|$|E

Her career in audio dramas has included the Voice of Planet B in Planet B on BBC Radio 7. In 2004, she was cast in the video game Fable.|$|R
40|$|Whether or not {{books and}} other {{traditional}} literary technologies survive, the dominant medium {{in the foreseeable}} future will be electronic, digital, with the Internet the probable universal provider. I anticipate that literary artists will gravitate toward this powerful medium. But if they do not, if literature does not in fact find a place there, then {{the vast majority of the}} human race will simply do without it, and thus, whether the new generations know it or <b>not,</b> they (<b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us)</b> will be greatly impoverished...|$|R
6000|$|... "Senor Harned may be right," [...] said Luis Cervallos. [...] "It {{may not be}} fair to the bull. For is it <b>not</b> {{known to}} <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that for twenty-four hours the bull is given no water, and that {{immediately}} before the fight he is permitted to drink his fill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I trust, Mogul, {{you will}} have charity to believe we are <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> quite so bad as appearances, no doubt, make us in your {{polished}} eyes. These rude beings are spoiled by our jacobinical laws; {{but we have a}} class, sir, that IS different. But, if you will not touch on the people, how do you like the town, sir? A poor place, no doubt, after your own ancient capitals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (1.) That as {{they were}} not of the elect of God, so God by {{suffering}} them to be carried away finally, may make it appear, {{that they were not}} of his elect. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us. But they went out from us, that it might be made manifest (or that men might see) that they were <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> (1John 2:19).|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly; when we {{know the}} character, {{we can see it}} in the writing. The {{difficulty}} is, to see it and read it BEFORE we know it; and I have practised a little at that. There is character in all we do, of course--our walk, our cough, the very wave of our hands; the only secret is, <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have always skill to see it. Here, however, I feel pretty sure. The curls of the g's and the tails of the y's--how full they are of wile, of low, underhand trickery!" ...|$|E

If he was, he {{has certain}} liberties allowed him for {{excursions}} [...] into the Regions of this Air, and certain spheres of action, in [...] which he can, and does move, to do, {{like a very}} Devil as he is, [...] all the mischief he can, and of which we see so many examples both [...] about us and in us; in the inquiry after which, I shall take [...] occasion to examine whether the Devil is not in most <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> [...] sometimes, if <b>not</b> in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> one time or other.|$|R
50|$|Father of {{the shining}} bolt, dark misted, {{what is this}} you said?Do you wish to bring back {{a man who is}} mortal, one long sincedoomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?Do it, then; but <b>not</b> <b>all</b> the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> gods shall approve you.|$|R
50|$|Library and {{information}} science CAS programs {{are intended to}} allow students to closely focus on a particular sub-area of library {{and information}} science after earning a master's degree in the discipline. Some students advance directly to the CAS after finishing their master's degree, others return for a CAS after working in the field. The certificate generally takes {{one to two years}} to complete, including a culminating cumulative exam or extensive project. Such programs are offered by many, but <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the <b>U.S.</b> institutions <b>of</b> higher education that issue American Library Association-accredited master's degrees.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Miss Miniver--she {{went on in}} a {{regularly}} undulating voice--"we DO please men. We {{have that}} gift. We can see round them and behind them and through them, {{and most of us}} use that knowledge, in the silent way we have, for our great ends. <b>Not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> but some of us. Too many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if we really told them what WE thought of them, really showed them what WE were." [...] A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} monarch, thoughtfully, [...] "it must indeed have been Scowleyow; {{and it was}} a very unkind act, for we never harmed him in any way. But what shall we do with this great man? If he is left here he will scare all the {{children}} with his roarings, and none of the ladies will care to walk near this end of the Valley. He is so heavy that <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> together could lift him, and even if we succeeded we have no place to put him where he would be out of the way." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, thus it {{happened}} to him. For a while he carried the iron ring around in his pocket--just as {{so many of us}} do--without thinking to put it on. But one day he slipped it on his finger--and that is what we do <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do. After that he never took it off again, and the world went smoothly with him. He was not rich, but then he was not poor; he was not merry, neither was he sad. He always had enough and was thankful for it, for I never yet knew wisdom to go begging or crying.|$|E
60|$|We do {{not differ}} from known savages {{in being able to}} bring on non-normal {{psychological}} conditions, but we produce these, as a rule, by other methods than theirs, and such experiments are <b>not</b> made on <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> as they were on all Red Indian boys and girls in the 'medicine-fast,' at the age of puberty.|$|R
50|$|InterTAN {{operated}} a RadioShack chain from Barrie, Ontario which carried most (but <b>not</b> <b>all)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> Radio Shack product line. As the UK and Australia stores {{had been sold}} in 1999 and 2002 (respectively), these were the last InterTAN-operated Radio Shack locations when Circuit City purchased InterTAN and its 950 Canadian stores (RadioShack, Battery Plus and some Rogers kiosks) for $284 million in 2004. RadioShack branded merchandise accounted for 9.5% of InterTAN's inventory purchases in its 2002-2003 fiscal year, the last complete year before the Circuit City acquisition, and would soon disappear from stores entirely.|$|R
40|$|When Bishop Butler {{said that}} "{{probability}} {{is the very}} guide of life", he implied that there is exactly one guide of life, and that probability is it. He needed to say more. For as any visitor to the Taj Mahal knows, there can be all too many "guides", and <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them take <b>us</b> to our proper destinations. And {{so it is with}} probability: some probabilitie...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} should. There {{should never have}} been a dream that she or I could marry on six hundred a year. Had <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> been fools, we should have taken our hats off and bade each other {{farewell}} for ever when the state of the old man's affairs was known. We were fools; but we were fools together; and none of us have a right to abuse the others. When I became acquainted with this young lady at Rome, it had been settled among us that Imogene and I must seek our fortunes apart." ...|$|E
60|$|How {{many of us}} are there, {{women and}} men too, who think most of the 'looks of it' under such circumstances; and who, were we as honest as poor Susan, ought to thank God, as she did, that we can love anyone; anyone, that is, of the other sex. We are <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{susceptible}} of being torn to tatters by an unhappy passion; not even all those of us who may be susceptible of a true and honest love. And it is well that it is so. It is one of God's mercies; and if we were as wise as Susan, we should thank God for it.|$|E
6000|$|Have we <b>not,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> a {{great deal}} to make us happy? What {{pleasure}} is it to you to go about with a cross or melancholy face? Try to think of something pleasant, and call up a smile. Put the ill-natured feelings out of your heart, and then the brightness will come to your face without further trouble. If you have a hard task to do, being cross won't help you along one bit. Go to work at it with a will, and you will be surprised to find how soon it will be done. Then, with a clear conscience and a glad heart, you can sit waiting for the welcome sound, [...] "School's out!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{are stories}} that I quit Sabbat because {{the rest of}} the band didn't like my pagan lyrics. That's <b>not</b> true. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> shared an {{interest}} in paganism. The paganism was never a problem; I was always left {{to get on with the}} lyrics the best way I saw fit. No, the truth was that I could see that the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|R
6000|$|And, then, are we <b>not</b> tempted, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> to {{fall down}} like the Chaldeans and worship our own net, because by it our portion is fat, and our meat plenteous? Are we not tempted to say within ourselves, 'This present system <b>of</b> things, with <b>all</b> its {{anomalies}} and its defects, still is the right system, and the only system. It is the path pointed out by Providence for man. It is of the Lord; for we are comfortable under it. We grow rich under it; we keep rank and power under it: it suits us, pays us. What better proof {{that it is the}} perfect system of things, which cannot be amended?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, my lads, {{although}} I {{would not}} for the world terrify the dear child uselessly, by telling her {{that we are in}} danger, it must be clear to you that if a gale springs up and our raft should be broken up, it's <b>not</b> likely that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would be saved.
