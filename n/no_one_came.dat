5|$|The {{violence}} and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their {{government was not}} doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that {{came to be known as}} the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> forward to identify them.|$|E

25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin seemed very tired, was constantly yawning, {{and was not}} paying much attention. Jiang seldom talked to Wen Jiabao, who was sitting to his left. Wen was paying full attention to Hu's speech for its entire length. Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, but {{with the exception of}} Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E
25|$|There {{were reports}} of drunken grave-diggers making graves for Ebola {{patients}} too shallow, {{and as a}} result wildlife came and dug up and ate at the corpses. In addition, in some cases bodies were not buried for days, because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> to collect them. One problem was that it was hard to care for local health care workers, and there was not enough money to evacuate them. Meanwhile, other diseases like malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea were not being treated properly because the health system was trying to deal with Ebola patients. On 7 October 2014 Canada sent a C-130 loaded with 128,000 face shields to Freetown.|$|E

Middlesex finished second after two wins over Kent in late August, to improve five places on their 1897 finish, while Derbyshire broke their streak of 22 Championship matches without victory by beating Hampshire in late May. As for individual performances, Surrey batsman Bobby Abel made 1800 runs for the second season in succession, one run off his own Championship record from 1897.|$|E

25|$|The Balloon Corps was {{eventually}} {{assigned to the}} Army Corps of Engineers and put under the administrative purview of one Captain Cyrus B. Comstock, who did not appreciate a civilian (Lowe) being paid more than he. He reduced Lowe's pay from $10 gold to $6 currency (equal to $3 gold) per day. Lowe posted a letter of outrage and threatened to resign his position. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> to his support, and Comstock remained unyielding. On 8 April 1863, Lowe left the military service {{and returned to the}} private sector. Direction of the Balloon Corps defaulted to the Allen brothers, but they were not as competent as Lowe. By 1 August 1863, the Corps was no longer used.|$|E
25|$|Xu Shu {{was from}} Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡), Yu Province, {{which is in}} present-day central Henan. His {{original}} family name was Shan (單) and his original given name was Fu (福). He was a swordsman in his early life and he once helped someone take revenge by killing another person. To avoid being recognised, he covered his face with white chalk and let his hair run wild. He was later arrested by an official, who asked him for his name, {{but he did not}} reply. The official tied him to a cart, paraded him through the streets, and asked for any person who could identify him. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> forth. Xu Shu's fellows rescued him later. He was so grateful to be saved that he gave up his life as a swordsman and became a scholar.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Spring and Autumn period, {{the state of}} Chu grew in power and began to expand its {{influence}} over eastern Hubei. In doing so, it was mostly content with expressions of loyalty from its neighbors, instead of immediately conquering them. The viscount of Xian, however, remained defiant. Despite Chu's power, he felt secure because of his marital ties with the states of Jiang, Huang, Dao, and Bo, which in turn were allies of the hegemon of China, Duke Huan of Qi. Confident that they would aid him if Chu attacked, the viscount made no emergency preparations. This overconfidence led to Xian's ruin according to the Zuo Zhuan, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> to help the state when it was actually invaded by a Chu army under Dou Gouwutu in 655 BC. Xian was annexed by Chu, but the viscount managed to escape to Huang. Eventually, he and his followers settled down near modern-day Xi County, Henan, on the border to the Chu-occupied territory of Xi. Chu eventually conquered the area where Xian's new capital-in-exile was located between 648 and 623 BC.|$|E

25|$|Gai Lan and Dai Yuan {{were still}} {{dissatisfied}} and they harboured {{the intention of}} rebelling. They forged close ties with Bian Hong (邊鴻, also rendered 邊洪), an aide of Sun Yi. Once, when Sun Quan was away on a campaign, they {{took advantage of the}} situation to set their plans into motion. At the time, the various chiefs of the counties in Danyang were scheduled to meet Sun Yi in the commandery capital. Before the meeting, Sun Yi asked his wife, Lady Xu (徐氏), who was versed in divination, to predict the events of the meeting. Lady Xu predicted ill luck and advised her husband to postpone the meeting, but Sun Yi wanted to settle the meeting quickly because the Chiefs had been waiting for some time since they arrived, so he hosted a banquet for them. Sun Yi often carried a sword with him when he travelled around, but he became tipsy after the feast so he was unarmed when he saw the guests off. Just then, Bian Hong attacked him from behind. The scene was thrown into disarray and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> to Sun Yi's rescue so Sun died at the hands of Bian Hong. Bian Hong escaped to the hills after murdering Sun Yi, but was later killed by Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E

Recalling the visit to Deshler, the Republican candidate stated, [...] "There were many signs like those I see here. But one sign held by a teenager said, 'Bring Us Together Again'. My friends, America needs to be brought together." [...] However, Nixon's use of the phrase received little coverage until after the election. Deshler school officials heard of the speech, and asked students about the sign, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> forward.|$|E

During the press conference, officials urged viewers {{to be aware of}} children that may have disappeared or gone unaccounted for {{in the days leading up}} to the celebration of Independence Day. Despite their hopes, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> forward to claim responsibility for the crime or to confirm who the victim was.

500|$|Gittings {{found a home}} in the gay {{group that}} formed in 1970 in the American Library Association, the first gay caucus in a {{professional}} association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> into the booth to get a free hug.

500|$|Mora death raised {{fears that}} the country's economy would be hurt by reduced tourism, leading Univision to {{describe}} the situation as [...] "an internal crisis". [...] Commentary published by the Costa Rican Times alleged that the true culprits would never be found, saying whoever was blamed would be a scapegoat offered up by the drug traffickers. [...] The government [...] "is happy letting the Caribbean side of Costa Rica lose all tourism" [...] continued the commentary by Dan Stevens. [...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to get the government to act. [...] "Mora reached out for help before he was killed, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author. [...] Mora's death, suggested the author, shows that [...] "the drug traffickers are winning", that crime {{is out of control}} in Limón, and that [...] "the bad guys operate with near impunity." [...] The editorial concluded by imploring Costa Ricans to re-evaluate their personal environmental habits and support environmental groups that keep fighting. [...] The Guápiles Biofestival, an arts festival held each year during early June, was also dedicated to Mora.|$|E

500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>came</b> forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E
