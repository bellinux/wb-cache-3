5|$|On September 28, 1963, an Eastern Air Lines Douglas DC-7 {{crashed on}} landing after the aircraft's <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> collapsed. All 45 {{passengers}} and crew survived.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E
5|$|Although nearly {{everything}} {{connected to the}} CF-105 and Orenda Iroquois programs was destroyed, the cockpit and <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> of RL-206, the first Mk2 Arrow, and two outer panels of RL-203's wings were saved and are {{on display at the}} Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, alongside an Iroquois engine.|$|E

5|$|The main {{landing gear}} touched down at 12:01:27pmEST (17:01:27UTC) on 20 November, a mission elapsed time (MET) of 8days 4hours 30minutes and 44seconds. <b>Nose</b> <b>gear</b> touched down at 8days 4hours 30minutes 54seconds (12:01:37pmEST – 17:01:37UTC) and Atlantiss wheels stopped at an MET of 8days 4hours 31minutes 42seconds (12:02:24pmEST – 17:02:24UTC), {{bringing}} the 73rd space shuttle mission to a close.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
25|$|On 11 September 1998, China Eastern Flight 586, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11, {{flying from}} Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, {{suffered}} a <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> failure after take-off. The aircraft landed back in Shanghai with the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> up on a foamed runway.|$|E
40|$|During the {{conceptual}} design phase of aircraft {{the integration of}} undercarriage system is very important and {{it is often difficult}} to achieve on the first time. The <b>nose</b> wheel landing <b>gear</b> preferred configurations for light naval trainer aircraft. The main objective of this project is to improve the static strength criteria and fatigue life of <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> Barrel considered. The investigations includes preliminary design layout for <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> Barrel and initial sizing has been done. It has been designed and evaluated for strength criteria. A method of analysis for the design of <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> Barrel made up of Al-Cu alloy (BS L 168 T 6511) with static loads of axial, bending and normal loads are applied. The geometric modeling of the <b>Nose</b> Landing <b>Gear</b> Barrel was carried out using CAD package CATIA V 5 R 19 and pre and post processing was done through MSC/PATRAN. The stresses and displacements are obtained with the application of MSC/NASTRAN finite element software. ...|$|R

25|$|On 4 December 2016, SkyWest Airlines flight 5588, an E175 {{operating}} as a United Express flight from Houston Intercontinental Airport, TX to Monterrey, Mexico, was diverted to San Antonio, TX after experiencing an abnormal landing gear indication. Upon landing, the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> {{of the aircraft}} collapsed, and the aircraft {{came to rest on}} runway 04. Of the 51 passengers and 4 crew members, only one minor injury was sustained during the evacuation. During recovery of the aircraft, it was discovered that a failed downlock spring on the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> had prevented the landing gear from locking in the down position.|$|E

25|$|On 10 December 1982, the <b>nose</b> <b>gear</b> of a Bouraq HS 748 (registered PH-IHI) {{collapsed}} upon {{landing at}} Sam Ratulangi International Airport, causing the aircraft to veer off the runway.
