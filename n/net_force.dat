5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero <b>net</b> <b>force,</b> but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no <b>net</b> <b>force</b> causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero <b>net</b> <b>force,</b> since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse elite (FINA points 938) backstroke swimmers stroke-coordination using an instantaneous <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> and timing protocols using a symmetry index tool. Ten male and nine female elite backstroke swimmers completed three maximum speed trials and five maximum speed <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> swimming trials. <b>Net</b> drag <b>force</b> was measured using an assisted motorised dynamometer device. Each trial was filmed using three genlocked 50 Hz cameras, synchronised to the <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> output from the force-platform. This methodology enabled the comparison of stroke-coordination timing symmetry index to <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> symmetry index. The timing symmetry index and <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> symmetry index yielded different results, the timing reflects the stroke-coordination, whilst the force index identified the effectiveness of the stroke. The only variable that was significantly different when comparing left and right stroke patterns was the location of minimum <b>net</b> drag <b>forces.</b> Conversely, gender influenced the location of maximum <b>net</b> drag <b>force.</b> Relationship analysis identified that location of maximum <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> production was the only variable to correlate with speed within this cohort.

40|$|This study {{explored}} and quantified {{gender differences}} in passive drag and instantaneous <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> profile for elite backstroke swimmers (FINA points 938 ± 71). Nine female and ten male backstroke swimmers completed eight maximum speed trials. During the passive drag condition participants were towed at the speed achieved within the maximum effort backstroke swimming trials, whilst holding a supine stationary streamline position. The remaining trials, swimmers performed their natural swimming stroke, whilst attached to an assisted towing device. Male participant’s passive (p less than 0. 001) and mean <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> (p less than 0. 001) were significantly higher compared to female participants. Additionally, {{there were no significant}} differences by gender between either the minimum or maximum <b>net</b> drag <b>forces</b> produced during the left and right arm strokes. Instantaneous <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> profiles demonstrated differences within and between individuals and genders. The swimmers who recorded the fastest speed also recorded the smallest difference in <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> fluctuations.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} motion of {{colloidal}} particles relative to a two component fluid consisting of solvent and solute. Particle motion can result from (i) <b>net</b> body <b>forces</b> on the particle due to external fields such as gravity; (ii) slip velocities on the particle surface due to surface dissipative phenomena. The perturbations of the hydrodynamic flow field exhibits characteristic differences in cases (i) and (ii) which reflect different patterns of momentum flux corresponding {{to the existence of}} <b>net</b> <b>forces,</b> force dipoles or force quadrupoles.

40|$|The diurnal and {{regional}} {{variations of the}} top-of-atmosphere radiation budget in the tropics are examined and {{the relative importance of}} these variations are assessed. The variations of the radiation components with scene type and the radiative effects of clouds are investigated. The LW emission shows the strongest diurnal variation over clear desert and land scenes, with domain-averaged diurnal ranges of approximately 50 W/sq m and 35 W/sq m, respectively. The LW emission over clear and tropical oceans show a small diurnal range of less than 1 W/sq m. A bias in the ERBE scene ID algorithm against clear tropical scenes at night is evident in the LW diurnal variation results for clear scenes. The effect of tropical water vapor resulting in low LW emission to space is diagnosed as the principal source of uncertainty in scene identification at night. Regional cloud forcing results show a strong dependence of <b>net</b> <b>forcing</b> on cloud type.

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a <b>net</b> <b>force</b> of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero <b>net</b> <b>force</b> and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed.

40|$|We study a three-wave {{truncation}} of {{a recently}} proposed damped/forced high-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation for deep-water gravity waves under {{the effect of}} wind and viscosity. The evolution of the norm (wave-action) and spectral mean of the full model are well captured by the reduced dynamics. Three regimes are found for the wind-viscosity balance: we classify them according to the attractor in the phase-plane of the truncated system and to the shift of the spectral mean. A downshift can coexist with both <b>net</b> <b>forcing</b> and damping, i. e., attraction to period- 1 or period- 2 solutions. Upshift is associated with stronger winds, i. e., to a <b>net</b> <b>forcing</b> where the attractor is always a period- 1 solution.

5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the <b>net</b> <b>force),</b> can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

To the {{stationary}} observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero <b>net</b> <b>force.</b> However, the rotating observer sees a curved path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing {{to the right of the}} instantaneous direction of travel for a counter-clockwise rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> required to cause the curved trajectory.|$|E

Twenty elite front-crawl swimmers Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA ranking 908 ± 59) were tested {{to identify the}} influence of both gender and breathing. A total of six randomised free-swimming trials were conducted: (i) three breathing, (ii) three non-breathing. <b>Net</b> drag <b>forces</b> were measured using an assisted towing device and the magnitude and location of minimum and maximum was determined to create a stroke symmetry index.

For the <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> profile, only three females and zero males exhibited a symmetrical minimum net drag force; and only four females and two males demonstrated a symmetrical maximum <b>net</b> drag <b>force</b> index.

25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the <b>net</b> <b>force</b> on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or <b>net</b> <b>force</b> on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path.
