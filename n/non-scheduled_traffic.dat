50|$|According to AIP Serbia / Montenegro, {{the airport}} {{does not have}} any fuel facilities, so it is not useful for any <b>non-scheduled</b> <b>traffic.</b> There is no hangar space for visiting aircraft, as the hangar is in bad condition. There are no lights at the landing strip or aprons. There is no fence around the airport. There are no navigational aids. The {{passenger}} terminal {{is in a state of}} disrepair.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport was}} given its current title in 1965. In 1968 a new {{passenger}} terminal was opened. In 1972 a second passenger terminal was opened to cater specifically for <b>non-scheduled</b> <b>traffic.</b> An increase in companies offering package holidays (around 30 by 1965) meant {{that this type}} of traffic was providing an increasing proportion of the airport's business. The terminal was very similar to the ones that were built in Palma de Mallorca, Alicante, Ibiza and Girona.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{relating}} to environmental emissions database for the military, charter, and <b>non-scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> {{for the year}} 1992 were conducted by McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Transport Aircraft. The report also includes a comparison with a previous emission database for year 1990. Discussions of the methodology used in formulating these databases are provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of <b>non-scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> by scheduled services {{is one of}} the main impacts that the liberalisation of the European Common Aviation Area has had on tourist airports. In the case of Faro, between 1996 and 2013, this shift led to both fewer routes served and reduced catchment areas in the source markets for tourists visiting the Algarve. The strategy pursued by Ryanair, the airportâ€™s main carrier, focuses on connections that already channelled a greater volume of traffic when charter airlines dominated. Therefore, the impact of low-cost carriers on diversifying the number of airports of origin and source markets is limited. Moreover, using the spatial analysis functions of GIS software, we verified that the population linked to the theoretical catchment areas of airports with a non-stop flight to Faro in 2013 was smaller than that of the airports with such connections in 2000. The decision-making process involved in the policy incentives for introducing new routes could benefit greatly from this type of analysis...|$|E
