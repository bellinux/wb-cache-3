40|$|A {{subgroup}} H of an algebraic group G {{is said to}} {{be strongly}} solvable if H is contained in a Borel subgroup of G. This paper is devoted to establishing relationships between the following three combinatorial classifications of strongly solvable spherical subgroups in reductive complex algebraic groups: Luna's general classification of arbitrary spherical subgroups restricted to the strongly solvable case, Luna's 1993 classification of strongly solvable wonderful subgroups, and the author's 2011 classification of strongly solvable spherical subgroups. We give a detailed presentation of all the three classifications and exhibit interrelations between the corresponding combinatorial invariants, which enables one to pass from one of these classifications to any other.

We present the definition of a dedualizing complex of bicomodules over a pair of cocoherent coassociative coalgebras C and D. Given such a complex B^∙, we construct an equivalence between the (bounded or unbounded) conventional, as well as absolute, derived categories of the abelian categories of left comodules over C and left contramodules over D. Furthermore, we spell out the definition of a dedualizing complex of bisemimodules over a pair of semialgebras, and construct the related equivalence between the conventional or absolute derived categories of the abelian categories of semimodules and semicontramodules. Artinian, co-Noetherian, and cocoherent coalgebras are discussed as a preliminary material.

40|$|The <b>numbering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> and {{examples}} continues {{that of the}} earlier paper. VIII In section III of Pryor 2006 a, I argued against {{the view that the}} mere fact that a thought-type is hyper-reliable directly gives one justification to believe a thought of that type. A close alternative says that our merely appreciating that the thought-type is hyper-reliable directly gives us that justification. We needed to refine these proposals to give them the best run for their money. I gave examples of attitudes that would be self-verifying if one formed them, but where intuitively, that gave one no reason to form them. In response, the hyper-reliabilist can say he’s only offering an account of doxastic justification—what justifies a belief you have—rather than an account of what gives you justification to believe some thought you don’t yet have. Another problem comes from examples of unknown (or empirically known) mathematical truths. Those truths will be true whenever entertained, but we don’t think that by itself provides subjects with reason to believe them. The hyper-reliabilist can address this problem by saying it’s only a certain special kind of hyper-reliability that gives the direc...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{implication}} and details of the consolidation of the statutes of the Province of Quebec which is now under way. Unlike earlier consolidations, this one will be permanent and brought up to date annually, and as he approaches his subject, the author describes what must be understood by keeping up to date and who should be responsible for the task. Next, he discusses the technical aspects which ought to be considered in the process of keeping the consolidation up to date, among which are the moment and methods to inserting new texts, the <b>numbering</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections,</b> and the vehicle for the publication of amending legislation. In the third part of his paper, the author describes what important changes would have to be made to the present situation, should the proposed system be adopted. These changes are both documentary (a new presentation of the Quebec official Gazette is advocated) and legislative (new duties of the Quebec Official Printer are stressed). Finally there is established a link between the permanent consolidation and a policy for non-official consolidations. The author concludes with the expression of a point of view on the access of the people to the law...|$|E
