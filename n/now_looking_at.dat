5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use vacant land {{to the east of}} the current alignment, the Department of Transportation put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the industrial land between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. The Department of Transportation is <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E

It was commended for its inclusive policy and several other innovations done in the market such as the AppZone (Sri Lanka's first independent 3rd party app store and the Book Hub, Sri Lanka's first eBook store) Many governments are <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> this eco system and how it can too be implemented in their respective countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{bargaining}} atmosphere deteriorated {{throughout the}} remainder of 1992. The state's chief negotiator said he would wait for the legislative fact-finding panel's recommendation, Shafer implied he might oppose a proposed bond measure which would help fund state jobs, and Shafer accused the governor of releasing private confidential negotiating information to PEF members without the union's consent. At PEF's convention in October 1992, Members United for a Responsible Union leafletted against Shafer, accused him of neglecting members' needs and trying {{to curry favor with}} the AFT. Although the legislature passed a mandatory binding arbitration bill, the governor vetoed the legislation. <b>Now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> two years without a new contract, Shafer hired Theodore W. Kheel, a well-known labor negotiator, to help the union win a new pact.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies are <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current prenatal testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current prenatal testing methods. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of chorionic villi sample (CVS), amniocentesis, and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E

But what people didn't realise at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They are bound to be American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates the ways they have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not quite in body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> things from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{reports on}} the {{converging}} technologies and NBIC concepts have criticised their transhumanist orientation and alleged science fictional character. At the same time, research on brain and body alteration technologies has been accelerated under the sponsorship of the U. S. Department of Defense, which {{is interested in the}} battlefield advantages they would provide to the supersoldiers of the United States and its allies.

2500|$|In December 2011, Bloomberg {{reported}} that the U.S. is invoking Cold War-era national security powers to force telecommunication companies including AT Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. to divulge confidential information about their networks in a hunt for Chinese cyber-spying, with Richard Falkenrath, a senior fellow in the Council on Foreign Relations Cyberconflict and Cybersecurity Initiative, saying, [...] "This is beyond vague suspicions...Congress is <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> this as well, and they’re doing so based on very specific material provided them in a classified setting by the National Security Agency." [...] The action represents a concern that China and other countries may be using their growing export sectors to develop built-in spying capabilities in U.S. networks. The U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said it would investigate potential security threats posed by some foreign companies, and mentioned Huawei specifically. A spokesman for Huawei said that the company conducts its businesses according to normal business practices and actually welcomed the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 September, at McCartney's The Mill studio, McCartney, Starr, Hudson, Emerick and Paul Wright {{worked on}} the track [...] "La De Da", which McCartney contributed bass and backing vocals to. This session was filmed by Grakal, and {{excerpts}} were later featured in the music video for the song. Also recorded was a new bass track for [...] "What in the... World" [...] replacing the placeholder bass track from a July session. Upon hearing a playback of the track, McCartney remarked [...] "Whoo ... Rich! Sounds kinda Beatle-ish!" [...] to which Starr replied [...] "I know! That's what I said to Mark months ago". McCartney, <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Starr, told him [...] "You are a fucking Beatle!" [...] On 15 October, the same day Starr was in Paris to watch McCartney's daughter Stella's fashion show, string overdubs were added on to [...] "I'm Yours" [...] and [...] "King of Broken Hearts" [...] at AIR Studios, located in London. Starr returned to Los Angeles on 1 November to add overdubs to the latest recorded material, and on 3 November, he recorded [...] "I Was Walkin'". On 4 November, [...] "The Puppet Song" [...] was recorded. The song had originated from a comment by Starr ("Put the puppet to bed"), and would be renamed to [...] "Puppet". On 6 November, [...] "Sometimes" [...] was recorded, which contained a riff taken from Ringo's Rotogravures (1976) [...] "Cryin'".|$|E
