50|$|Leipheimer {{said he was}} {{informed}} that <b>normal</b> <b>bonus</b> time for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place on the stage would also not be awarded. He and others thought Leipheimer had 5th place. In the final kilometers, several riders broke clear but were caught. Then, as the pace was increasing, Vinokourov moved to the front. With 2 km remaining, Laurent Brochard attacked and Vinokourov jumped on his wheel. A few seconds later Brad McGee closed the gap. When Brochard cracked, McGee moved to the front, but Vinokourov followed. They achieved a gap {{that could not be}} closed. McGee zigged and zagged, making Vinokourov work, but Vinokourov found enough power to pull around McGee and win.|$|E
5000|$|When Pets.com closed, Wainwright {{controversially}} received $50,000 as a [...] "performance bonus" [...] {{from the}} board members {{in addition to her}} <b>normal</b> $165,000 <b>bonus</b> and a severance package of $165,000. [...] She then founded SmartNow.com, a website centered around an application that enables an economy for knowledge sharing, in 2008.|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. In {{the case}} of share {{purchase}} schemes, the employer assists the employee to buy shares through a trust. If the interest on the loan is at a rate lower than the standard rate for tax purposes, the employee will be taxed on {{the difference between the}} standard and actual rate charged. An alternative for buying ordinary shares is to buy convertible preference shares in the Company. A scheme involving convertible debentures has the same basic principles as convertible preference shares, but the South African Revenue Services might use section 8 A of the Act as it seems as if only a right to ordinary shares is offered to the employee. If the company does not have the means to administrate any of the schemes summarised above, they can make use of a phantom share scheme. With this scheme there is no actual buying or selling of shares, but "bonuses" are calculated with reference to the movement in the share price. These incentives are treated as <b>normal</b> <b>bonuses</b> for tax purposes {{in the hands of the}} employer and employee. To provide the employees with a tax effective scheme is just as important as providing a share incentive scheme. Companies, therefore, have to consider all the schemes available and the tax implications before implementing a share incentive scheme...|$|R
5000|$|Season 5: Season five had a [...] "Close but No Cigar" [...] week {{to decide}} who would join the seven undefeated winners in the <b>normal</b> tournament. The <b>bonus</b> round was played for a $25,000 Bloomingdale's {{shopping}} spree until Friday, when it {{was replaced by a}} cruise on the RMS Queen Elizabeth 2. The winner of the tournament chose one of the celebrities who then revealed a cash amount of up to $50,000 inside a sealed envelope.|$|R
5000|$|The Chase format {{was again}} {{modified}} for the 2011 season, {{as was the}} point system for winnings. After 26 [...] "regular season" [...] races, the top 10 drivers, as determined by points accumulated during the season, automatically advance to contend for the Cup championship. These drivers are joined by two [...] "wild card" [...] qualifiers, specifically the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th in drivers' points who have the most regular-season race wins. The 12 drivers' championship points are reset to a base of 2,000 per driver. Each of the 10 automatic qualifiers receives a bonus of 3 points for each win during the regular season, while the two wild card qualifiers receive no <b>bonus.</b> <b>Normal</b> scoring applies during the Chase, with race winners earning 43 base points plus 3 bonus points, all drivers who lead a lap earning 1 bonus point, and the driver who leads the most laps earning 1 bonus point in addition to any other points earned.|$|R
40|$|An annullable {{penalty is}} a {{sanction}} that is applied unless monitoring takes {{place and the}} agent is found non-shirking. An annullable bonus is a bonus that the agent receives unless he has been monitored and found shirking. Annullable penalties and bonuses stand in contrast with <b>normal</b> penalties and <b>bonuses,</b> which are only applied if monitoring has taken place. While real-life examples of annullable penalties are rare (an example is a sanction for which {{the burden of proof}} is reversed), there is a clear and oft-discussed example of annullable bonuses: efficiency wages. Under efficiency wages all employees receive a bonus (an overpayment), except for those who have been monitored and found shirking. This paper analyzes under what conditions annullable bonuses or penalties make economic sense. On the one hand, annullable bonuses and penalties have a degree of ineffectiveness that is absent in their normal counterparts: the penalty paid by or the bonus paid to non-monitored agents does not improve their incentives. Not only does this ineffective part make the expected sanction or bonus higher than necessary but it also creates an implicit tax on low monitoring levels and hence distorts monitoring choices. On the other hand, the annullable variants may change the ex post incentives of the agents (to come up with evidence) and the principal (to monitor as promised). As a result, annullable bonuses (such as efficiency wages) can be rational choices when the principal cannot credibly commit to paying bonuses with a certain probability, and annullable penalties can make sense when the agent needs an incentive to reveal information. Effectiveness of sanctions Contract remedies Carrots and sticks Efficiency wages Burden of proof...|$|R
