5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical <b>needle,</b> {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The <b>needle</b> selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The <b>needle</b> is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a <b>needle</b> holder or pusher. While the <b>needle</b> is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the <b>needle.</b> Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a <b>needle,</b> so that as the <b>needle</b> pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E
5|$|<b>Needle</b> {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, <b>needle</b> receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. Not only are these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the <b>needle</b> once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. <b>Needle</b> receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{is usually}} treated with urgent <b>needle</b> decompression. This {{may be required}} before transport to the hospital, and can be performed by an emergency medical technician or other trained professional. The <b>needle</b> or cannula is left in place until a chest tube can be inserted. If tension pneumothorax leads to cardiac arrest, <b>needle</b> decompression is performed as part of resuscitation as it may restore cardiac output.|$|E
50|$|Dry <b>needling,</b> {{also known}} as myofascial trigger point dry <b>needling,</b> {{is the use of}} either solid {{filiform}} <b>needles</b> (also referred to as acupuncture <b>needles)</b> or hollow-core hypodermic <b>needles</b> for therapy of muscle pain, including pain related to myofascial pain syndrome. Dry <b>needling</b> is sometimes {{also known as}} intramuscular stimulation (IMS). Acupuncture is a broad category of <b>needling</b> practices with solid filiform <b>needles.</b> Modern acupuncture notably includes both traditional and Western medical acupuncture; dry <b>needling</b> is arguably one subcategory of western medical acupuncture.|$|R

25|$|A {{developing}} {{trend in}} the knitting world is interchangeable <b>needles.</b> These kits consist of pairs of <b>needles</b> with usually nylon cables or cords. The cables/cords are screwed into the <b>needles,</b> allowing the knitter to have both flexible straight <b>needles</b> or circular <b>needles.</b> This also allows the knitter to change the diameter and length of the <b>needles</b> as needed.|$|R
5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use a <b>needle</b> {{containing a}} cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end of the <b>needle.</b> In some countries, the piercing <b>needle</b> favoured in the United States is regarded as a medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing <b>needle</b> method, but the initial jewellery is inserted into the back of the cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a <b>needle</b> into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. CSF is extracted through the <b>needle,</b> and tested. About one third of people experience a headache after lumbar puncture, and pain or discomfort at the <b>needle</b> entry site is common. Rarer complications may include bruising, meningitis or ongoing post lumbar-puncture leakage of CSF.|$|E

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic <b>needle</b> aspiration, transbronchial <b>needle</b> aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with <b>needle</b> aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E

5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. Blood-borne transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, <b>needle</b> stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a <b>needle</b> during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a <b>needle</b> stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Buttonhole <b>needling</b> {{is reported to}} be associated with less pain than standard <b>needling.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare patient perceived pain and fistula complications in buttonhole and standard <b>needling.</b> Design, setting, participants, & measurements In this study, 140 conventional hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to buttonhole or standard <b>needling.</b> The primary outcome was patient perceived pain with <b>needling</b> at 8 weeks. Fistula complications of hematoma, bleeding postdialysis, and infection were tracked. ResultsMedian pain score at 8 weeks using a visual analog scale from 0 to 10 cm was similar for standard and buttonhole <b>needling</b> (1. 2 [0. 4 â 2. 4] versus 1. 5 [0. 5 â 3. 4]; P= 0. 57). Rate of hematoma formation in standard <b>needling</b> was higher (436 versus 295 of 1000 hemodialysis sessions; P= 0. 03). Rate of no bleeding postdialysis was 23. 6 and 28. 3 per 1000 in standard and buttonhole <b>needling,</b> respectively (P= 0. 40). Rate of localized signs of infection in standard versus buttonhole <b>needling</b> was 22. 4 versus 50 per 1000 (P= 0. 003). There was one episode of Staphy-lococcal aureus bacteremia during the 8 weeks with buttonhole <b>needling</b> and no episodes with standard <b>needling</b> (P= 1. 00). Within 12 months of follow-up, another two buttonhole <b>needling</b> episodes developed S. aureus bac-teremia, and nine buttonhole <b>needling</b> episodes had <b>needling</b> site abscesses requiring intravenous antibiotics versus zero standard <b>needling</b> episodes (P= 0. 003). Conclusions Patients had no difference in pain between buttonhole and standard <b>needling.</b> Although fewer buttonhole <b>needling</b> patients developed a hematoma, there was an increased risk of bacteremia and localized signs of infection. Routine use of buttonhole <b>needling</b> is associated with increased infection risk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Acupuncture {{has been}} applied to aid in the {{recovery}} of post-stroke patients, but its mechanism is unclear. This study aims to analyze the relationship between acupuncture and glucose metabolism in cerebral functional regions in post-stroke patients using 18 FDG PET-CT techniques. Forty-three ischemic stroke patients were randomly divided into 5 groups: the Waiguan (TE 5) <b>needling</b> group, the TE 5 sham <b>needling</b> group, the sham point <b>needling</b> group, the sham point sham <b>needling</b> group and the non-needling group. Cerebral functional images of all patients were then acquired using PET-CT scans and processed by SPM 2 software. Results Compared with the non-needling group, sham <b>needling</b> at TE 5 and needling/sham <b>needling</b> at the sham point did not activate cerebral areas. However, <b>needling</b> at TE 5 resulted in the activation of Brodmann Area (BA) 30. Needling/sham <b>needling</b> at TE 5 and <b>needling</b> at the sham point did not deactivate any cerebral areas, whereas sham <b>needling</b> at the sham point led to deactivation in BA 6. Compared with sham <b>needling</b> at TE 5, <b>needling</b> at TE 5 activated BA 13, 19 and 47 and did not deactivate any areas. Compared with <b>needling</b> at the sham point, <b>needling</b> at TE 5 had no associated activation but a deactivating effect on BA 9. Conclusion <b>Needling</b> at TE 5 had a regulating effect on cerebral functional areas shown by PET-CT, and this may relate to its impact on the recovery of post-stroke patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Like acupuncture, dry <b>needling</b> {{involves}} {{the insertion of}} acupuncture <b>needles</b> into specific points on the body to improve health. Unlike acupuncture, the practice of dry <b>needling</b> is unregulated in Australia. This paper challenges the notion that dry <b>needling</b> is {{not a part of}} acupuncture practice and also examines the risks associated with the practice of dry <b>needling</b> from a public health perspective. The practice of acupuncture and dry <b>needling</b> are first examined and compared to identify commonalities. A review into the incidence of risks of dry <b>needling</b> reveals very limited literature with only one case report and no review articles identified. Based on the similarities between acupuncture and dry <b>needling,</b> the extensive literature on the serious risks of acupuncture is extrapolated to evaluate the risks of dry <b>needling.</b> Dry <b>needling</b> is not a new or separate practice to acupuncture; rather it is a subsystem of musculoskeletal acupuncture which has been practised continuously for at least 1400 years. Dry <b>needling</b> is a pseudonym for a brief course of study in myofascial acupuncture also known as ashi acupuncture and trigger point acupuncture. Dry <b>needling</b> is likely to result in an increased incidence of serious risks, particularly pneumothorax, due to the short training courses and deep <b>needling</b> techniques which typify the practice. In the interest of public health and safety, the practice of dry <b>needling</b> should be restricted to suitably qualified practitioners...|$|R
