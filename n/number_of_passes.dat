25|$|Some {{assemblers}} {{may also}} be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>passes,</b> on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible.|$|E
25|$|When {{the size}} of the array to be sorted {{approaches}} or exceeds the available primary memory, so that (much slower) disk or swap space must be employed, the memory usage pattern of a sorting algorithm becomes important, and an algorithm that might have been fairly efficient when the array fit easily in RAM may become impractical. In this scenario, the total number of comparisons becomes (relatively) less important, and the number of times sections of memory must be copied or swapped to and from the disk can dominate the performance characteristics of an algorithm. Thus, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>passes</b> and the localization of comparisons can be more important than the raw number of comparisons, since comparisons of nearby elements to one another happen at system bus speed (or, with caching, even at CPU speed), which, compared to disk speed, is virtually instantaneous.|$|E

Development and improvement of the module of the Block Medical Professionalism are the bridge to yielding a good, capable and professional medical doctor.

40|$|This paper reports two whole-body {{vibration}} experiments. The first {{experiment was}} conducted to determine {{the manner in which}} annoyance caused by railway-induced building vibration depends on how frequently trains pass. It also investigated how annoyance depends on the magnitude of the vibration. The second experiment {{was conducted to}} confirm that the relation between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> trains and the magnitude of vibration could be used to predict conditions which will cause similar annoyance. Forty-eight seated subjects experienced simulations of vertical vibration recorded in a house during the passage of a nearby train and assessed the stimuli on a seven-point scale. Annoyance increased with an increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> trains and with increasing magnitude of vibration. The findings of the first study were employed to determine a trade-off between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> trains. N, and the magnitude of the vibration, V. The relation was determined as approximately N ∝ V - 4 for equal annoyance. This was confirmed by the results of the second experiment in which r. m. s. evaluation of the vibration (i. e., N ∝ V - 2) was found to be less satisfactory. The relation (V 4 N = constant) for equal annoyance is consistent {{with the use of the}} vibration dose value (∫ t= 0 t=T a 4 (t) dt) 1 4 proposed for vibration assessment. © 1988. </p...|$|R
