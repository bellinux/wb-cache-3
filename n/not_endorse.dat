5|$|Harper {{stood for}} office {{again in the}} 1993 federal election, and {{defeated}} Jim Hawkes amid a significant Reform breakthrough in Western Canada. His campaign likely benefited from a $50,000 print and television campaign organized by the National Citizens Coalition against Hawkes, although the NCC did <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> Harper directly.|$|E
5|$|Baba is Amir's {{father and}} a wealthy {{businessman}} who aids the community by creating businesses for others and building a new orphanage. He is the biological father of Hassan, a fact he hides from both of his children, and seems to favor him over Amir. Similar to Hosseini's father, Baba does <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> the religiosity demanded by the clerics in the religion classes attended by Amir in school. In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the {{old order}} was mostly re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen judges were endorsed for re-election by both parties and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> his re-election, calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for re-election in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from the profession of law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 8, Money, {{describes}} the internal debate at CBC regarding how {{to cover a}} $70 million loss in advertising revenue from the 2008-2009 recession with the government unwilling to cover the deficit or allow CBC to incur debt. Ultimately, they decided on cutting 400 jobs, {{reducing the number of}} episodes ordered, and selling excess real estate. Chapter 9, The Plan, addresses CBC's adaption to new technology and the consolidation of the Canadian telecommunications industry. Stursberg details his struggles with the new CBC president Hubert Lacroix, who did <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> Stursberg's strategy of providing popular content and initiated a new strategic planning process. In the final chapter Stursberg notes the changes that have occurred since his departure and predicts the demise of CBC Sports as it loses NHL rights to CTV/TSN.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association {{reported}} that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, {{had formed a}} coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied {{being part of the}} coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective {{along the lines of the}} defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.|$|E
5|$|The rift in the Democratic party {{caused by}} the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's {{supporters}} were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising {{continued to be a}} major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss strategy for the general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. John Kennedy indicated that he could <b>not</b> <b>endorse</b> Nixon, but {{that he would not be}} heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.|$|E
