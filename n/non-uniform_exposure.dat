40|$|We {{investigate}} the large-scale angular {{distribution of the}} short-Gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) from BATSE experiment, using a new coordinates-free method. The analyses performed {{take into account the}} angular correlations induced by the <b>non-uniform</b> sky <b>exposure</b> during the experiment, and the uncertainty in the measured angular coordinates. Comparising the large-scale angular correlations from the data with those expected from simulations using the exposure function we find similar features. Additionally, confronting the large-angle correlations computed from the data with those obtained from simulated maps produced under the assumption of statistical isotropy we found that they are incompatible at 95 % confidence level. However, such differences are restricted to the angular scales 36 o - 45 o, which are likely to be due to the <b>non-uniform</b> sky <b>exposure.</b> This result strongly suggests that the set of SGRBs from BATSE are intrinsically isotropic. Moreover, we also investigated a possible large-angle correlation of these data with the supergalactic plane. No evidence for such large-scale anisotropy was found.

40|$|The {{anisotropy}} {{of the sky}} {{distribution of}} 2025 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) collected in Current BATSE catalog is confirmed. It is shown that the quadrupole term being proportional to similar to sin 2 b sin I is non-zero with a probability 99. 9 %. The occurrence of this anisotropy term is then supported by the binomial test even with the probability 99. 97 %. It is also argued that this anisotropy cannot be caused exclusively by instrumental effects due to the <b>non-uniform</b> sky <b>exposure</b> of BATSE instrument; there should exist also some intrinsic anisotropy in the angular distribution of GRBs. Separating GRBs into short and long subclasses, it is shown that the 251 short ones are distributed anisotropically, but the 681 long ones seem to be distributed still isotropically. The 2 -sample Kolmogorov Smirnov test shows that they are distributed differently with a 98. 7 % probability.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are characterised by a fast rise and exponential decay (FRED) temporal structure. This {{is not a}} distinctive feature of this class, since it is observed in many Galactic transients and is likely descriptive of a sudden release of energy followed by a diffusion process. Possible evidence has recently been reported by Tello et al. (2012) for a Galactic contamination in the sample of FRED GRBs discovered with Swift. We searched for possible Galactic intruders disguised as FRED GRBs in the Swift catalogue up to September 2014. We selected 181 FRED GRBs (2 / 3 with unknown redshift) and considered different subsamples. We tested the degree of isotropy through the dipole and the quadrupole moment distributions, both {{with reference to the}} Galaxy and in a coordinate-system-independent way, {{as well as with the}} two-point angular autocovariance function. In addition, we searched for possible indicators of a Galactic origin among the spectral and temporal properties of individual GRBs. We found marginal (~ 3 sigma) evidence for an excess of FREDs with unknown redshift towards the Galactic plane compared with what is expected for an isotropic distribution corrected for the <b>non-uniform</b> sky <b>exposure.</b> However, when we account for the observational bias against optical follow-up observations of low-Galactic latitude GRBs, the evidence for anisotropy decreases to ~ 2 sigma.

40|$|Lab: Lucerne {{is divided}} by sills into four major and two minor basins. During winter, {{differential}} vertical mixing due to <b>non-uniform</b> wind <b>exposure</b> and different total dissolved solid {{concentrations in the}} main tributaries of the lake cause considerable interbasin density gradients. These gradients induce density-driven currents across the sills that contribute significantly to the deep water exchange in the basins and gradually reduce the density gradients during summer. Over a period of 2 yr (1990 - 1992), the spatial and temporal evolution of water density and water age (measured by the 3 H- 3 He method) was investigated. Variation in water age between the different basins and the occasional occurrence of age inversions (older water overlying younger one) can be {{explained in terms of}} the observed density distribution and the exchange flows the density gradients cause. Water age provides an integral measure of the magnitude of deep-water renewal, which in some basins can be roughly separated into contributions from density-driven currents and wind-induced vertical mixing. By correlating water age with dissolved helium and oxygen concentrations, radiogenic helium fluxes and average oxygen depletion rates were determined for the main basins of the lake. The helium flux was between 1 and 2 x lOlo atoms m- 2 s-l, indicating dynamic equilibrium with helium production in the underlying crust. Oxygen depletion rates per unit sediment area were roughly equal in all basins (between 220 and 290 g m- 2 yr-l), whereas volumetric depletion rates varied from 1. 8 g m- 3 yr-r in the deepest basin to 10 g m- 3 yr-L in the shallowest.

This property of the WT is particularly well suited to the case where the Point-Spread Function is strongly varying across the image, {{and it is also}} effective in the detection of extended sources. The method allows to measure source count rates, sizes, and ellipticity, with their errors. Care has been taken in the assessment of thresholds for detection, in the WT space, at any desired confidence level, through a detailed semi-analytical study of the statistical properties of noise in wavelet-transformed images. The method includes the use of exposure maps to handle sharp background gradients produced by a <b>non-uniform</b> <b>exposure</b> across the detector, which would otherwise yield many spurious detections.

40|$|The {{reduction}} in {{average age of}} a vector population after application of a residual insecticide is commonly interpreted under the implicit assumption that the vector population is uniformly exposed to the insecticide. This assumption maximizes the calculated impact of the insecticide on the vectorial capacity. An alternative assumption, namely that the vector population is composed of two subpopulations, one endophilic and exposed, the other exophilic and not exposed, leads to a much smaller calculated impact of insecticide on the vectorial capacity. This is illustrated with data collected before and after application of propoxur in the Garki District, Kano State, Nigeria. These data were also used to estimate, on the one hand, before spraying, the proportion of blood meals taken by Anopheles gambiae s. l. on man that are followed by rest indoors, {{and on the other}} hand, after spraying, the proportion exposed after the first blood meal, according to the model of non-uniform exposure; the two estimates agree fairly well.

The adaptation of nucleation and catastrophe theories, well known in physics, yields sigmoidal relationships for carcinogenic risk {{as a function of the}} irradiation.

40|$|Wind-induced natural {{disasters}} have been frequently reported {{as some of}} the most fatal and costly catastrophes. Of particular intensity was the disastrous effect on low-rise residential properties that suffered in several cases from a complete damage. The intense research efforts of the wind engineering community contributed significantly towards the development of more complex yet safer wind standards and building codes of practice. Numerous studies have been carried out focusing on the estimation of wind-induced envelope pressures using in most cases wind tunnel experimental techniques and less often field studies. A key component that has not yet been investigated adequately is the flow of wind-induced forces through the structural system and their attenuation due to dynamic and other structural aspects of light frame construction. The field monitoring of a low-rise wood building provided valuable information related to its wind-induced structural response. The building was equipped with a state-of-the-art data acquisition system to monitor weather, pressure and force data. In addition, detailed wind tunnel tests on a scaled model and finite element analysis were used to study the wind effects in a simulated environment. Despite the vast amount of field data that were acquired, only a limited number was qualified as stationary and considered for further interpretation. The analysis revealed a <b>non-uniform</b> upstream <b>exposure</b> which was incorporated in the wind tunnel experiments and improved the agreement between the two experimental approaches. Of particular importance were the findings related to wind-induced uplift force distribution, especially those related to the attenuation of the wind load. For this analysis, data from pressure taps and foundation load cells were considered and incorporated in the finite element analysis. A significant reduction was identified as the wind-induced load is transferred through structural and non-structural elements to the foundation level. This attenuation was evident in the field data but was not predicted by finite element analysis, indicating that wind design practices based on static analysis of structural systems will tend to conservatively estimate actual building performances. Another interesting finding was that the wind load is transferred predominantly to the two side walls whereas the end walls have a significantly smaller contribution. Last but not least, the comparisons of the findings to current wind provisions, such as ASCE 7 and NBCC, revealed that in certain cases the recommended by the standards values could underestimate the total uplift wind force. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis summarises {{the authors}} {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} ionising radiation effects by reviewing a number of studies in physics and biology made over the past 20 years. These studies relate primarily to aspects of radiological protection and chapters I and II provide some background and an historical introduction to this important branch of radiation research. Chapter III deals with work on two-dimensional multilayer structures and in particular their utilisation as long-spacing pseudo crystals for the dispersion of low energy X-radiation. Chapter IV deals with investigations of the gas gain and energy resolution of gas proportional counters and their utilisation for the study of energy deposition processes. Chapter V deals with the development of defensible radiological protection criteria for, and the measurement of doses to, superficial tissues such as the skin, eye and gonads. Enphasis has been placed upon the need for parallel developments in the understanding of both the necessary radiobiology and physics. Studies in radiobiology and morphology can identify the origin and depth of target cells while fundamental physics developments may be necessary for the production of appropriate radiation detectors. The superficial tissues may be subjected to high localised radiation exposures from poorly penetrating radiations such as alpha, beta and low energy X-radiation. Chapter VI reviews the use of animal models for the investigation of the effects of <b>non-uniform</b> skin <b>exposure</b> such as those which arise when the skin is subjected to radioactive particle exposures. The discussion is framed in terms of the limitations of current recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) for skin dose limitation. The rationale of much of the authors work has been to carry out fundamental research in order to identify weaknesses in ICRP recommendations and, where they exist, to provide information to strengthen or underwrite revised radiological protection criteria. Such new data have been produced, for both stochastic and nonstochastic biological effects, through extensive multi-disciplinary collaborative research programmes, which are described. Chapter VII deals with the development of biological dosimetry techniques, particularly those capable of providing information on the uniformity of radiation exposures. The development of skin and hair as monitors of skin dose, and as indicators of the uniformity of whole body exposures, is particularly appropriate to the need for dose assessments in unscheduled exposures which have been underlined by the Chernobyl reactor accident. Chapter VIII deals with the evaluation of radiation risks from human radiation exposure experience. Particular emphasis is laid on the importance of the Japanese bomb survivor data and the controversy regarding radiation risks which has arisen in recent years following the need to revise the survivors radiation doses.

40|$|Maintaining {{structural}} stability {{is an integral}} component of building fire safety. Stability must be ensured to provide adequate time for safe egress of the buildings occupants, fire fighting operations and property protection. Structural fire engineering endeavours to design structures to withstand the effects of fire {{in order to achieve}} this objective. The behaviour of reinforced concrete in fire is not as well understood as other construction materials, such as steel. This is in part due to the complexity of concrete material behaviour and also due to concrete’s reputation of superior fire performance. Concrete technology is, however, continually evolving; structures are increasingly slender, more highly stressed and have higher compressive strengths. A more robust understanding of concrete’s behaviour in fire will enable predictions of the implications of changing concrete technology and also help to properly quantify the fire safety risk associated with concrete structures. A fundamental key to understanding structural fire performance is the relationship between the thermal environment induced by the fire and the structure. Significant thermal variation has been found experimentally to exist within fire compartments. Despite this the design of structures for fire almost universally assumes the compartment thermal environment to be homogeneous. In this thesis the implications of compartment fire non-uniformity for concrete structural behaviour is investigated to assess the validity of the uniform compartment temperature assumption. The investigation is conducted using numerical tools; a detailed review of the necessary background knowledge, material modelling of reinforced concrete, finite element modelling of reinforced concrete structures and compartment fire thermal variation is included. The behaviour of a two-way spanning reinforced concrete slab is used as a structural benchmark. The membrane behaviour exhibited by two-way spanning RC slabs at high temperatures has been previously studied under uniform thermal conditions. They therefore are an ideal benchmark for identifying the influence of non-uniform thermal environments for behaviour. The relationship between gas phase temperature variation and concrete thermal expansion behaviour, which is fundamental to understanding concrete high temperature structural behaviour, is first investigated. These preliminary studies provide the necessary fundamental understanding to identify the influence of gas phase temperature variation upon the membrane behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs. The individual influences of spatial and temporal variation upon slab membrane behaviour are investigated and the behaviour under non-uniform thermal variation contrasted with uniform thermal exposure behaviour. The influence of spatial variation of temperature is found to be strongly dependent upon the structural slenderness ratio. The tensile membrane action of slender slabs is particularly susceptible to the distorted slab deflection profiles induced by spatial variation of gas temperature. Conversely the compressive membrane behaviour of stocky slabs is found to be insensitive to the deformation effects induced by spatial variation of temperature. The influence upon slender slabs is demonstrated under a range of temporal variations indicating that the thermal response of concrete is sufficiently fast to be sensitive to realistically varying distributions of temperature. Contrasting behaviour induced by uniform and <b>non-uniform</b> thermal <b>exposures</b> indicates that uniform temperature assumptions provide both conservative and unconservative predictions of behaviour. The accuracy of the uniform temperature assumptions was also found to be dependent upon the type of fire, for example, fast hot and short cool fires. Additionally, the sensitivity of structural performance to deformations caused by spatial variation of temperature demonstrated in this thesis challenges the purely strength based focus of traditional structural fire engineering. Spalling is an important feature of concrete’s high temperature behaviour which is not currently explicitly addressed in design. The incorporation of spalling into structural analysis is not, however, straightforward. The influence of spalling upon behaviour has therefore been dealt with separately. A spalling design framework is developed to incorporate the effects of spalling into a structural analysis. Application of the framework to case studies demonstrates the potential for spalling to critically undermine the structural performance of concrete in fire. It also demonstrates how the framework can be used to quantify the effects of spalling and therefore account for these in the structural fire design addressing spalling risk in a rational manner.

The significance of in-version polymorphism in gambiae and arabiensis (the two species of greatest medical importance) is evaluated with reference to recent field investiga-tions carried out in Nigeria. In both sibling species some of the inversions show clinal geographical changes in frequencies, with evident correlations with climatic conditions and vegetation zones. Microgeographical variations in species distribution and in intraspecific inversion frequencies are also present, which appear mostly related to man-made environmental contrasts. Parallel indoor/outdoor collections of samples from polymorphic populations of arabiensis and gambiae show that adult mosquitoes carrying certain inversion karyotypes do not distribute at random {{in relation to the}} human environment, being significantly more frequent in outdoor than in indoor samples, or vice-versa. Optimal habitat choice appears to be involved in such variations of indoor resting behaviour, since the chromosomal types carried by less endophilic individuals are those more adapted to humid climates, i. e. those which tend to avoid the higher nocturnal saturation deficit of the indoor environ-ment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the effects on the shape and {{position}} of the characteristic curve due to a low level uniform exposure to white light. This was accomplished using a special camera which produced {{an image of a}} neutral density -wedge on a film strip. One half of this image was covered while the other half was uniformly exposed to a low level light exposure. In some cases the low level exposure was first applied to half of the film strip with the image exposure occurring second. The density differences between the two halves of the film strip were measured and compared to density differences expected from additive exposure. The density differences were also analysed with respect to the time delay between the imaging and additional uniform exposure. This is repeated for each level of additional exposure. A graphical analysis based on a hypothetical film type was performed and then the same done for the test data. Graphical analysis was then done to determine if effects other than those attributable to additive exposure occurred. Conclusions were drawn concerning the effects of the level of additional exposure, and of the time delay between exposures, on the density differences produced by the additional exposure. For the film type and processing conditions used, a level of additional exposure producing a density of 0. 016 above base plus fog density, introduced significantly greater density increase when the additional uniform exposure occurred after the image exposure. No significant difference, with respect to time, occurred for an additional exposure of 0. 006 above base fog. The greatest effects were noticed in the toe region of the density versus Log exposure curve, where the slope of the density versus exposure curve is the greatest. For the type 5302 film, <b>non-uniform</b> <b>exposure</b> in the camera system caused errors in determining the log exposure values for the projected step wedge image. Sensitometer control strips were used to determine those values for the type 5302 film, however, no control strips existed for the Tri-X, due to my error, and exposure values could not be determined.

In the current work, an integrated procedure for microwave extraction followed by volatiles sampling and analysis from selected botanical raw materials (viz. black pepper, Piper nigrum and coriander Coriandrum sativum) was developed. There are two problems to overcome in the extraction from solid plant materials: that of releasing the essential oil from solid matrix and letting it diffuse out successfully in a manner that can be scaled-up to industrial volumes. Towards this end, an innovative volatiles extraction unit was conceived, designed and developed that used thin layer, for microwave exposure and rotational mixing, to mitigate the effects of thermal gradient and <b>non-uniform</b> <b>exposure</b> of bulk matter. The effect of varying the microwave field on the essential oils extracted was studied. The microwave field that coupled in the region of extraction was estimated from temperature rise measurement using the microwave power equation (with water as reference dielectric). The essential oil extracted under different microwave fields were compared using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data analysis with SAS statistical software. The microwave field at the site of extraction was sensed by symmetrical placement of biomaterial sample and a reference, in a rotational extractor, such that they both couple the same field during tumbling motion. By measuring the temperature rise in the reference accurately, it is possible to estimate the microwave field present at that position. The rotational extractor has a second degree of freedom, in that it can slide along the axel taking discrete positions. Each position leads to a different microwave exposure of the sample. It is possible to measure the relative variation of microwave field using temperature rise data at each position. It was found that, at position labeled R 4, located at 65. 6 mm from the right extreme of the microwave cavity had the highest effective microwave field strength of value 92. 7 V/m. The volatiles released from the biomaterials, black pepper and coriander, were sampled using solid phase micro extraction and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The highest peaks representing beta-caryophyllene in black pepper and linalool in coriander were identified using mass spectrometric peak matching using NIST library. The extract (in terms of ion count) for each microwave parameter (such as field, water content level and solvent type) was plotted as a trend graph. The current experiment successfully tested the procedure for following the microwave process in the extraction of sensitive spice volatiles (from black pepper and coriander). With the microwave field measured at the region of extraction, it was possible to plot pepper extraction versus the microwave field to which the pepper sample was exposed. The extraction was represented in terms of cumulative value of ion counts obtained in GC-MS analysis. This unique procedure developed in the current research allows for the graphical comparison of the microwave extractions. It was found that black pepper has a better response to microwave extraction than coriander. The pepper extraction was found to increase proportionately with increase in microwave field strength. The extraction was also enhanced proportionately by the incremental addition of water content at constant microwave field...|$|E
