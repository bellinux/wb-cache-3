It {{continued}} operating, and a new company formed under the same name to take over. In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E

However, Ögedei also expanded his personal appanage, seizing some territories of Tolui and took most of Sorghaghtani's soldiers.|$|E

25|$|During the American Revolution, Savannah {{fell to the}} British. This left Augusta as the {{new state}} capital and a new prime target of the British. By January 31, 1779, Augusta was {{captured}} by Lt. Col. Archibald Campbell. But Campbell soon withdrew, as American troops were gathering on the opposite shore of the Savannah River. Augusta again became the state capital, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Augusta fell into British hands once more {{before the end of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Battle of Manzikert {{is widely}} seen as {{the moment when the}} Byzantines lost the war against the Turks; however the Byzantine {{military}} was of questionable quality before 1071 with regular Turkish incursions overrunning the failing theme system. Even after Manzikert, Byzantine rule over Asia Minor did not end immediately, nor were any heavy concessions levied by the Turks on their opponents – it took another 20 years before the Turks were in control of the entire Anatolian peninsula and <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long</b> either.|$|E
25|$|With {{losses to}} the Spanish navy increasing, and the {{eventual}} fall in profits from slave selling, raiding became less {{appealing to the}} Iranuns and their Islamic supporters. Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal. Thus, it came to pass that the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro's history. The pirate fort in Mamburao was abandoned, and the Moros retreated to Mindanao to consolidate their forces and continue the Moslem resistance at the homefront. Mindoro Island then became a Spanish possession in a truer sense for the first time. But <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E

25|$|The match went to extra time, and France {{finished}} slightly {{the stronger}} {{of the two}} sides. No more goals were scored, {{and so it was}} time for a penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms – but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Julio Cesar struck the post with his penalty, and Luis Fernández then scored to put France through 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
25|$|The shutdown, however, was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Tourism to Alaska {{began to}} increase, with many cruise ships {{stopping}} at Skagway. The scenery of the White Pass route {{sounded like a}} great tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route were laid {{right down to the}} docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even have to walk far.|$|E
25|$|Reicha's {{life and}} career in Vienna were {{interrupted}} by Napoleon's November 1805 occupation of the city by French troops. In 1806 Reicha travelled to Leipzig to arrange a performance of his new work, the cantata Lenore (stopping at Prague to see his mother {{for the first time}} since 1780), but because Leipzig was blockaded by the French, not only was the performance cancelled but he could not return to Vienna for several months. When he did return it was <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long,</b> because by 1808 the Austrian Empire was already preparing for another war, the War of the Fifth Coalition, so Reicha decided to move back to Paris. This time three of his many operas were produced, but they all failed; yet his fame as theorist and teacher increased steadily, and by 1817 most of his pupils became professors at the Conservatoire de Paris. The following year, Reicha himself was appointed professor of counterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire with the support of Louis XVIII, despite opposition from its director Luigi Cherubini.|$|E

Near Balfour {{an arm of the}} lake branches westward to Nelson, where below Corra Linn Dam the Kootenay becomes a river again, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> The river drops over several waterfalls at Bonnington Falls, all of which are taken advantage of to generate hydropower. Four run-of-the river dams impound the river in the [...] stretch that follows. At Brilliant it widens into a small inland delta, then at Castlegar it joins with the Columbia River.|$|E
500|$|Norse sources {{describe}} a large force emerging from hiding places in an ambush. The Norwegian forces {{were taken by}} surprise, and were not in battle order. Magnus attempted to assert control over his disordered army, ordering part of his force to seize secure ground and use archery fire to slow the Irish. In the melee Magnus was pierced by a spear through both thighs above the knees but he fought on, attempting to get his men back to the level campsite. An axe-wielding Irishman charged him, striking a lethal blow to his neck. When his men said that he proceeded incautiously in his campaigns, Magnus {{is reported to have}} responded [...] "Kings are made for honour, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long</b> life"; he was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad.|$|E

500|$|Delta Sigma Theta is an {{historically}} African-American sorority at Dartmouth College {{that was}} founded in 1982 as the Che-Ase Interest Group. [...] At the time, the college had imposed a moratorium on the founding on new sororities, but when the moratorium was lifted, the group was recognized by the college as a sorority {{in the fall of}} 1984. [...] The women contacted the Delta Sigma Theta national sorority and were granted a charter as the Pi Theta chapter in the spring of 1985. [...] Delta Sigma Theta provided an extensive array of public service through the Five-Point Thrust program. [...] Until the chapter's dissolution, the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta had cosponsored the Step Show, an annual cultural dance performance, with the brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha. [...] The sorority had occupied dedicated College-owned apartment housing until June, 2004, when all but one member of the Dartmouth chapter graduated. [...] An attempt was made to recruit new members in the summer, and it succeeded, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long,</b> as the chapter currently has no members at Dartmouth.|$|E
500|$|By early 1998, {{the punk}} revival had commercially stalled, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> That November, the Offspring's Americana {{on the major}} Columbia label debuted at number two on the album chart. A bootleg MP3 of its first single, [...] "Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)", made it onto the Internet and was {{downloaded}} a record 22 million times—illegally. The following year, Enema of the State, the first major-label release by pop punk band Blink-182, reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months. In January 2000, the album's second single, [...] "All the Small Things", hit the sixth spot on the Billboard Hot 100. While they were viewed as Green Day [...] "acolytes", critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and 'N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink-182's sound and market niche. The band's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and Blink-182 (2003) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart. In November 2003, The New Yorker described how the [...] "giddily puerile" [...] act had [...] "become massively popular with the mainstream audience, a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk-rock purists." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon, {{the stock}} rush began.

2500|$|The quarter-final {{opponent}} was one Lithuania {{could not}} defeat in previous years, Yugoslavia. The start was anxious as Lithuanians were trailing 8–2, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Yugoslavians resisted only until three minutes were left, with Lithuania already leading the game 72–58. Then nobody doubted – the quarter-final winner is Lithuania, officially winning the game 76–63. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas: [...] "Winning against the Yugoslavian team and its coach is every team and every coach dream. We {{are even more}} happy that we won in the quarter-final. The gulf is separating the quarter-final winner teams from the losers. We played very orderly, probably the most disciplined in this tournament. We defended well. Furthermore, Gintaras Einikis and Šarūnas Jasikevičius played amazingly". Lithuania was to compete for another Olympic medal, to the happiness of all their fans.|$|E

This order was carried out, but <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long,</b> because further orders were soon forthcoming with instructions to bypass San Francisco and report to the Thirteenth Naval District, Seattle, Washington. The arrival at Seattle was heralded by a shore-based ovation. Following the debarkation of the passengers, the ship was brought over to the Bremerton Navy Yard for repairs. The yard workers concentrated mostly on the boilers, which were in serious need of attention. Temporary repairs took one week after which the headquarters detachment of the 97th Infantry Division was embarked at Pier Forty-two.|$|E
