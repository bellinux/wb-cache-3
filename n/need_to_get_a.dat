Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is no longer Corleone consigliere, as he is now Michael's lawyer, and Michael wants him removed from Corleone operations. As such, he is to be Dominic's consigliere. Hagen tells Dominic they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> senator on their side; Pat Geary (Chris Edgerly), who has a weakness for prostitutes, and frequents a local brothel. They set Geary up so he awakens with a dead prostitute, and Tom and Dominic promise him the girl will disappear, {{as long as he}} offers his friendship to the Corleones. Geary agrees, advising Dominic the Mangano family are planning to start operating in Miami.|$|E
25|$|From 2021, choice {{will matter}} {{when it comes}} to {{secondary}} school admissions. Pupils will get a choice of six schools and have to rank these choices in order of their preference. If two pupils have the same PSLE score and have chosen the same school, the one who has put it down as a first choice will get priority over the one who listed it as a second choice. Computerised balloting will be used as a tie-breaker if there are two pupils with the same PSLE score and citizenship status, vying for a place in a school for which they have both listed in the same choice order.To get into the Express stream, pupils <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> PSLE score of 22 or less, instead of a PSLE aggregate score of around 188 currently. For the Normal (Academic) stream, a score of 25 or less is needed, and for the Normal (Technical) stream, a score of 30 or less.|$|E
500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little bit of luck you always <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen {{was not going to be}} part of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

[...] Begala argued {{that the purpose of the}} show was that it was intended as for debate, to which Stewart responded [...] "To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying Pro Wrestling is a show about athletic competition" [...] and called Carlson's signature bow-tie an example of [...] "theater".

The show was later canceled and aired its final episode on June 17, 2006. On this episode, Chung, {{dressed in a white}} evening gown and dancing atop a black piano, sang a parody to the tune of [...] "Thanks for the Memory". Video clips of the bizarre, off-key farewell performance circulated on internet video sites. Connie herself commented, [...] "All I want to be sure of is that viewers understood it was a giant self-parody.

2500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for {{dialogue}} referencing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps benefit). In {{a scene from the}} episode, Patrick Star tries to show SpongeBob [...] "the benefits of being unemployed", to which SpongeBob replies, [...] "Unemployment may be fun for you, but I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job." [...] The scene was meant to demonstrate the title character's [...] "eternal optimism and willingness to get back to work...in a way that's still funny and relatable". However, some political activists claimed the [...] "notorious line" [...] was a [...] "slam" [...] to the Food Stamps benefit. A report by The Hollywood Reporter alleged that the episode may have had a political agenda about the social safety net. It added that [...] "It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left." [...] The Hollywood Reporter cited the previous episodes [...] "SpongeBob's Last Stand" [...] and [...] "Selling Out" [...] for where [...] "environmentalism is glorified" [...] and [...] "large businesses are demonized".|$|E
60|$|A {{man who has}} {{at length}} found {{something}} to do will not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new suit to do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an indeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet--if a hero ever has a valet--bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go to soirées and legislative balls must have new coats, coats to change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes--his old coat, actually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, {{so that it was}} not a deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors, and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind.|$|E
