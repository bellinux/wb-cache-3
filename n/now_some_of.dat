However, La Salle during its {{stint in the}} NCAA was not as strong a contender as Ateneo was (see Ateneo–San Beda rivalry), with Ateneo not meeting La Salle again until the 1958 Finals, where Ateneo prevailed.

These were poor quality models, however, compared to earlier Dinkys, and {{an attempt to}} cut production costs and possibly shift production should the Binns Road Factory close, which it eventually did. So, the last new Dinky Toys made by Meccano were Hong Kong products. These are <b>now</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most sought after of all Dinky Toys. A few, such as the Mk2 Ford Granada, and Steed's Jaguar from the New Avengers TV series exist as pre-production examples only.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{the first}} State of Origin match was played in Australia. This pitted teams {{representative}} of Queensland and New South Wales against each other. Although matches {{between the two}} had taken place for many years, the origin concept (borrowed from Australian rules football) meant {{that for the first}} time players were selected based on where they first played the game, rather than where they were currently playing. This had an immediate effect, evening up the competition, which had come to be dominated by New South Wales because of the financial strength of the Sydney clubs, and rousing greater pride in spectators as their players were considered more truly representative of their respective states. State of Origin matches are <b>now</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the biggest and most keenly fought contests in Australian sport.|$|E

The National Art Museum of Ukraine is a museum dedicated to Ukrainian art. The Golden Gate is a historic gateway in the ancient city's walls. The name Zoloti Vorota is also used for a nearby theatre and a station of the Kiev Metro. The small Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum acts as both {{a memorial}} and historical center devoted to the events surrounding the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and its effect on the Ukrainian people, the environment, and subsequent attitudes toward the safety of nuclear power as a whole.|$|E
500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of <b>now,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, which I did with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E

The interviewer noted that Granholm would be criticized, but she hoped that everyone would [...] "keep those values in mind...through the budget process". Betsy DeVos, the chairman of the Michigan Republican Party (1996–2000, 2003-05), was upset that Granholm had decided [...] "to cloak her views on balancing the budget in religious terms in order to demonize her political opponents". Granholm responded that she did not think her response was controversial and said that many people of faith were serving in state government.|$|E
2500|$|The Jewish {{community}} of Brody {{perished in the}} Holocaust. A great number of Brody Jews were murdered in the autumn 1942. A group of 250 Brody Jewish intellectuals were shot nearby the Jewish cemetery in Brody (where the Holocaust monument stands <b>now).</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> surviving Brody Jews were imprisoned in the family camp of Pyanytsia (Pianica) in the forests near Lviv. [...] All of remaining Brody Jews were moved into the ghetto created in the town on January 1, 1943 (or December 1942). Another 3,000 Jews from neighbouring areas of Zolochiv, Lopatyn and Busk were subsequently added to Brody's ghetto. Horrible work conditions made some young people to run away joining the Soviet army. Ghetto's poor hygiene and hunger were non-tolerable. The disease and famine took hundreds of Jewish lives. All 9.000 Jews of Brody ghetto were subsequently mass murdered on May 1, 1943. On September 19, 1942, around 2,500 Jews of Brody were deported to the extermination camp of Bełżec (today a little town on Polish Ukrainian border). [...] On November 2, 3,000 more Jews were sent from Brody to Bełżec extermination camp. Many Brody Jews were exterminated in Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin (a city in the south east corner of Poland).|$|E
