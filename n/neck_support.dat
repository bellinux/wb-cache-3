25|$|Since late 2001, a {{head and}} neck {{restraint}} has been required for usage of all drivers. Since 2005 the HANS Device (Head and <b>Neck</b> <b>Support</b> Device) {{has been the only}} such approved device. Since 2003, helmets have been required for pit crew members as well. Drivers and pit crew members must also wear firesuits. Drivers are required to use carbon fiber seats and headrests for strength and durability. Cars have also been redesigned since the 2001 death of Dale Earnhardt and after spectacular crashes to reflect new discoveries and developments in safety.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day as Myers' report was made public, NASCAR {{announced}} its own investigation, after having remained silent for six weeks since the crash. The official NASCAR report, which had cost over a million dollars and was published on August 21, 2001, concluded that Earnhardt's death {{was the result of a}} combination of factors, which included the last-second collision with Schrader's car, the speed and angle of impact, and the separation of the seat belt as being contributing factors. It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and <b>neck</b> <b>support</b> (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E
500|$|In October 1996 FIA {{set about}} researching a driver {{restraint}} system for head-on impacts, {{in conjunction with}} McLaren and Mercedes-Benz. Mercedes contacted the makers of the HANS (Head and <b>Neck</b> <b>Support)</b> device, {{with a view to}} adapting it for Formula One. The HANS device was first released in 1991 and was designed to restrain the head and neck {{in the event of an}} accident to avoid basal skull fracture, the injury which killed Ratzenberger. [...] Initial tests proved successful, and at the 2000 San Marino Grand Prix the final report was released which concluded that the HANS should be recommended for use. Its use was made compulsory from the start of the 2003 season.|$|E
5000|$|Although looking upward, {{the head}} is not [...] "thrown back" [...] {{allowing}} the neck to collapse, but rather the chin is raised and <b>neck</b> <b>supported</b> and extended.|$|R
5000|$|Stretching {{the muscle}} in a lateral {{position}} {{supported by a}} pillow (have infant lie on the side with the <b>neck</b> <b>supported</b> by pillow). Affected side should be against the pillow to deviate the neck towards the non-affected side.|$|R
5000|$|The head is {{tilted back}} on the C1 vertebrae, {{allowing}} the chin to move upwards, but keeping the <b>neck</b> <b>supported</b> and lengthened. This both lengthens and/or works the following anterior neck muscles: rectus capitis, longus capitis, longus colli, verticalis, scalenes (worked eccentrically).|$|R
2500|$|Although NASCAR {{frequently}} publicizes {{the safety}} measures it mandates for drivers, these features are often only adopted {{long after they}} were initially developed, and only {{in response to an}} injury or fatality. The impact-absorbing [...] "SAFER Barrier" [...] that is now in use had been proposed by legendary mechanic Smokey Yunick during the 1970s, but his idea had been dismissed as too expensive and unnecessary. Only after the deaths of Adam Petty, Kenny Irwin and Tony Roper in 2000, and Dale Earnhardt in 2001 did NASCAR revisit the idea of decreasing the G-forces a driver sustained during a crash. Other examples of available safety features that were slow to be implemented include the mandating of a throttle [...] "kill switch". The [...] "kill switch" [...] was mandated after the death of Adam Petty, along with the requirements of an anti-spill bladder in fuel cells. Fire-retardant driver suits were required only after the death of Glen [...] "Fireball" [...] Roberts, who died from complications of burns suffered in a crash when flames engulfed his car during a Charlotte race. Dale Earnhardt was killed after he received massive head and neck trauma from a hard crash in the 2001 Daytona 500. Earnhardt's death prompted NASCAR to require all drivers to use the [...] "HANS device" [...] (Head And <b>Neck</b> <b>Support</b> Device), a device that keeps the driver's neck from going forward in a wreck. In the mid-2000s, NASCAR redesigned the racing vehicle with safety improvements, calling it the Car of Tomorrow. The car has a higher roof, wider cockpit, and the driver seat was located more {{toward the center of the}} vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Muzquizopteryx was {{relatively}} small for a pterodactyloid pterosaur, with a wingspan of around 2 m. It had an elongated {{head with a}} convex upper profile, ending {{at the back of}} the head in a backward pointing short rounded crest. The jaws were toothless. The arms were very robust with the humerus featuring a large hatchet-shaped deltopectoral crest, indicating a strong wing musculature. The pteroid bone was long and pointed towards the <b>neck,</b> <b>supporting</b> a flight membrane.|$|R
40|$|Aims: (i) To {{describe}} the displacement and {{recovery of the}} vesical neck position during pregnancy and after childbirth and (ii) to discriminate between compliance of the vesical <b>neck</b> <b>supporting</b> structures with and without pelvic floor contraction. Methods: We focussed on the biomechanical properties of the vesical <b>neck</b> <b>supporting</b> structures during pregnancy and after childbirth by calculating the compliance and the hysteresis as a result from of abdominal pressure measurements and simultaneous perineal ultrasound. Results: This study shows that compliance of the supporting structures remains relatively constant during pregnancy and returns to normal values 6 months after childbirth. Hysteresis, however, showed an increase after childbirth, persisting at least until 6 months post partum. Conclusions: Vaginal delivery may stretch and or load beyond the physiological properties of the pelvic floor tissue {{and in this way}} may lead to irreversible changes in tissue properties which {{play an important role in}} the urethral support continence mechanism. Editorial Comment This manuscript reviews the effects of vaginal delivery on the biomechanical properties of the bladder neck and the pelvic tissues that support same.

50|$|The use of treaded rain tires {{in place}} of the normal slick tires is {{permitted}} only when the race director deems it necessary in any given session or race, and he reserves the right to mandate their use when conditions are severe. For safety reasons, the pitlane is subject to a 60-km/h (37.5-mph) speed limit, violation of which will result in a drive-through penalty. Drivers must wear FIA-specification helmets and use the Head And <b>Neck</b> <b>Support</b> (HANS) restraint system.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped <b>neck</b> <b>supporting</b> the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, {{although}} the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over the hips.|$|R
