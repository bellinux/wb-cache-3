50|$|In 2006, Hayes's {{name was}} removed from the display of active Bujinkan teachers, ending his {{official}} role within that organization. That his <b>name</b> <b>plank</b> {{was removed from}} the Bujinkan Honbu wall has been documented by both parties. However, the specifics regarding the motivation for the removal are in dispute. Some suggest Hayes was expelled from the organization. Hayes explains that he simply no longer participates as an active Bujinkan instructor. To-Shin Do is taught through his SKH (Stephen K. Hayes) Quest locations. The SKH Quest network now spans 31 schools across North America, Europe, Australia and Africa.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins of the}} county name [...] "Clare". One hypothesis is that the name is derived from Thomas de Clare who was deeply embroiled in local politics and fighting in the 1270s and 1280s. An alternative hypothesis is that the county name Clare comes from the settlement of Clare (now Clarecastle) whose Irish <b>name</b> [...] (<b>plank</b> bridge) refers to a crossing over the River Fergus.|$|R
2500|$|The {{last two}} {{crossings}} of Tin Brook, {{a mile and}} a half (...) east of CR 85 precede a bend to the southeast. The woods on the side of the road increase here as NY52 climbs slightly after the Catskill Aqueduct crosses a half-mile from that turn. In another half-mile, the route returns to its more easterly course as it enters the town of Newburgh and takes the <b>name</b> South <b>Plank</b> Road at the intersection with Old South Plank Road and Cooks Lane.|$|R
50|$|Route 3 splits into a {{business}} route and a bypass while going through Fredericksburg. The bypass is called the Blue and Gray Parkway. The business route follows William Street. Both routes enter the city by passing over the Rappahannock River, although on different bridges. They rejoin as William Street just before the U.S. 1 interchange. The street <b>name</b> changes to <b>Plank</b> Road somewhere between Route 1 and Interstate 95.|$|R
50|$|The Newark Plank Road {{was a major}} artery between Hudson Waterfront at Paulus Hook (in today's Jersey City) {{and city}} of Newark further inland across the New Jersey Meadows. As its <b>name</b> suggests, a <b>plank</b> road was {{constructed}} of wooden planks laid side-to-side on a roadbed. Similar roads, the Bergen Point Plank Road, the Hackensack Plank Road and Paterson Plank Road, travelled to the locales {{for which they are}} named. The name is no longer used, the route having been absorbed into other streets and freeways.|$|R
50|$|SR 142 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 1 and US 460 Business (Boydton Plank Road) {{just south of}} the U.S. Highways' interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) (Richmond - Petersburg Turnpike) in eastern Dinwiddie County. The state highway heads east as two-lane Simpson Road, which heads east parallel to I-85 through a sparsely-populated area and passes the remains of Fort Gregg. East of the old Confederate fort, SR 142 enters the city of Petersburg and becomes <b>named</b> Boydton <b>Plank</b> Road. The state highway enters a residential area shortly before crossing over I-85 and intersecting Squirrel Level Road, which has a diamond interchange with I-85 to the south. SR 142 intersects Halifax Road and the highway's name changes to Halifax Street shortly before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at its bridge over CSX's North End Subdivision. Halifax Street continues northeast as an unnumbered street toward Old Towne Petersburg.|$|R
50|$|SR 35 heads {{northwest}} from Courtland as Plank Road. The {{state highway}} crosses over then parallels the Assamoosick Swamp north into Sussex County. Within that county, SR 35 is <b>named</b> Jerusalem <b>Plank</b> Road and intersects SR 40 (Sussex Drive) in the hamlet of Homeville. The state highway continues into Prince George County as Courtland Road {{to the village}} of Templeton. SR 35 meets US 301 (Crater Road) just east of I-95; the intersection also serves as the southern terminus of SR 156 (Prince George Drive) and receives the exit ramp from northbound I-95. SR 35 and US 301 head west across I-95 and meet the other three ramps of the partial cloverleaf interchange with the Interstate. US 301 turns south onto Crater Road while the state highway continues to its terminus at the intersection of SR 605 (Spain Drive) and SR 622 (Providence Road).|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{street names}} for the north-south section of NY 300 still enjoy wide local usage even though both the United States Postal Service and the local governments no longer recognize them as valid road names. Since {{the adoption of the}} 911 emergency system in 1997, {{the entire length of the}} road is now referred to officially as [...] "Route 300", with the old names of Plattekill Turnpike, Union Avenue Extension, Union Avenue and Temple Hill Road being suppressed by the local governments and by the U.S. Postal Service. The name Route 300 has even replaced the old <b>name</b> North <b>Plank</b> Road west of Cronomer Valley, even though the name is retained by the Postal Service east of that intersection. Interestingly, the large signs on Interstate 84 still refer to NY 300 as Union Avenue, however, even though local and official use of this name has been suppressed for the past decade.|$|R
40|$|Trespass negotiates my {{frustration}} with Tasmania being enclosed, fenced and gated, {{and the difficulty}} for Aboriginal people to access their island without the permission of private landholders. In early 2008 I drove to Latrobe where, by the 1840 s, my great great great great grandparents lived. Coal rd seemed {{a clue to the}} location of the Alfred Colliery that they founded and mined until it ran nigh dry after a decade. Asking a stranger who looked local on the main street brought me to an old-timer who told me where to look for what he thought was an entrance to the mine. Not on Coal rd, but not far off it lay, a black abyss hiding under the base of a burnt but alive grand old tree. I jumped a fence and hastened towards it, stopped suddenly by the booming voice of a man, striding down hill towards me. His broad accent, he was from Chester he later explained, seemed to bring me towards a colonial confrontation. Would I be shot? His increasing gait, it happened, was due to his concern for me because a large tiger snake lived {{at the entrance to the}} mine. However, I saw his rapid approach as a hostile response to my trespass. I remember the conjunction of both alarm and annoyance at my sense of guilt, caught wandering across what was originally not only my Aboriginal forebear's land, but also convict ancestor's land. Didn’t I have all ground covered? The man's arrival reawakened an anxiety that runs deep, about not being able to access my island home. Tasmania has been, since the first half of the 1800 s, revised into a series of named 'properties'. Each has borne witness to the exclusion of the original people. Some properties have rivers that run through them, providing an arterial, subversive journey across places that hold close their secret pasts. Trespass is an imaginary vehicle on which I might journey through these places. Perhaps in dreams I would collect, remove, reorder the <b>name</b> <b>planks</b> along the byways and highways, reclaiming Aboriginal place...|$|R
5000|$|From 1981 until 1983, Plank (who is {{also known}} as the godmother of PRSSA [...] ) partnered with Jon Riffel (who is known as the godfather of PRSSA) to start a group that is now called Champions for PRSSA, which is {{composed}} of public relations professionals who have taken a special interest in public relations education and PRSSA students. Beginning in 1988, the Champions for PRSSA began giving out scholarships which would later be given out in <b>Plank's</b> <b>name.</b> Between the program's inception in 1988 and 2005, more than $65,000 scholarships had been awarded for those seeking an education in the field.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, a plank {{road was}} {{completed}} from Milwaukee to Watertown. [...] After plank roads {{were no longer}} used, the route was replaced by highway (Wisconsin Highway 16) and a railroad. A street <b>named</b> [...] "Watertown <b>Plank</b> Road" [...] survives in Milwaukee. It is {{referred to in the}} [...] "Plank Road Brewery" [...] family of beers, produced by Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee.There was an influx of German immigrants in the late 19th century. The city is the home of the first kindergarten in the United States, started in 1856 by Margarethe Schurz, wife of statesman Carl Schurz; the building that housed this kindergarten is now located {{on the grounds of the}} Octagon House Museum in Watertown.|$|R
50|$|US 1 {{continues}} northeast as a three-lane {{road that}} alternates between two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound, and a center turn lane. The route expands to a four-lane divided highway after entering Brunswick County, where the highway's <b>name</b> becomes Boydton <b>Plank</b> Road, and before crossing the Meherrin River. US 1 reduces to a three-lane road and passes through Meredithville. At Cochran, the highway intersects SR 46 (Christanna Highway) {{just south of}} the Christanna Campus of Southside Virginia Community College. US 1 expands to a four-lane divided highway; the southbound lanes pass under a narrow former railroad bridge. The highway has a diamond interchange with I-85, then passes through the southern edge of the town of Alberta, where the U.S. Highway meets the eastern end of SR 136 (Church Street). East of Alberta, US 1 becomes three lanes and passes through the adjacent communities of Warfield and Sturgeonville and to the east of Rawlings before expanding to a four-lane divided highway immediately before crossing the Nottoway River into Dinwiddie County.|$|R
5000|$|Today {{there is}} little or nothing to be seen of the plank road in Hoboken, the urban grid of the city having {{expanded}} westward across landfilled marshes, though the alignment would be at Clinton Street in the city's northwest quarter. The route begins today in lower Weehawken at the town line and rail tracks now used by the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. A short street connects it to Willow Avenue, which functions as a local entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. The only segment that retains the <b>name</b> Hackensack <b>Plank</b> Road (and locally called the High Road), ascends the face of the Hudson Palisades to Weehawken Heights and upon reaching the top is designated County Route 691. It travels on a northwest diagonal across Union City as 32nd Street, passing over the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix, intersecting Bergenline Avenue, and creating the terminus of Summit Avenue. Crossing Kennedy Boulevard at Schuetzen Park it enters North Bergen, New Jersey, and as Bergen Turnpike descends to pass Weehawken Cemetery, Palisade Cemetery, and near the site of the colonial-era Three Pigeons joins Tonnelle Ave. There the route heads north through New Durham and Bergenwood between the western slope of the palisades and the border of what has become the [...] The portion called Hackensack Plank Road is one of few roads which travel along the face of the Hudson Palisades escarpment, other being the Paterson Plank Road, the Wing Viaduct, Pershing Road, and Bulls Ferry Road. It is joined at its midpoint by what some have called the Lombard Street of the East Coast, Shippen Street, which has double hairpin turn descending to the plank road. [...] A similar street, Mountain Road, is a single hairpin between Jersey City Heights and Hoboken.|$|R
