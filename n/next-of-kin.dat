5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the <b>next-of-kin,</b> on the agreement that the <b>next-of-kin</b> give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. If this is the case, the <b>next-of-kin</b> would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BCE Aristotle {{records that}} there were no {{restrictions}} on whom an heiress might marry. If she was not married during her father's lifetime or by directions in her father's will, her nearest <b>next-of-kin</b> was allowed to marry her wherever he chose.|$|E
5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of a new Civil Commitment Act in Sweden in 1992 involved a shift of emphasis from medical to judicial authority. Little is known about general patient attitudes to compulsory care. The aim {{of the study was}} to study possible differences in attitudes, before and after the mental health law reform, among involuntarily and voluntarily admitted patients and their nextof- kins towards involuntary psychiatric admission. Samples of 84 committed and 84 voluntarily admitted patients in 1991 and 118 committed and 117 voluntarily admitted patients in 1997 - 99 were interviewed within 5 days from admission and at discharge, or after 3 weeks of care. Samples of 64 <b>next-of-kins</b> to the committed patients and 69 <b>next-of-kins</b> to the voluntarily admitted patients in 1991, and 73 and 89 <b>next-of-kins,</b> respectively, in 1997 - 99 were interviewed approximately 1 month after the admission. Few changes in attitudes were found between the two study occasions. A majority of all patients stated that it should be possible to compulsorily admit patients, and a great majority of the patients and the next-of kins stated that decisions regarding compulsory admission should be taken by doctors. Most patients and <b>next-of-kins</b> regarded decisions about involuntary psychiatric care mainly as a medical matter. Strong support for coercion in order to protect the patient and others was found among <b>next-of-kins.</b> The law reform was not reflected in attitudinal differences...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide an {{overview}} of the fourth edition of the CLEF eHealth evaluation lab. CLEF eHealth 2016 continues our evaluation resource building efforts around the easing and support of patients, their <b>next-of-kins</b> and clinical staff in understanding, accessing and authoring eHealth information in a multilingual setting. This year’s lab offered three tasks: Task 1 on handover information extraction related to Australian nursing shift changes, Task 2 on information extraction in French corpora, and Task 3 on multilingual patient-centred information retrieval considering query variations. In total 20 teams took part in these tasks (3 in Task 1, 7 in Task 2 and 10 in Task 3). Herein, we describe the resources created for these tasks, evaluation methodology adopted and provide a brief summary of participants to this year’s challenges and some results obtained. As in previous years, the organizers have made data and tools associated with the lab tasks available for future research and development...|$|R
40|$|The very old, aged 80 {{years and}} over, {{is the fastest}} growing age group today, and the demands for {{healthcare}} and services will be even higher in the future. It is, therefore, of great importance to advance our knowledge about this group. The main purpose of this thesis was to describe living conditions and health, with a special focus on physical ability, falls and morale, in {{women and men in}} three different age groups of very old people in northern Sweden. Half the population aged 85, and the total population aged 90 and ≥ 95 (- 103) in the municipality of Umeå were selected for participation (n= 348) in this population-based cross-sectional study, entitled the Umeå 85 + Study. Structured interviews and assessments were performed with the participants in their homes, and data were also collected from <b>next-of-kins,</b> caregivers and medical charts. Cognition was screened for using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), depressive symptoms using the Geriatric Depression Scale- 15 (GDS- 15), and nutritional status using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were assessed using the Staircase of ADL (including the Katz Index of ADL) and morale using the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale (PGCMS). Participants also rated their own health and answered a questionnaire about symptoms. Physical ability was assessed using a gait speed test over 2. 4 meters (8 feet), three consecutive chair stands, and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). A follow-up study for falls was performed during a period of six months with fall calendars and telephone calls. The very old people in this northern population have more depression, hypertension and hip fractures, as well as a higher consumption of drugs than comparable, more southern populations. In general, younger participants had lower rates of diagnoses and prescribed drugs, were less dependent in ADL and other functional variables than older participants, and men had lower rates of diagnoses and reported symptoms than women. However, there were no age or sex differences in self-rated health or morale, which were both rated as good by the majority of the participants. There was a wide range of physical ability among these very old people, especially in women, where an age-related decline was seen. The results also demonstrate that men had greater physical ability than women. The BBS had no floor or ceiling effects in the present sample. In contrast, a large proportion was unable to perform the gait speed and chair stands test, resulting in a floor effect for the timed performances, especially in women. Falling is a major public health problem in very old people. From {{the results of the present}} study, it could be predicted that every seventh participant and every third of the people who did fall would suffer a fracture over a period of one year. The independent explanatory risk factors for time to first fall in this sample of very old people were dependency in personal (P-) ADL but not bedridden, thyroid disorders, treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and occurrence of fall/s in the preceding year. These factors should all be considered in fall prevention programmes. The morale of very old people was found in this study to be rather high, with similar scores among age groups and sexes. The most important factors for high morale were the absence of depressive symptoms, living in ordinary housing, having previously had a stroke and yet still living in ordinary housing, not feeling lonely and having few symptoms. The PGCMS seems applicable in the evaluation of morale in very old people. In conclusion, there were wide variations in health status and physical ability in this northern population of very old people. Women had poorer health and physical ability than men. Falls and fractures were common and serious health problems. Morale seemed to be high, despite the fact that a large proportion of the participants suffered from many diseases and functional decline...|$|R
5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many memorials were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France were typically opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the <b>next-of-kin</b> of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial each evening, for example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{evidence}} in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the accident and payments made by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an accident and each passenger's <b>next-of-kin</b> are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was written {{off after the}} accident. Immediately after the accident, Widerøe paid a compensation of NOK10,000 {{to each of the}} survivors. The survivors and the deceased's <b>next-of-kin</b> claimed damages for several million NOK, including three people who each demanded over one million after becoming disabled. The demands were raised against the insurance company Norsk Flyforsikringspool. After mediation, the airline agreed to compensate the passengers with an additional NOK15,000 in cash and NOK30,000 worth of free travel with Widerøe.|$|E
5|$|The West Virginia Legislature {{has passed}} a series of laws in the West Virginia Code {{governing}} the usage of the West Virginia state flag. The state flag is not permitted to be placed above, or if on the same level, {{to the right of}} the United States flag. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the <b>next-of-kin.</b>|$|E

25|$|Under {{the rules}} for {{distribution}} of estates without a will (the Intestacy Rules), where a child under 18 would inherit or a life interest would arise, the Court or District Probate Registry would normally appoint {{a minimum of two}} administrators.

25|$|Unlike most awards, the RASB is not {{issued to}} {{deceased}} members or the <b>next-of-kin,</b> as the badge represents a {{return from the}} member's warlike service. The replacing of the AASM with the Operational Service Medal was announced in May 2012; the RASB has been retired with the AASM, with the Operational Service Badge filling the role of being a badge indicative of a members' warlike service.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the award}} of the medal {{had to be}} applied for, it was not awarded posthumously. The <b>next-of-kin</b> of members {{who had been killed}} in action or who had died while on service {{therefore}} received no medal. The published medal roll shows that 5,252 medals were awarded to 5,156 individuals, which included 96 duplicate or triplicate awards. Nearly half of the awards, to 2,422 individuals, were for the Bechuanaland campaign.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} medal, the <b>next-of-kin</b> {{of those men}} and women who lost their lives as a result of enemy action, were {{presented}} with a memorial plaque and memorial scroll, both inscribed with the deceased's full name, and a condolence slip signed by King George V.

25|$|Under {{the name}} Frank Hall, Gooding joined the Army Service Corps on 15 April 1891, citing his {{maternal}} grandmother, Annie Furzeland, as his <b>next-of-kin.</b> He attained {{the rank of}} Lance-Corporal in 1894, but was dismissed two years later for the theft of money whilst working as an army clerk in Aldershot. He was given twelve months hard labour in 1896 and eighteen months in 1897 for a charge of fraudulently claiming funeral expenses from the non-existent life-insurance of his living wife.|$|E
25|$|The IACHR began {{processing}} the complaint, received a partial {{recognition of the}} state's institutional responsibility from democratically elected president Alfonso Portillo {{in the first year}} of his term, and finally referred the case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for judgement and settlement. In 2004, the Inter-American Court issued two judgements, in which it established Guatemala's liability in the case and ordered an extensive package of monetary, non-monetary and symbolic forms of compensation for the survivors and the <b>next-of-kin</b> of the deceased.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} (for instance, Spain, Finland, Poland, Wales, Portugal, and France), everyone is automatically an organ donor after diagnosis of death on legally accepted criteria, although some jurisdictions (such as Singapore, Spain, Wales, France, Czech Republic and Portugal) allow opting {{out of the}} system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or <b>next-of-kin</b> may be required for organ donation. In New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom (excluding Wales) and most states in the United States, drivers are asked upon application {{if they wish to}} be registered as an organ donor.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 2008, The Code Talkers Recognition Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-420), {{was signed}} into law by President George W.

The medal was also awarded, with the same criteria, to members of the Women's Royal Naval Service, to members of Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service and Royal Naval Nursing Service Reserve, and to a number of non-Naval personnel who served on Royal Navy ships, such as canteen and medical staff.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 2004 the New Zealand Parliament {{passed the}} Civil Union Bill, {{establishing}} civil unions for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. The debate over Civil Unions was highly divisive in New Zealand, inspiring great public emotion both {{for and against}} the passing. A companion bill, the Relationships (Statutory References) Bill was passed shortly thereafter to remove discriminatory provisions {{on the basis of}} relationship status from a range of statutes and regulations. As a result of these bills, all couples in New Zealand, whether married, in a civil union, or in a de facto partnership, now generally enjoy the same rights and undertake the same obligations. These rights extend to immigration, <b>next-of-kin</b> status, social welfare, matrimonial property and other areas.|$|E
25|$|Most organ {{donation}} for organ transplantation {{is done in}} the setting of brain death. However, in Japan this is a fraught point, and prospective donors may designate either brain death or cardiac death – see organ transplantation in Japan. In some nations (for instance, Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Spain and France) everyone is automatically an organ donor, although some jurisdictions (such as Singapore, Portugal, Poland, New Zealand, or Netherlands) allow opting out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or <b>next-of-kin</b> is required for {{organ donation}}. The non-living donor is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If a brain-dead individual is not an organ donor, ventilator and drug support is discontinued and cardiac death is allowed to occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} of Lower Germany, A. Vitellius, was soon proclaimed emperor by his troops, and in Rome, the Praetorian Guard proclaimed M. Salvius Otho emperor. In January 69, Galba was assassinated, {{and the senate}} proclaimed Otho emperor. Otho took an army to Germany to defeat Vitellius, but was himself defeated by Vitellius. He committed suicide, and Vitellius was proclaimed emperor by the senate. Another general, Vespasian, soon defeated Vitellius. Vitellius was executed, and Vespasian was named Augustus, elected Consul, and given Tribunician powers. The result of these events illustrated a key weakness in Augustus' constitution. The method of succession was in part based on heredity, and if a dead emperor's <b>next-of-kin</b> {{had the support of}} the Praetorian Guard, then his installation as emperor was reasonably assured. However, with Nero's death, the Julian line had been extinguished. Thus, the events of 69 showed that the armies in the provinces were the ultimate 'electoral bodies', and that any successful general could legitimately claim a right to the throne. It also became apparent that, while the senate might acquiesce to the installation of a new emperor, such acquiescence was simply a matter of form. This flaw would contribute to the ultimate fall of the Roman Empire.|$|E
500|$|Eventually {{credited}} with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No.3 Squadron's highest-scoring member. He flew {{a total of}} eighty-four combat sorties, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16June 1942 alone. His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings [...] "could be offset by unbridled aggression", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and [...] "overcome much better opponents by simply going for them". Bobby Gibbes became No.3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander. Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1April, Barr was raised to acting squadron leader and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken ankle. Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role. As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his adjutant but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the <b>next-of-kin</b> of casualties himself.|$|E
500|$|Trial by {{battle was}} a {{procedure}} {{which had been}} brought to Britain by the Normans; it was not present in Saxon law. It was authorized in [...] "appeals of murder", that is, retrials by private prosecution following an acquittal for murder. If the plaintiff (in an appeal of murder, the <b>next-of-kin</b> of the deceased) requested such a retrial, the defendant could respond with the [...] "wager of battle", that is, requiring the plaintiff to settle the matter by combat, with the outcome to be ordained by God. Such an appeal, and such an offer of battle could also take place following an acquittal for treason or another felony. Appeals of murder were uncommon, had to be brought within a year and a day of the death, and were generally tried by jury. In 1815, three years before Ashford v Thornton, an appeal of murder was brought in Dublin in O'Reilly v Clancy, and the defendant demanded the wager of battle.
