In the case of Australia, one of the world’s largest foreign borrower economies for its size, empirical estimation yields the novel result that Australia’s consolidated budget imbalance and its foreign borrowing were approximately twinned on the basis of quarterly data for 1983 – 2009, when Australia’s exchange rate floated and international capital mobility was high.

40|$|Trend and {{cyclical}} {{patterns of}} household, business, government, and foreign <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> shares {{of gross domestic}} product are reviewed using diagrams and covariance decompositions of the identity stating that the sum of the shares equals zero. Household and business <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> shares and thereby those sectors' contributions to effective demand are procyclical. Household borrowing over the cycle is led by residential investment. Consumption varies countercyclically, but it is offset by rising taxes as opposed to saving, suggesting that "consumption smoothing" by households as featured in much macro theory is not empirically important. Procyclicality of private <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> is countered by a countercyclical government deficit along traditional lines. In terms of trends, "twin" fiscal and foreign deficits appear infrequently, with the household and external deficits being much more closely related. The former is linked to a strong upward trend in health-care spending as a share of disposable income, with a corresponding downward trend in saving after the early 1980 s. consumption smoothing, <b>net</b> <b>borrowing,</b> twin deficits,...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the fiscal}} {{federalism}} literature sub-central budget constraints become softer when {{local governments are}} more dependent on revenues over which they have no discretion. As a consequence of higher "transfer dependency", sub-central governments can expect to be bailed out by the central government and therefore tend to accumulate higher levels of debt. We test this conjecture with data from Austrian municipalities. Austria is a fiscally highly centralised federation in which tax autonomy at the sub-central level is almost absent. Our identification strategy {{is based on a}} discontinuity caused by a special regulation on population weights in the tax sharing agreement between central government and the municipalities. We analyse the discontinuity in the conditional expectation of borrowing given population size to unveil an average causal effect of the treatment. Our results indicate that in line with theoretical expectations municipalities with higher revenue dependency observe higher <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> per capita. We also find that almost one half of the observed discontinuity works through an investment channel. <b>Net</b> <b>borrowing</b> is spatially correlated...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} about the growth and {{development}} performance of non-industrialized regions {{in the latter part}} of the 20 th century. We find that sustained per capita GDP growth was accompanied by structural change in terms of output and labor share shifts as well as productivity growth with (in some cases) strong reallocation effects due to movements of labor from low to high productivity sectors. Regions that did not enjoy per capita growth showed little structural evolution apart from a rising employment/population ratio in service sectors. On the demand side, we examine shifts in <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> by the private sector, government, and rest of the world. Mutually offsetting co-movements of government and foreign <b>net</b> <b>borrowing</b> occurred sporadically at most. In other words, the widely accepted “twin deficits” view of macro adjustment does not seem to apply. Macroeconomic flexibility, on the other hand, may be very important. The policy background for these findings is sketched out along with a critique of justifications provided by the World Bank. Proposals are advanced for policy changes. ...|$|E

While money and credit follow similar long run trends, the short and medium term relation between money and credit overhang is weak, throwing doubt on the hypothesis that money creating potential drives credit booms. Especially in current account deficit countries, we observe a sizable build-up of credit overhang prior to 2008.
