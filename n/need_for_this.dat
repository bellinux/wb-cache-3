5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is rare.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

25|$|The text of {{the apology}} did not refer to {{compensation}} to Aboriginal people as a whole, nor {{to members of the}} Stolen Generations specifically. Rudd followed the apology with a 20-minute speech to the house about the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> action. The government's apology and his speech were widely applauded among both Indigenous Australians and the non-indigenous general public.|$|E

The back office acts mainly as a record of transactions that have been completed between cards and readers. This provides a high degree of resilience.|$|E
25|$|The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{definition}} of Gibraltarian {{was rooted in}} the epidemic of 1804, where control of population density {{was seen as a}} major consideration. Epidemic disease, in the 1804 case, yellow fever, put the military population at risk, and by extension Britain's ability to control the area. It was feared that civilian population had to be controlled to prevent pestilence. It is estimated that three fifths of the population was wiped out by the 1804 epidemic.|$|E

25|$|Mosquito {{mouthparts}} {{are very}} specialized, {{particularly those of}} the females, which in most species are adapted to piercing skin and then sucking blood. Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy they <b>need.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this,</b> their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require {{the same degree of}} specialization as those of females.|$|E
25|$|A {{floating}} toilet {{is essentially}} a toilet on a platform built above or floating on the water. Instead of excreta going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To {{reduce the amount of}} excreta that needs to hauled to shore, many use urine diversion. The floating toilet was developed for residents without quick access to land or connection to a sewer systems. It is also used in areas subjected to prolonged flooding. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of toilet is high in areas like Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{approaches}} to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend {{the range of}} basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, formal schemes, ind-schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks and so on. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead {{to some of the}} further extensions.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as being}} aware of {{cryptographic}} history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential effects of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography; the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> preemptive caution rather more than merely speculative.|$|E
25|$|Some organisations {{provide a}} Melway year of {{publication}} {{in addition to their}} map reference (e.g., (2006) 70 F6), to avoid confusion if map references change in newer versions of the directory. However Melway have kept the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> to an absolute minimum over the years and have held off several cartographic features, including a more logical overall tiling of pages across the entire metropolitan area (which do appear in the Sydway and Brisway) {{in order to protect the}} integrity and continuity of the original 1966 grid references.|$|E
25|$|When Alex George {{published}} his revision of Dryandra in 1996, he recognised that D.bipinatifida possessed {{a number of}} very distinctive characters, especially in its fruiting structure. These include unusually large follicles and seeds; seeds that are set within the seed wings rather than along the base or one side; and unusual double wings that are attached to each side of the seed. In addition, the species has extremely long involucral bracts, and floral bracts that enlarge more than any other species. Recognising the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> species to be placed in its own subgenus, George resurrected Diplophragma, promoting it to subgenus rank as D.subg. Diplophragma.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} the {{mean free path}} of the electron gas interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the mean free path. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{there came}} into being {{the idea of a}} select corps of teenaged youths, who would devote some of their spare time to prepare for the day when they would take their places in the ranks of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In 1940, Air Minister Power, who was very much aware of the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of Air Cadet training, called in a group of {{influential}} civilians and asked them to set up a national voluntary organization to sponsor and develop this movement. The response was immediate, and a civilian organization was soon created to work on a partnership basis with the RCAF. As it later developed, this partnership was to be the main reason for the striking success of the Air Cadet Movement in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} {{colonization}} of America, the Northwest Passage {{had always been}} of special interest since it was speculated that it could offer a shortcut to Asia. Many attempts at crossing were made but very few succeeded due to the very unforgiving conditions that prevail in the Canadian Arctic {{for most of the}} year. The British explorer Sir John Franklin actually found a passage between 1845 and 1847 but this achievement was not known until years later as he and his crew had perished on the journey. Robert McClure was the first explorer to survive the expedition in 1850 but he completed the journey on a sled. It is only in 1906 that the passage was navigated entirely on water by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. However, construction of the Panama Canal had already begun at that time and its completion in 1914 lessened the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> route.|$|E
