5|$|Water {{was taken}} at first {{from the town}} well {{opposite}} St Giles Church, but the excessive demand diminished the supply and spoiled its quality. The tunnellers' water was then pumped from a site near the Dyneley Arms crossroads. At {{the same time the}} tunnel was draining away the local farmers' <b>natural</b> <b>water</b> supply and the source of Bramhope town well. Litigation on this subject continued for some years. To mitigate the situation, a public waterworks scheme with a reservoir and an aqueduct was proposed but not implemented.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of <b>natural</b> <b>water</b> bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
40|$|Isotope {{techniques}} have found increasingly wide {{scope of application}} to the environmental geochemistry of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> since 1960. The stable isotope ratio of hydrogen (D/H) varies in <b>natural</b> <b>waters,</b> as dose that of oxygen (18 O/ 16 O), due to isotopic separation during evaporation and condensation processes in the hydrologic cycle. The concentration of radioactive hydrogen isotope (tritium) in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> increased sharply following the atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs during the 1950 s and 1960 s. Thermonuclear tritium remaining in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> is a good indicator of {{the presence or absence}} of recent recharge and water age (residence time). Since deuterium, tritium and oxygen- 18 are constituents of water molecules (HDO, HTO and H 218 O) they serve as unique tracers in environmental geochemistry of <b>natural</b> <b>waters.</b> This paper presents measurement scales and units, techniques, behavior of isotopes within the hydrologic and the application of isotope techniques to the environment in Japan...|$|R

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the <b>natural</b> <b>water</b> runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of efforts to control water {{resources}} in Florida and projects to drain the Everglades during the early and mid-20th century, water flow into Biscayne Bay has been altered by the construction of canals. These canals channel water from portions of the southeastern Everglades now used for agriculture into the bay. Prior to canal construction, most fresh water inflow came from rain and groundwater, but the canals are now altering the salinity profile of the bay, conveying sediment and pollutants and leading to saltwater intrusion into the Biscayne aquifer. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was established in 2000 to mitigate the effects of human intervention into the <b>natural</b> <b>water</b> flow of the Everglades. Primarily aimed at the restoration of historical patterns of water flow into Everglades National Park, the project will also deal with issues arising from the diversion of {{water out of the}} southern Everglades into Biscayne Bay. The Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project (BBCW) is a CERP component specifically intended to redistribute water flow so that fresh water is introduced gradually through creeks and marshes rather than short, heavy discharges through drainage canals.|$|E

From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} the physico-chemical characteristics of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> in a drainage {{system of the}} Jungar Basin, northwestern China to identify chemical evolution and recharge mechanisms of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> in an arid environment.

We aimed to determine whether constructed lakes have lower zooplankton species richness or differ in species composition relative to <b>natural</b> <b>waters,</b> which might {{allow them to be}} invaded more readily. Location North Island, New Zealand. Methods Sediment cores were collected from 23 natural and 23 constructed lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Zooplankton diapausing eggs were hatched from sediments to assess species composition and richness. Results Average species richness between <b>natural</b> and constructed <b>water</b> bodies was not significantly different. Stepwise linear regression indicated latitude and maximum depth were significant predictors of species richness in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> (P = 0. 002 and 0. 016, respectively). No significant predictors were elucidated for constructed <b>waters.</b> Species in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> consisted mainly of planktonic species, while assemblages in constructed waters were more varied, comprising of more littoral and benthic species, and included many species recorded from only single water bodies. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that trophic state explained the greatest proportion of variation in species composition of <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> (P = 0. 002). Distance to nearest water body and number of water bodies within a 20 km radius (i. e. opportunity) explained the greatest proportion in constructed waters (P = 0. 040 and 0. 038, respectively). Main conclusions <b>Natural</b> and constructed <b>waters</b> had similar species richness per water body, but community composition varied between them. The core group of species found in <b>natural</b> <b>waters</b> are better adapted to pelagic conditions, and may therefore be better at reducing establishment rates of new arrivals than assemblages in constructed water bodies, which had more varied assemblages. Our study suggests that manipulating new water bodies, so that they develop mature communities faster, may reduce establishment rates of non-indigenous species...|$|R
