50|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>practice</b> {{is based}} on {{statistical}} theory which is, itself, founded {{on the concept of}} randomness. Many elements of <b>statistical</b> <b>practice</b> depend on randomness via random numbers. Where those random numbers fail to be actually random, any subsequent statistical analysis may suffer from systematic bias. Elements of <b>statistical</b> <b>practice</b> that depend on randomness include: choosing a representative sample of the population being examined, disguising the protocol of a study from a participant (see randomized controlled trial) and Monte Carlo simulation.|$|R

40|$|<b>National</b> <b>statistical</b> {{systems are}} the {{enterprises}} tasked with collecting, validating and reporting societal attributes. These data serve many purposes - they allow governments to improve services, economic actors to traverse markets, and academics to assess social theories. <b>National</b> <b>statistical</b> systems vary in quality, especially in developing countries. This study examines determinants of <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> capacity in developing countries, {{focusing on the}} impact of general purpose technologies (GPTs). Just as technological progress helps to explain differences in economic growth, states with markets with greater technological attainment (specifically, general purpose technologies) arguably have greater capacity for gathering and processing quality data. Analysis using panel methods shows a strong, statistically significant positive linear relationship between GPTs and <b>national</b> <b>statistical</b> capacity. There is no evidence to support a non-linear function in this relationship. Which is to say, there {{does not appear to be}} a marginal depreciating <b>National</b> <b>Statistical</b> Capacity benefit associated with increases in GPTs.
