Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> players. Prior to the draft, he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E
5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, night fell on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> small craft survived the passage.|$|E

25|$|Teacher {{dissatisfaction with}} {{representation}} {{by the three}} Trinidad unions had grown in the 1970s. There was the view that adversarial relations between the three units had severely hampered Industrial Relations in the Teaching Service. As early as 1966 there was a struggle {{between two of the}} three unions to be the sole representative for any class of, or classes of teachers. The Special Tribunal No. 10 of 1974, which stated that any one of the three unions could represent any class or classes of teachers decided this issue. This resulted in rapid changes of membership among teachers. However, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> unions emerged as the majority union.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, Earle was {{a member}} of a similar MCC tour in 1929-30, this time to New Zealand, with matches played on the journey in both Sri Lanka and Australia. This tour coincided with a similar MCC tour to the West Indies and on both tours the {{representative}} matches were judged to be Test matches, though several regular England players sat out both tours and other players received their only Test caps by playing in the matches on the twin tours. Earle was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> players: in seven first-class matches in Australia and New Zealand, he failed to pass 50 in any innings and he was not picked for any of the four matches against New Zealand. In one of the matches in Australia on the way to New Zealand, Earle hit Australian spin bowler Clarrie Grimmett for 22 runs in an over, with three sixes; in New Zealand, he scored 98 in 40 minutes in a minor match against Taranaki.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{although}} there are several dark powers in Earthsea (like the dragon, and the stone of Terrenon) the true evil was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> powers, or even death, but Ged's actions that went against the balance of nature. Although evil {{is present in the}} books, it is a non-Christian understanding of evil: evil is a [...] "misunderstanding of the dynamics of life". This is contrary to conventional Western storytelling, in which light and darkness are often considered opposites, and are seen as symbolizing good and evil, which are constantly in conflict. On two different occasions, Ged is tempted to try to defy death and evil, but eventually learns that neither can be eliminated: instead, he chooses not to serve evil, and stops denying death.|$|E

In 1994, after Chng Suan Sze was decided, the Application of English Law Act was enacted with the effect that only English statutes specified in the First Schedule of the Act continued to apply in Singapore after 12 November 1993.

500|$|When Elizabeth I became queen, {{she ordered}} {{a survey of}} her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles {{in the north of}} her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these.</b> A further survey in 1576 {{reported}} that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was full of holes, one kitchen {{was on the verge of}} collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth £1,000, and could be repaired for £100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed [...] "imperfect at every corner". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard [...] "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.|$|E

2500|$|Euclidean {{geometry}} can be axiomatically {{described in}} several ways. Unfortunately, Euclid's original system of five postulates (axioms) is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> as his proofs relied on several unstated assumptions which {{should also have}} been taken as axioms. Hilbert's system consisting of 20 axioms most closely follows the approach of Euclid and provides the justification for all of Euclid's proofs. Other systems, using different sets of undefined terms obtain the same geometry by different paths. In all approaches, however, there is an axiom which is logically equivalent to Euclid's fifth postulate, the parallel postulate. Hilbert uses the Playfair axiom form, while Birkhoff, for instance, uses the axiom which says that [...] "there exists a pair of similar but not congruent triangles." [...] In any of these systems, removal of the one axiom which {{is equivalent to the}} parallel postulate, in whatever form it takes, and leaving all the other axioms intact, produces absolute geometry. As the first 28 propositions of Euclid (in The Elements) do not require the use of the parallel postulate or anything equivalent to it, they are all true statements in absolute geometry.|$|E
