Cassatt immediately began a major capital improvement program, which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York Penn Station.

Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the <b>next</b> <b>January,</b> when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E

500|$|Arnada began {{plans to}} {{establish}} Playboy Indonesia, an Indonesian {{version of the}} American men's magazine Playboy, as a challenge. He considered the magazine more than [...] "pornography", describing it as home to [...] "edgy and award-winning journalism pieces" [...] which he wanted to bring to Indonesia. Arnada entered discussions with Christie Hefner, then head of Playboy Enterprises, in November 2005. He received permission to publish an Indonesian edition the <b>next</b> <b>January.</b> The first issue was launched in April 2006 and did not feature any nudity or focus on sexuality.

[...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] you just do whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{modalities}} of how electoral {{registration is}} conducted can also affect turnout. For example, until [...] "rolling registration" [...] {{was introduced in}} the United Kingdom, there was no possibility of the electoral register being updated during its currency, or even amending genuine mistakes after a certain cut off date. The register was compiled in October, and would come into force the next February, and would remain valid until the <b>next</b> <b>January.</b> The electoral register would become progressively more out of date during its period of validity, as electors moved or died (also people studying or working away from home often had difficulty voting). This meant that elections taking place later in the year tended to have lower turnouts than those earlier in the year. The introduction of rolling registration where the register is updated monthly has reduced but not entirely eliminated this issue since the process of amending the register is not automatic, and some individuals do not join the electoral register until the annual October compilation process.|$|E
2500|$|The game's {{publication}} {{took place}} in Spencer, Indiana, and upon its release was shipped to retail chains such as Fry's Electronics, Egghead Software and CompUSA. The design of the game cover closely mimicked that of the Windows 95 packaging. During development, Parroty Interactive had planned to promote the game at the COMDEX computer expo by Fall in 1997. The presentation was to include a Bill Gates lookalike. However the staff were expelled by security from the convention and the distribution plan was shut down. Despite this setback, the company presented their product at the Macworld expo in Silicon Valley, San Francisco <b>next</b> <b>January,</b> receiving praise from Macintosh users. At the event they demoed the CEO-themed Tamagotchi spoof [...] "Billagotchi", and [...] "Windows Exploder" [...] game where players blows away error messages. CD copies of the game were sold in a booth for $20 each. Microsoft also debuted some new products at Macworld such as Office 98 and Internet Explorer 4.0. While noting that he was yet to examine the Palladium Interactive title, Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray commented that [...] "ours are probably a little more serious" [...] than Microshaft Winblows 98, and that the corporation [...] "tr {{to have a sense}} of humor about this sort of thing".|$|E
2500|$|In 1809, the Grand Lodge of England (the Moderns) {{set up a}} [...] "Lodge of Promulgation". Its {{purpose was}} to [...] "revert to the Ancient Land Marks of the Society" [...] and to {{promulgate}} those landmarks amongst the brethren. One of its members was the Duke of Sussex, the Master of the Lodge of Antiquity, No 2, and sixth son of George III. The result of their labours was a reply to the Ancients in 1811 that the Grand Lodge had resolved to [...] "return to the Ancient Landmarks...when it should be ascertained what those ancient landmarks and obligations were." [...] Both Grand Lodges moved visibly towards union, forming committees to negotiate the precise terms. The main sticking point was {{the inability of the}} Ancients' committee to decide anything without reporting back to a quarterly meeting of their own Grand Lodge. In October 1812, the Ancients allayed the frustration of the Moderns by granting their commissioners full powers. Shortly after this, the Earl of Moira resigned as acting Grand Master of the Moderns, due to his appointment as Governor General of India. His successor was the Duke of Sussex, who became Grand Master the <b>next</b> <b>January</b> on the resignation of his brother, the Prince of Wales. On 1 December 1813, the Duke of Atholl ceded the leadership of the Ancients to the Duke of Kent, the older brother of Sussex and the father of Queen Victoria. Kent had already presided over the union of the Ancients and Moderns in Canada, accomplished by the brutally simple expedient of merging the lodges of the Moderns with the nearest lodge of the Ancients. The Moderns in Canada had simply ceased to exist. These two men oversaw the union in 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge of England, with the Duke of Sussex appointed as Grand Master of the new body.|$|E
