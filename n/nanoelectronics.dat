5|$|Richard E. Smalley, {{a chemist}} at Rice University, {{was best known}} as a co-discoverer of the C60 form of carbon known as buckminsterfullerine in 1985, along with Harry Kroto, Robert Curl, James Heath, and Sean O'Brien. Buckminsterfullerene was the first to be {{discovered}} of the class of molecules known as fullerenes, which also includes carbon nanotubes. The study and application of fullerenes forms {{a significant part of the}} fields of nanomaterials and <b>nanoelectronics,</b> and Smalley, Kroto, and Curl were awarded the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery.|$|E
25|$|Areas {{of physics}} such as <b>nanoelectronics,</b> nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved {{during the last}} few decades to provide a basic {{scientific}} foundation of nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|Interface and colloid {{science has}} given rise to many {{materials}} which may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods. Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related also to nanoionics and <b>nanoelectronics.</b>|$|E
25|$|David P. DiVincenzo is a {{theoretical}} physicist. He {{is the director}} of the Institute of Theoretical <b>Nanoelectronics</b> at the Peter Grünberg Institute in Jülich and Professor at the Institute for Quantum Information at RWTH Aachen University. With Daniel Loss (at the University of Basel), he proposed the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum computer in 1997, which would use electron spins in quantum dots as qubits.|$|E
25|$|One of Zisapel’s {{charitable}} contributions is to donate fully equipped computer rooms to educational institutions that serve {{children at risk}} and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. More than ten such projects are undertaken each year by RAD {{at a cost of}} approximately $500,000 annually. Zohar and Yehuda Zisapel have also donated $4.5 million to establish the Sara and Moshe Zisapel <b>Nanoelectronics</b> Center at their alma mater, the Technion, named in memory of their parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century there has been renewed {{interest}} in vacuum tubes, this time with the electron emitter formed on a flat silicon substrate, as in integrated circuit technology. This subject is now called vacuum <b>nanoelectronics.</b> The most common design uses a cold cathode in the form of a large-area field electron source (for example a field emitter array). With these devices, electrons are field-emitted from a large number of closely spaced individual emission sites.|$|E
25|$|Microelectronics {{engineering}} {{deals with}} the design and microfabrication of very small electronic circuit components for use in an integrated circuit or sometimes for use on their own as a general electronic component. The most common microelectronic components are semiconductor transistors, although all main electronic components (resistors, capacitors etc.) can be created at a microscopic level. <b>Nanoelectronics</b> is the further scaling of devices down to nanometer levels. Modern devices {{are already in the}} nanometer regime, with below 100nm processing having been standard since about 2002.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{currently}} {{debate the}} future implications of nanotechnology. Nanotechnology {{may be able}} to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications, such as in nanomedicine, <b>nanoelectronics,</b> biomaterials energy production, and consumer products. On the other hand, nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios. These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.|$|E
25|$|Within physics, the Department of Theoretical Physics {{was set up}} by Bhabha, who {{conducted}} research in high energy physics and Condensed Matter Physics. The department worked on the major advances in this period such as gauge theories, string theory, renormalisation and superconductivity. The Department of Astrophysics works in areas like stellar binaries, gravitational waves and cosmology. TIFR is involved in building India's first gravity wave detector. The High Energy Physics Department, TIFR has been involved in major accelerator projects like the KEK, Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. TIFR also runs the Pelletron particle accelerator facility. Bhabha's motivation resulted in the development of an NMR spectrometer for solid state studies. The Department of Condensed Matter Physics and Material Sciences also conducts experimental research in high-temperature superconductivity, <b>nanoelectronics</b> and nanophotonics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of such applications is {{the mission of}} vacuum <b>nanoelectronics.</b> However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good [...] "vacuum robustness" [...] of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have.|$|E
2500|$|UT Austin {{operates}} {{several major}} auxiliary research centers. The world's third-largest telescope, the Hobby–Eberly Telescope, {{and three other}} large telescopes are part of UT Austin's McDonald Observatory, [...] west of Austin. [...] The university manages nearly [...] of biological field laboratories, including the Brackenridge Field Laboratory in Austin. The Center for Agile Technology focuses on software development challenges. The J.J. Pickle Research Campus (PRC) {{is home to the}} Texas Advanced Computing Center which operates the Ranger supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers [...] as well as the Microelectronics Research Center which houses micro- and <b>nanoelectronics</b> research and features a [...] cleanroom for device fabrication.|$|E
2500|$|The Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory (NSERL), a four-story, [...] {{research}} facility, {{was completed}} in December 2006 {{after two years of}} construction. Including ISO 7 cleanroom facilities, the $85 million building provides open floor plans that allows chemists, biologists, nanotechnologists, materials scientists and other specialists to conduct multidisciplinary research. The laboratory provides extensive wet lab, fabrication, instrumentation, and high performance computing facilities to foster biomedical engineering and nano-technology research. The <b>Nanoelectronics</b> Materials Laboratory, on the fourth floor, includes a system that allows researchers to deposit thin film materials one atomic layer at a time. In May 2011 a $3 million JEOL ARM200F scanning transmission electron microscope with an atomic resolution of 0.78 picometers, was added to the research laboratory, already home to two transmission electron microscopes.|$|E
