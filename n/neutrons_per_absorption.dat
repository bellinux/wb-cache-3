40|$|This report {{presents}} FY 13 {{activities for}} the analysis of D 2 O cooled tight-pitch High-Conversion PWRs (HCPWRs) with U-Pu and Th-U fueled cores aiming at break-even or near breeder conditions while retaining the negative void reactivity. The analyses are carried out from several aspects which could not be covered in FY 12 activities. SCALE 6. 1 code system is utilized, and a series of simple 3 D fuel pin-cell models are developed in order to perform Monte Carlo based criticality and burnup calculations. The performance of U-Pu fueled cores with axial and internal blankets is analyzed in terms of their impact on the relative fissile Pu mass balance, initial Pu enrichment, and void coefficient. In FY 12, Pu conversion performances of D 2 O-cooled HCPWRs fueled with MOX were evaluated with small sized axial/internal DU blankets (approximately 4 cm of axial length) in order to ensure the negative void reactivity, which evidently limits the conversion performance of HCPWRs. In this fiscal year report, the axial sizes of DU blankets are extended up to 30 cm in order to evaluate the amount of DU necessary to reach break-even and/or breeding conditions. Several attempts are made in order to attain the milestone of the HCPWR designs (i. e., break-even condition and negative void reactivity) by modeling of HCPWRs under different conditions such as boiling of D 2 O coolant, MOX with different 235 U enrichment, and different target burnups. A similar set of analyses are performed for Th-U fueled cores. Several promising characteristics of 233 U over other fissile like 239 Pu and 235 U, most notably its higher fission <b>neutrons</b> <b>per</b> <b>absorption</b> in thermal and epithermal ranges combined with lower ___ in the fast range than 239 Pu allows Th-U cores to be taller than MOX ones. Such an advantage results in 4 % higher relative fissile mass balance than that of U-Pu fueled cores while retaining the negative void reactivity until the target burnup of 51 GWd/t. Several other distinctions between U-Pu and Th-U fueled cores are identified by evaluating the sensitivity coefficients of keff, mass balance, and void coefficient. The effect of advanced iron alloy cladding (i. e., FeCrAl) on the performance of Pu conversion in MOX fueled cores is studied instead of using standard stainless-steel cladding. Variations in clad thickness and coolant-to-fuel volume ratio are also exercised. The use of FeCrAl instead of SS as a cladding alloy reduces the required Pu enrichment and improves the Pu conversion rate primarily due to the absence of nickel in the cladding alloy that results in the reduction of the neutron absorption. Also the difference in void coefficients between SS and FeCrAl alloys is nearly 500 pcm over the entire burnup range. The report also shows sensitivity and uncertainty analyses in order to characterize D 2 O cooled HCPWRs from different aspects. The uncertainties of integral parameters (keff and void coefficient) for selected reactor cores are evaluated at different burnup points in order to find similarities and trends respect to D 2 O-HCPWR...|$|E

50|$|Neutron flux in {{asymptotic}} giant branch {{stars and}} in supernovae {{is responsible for}} most of the natural nucleosynthesis producing elements heavier than iron. In stars there is a relatively low neutron flux on the order of 105 to 1011 <b>neutrons</b> <b>per</b> cm2 per second, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the s-process (slow-neutron-capture-process). By contrast, after a core-collapse supernova, there is an extremely high neutron flux, on the order of 1022 <b>neutrons</b> <b>per</b> cm2 per second, resulting in nucleosynthesis by the r-process (rapid-neutron-capture-process).|$|R
50|$|For most applications, {{a higher}} neutron flux is better (since {{it reduces the}} time {{required}} to conduct the experiment, acquire the image, etc.).

2500|$|Most of {{the natural}} neutron {{background}} {{is a product of}} cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere. The neutron energy peaks at around 1MeV and rapidly drops above.

The flux is dependent on geomagnetic latitude, with a maximum near the magnetic poles.
