5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of <b>normal</b> <b>people</b> have these small aspirations during sleep. While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E

40|$|Background: Anxiety {{symptoms}} and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among elderly people, although infrequently {{the subject of}} systematic research in this age group. One important limitation {{is the lack of}} a widely accepted instrument to measure dimensional anxiety in both <b>normal</b> old <b>people</b> and old people with mental health problems seen in various settings. Accordingly, we developed and tested of a short scale to measure anxiety in older people. Methods:We generated a large number of potential items de novo and by reference to existing anxiety scales, and then reduced the number of items to 60 through consultation with a reference group consisting of psychologists, psychiatrists and <b>normal</b> elderly <b>people.</b> We then tested the psychometric properties of these 60 items in 452 <b>normal</b> old <b>people</b> and 46 patients attending a psychogeriatric service.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} if normal, overweight, and obese people experience different amounts of hunger before eating and satiety after eating. Our hypothesis is there are higher sensations of satiety, and lower sensations of hunger among Normal Weight than Overweight and Obese people. The study compared hunger and satiety levels before and after eating amongst normal, overweight, and obese Body Mass Index (BMI) categories using a Labeled Magnitude Scale (LMS). Forty-five subjects (29 normal, 13 overweight, and 3 obese) rated thirty phrases using LMS hunger and satiety scales. The scale was 100 mm in length having the intensity descriptors of hunger and fullness as follows: strongest imaginable sensation, extremely, very, moderately, slightly, barely detectable, no sensation. Because there were so few obese people, I grouped the overweight and obese answers to compare with the normal weight answers. The results for the first ten survey questions, which were situational hunger and fullness questions, typically showed overweight and obese people being hungrier than <b>normal</b> weight <b>people,</b> for example “how hungry/full do you feel after not have eaten for 24 hours. ” Overweight and obese people were fuller than <b>normal</b> weight <b>people</b> when the scenarios were more geared towards fullness, for example, “after a complete Thanksgiving dinner. ” The last twenty survey questions were specific food questions that displayed the overweight and obese people less hungry after eating the item in comparison to <b>normal</b> weight <b>people.</b> In addition, the averages of the overweight and obese people for the specific food questions presented the overweight and obese people being fuller than <b>normal</b> weight <b>people</b> after eating the various foods asked in the survey.
