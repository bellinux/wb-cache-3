The TE refrigeration {{is the most}} well-developed, applicable and competitive technology. Three eco-friendly refrigeration systems are increasingly getting attention, especially in a day with increasingly energy and environmental crises. In summary, thermoelectric refrigeration possesses the following superiorities: a longer developmental period, more perfect techniques, increasing applications, a larger range of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>capacity,</b> and a better economic property in small <b>refrigerating</b> <b>capacity.</b> Thermoelectric refrigeration cannot be replaced in special fields, and its applications have received more and more attention in recovering waste heat. Magnetic refrigeration has been widely applied in lower temperature regions; its application in middle temperature regions is juvenile. In particular, there is no application of this technique in high temperature regions. Adsorption refrigeration is practical only in near room temperatures.
