40|$|The NKS B-programme EcoDoses project {{started in}} 2003 as a {{collaboration}} between all the Nordic countries. The aim of the project {{is to improve the}} radiological assessments of doses to man from terrestrial ecosystems. The first part, conducted in 2003, has focussed on an extensive collation and review of both published and unpublished data from all the Nordic countries for the <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> period and the post-Chernobyl period. This included data on radionuclides in air filters, precipitation, soil samples, milk and reindeer. Based on this, an improved model for estimating radioactive fallout based on precipitation data during the <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> period has been developed. Effective ecological half- lives for 137 Cs and 90 Sr in milk have been calculated for the <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> period. For reindeer the ecological half- lives for 137 Cs have been calculated for both the <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> period and the post-Chernobyl period. The data were also used to compare modelling results with observed concentrations. This was done at a workshop where the radioecological food-and-dose module in the ARGOS decision support system was used to predict transfer of deposited radionuclides to foodstuffs and subsequent radiation doses to man. The work conducted the first year is presented in this report and gives interesting, new results relevant for terrestrial radioecology.

500|$|The complex was {{equipped}} with facilities such as restaurants, clinics, schools, theaters, factories, a roller skating rink, grain and oil warehouses, and a mushroom cultivation farm. There were also almost 70 potential sites where water wells could easily be dug if needed. Elaborate ventilation systems were installed, with 2300 shafts that can be sealed off to protect the tunnels' inhabitants from poison gases, Gas- and water-proof hatches, as well as thick concrete main gates, were constructed to protect the tunnels from biochemical attacks and <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallouts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The r-process also {{occurs to}} a minor extent in {{thermonuclear}} weapon explosions. This led to the historical discovery of the elements einsteinium (element 99) and fermium (element 100) in <b>nuclear</b> weapon <b>fallout.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} formally {{requested a}} permanent test facility on 30 October 1953. Due to concerns about <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> {{from the previous}} tests at Emu Field and the site's inadequate infrastructure and water supply, the recently surveyed Maralinga site was selected for this purpose. The new site was announced in May 1955. It was developed as a joint, co-funded facility between the British and Australian governments.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E

5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout.</b> A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is the {{chemical}} element with symbolSr and atomic number38. An alkaline earth metal, strontium is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element {{that is highly}} reactive chemically. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has {{physical and chemical properties}} similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally in the minerals celestine, strontianite, and putnisite, and is mined mostly from the first two of these. While natural strontium is stable, the synthetic 90Sr isotope is radioactive {{and is one of the}} most dangerous components of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout,</b> as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Warren {{became the}} first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although {{controversial}} and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out {{about the dangers of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion leading up to the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine.|$|E

From this data {{it is possible to}} calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to fission products in bomb fallout).|$|R
30|$|Various radiometric {{methods such as}} {{gas flow}} GM (Geiger–Müller) {{counting}} and liquid scintillation counting are usually used for direct measurement of 90 Sr and its daughter 90 Y subsequently. Ultra low-level liquid scintillation counting (LSC) can be successfully utilized for counting alpha and beta activity derived from alpha, beta emitters to monitor the natural radioactivity, contamination related to <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallouts,</b> contaminants branched from nuclear power stations or fuel reprocessing plants. Reduced equipment requirements and relative readiness of radiochemical procedures make LSC an attractive technique which can be applied also by laboratories lacking specific radiochemistry facilities and experience. The determination of radiostrontium by this technique {{is based on the}} high counting efficiency for high-energy β-particles in aqueous solutions [37]. To evaluate the removal of radioactive 90 Sr, the adsorption behavior of CuO NPs/Ag-clinoptilolite zeolite composite was assessed and those progresses were monitored by LSC instrument. The effects of several operational parameters such as pH, amount of adsorbent and contact time, and also kinetics and thermodynamic reactions were considered.|$|R

5|$|The {{first trial}} series {{consisted}} of three shots. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, {{in order to reduce}} the production of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout.</b> British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did not yet know how to do this. Amid growing public concern about the dangers of fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, they agreed that levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled the human population {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life. Some people were placed in cryogenic facilities in an attempt to sleep long enough until the environment improved even a little bit.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{nuclear tests}} in the Pacific were causing {{radioactive}} rainstorms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout,</b> with disastrous results. It is in this anxious atmosphere that Kurosawa's next film, Record of a Living Being, was conceived. The story concerned an elderly factory owner (Toshiro Mifune) so terrified of {{the prospect of a}} nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family (both legal and extra-marital) to what he imagines is the safety of a farm in Brazil. Production went much more smoothly than the director's previous film, but a few days before shooting ended, Kurosawa's composer, collaborator and close friend Fumio Hayasaka died (of tuberculosis) at the age of 41. The film's score was finished by Hayasaka's student, Masaru Sato, who would go on to score all of Kurosawa's next eight films. Record of a Living Being opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction, becoming the first Kurosawa film to lose money during its original theatrical run. Today, it is {{considered by many to be}} among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, many {{countries}} ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> testing.

5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into <b>nuclear</b> <b>fallout</b> from the Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter {{conflict with the}} Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence that the previous year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a variety of}} {{sampling}} methods have been utilised to assess the amount of deposited activity, mainly of Cs- 137, from the Chernobyl accident and from the nuclear weapons tests. Starting with the Chernobyl accident in 1986 sampling of air and rain {{was used to determine}} the composition and amount of radioactive debris from this accident, brought to southern Sweden by the weather systems. The resulting deposition and its removal from urban areas was then studied through measurements on sewage sludge and water. The main part of the thesis considers methods of determining the amount of radiocaesium in the ground through soil sampling. In connection with soil sampling a method of optimising the sampling procedure has been developed and tested in the areas of Sweden which have a comparatively high amount of Cs- 137 from the Chernobyl accident. This method was then used in a survey of the activity in soil in Lund and Skåne, divided between <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> and fallout from the Chernobyl accident. By comparing the results from this survey with deposition calculated from precipitation measurements it was found possible to predict the deposition pattern over Skåne for both <b>nuclear</b> weapons <b>fallout</b> and fallout from the Chernobyl accident. In addition, the vertical distribution of Cs- 137 has been modelled and the temporal variation of the depth distribution has been described...|$|R
