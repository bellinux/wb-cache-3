5|$|Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—had {{achieved}} several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, in Italy the Coalition's achievements {{were more}} limited. In <b>northern</b> <b>Italy,</b> {{despite the presence}} of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.|$|E
5|$|As winter {{broke in}} 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl. Instructed {{to block the}} Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy,</b> and prevent them from {{assisting}} one another. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> and southwestern Germany, and use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria.

5|$|The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several {{victories}} at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy,</b> {{they could}} neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> pushed Austrian {{forces to the}} border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.|$|E

5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little {{resistance}} as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking {{position on the}} north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy,</b> and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian was not {{the only}} {{challenger}} to Carinus' rule: the usurper M. Aurelius Julianus, Carinus' corrector Venetiae, took control of <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> and Pannonia after Diocletian's accession. Julianus minted coins from the mint at Siscia (Sisak, Croatia) declaring himself as emperor and promising freedom. It was all good publicity for Diocletian, and it aided in his portrayal of Carinus as a cruel and oppressive tyrant. Julianus' forces were weak, however, and were handily dispersed when Carinus' armies moved from Britain to <b>northern</b> <b>Italy.</b> As leader of the united East, Diocletian was clearly the greater threat. Over the winter of 284–85, Diocletian advanced west across the Balkans. In the spring, some time before the end of May, his armies met Carinus' across the river Margus (Great Morava) in Moesia. In modern accounts, the site has been located between the Mons Aureus (Seone, west of Smederevo) and Viminacium, near modern Belgrade, Serbia.|$|E

5|$|For {{many centuries}} thereafter, the {{settlements}} around the Mont Blanc massif comprised a rural population of peasant mountain farmers, living off animal husbandry, supplemented with a meagre harvest of rye and oats. Some {{farmers in the}} valley of Chamonix joined their counterparts from the neighbouring valleys of Maurienne, Beaufortain and Tarentaise and crossed the Alps into southern Germany, Austria and <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> to sell their products and bring back goods for sale in local markets.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Mussolini {{took his}} country into World War II {{on the side}} of Nazi Germany but soon met with {{military}} failure. By the autumn of 1943, he was reduced to being the leader of a German puppet state in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> and was faced with the Allied advance from the south and an increasingly violent internal conflict with the partisans. In April 1945, with the Allies breaking through the last German defences in <b>northern</b> <b>Italy</b> and a general uprising of the partisans taking hold in the cities, Mussolini's situation became untenable. On 25 April he fled Milan, where he had been based, and tried to escape to the Swiss border. He and his mistress, Claretta Petacci, were captured on 27 April by local partisans near the village of Dongo on Lake Como. Mussolini and Petacci were shot the following afternoon, two days before Adolf Hitler's suicide.|$|E
