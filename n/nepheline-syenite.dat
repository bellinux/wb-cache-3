The first two are blue fibrous minerals, with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and crocidolite (blue asbestos) in ironstone formations, both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes. The latter two are dark green minerals, which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium, such as <b>nepheline-syenite</b> and phonolite.|$|E
5000|$|Gonnardite {{has been}} found in silica-poor {{volcanic}}s and pegmatites. It occurs with thomsonite and natrolite in vesicles in the volcanic rock of The Nut, near Stanley, Tasmania, Australia, intergrown with natrolite at Don Hill, Tasmania and in drill holes with chabazite and calcite near Guildford, Tasmania. [...] It is also found in <b>nepheline-syenite</b> in the Grenville Geological Province, {{which is part of the}} Canadian Shield.The type locality (the place where the mineral was first described) is La Chaux de Bergonne, Gignat, Saint-Germain-Lembron, Puy-de-Dôme, Auvergne, France, and type material from this locality is held at the Natural History Museum, London, England, registration number BM.1930,166.|$|E
50|$|Rocks of {{this class}} also occur in Brazil (Serra de Tingua) {{containing}} sodalite and often much augite, {{in the western}} Sahara and Cape Verde Islands; also at Zwarte Koppies in the Transvaal, Madagascar, São Paulo in Brazil, Paisano Pass in West Texas, United States, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The rock of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, is a mica-foyaite rich in albite and aegirine: it accompanies granite and essexite. Litchfieldite is another well-marked type of <b>nepheline-syenite,</b> in which albite is the dominant feldspar. It is named after Litchfield, Maine, United States, where it occurs in scattered blocks. Biotite, cancrinite and sodalite are characteristic of this rock. A similar <b>nepheline-syenite</b> is known from Hastings County, Ontario, and contains hardly any orthoclase, but only albite feldspar. Nepheline is very abundant {{and there is also}} cancrinite, sodalite, scapolite, calcite, biotite and hornblende. The lujaurites are distinguished from the rocks above described by their dark color, which is due to the abundance of minerals such as augite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and other kinds of amphibole. Typical examples are known near Lujaur on the White Sea, where they occur with umptekites and other very peculiar rocks. Other localities for this group are at Julianehaab in Greenland with sodalite-syenite; at their margins they contain pseudomorphs after leucite. The lujaurites frequently have a parallel-banding or gneissose structure. Sodalite-syenites in which sodalite very largely or completely takes the place of nepheline occur in Greenland, where they contain also microcline-perthite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and eudialyte.|$|E

They are exceedingly rich in alkalis and in alumina (hence {{the abundance of}} felspathoids and alkali feldspars) with silica varying from 50 to 56%, while lime, magnesia and iron are never present in great quantity, though somewhat more variable than the other components. A worldwide average of the major elements in nepheline syenite tabulated by Barker (1983) is listed below, expressed as weight percent oxides.|$|R
50|$|Sodalite, colorless and {{transparent}} in thin section, but frequently pale {{blue in the}} hand specimens, is the principal feldspathoid mineral in addition to nepheline.

Other minerals common in minor amounts include sodium-rich pyroxene, biotite, titanite, iron oxides, apatite, fluorite, melanite garnet, and zircon. Cancrinite occurs in several <b>nepheline-syenites.</b> A great number of interesting and rare minerals have been recorded from nepheline syenites and the pegmatite veins which intersect them.|$|R
40|$|Carbonatites {{are rather}} {{uncommon}} rocks, {{the origin of}} which still stands a subject of debate, especially regarding if they crystallize from primary carbonatitic melts from the mantle, or if they are generated, by some magmatic differentiation process, from an alkaline-silicate parent magma.

In this work, field relationships between both groups of lithologies {{as well as the}} main geochemical characteristics of the carbonatites, which are compared to those of the alkaline silicate rocks, are presented.

50|$|The OJSC Apatit enterprise, {{which is}} located on the Kola Peninsula, was the leading {{producer}} of apatite concentrate in Russia and one of the world's leading suppliers of phosphate raw material; its core activities were the mining and beneficiation of apatite and <b>nepheline-syenite</b> ores at 10 deposits that have estimated combined reserves of 3.5 Gt. The development plan for Apatit to 2015 assumes an optimal level of apatite concentrate production of 8.5 Mt/yr that would require levels of ore extraction of 27 to 28 Mt/yr. To maintain output, the enterprise would need to develop underground mining significantly. In 2001, the percentage of ore mined underground was 38%; by 2015, this percentage was expected to increase to 75%. Investment to renovate the beneficiation complex, reduce energy expenditures, reduce emissions harmful to the environment, and acquire new equipment to improve labor productivity was also needed.|$|E
50|$|The Monchique Range {{is part of}} the Late-Cretaceous Iberian Alkaline Igneous Province and {{is related}} to the Mount Ormonde {{seamount}} in the Gorringe Bank. The inselberg is formed primarily of nepheline-syenites (foyaite, for which 'Foia' is the type locality). At c.63 km2 Monchique the fourth largest miaskitic <b>nepheline-syenite</b> intrusion so far discovered. It is assumed to be of 'laccolithic' form, from its regular contact altitude to the Breijera formation (country rock). Pegmatites of similar foyaitic composition are seen within the mass at two locations and an associated dyke swarm of lamprophyres and picrites extends some 3 km from the mountain. the psammite/shale/marl country rocks of the Breijera formation are well exposed to the west of Serra de Monchique, forming jagged outcrops and dramatic gorges, which since the destructive introduction of eucalyptus farming in 1976, now run dry most of the year round.|$|E
40|$|Carbonatites {{are very}} rare in oceanic environments, {{where they have}} been {{reported}} only at the Canary and Cape Verde islands in the Atlantic Ocean. In the Canary archipelago, calciocarbonatites occur only on the island of Fuerteventura, in clear spatial and temporal association to alkaline silicate rocks, ranging from ultramafic to salic, and comprising alkaline clinopyroxenites, melteigites–ijolites–urtites, nepheline-bearing gabbros and <b>nepheline–syenites,</b> together with their volcanic equivalents. Selected isotopic (Sr, Nd and Pb) data from representative samples of this alkaline–carbonatitic association show a very estricted range of isotopic compositions, with those of the calciocarbonatites overlapping those of the alkaline silicate rocks. Despite the fact that all these rocks display cumulate textures and cover a wide range of SiO 2 and Sr, Nd, Pb contents, initial isotopic compositions are approximately constant and mantle-like, indicating that evolution of the alkaline–carbonatitic association of Fuerteventura must have taken place in the absence of crustal contamination processes. Regarding the mantle source for the alkaline–carbonatitic association, its depleted initial Sr (87 Sr/ 86 Sr= 0. 7032 – 0. 7036) and Nd (143 Nd/ 144 Nd= 0. 5128 – 0. 5129) compositions, fall on the same trend as the East African young (< 40 Ma) carbonatites. In 143 Nd/ 144 Nd and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr vs. 206 Pb/ 204 Pb diagrams, the alkaline–carbonatitic association of Fuerteventura shows FOZO compositions for Sr and Nd, and slightly higher (towards HIMU) Pb compositions. Furthermore, these data fit the projection of the mantle plane defined by Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic compositions of the DMM, HIMU and EMI components, this fit not being found in sources containing crustal components. In view of this, we propose that the alkaline–carbonatitic association of Fuerteventura was derived mainly from a heterogeneous mantle plume with a deep-seated (FOZO) signature, mixed with HIMU component...|$|R
40|$|At 1299 ± 17 Ma (Blaxland et al, 1978), the Grønnedal-Íka is {{the oldest}} of the Gardar centres, {{situated}} in the extreme north-west of the province. Hare-earth clement (REE) trends suggest that the <b>nepheline-syenites</b> which make up the bulk of the complex were derived from a parental magma formed by a few percent of partial melting of a garnet-lherzolite mantle source during an episode of rifting in the Early Gardar. In contrast to other undersaturated Gardar centres, the syenites of Gronnedal-l'ka show some striking raineralogical differences. The scarcity of amphibole and lack of olivine indicate a magma with a relatively high oxygen fugacity. Opaque oxide compositions and pyroxene trends provide further support for this idea. Additionally, the occurrence of zircon in all units of the complex is unusual, and is probably related to post-magmatic alteration processes. Fractionation of apatite and zircon appears to have been responsible for the observed variations in REE content, although later iteration and variations in the composition of the inter- cumulus liquid have given rise to a considerable scatter in major and trace element abundances. Normative compositions show the evidence {{for the development of a}} 'sandwich' horizon in both the Lower and Upper Series. At a later stage, a plug of xenolithic syenite was intruded, which was followed by a the em placement of a body of xenolithic carbonatite, containing fragments of the earlier syenites. This unit is predominantly s 0 vitic, but with increasing fractionation, more iron-rich (ferrcarbonatite) compositions were developed. Compared to many carbonatites, the rock at Grønnedal is rather poor in 'exotic' minerals. Trace element abundances, however, show extreme enrichment in Sr, Th, REE's, and Y, and depletion in Zr, Ti, and K compared to the syenites. These variations are comparable to the observed concentrations in the Igaliko carbonatite dykes (Pearce, 1988). Hf, Ta, and REE distributions between the carbonatite and syenitic rocks suggest that the carbonatite was derived by liquid immiscibility from a Co(_ 2) -saturated phonolitic magma, with the conjugate silicate phase possibly intruded as the Xenolithic Porphyritc Syenite. Patchy metasomatic alteration has affected all units, and has given rise to the Coarse- Grained Brown Syenite, which occurs in both the Lower and Upper Series. More intense alteration has affected the syenites, giving carbonate-rich 'carbosyenites', and xenoliths of country rock within the syenites and carbonatite; the surrounding country-rock is not as severely affected as might have been expected. The presence of zircon, alkali mafics, sodalite veins, and recrystallisation of feldspar in the altered rocks is attributed to the effects of peradkaline.

40|$|The Igaliko <b>Nepheline-Syenite</b> Complex of Gardar age (1300 - 1120 Ma) {{includes}} carbonatite, lamprophyre, basalt, trachybasalt, phonolite and rhyolite dykes. The {{relationship of}} carbonatite magma {{to the other}} magma types {{in this area is}} not immediately obvious. Field, geochemical and petrological studies suggest three equally acceptable models for the evolution of the carbonatites. Here we present petrological, geochemical and isotopic (C, O, Sr and Nd) data for a series of dykes from the Igaliko <b>Nepheline-Syenite</b> Complex which are pertinent to the origin of these carbonatites. delta(13) C and delta(18) O ratios show that the isotope evolution of the dykes is consistent with closely related carbonatite and ultramafic lamprophyre magma genesis, prior to the production of more voluminous alkaline lamprophyre and basalt magma during repeated rifting episodes. The associated phonolite melts, produced by fractional crystallisation of basic magmas late in this evolution, had lengthy residence times in the crust during which they exchanged C, O and Sr isotopes with crustal rocks. Despite geochemical evidence suggesting a genetic link between phonolites and carbonatites, the C and O isotopic evidence shows that the phonolites are not related directly to the carbonatites by liquid immiscibility, whilst combined field, geochemical and isotopic data strongly point to an origin of carbonatites by liquid immiscibility from ultramafic lamprophyres.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to sedimentary sequences, {{the relationships between}} the stressed state of igneous rocks and the chemistry and physical properties of gases contained within them are not well known. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by using, as an example, the apatite-nepheline and rare-metal ore deposits hosted within the Khibiny and Lovozero alkaline <b>nepheline-syenite</b> complexes of the Kola Peninsula, NW Russia. These massifs are characterized by unusually high, for igneous rocks, contents of multi-component, essentially hydrogen-hydrocarbon, gases and also by high hardness, elasticity and unevenly distributed, subhorizontal tectonic stresses. Relationships between the chemical and dynamic characteristics of the gases and the geomechanical properties of the host rocks have been examined using field observations and laboratory experiments. Patterns of gas release variations in time and space, gas emissions from rock pillars during artificial loading, variations of gas pressure in sealed shot-holes and changes in liberation rates of gaseous components during experimental rock loading are suggested to result from changes in rock stress and deformation state. Gas compositions in sealed shot-holes in stressed rocks change with time. Partly this is due to belated release of gases held in fluid inclusions and isolated voids and their subsequent mixing with gases held in interconnected fracture systems as the included gases are preferentially released as fluid inclusion arrays are opened during later stages of stress build-up. Partly it may also be because released gases may react with new fracture surfaces to generate enhanced levels of reduced H 2 gases...|$|E
40|$|The Husfjord area of Soroy {{essentially}} comprises a plutonic igneous complex {{which has}} been emplaced into Eocambrian meta sediments during the Caledonian orogeney. The metasedimentary envelope of the complex consists mainly of a sequence of psammites, pelites, semi-pelites, calc-silicate-schists, and metalimestones, which have suffered a prolonged regional metamorphism and two principal episodes of deformation. The regional metamorphic event commenced before the first folding episode, reached its peak in the almandine-amphibolite facies between the deformation episodes, and waned during the second period of folding. The {{various members of the}} igneous complex were emplaced synchronous with these metamorphic and tectonic events. Contact metamorphie effects produced by some members have been superimposed upon those of the regional metamorphism. The earliest member, the Husfjord metagabbro, was intruded {{towards the end of the}} first deformation episode, and has undergone the highest grades of regional metamorphism. A norite and a suite of diorites were emplaced during the second deformation episode and these have only suffered a low-grade regional metamorphism.

The latest members of the igneous complex were the Vatna gabbro, the Slatten gabbros, and a number of minor intrusions including perthosite sheets, basic dykes, and <b>nepheline-syenite</b> pegmatites.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of 25 trace elements and selected major elements {{have been investigated}} in carbonatites, peralkaline silicate rocks and fenites from Homa Mountain, N. Ruri and Wasaki in W. Kenya. Comparison has been made with the distributions of these elements in similar rocks from Budeda, Toror and Tororo carbonatitic complexes, E. Uganda. The earliest sovitic carbonatites were found to contain greater concentrations of Sr, and generally less Ba, Nb, REE (both Ce- and Y-earths), Fe, Mn, Zn, Zr, Ti, and V than the later alvikitic carbonatites. The later ferruginous alvikites were characteristically enriched in Fe, Mn, Ba, Zn, and REE (Ce-earths) relative to other carbonatites. All carbonatites were typically strongly Ce-earth enriched. The peralkaline silicate rocks and fenites were similarly enriched in Sr, Ba, REE, Nb and Ti, and contained generally more Zr and Ga than the carbonatites. These rocks were also Ce-earth enriched. The concentrations of Sr, Ba, Zr, REE, Ga, and Nb in the fenites indicate that these elements are introduced into the country rock by Na-fenitising solutions. The similarity in trace element content between fenites and <b>nepheline-syenite</b> suggests a genetic relationship between these rock types. The greater concentration of Cr, Ni and Co in the pyroxenites suggest that these rocks formed early in the crystallisation history of the carbonatite complexes, leading to crystallisation of the ijolitic suite. The relationship between the carbonatites and silicate rocks remains controversial. However, the concentration Ba, REE, and Nb in the carbonatites indicates that these rocks were formed late {{in the history of}} the complexes. A mechanism involving fractional crystallisation of a carbonated silica-undersaturated magma, leading in the later stages to liquid immiscibility of carbonate and silicate liquids, is favoured for the origin of these rocks...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Leucite and pseudoleueitc {{invariably}} {{have lower}} K/Rb ratios and higher K/Sr and K/Ba ratios than the groundmasses {{of the rocks}} in which they occur. The distribution of Rb, Sr, and Ba between K-rich minerals (e. g. alkali feldspars) and the liquids from which they crystallize is generally such that Rb is impoverished and Sr and Ba enriched, relative t ~ K, in the crystallizing phase. Leucite shows the opposite relationship and this is attributed tothe leucite structure being sensitive to the size and valency of the ions rep]acing K. p SEUDOLEUCITE normally consists of a fine-grained intergrowth of nepheline and alkali feldspar and {{is believed to be}} formed by reaction of primary leucite with Na-rich magma (Bowen and Ellestad, 1937), subsolidus breakdown of primary Na-rieh leucite (Fudali, 1963), or breakdown of K-analcime (Larsen and Buie, 1938). During a recent geochemical nd mineralogical investigation of the Marangudzi igneous complex, Southern Rhodesia (Rees, 1960; Gifford, 1961) I found that pseudoleucites usually have larger concentrations of Rb and smaller concentrations of Sr and Ba than the rocks in which they are contained. This means that the groundmasses of these rocks have lower Rb and higher Sr and Ba concentrations. Pseudoleucites from other areas show a similar distribution of these elements relative to their bulk rock or groundmass composition. Leueite phenocrysts from fine-grained or glassy lavas also show high concentrations of Rb and low concentrations of Sr and Ba relative to their bulk rocks or groundmasses. The above relationships do not conform with those expected con-sidering the normal laws of trace element distribution (Goldschmidt, 1937; Ringwood, 1955) and the possible reasons for this are discussed in this paper.
