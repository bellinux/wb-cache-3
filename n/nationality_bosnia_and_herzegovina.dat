2500|$|On 25 January {{a debate}} over a {{referendum}} was held in Parliament, ending when the Serb deputies withdrew after Bosniak and Croat delegates rejected a Serb motion that it be determined by a yet-to-be-formed Council for National Equality. After Momčilo Krajišnik tried to adjourn the session, he was replaced by an SDA member and the proposal to hold a referendum was adopted {{in the absence of}} the SDS. Since the referendum intended to change the status of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> from a federal state of Yugoslavia to a sovereign state, it [...] breached the Constitution of Yugoslavia (since the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina</b> did not have jurisdiction, and exceeded its powers). According to the Yugoslav constitution, changing the borders of Yugoslavia was impossible without the consent of all republics. The referendum was also unconstitutional in terms of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> Amendment LXX to the constitution established a council entrusted with exercising the right to equality of the nations <b>and</b> <b>nationalities</b> of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> <b>Herzegovina.</b> The proposal for a referendum on the [...] "status of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina" [...] was required to be considered by the Council, since such a referendum directly impacted [...] "the principles of equality among nations and nationalities".|$|R
