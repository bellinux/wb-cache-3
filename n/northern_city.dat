Using rainwater resources {{to solve the problem}} of water shortage in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> haven’t been put into practice. This paper took rainwater use in Handan City as an example, analyzed potential and economic benefits of city rainwater utilization, and discussed two project patterns of rainwater use which are suitable for climate characteristics and economic development of <b>northern</b> <b>cities.</b> The two project patterns are road rainwater collection and utilization, and roof rainwater collection and utilization. After analysis, these two kinds of engineering modes can largely solve the problem of water shortage in <b>northern</b> <b>cities,</b> and reduce the load of rainwater pipe network, which can make considerable economic benefits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Inhalable {{particulate}} matter seriously affects ambient air quality. To analyze temporal-spatial distribution char-acteristics of PM 10 pollution and {{the impacts of}} meteorological factors in China since 2000, using statistical methods and GIS, monitoring data of PM 10 during 2000 - 2013 in China were analyzed. It was found that annual mean of PM 10 in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China basically presented declining tendency since 2000. PM 10 concentration in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China had obvious seasonal change characteristics, and monthly average PM 10 concentration which was higher during November-December and January-April and had double-peak characteristics. PM 10 pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China was eased largely, and heavily polluted area significantly reduced. The overall tendency changed from the concentrated contiguous distribution into sporadic zonal and punctiform distribution. Meteorological factors had important impacts on PM 10 in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China. PM 10 concentration and wind velocity presented negative correlation when wind veloc-ity 6 m/s and positive correlation when wind velocity 6 m/s. Relative humidity was an important factor affecting in-halable {{particulate matter}} pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China in winter, and high-humidity air was easy to cause heavier particulate matter pollution. Temperature and atmospheric pressure had no obvious impact on inhalable particulate matter pollution in <b>northern</b> <b>cities</b> of China...|$|R

5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954.

After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and the <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E

5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, {{as well as his}} wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Spanish government, which ruled over Puerto Rico, {{attempted}} to banish Betances {{for a second}} time, but he and Segundo Ruiz Belvis (a lawyer and city administrator who became his closest friend and political companion) fled the island before they were apprehended. Both fled to the <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic in 1861, where Betances established a close personal friendship with Gen. Gregorio Luperón, the military leader of the northern pro-independence faction who led the efforts to restore Dominican sovereignty over their country. Betances was also a collaborator of Dominican priest (and later Archbishop of Santo Domingo and one-time president of the country), Fernando Arturo de Meriño, who was the revolt's ideological leader (as well as its delegate in Puerto Rico when he was himself exiled by the restored republican government). These two friendships {{would prove to be}} key to Betances' own efforts to achieve Puerto Rican independence later on.|$|E
5|$|Delaware Route 202 (DE 202), {{also known}} as Concord Avenue, is a short state highway in Wilmington, Delaware.

The road is two lanes and undivided for most of its length except for the part just south of the I-95 interchange, which is four lanes and divided. DE 202 was a part of US 202 until that highway was truncated to the I-95 interchange in 1970. DE 202 was designated by 1981.|$|E

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via the <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) {{announced}} a proposal, which {{became known as}} the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E

King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E
