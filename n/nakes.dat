40|$|<b>Naked</b> {{family members}} (Drosophila <b>Naked</b> Cuticle and {{mammalian}} <b>Naked</b> 1 and <b>Naked</b> 2) {{have been identified}} as inducible antagonists of canonical Wnt signaling. We recently reported that <b>Naked</b> 2, but not <b>Naked</b> 1, interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of TGF-alpha, thereby coating TGF-alpha-containing exocytic vesicles and directing these vesicles to the basolateral corner of polarized epithelial cells. Here, we show that <b>Naked</b> 2 is a short-lived protein with a half-life of 60 min caused by its rapid ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. Overexpression of TGF-alpha stabilizes <b>Naked</b> 2 protein in an EGF receptor (EGFR) -independent manner; a physical interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of TGF-alpha and <b>Naked</b> 2 is necessary and sufficient for this protection. We have identified a RING finger protein, AO 7 /RNF 25, as a ubiquitin ligase for <b>Naked</b> 2, and we have shown that overexpression of TGF-alpha reduces binding of AO 7 to <b>Naked</b> 2. These results identify an EGFR-independent action of TGF-alpha, in which it protects <b>Naked</b> 2 from proteasomal degradation, thus ensuring its delivery to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of an actor’s internal attributions for success on observers ’ sub-sequent treatment of the actor. The actor self-disclosed inform-ation of moderate intimacy to some observers, but not to others. In both experiments it was found that when the actor attributed his success to ability he was treated less favorably when he was perceived to be friendly because he had self-disclosed, than when he was regarded neutrally because there had been no opportunity for him to self-disclose. In the first experiment, but not in the second, it was found that when the actor attributed his success to effort, he was treated more favorably when he had self-disclosed than when he had not. The attributions that an individual <b>nakes</b> to account for his suc-cess in a competitive situation are likely to have implications for the behavior of other competitors toward the individual.

40|$|Approximations of the non-additive non-interacting {{kinetic energy}} (<b>NAKE)</b> as an {{explicit}} functional of the density {{are the basis}} of several electronic structure methods that provide improved computational efficiency over standard Kohn-Sham calculations. However, within most fragment-based formalisms, there is no unique exact <b>NAKE,</b> {{making it difficult to}} develop general, robust approximations for it. When adjustments are made to the embedding formalisms to guarantee uniqueness, approximate functionals may be more meaningfully compared to the exact unique <b>NAKE.</b> We use numerically accurate inversions to study the exact <b>NAKE</b> of several rare-gas dimers within Partition Density Functional Theory, a method that provides the uniqueness for the exact <b>NAKE.</b> We find that the <b>NAKE</b> decreases nearly exponentially with atomic separation for the rare gas dimers.
