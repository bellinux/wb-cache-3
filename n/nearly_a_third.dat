Namath responded with a passing display that gave the Jets a 24–0 halftime lead. Saying that his players were “polite” to Namath, coach McKay compared the Buccaneers to a junior-high team, and said that the only thing they did better than the Jets was to be the first team on the field after halftime. Clark Gaines rushed for 103 yards for the Jets. The Buccaneers’ three quarterbacks combined for 171 yards passing, more than the Jets’ quarterbacks, but the Buccaneers failed to score for the fourth time in the season.

Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker.

The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979.
