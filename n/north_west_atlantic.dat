2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of sand tigers are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of sand tigers food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller sand tigers mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of sand tigers is consistent with similar observations in the <b>north</b> <b>west</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and in South Africa where large sand tigers capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of sand tiger feeding. Off South Africa, sand tigers less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large sand tigers capture prey up to about half of their own length. The prey items are usually swallowed as three or four chunks.|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of the 5 th International Symposium on Fauna and Flora of Atlantic Islands. Dublin, 24 - 27 August 2004.

Results showed close affinities of the Azores green, brown and red marine algal floras with those of Madeira aand the Canary Islands. Analyses also indicated, particularly for the red algae, trans-Atlantic affinities between the algal floras of Macaronesia and the Carolinas. Low endemicity suggests that the Azores algal flora is not an isolated one. The islands may serve as trans-Atlantic stepping stones in the dispersal distribution of some species but the various elements in the flora suggest the islands to be an Atlantic crossroad...|$|R
