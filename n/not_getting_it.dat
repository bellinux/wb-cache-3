500|$|After {{releasing}} the successful debut album Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992), TLC {{began working on}} the their second release called CrazySexyCool in late 1993 and continued through till September 1994. One of the album's tracks, [...] "Creep", was based on member Tionne [...] "T-Boz" [...] Watkins' own experience. She recalled it for Billboard: [...] "You're with a guy and he's not showing you attention, so another guy comes along and you're like, 'Hey, if you were where {{you were supposed to}} be, he couldn't be showing me attention right now!' I {{was in the middle of}} this drama, because the other guy was [...] friend, and my boyfriend was just <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> together." [...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's how they feel – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani {{received}} another personal {{question at}} a public appearance in Derry, New Hampshire on August 16, {{when he was asked}} [...] "ow you could expect the loyal following of Americans when you are <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> from your own family?" [...] He replied, [...] "I love my family very, very much and will do anything for them.... The best thing I can say is kind of, 'Leave my family alone, just like I'll leave your family alone.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It may {{strike you}} as we proceed. If you stop to {{consider}} whether it's judicious to reach out for the thing you want, you generally end by <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> or anything else. Isn't it better to clutch with courage, {{even if you have}} to face the cost?" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seems that}} our hero, {{considering}} himself spited by a Latin-Grammar-Master, demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another. <b>Not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it,</b> he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company, bought a second-hand pocket-pistol, folded up some sandwiches {{in a paper}} bag, made a bottle of Spanish liquorice-water, and entered on a career of valour.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{brought my}} master money, but me {{aches and pains}} as many as you will, and at last the fever. When that was burnt out, I {{made up my mind}} to ask for more pay, and, <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it,</b> to quit that service. I think the signor would have given it,--but the signora! So I left, empty as I came, and was cook on a vessel to New York." ...|$|E
60|$|Cornelia {{found herself}} {{in the last of}} a long line of {{sections}} or stalls which flanked a narrow corridor dividing the girl students from the young men, who were often indeed hardly more than boys. There was a table stretching from this corridor to a window looking down on the roofs of some carpenter shops and stables; on the board before her lay the elementary shape of a hand in plaster, which she was trying to draw. At her side that odd-looking girl, who had stared so at her on the stairs the day before, was working at a block foot, and <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> very well. She had in fact given it up for the present and was watching Cornelia's work and watching her face, and talking to her.|$|E

[...] "Between de Cressi and Clavering there has been rivalry and feud for three long generations. When we were {{children}} it abated for a while, since your father lent money to mine, {{and that is why}} they suffered us to grow up side by side. But then they quarrelled about the ferry that we had set in pawn, and your father asked his gold back again, and, <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it,</b> took the ferry, which I have always held a foolish and strife-breeding deed, since from that day forward the war was open. Therefore, Hugh, if we meet at all it must be in these frozen reeds or behind the cover of a thicket, like a village slut and her man." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{sudden and}} inconsiderate {{departure}} was a severe blow to Mr. Cooke' {{who was so}} constituted that he cared but little about anything until there was danger of <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it.</b> My client had planned a trip to Bear Island for the following Tuesday, which was to last a week, the party to bring tents with them and rough it, with the Maria as headquarters. It {{was out of the}} question to send to Far Harbor for another skipper, if, indeed, one could be found at that late period. And as luck would have it, six of Mr. Cooke's ten guests had left but a day or so since, and among them had been the only yacht-owner. None of the four that remained could do more than haul aft and belay a sheet. But the Celebrity, who chanced along as Mr. Cooke was ruefully gazing at the graceful lines of the Maria from the wharf and cursing the fate that kept him ashore with a stiff wind blowing, proposed a way out of the difficulty. He, the Celebrity, would gladly sail the Maria over to Bear Island provided another man could be found to relieve him occasionally at the wheel, and the like. He had noticed that Farrar was a capable hand in a boat, and suggested that he be sent for.|$|E
60|$|Washington, Oct. 13, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--Nothing {{particular}} new with me. I am {{well and}} hearty--think {{a good deal}} about home. Mother, I so much want to see you, even if only for a couple of weeks, for I feel I must return here and continue my hospital operations. They are so much needed, although one can do only such a little in comparison, amid these thousands. Then I desire much to see Andrew. I wonder if I could cheer him up any. Does he get any good from that treatment with the baths, etc.? Mother, I suppose you have your hands full with Nancy's poor little children, and one worry and another (when one gets old little things bother a great deal). Mother, I go down every day looking for a letter from you or Jeff--I had two from Jeff latter part of the week. I want to see Jeff much. I wonder why he didn't send me the Union with my letter in; I am disappointed at <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it.</b> I sent Han a N. Y. Times with my last letter, and one to George too. Have you heard anything from George or Han? There is a new lot of wounded now again. They have been arriving sick and wounded for three days--first long strings of ambulances with the sick, but yesterday many with bad and bloody wounds, poor fellows. I thought I was cooler and more used to it, but the sight of some of them brought tears into my eyes. Mother, I had the good luck yesterday to do quite a great deal of good. I had provided a lot of nourishing things for the men, but for another quarter--but I had them where I could use them immediately for these new wounded as they came in faint and hungry, and fagged out with a long rough journey, all dirty and torn, and many pale as ashes and all bloody. I distributed all my stores, gave partly to the nurses I knew that were just taking charge of them--and as many as I could I fed myself. Then besides I found a lot of oyster soup handy, and I procured it all at once. Mother, it is the most pitiful sight, I think, when first the men are brought in. I have to bustle round, to keep from crying--they are such rugged young men--all these just arrived are cavalry men. Our troops got the worst of it, but fought like devils. Our men engaged were Kilpatrick's Cavalry. They were in the rear as part of Meade's retreat, and the Reb cavalry cut in between and cut them off and attacked them and shelled them terribly. But Kilpatrick brought them out mostly--this was last Sunday.|$|E
