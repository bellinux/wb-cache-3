Our analysis acknowledges that High Reliability Organization (HRO) principles are transferable to a hospital organization.

These certainly shorten response time for hospital’s stuffs to reach patients. In this project, a new prototype of portable <b>nurse</b> call <b>system</b> that uses Wifi internet network is developed to improve the system mobility. A cheaper and easy programmed system development board (Arduino) was chosen. A Wifi module - Xbee module was added to the development board in order to connect to Wifi internet network.

40|$|Summary: The {{problems}} {{behind the}} failure of <b>nursing</b> information <b>systems</b> to support patient care are explored and a solution proposed. I {{do not know if}} you agree, but I have a feeling about <b>nursing</b> information <b>systems.</b> I think it is one shared by colleagues who know more about the subject than me. I feel that all the information important to the nursing professions in delivering care is not captured by and available in <b>nursing</b> information <b>systems,</b> and in some way these <b>systems</b> have let <b>nurses</b> down. There is indirect evidence for this view in the apparently slow procurement and implementation of <b>nursing</b> information <b>systems</b> detailed in official reports. 1, 2 Perhaps it is ourselves as nurses who have let the systems developers, and thus the profession down. It is timely to ask what is the value of information captured by <b>nursing</b> information <b>systems,</b> and is this the same as valuable nursing information? Clearly, that is too grand an aim for a short article, but there are some questions that can be asked about how we could think about this issue.

40|$|Asthma is {{the most}} {{frequent}} reason for preventable hospital admissions among children regardless of race or socio-economic status. Since asthma hospitalizations are preventable, an implicit assumption is that parents are not optimally managing the illness condition. Using Orem's Self-Care Deficit Nursing Theory, 14 antecedent conditions necessary for competent action by dependent-care agents (usually parents) were uncovered in the pediatric asthma literature. All {{but two of the}} 14 antecedent conditions are influenced by factors partly or completely controlled by the health care system. Given this new understanding, a unique partnership between a health care system and a Medicaid managed care health plan was forged to remove health care system barriers that interfere with dependent-care agent competency for the management of asthma. A <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> was designed and implemented to improve health care system factors associated with optimal symptom control: accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, continuity, access, and parent/child teaching. The multi-faceted <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> was implemented across three professional groups (physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists) within one ER, three hospital units, and six outpatient clinic sites. One component of the <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> involved formal annual training of participants on appropriate diagnosis and optimal treatment. Other <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> components focused attention on children who had failed outpatient management. Specifically, between October l, 1998, and March 31, 2001, 753 children were brought to one emergency room or three hospital units for treatment of an asthma exacerbation. The <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> was successfully implemented on behalf of 75 % of these children. Using Medicaid managed care enrollment files and claims data for asthma care, the effects of the <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> on symptom control were compared before: and after the <b>nursing</b> <b>system</b> intervention, and between two groups of health care providers who had either been maximally or minimally impacted by the <b>nursing</b> <b>system.</b> Rates for asthma claims used to proxy symptom control included ER, hospital, and clinic visits for asthma. Children who had providers in the maximally involved group were one-half as likely to be hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation as children with providers in the minimally involved group.

40|$|AbstractIn {{response}} {{to the need to}} support diverse and complex information requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication, information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level. Formal <b>nursing</b> terminology <b>systems</b> present an alternative approach. This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing <b>nursing</b> terminology <b>systems</b> and overcome their limitations through mediation. The development of formal <b>nursing</b> terminology <b>systems</b> is not an end in itself and there remains a great deal {{of work to be done}} before success can be claimed.
