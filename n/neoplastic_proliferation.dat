40|$|This is the {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between the}} <b>neoplastic</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> and the expression of bcl- 2 and c-myc in human papillomavirus (HPV) -negative and HPV-positive cervical intraepithelial neoplasms (CIN). The expression of bcl- 2 and c-myc was studied using quantitative immunohistochemistry in 20 specimens of normal cervical squamous epithelium and 73 specimens of CIN. To analyze the <b>neoplastic</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> rate, the Ki- 67 labelling index was determined; the latter was significantly different between normal epithelium and various grades of CIN (p > 0. 0001). The highest proliferation rate was found in high-grade CIN. In precancerous lesions, we found the number of bcl- 2 positive cells lower than in normal epithelium, but with a significant difference between low-grade and high-grade CIN (p > 0. 0001). The highest percentage of bcl- 2 positive neoplastic cells was found in high-grade CIN. C-myc was rarely expressed in normal epithelium. Similar to the Ki- 67 labelling index, c-myc immunostaining correlated with the histological grade of CIN, with the highest percentage of c-myc positive nuclei occurring in high-grade CIN (p > 0. 0001). In contrast to bcl- 2 immunoreactivity, the c-myc significantly was more expressed in high-risk HPV-positive than in HPV-negative lesions. The c-myc expression in CIN is closely related to the <b>neoplastic</b> cell <b>proliferation</b> rate.

40|$|Abstract: Pulmonary Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (PLCH) {{is a rare}} interstitial {{lung disease}} {{seen as part of}} multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or as an isolated form of the disease. The majority of cases of the latter are seen in adults and associated with cigarette smoking, which probably plays a central etiologic role. Although the mechanisms leading to the development of isolated PLCH are unclear, it is thought to be a reactive process in contrast to other forms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which have been shown to represent clonal, <b>neoplastic</b> <b>proliferations</b> of Langerhans cells. Isolated PLCH and the other forms may be altogether separate diseases, but they have in common great variability in severity and, likewise, unpredictable clinical courses.

40|$|Background: Desmoid {{tumors are}} <b>neoplastic</b> <b>proliferations</b> of {{connective}} tissues. The mutation {{status of the}} gene coding for catenin (cadherin-associated protein) beta 1 (CTNNB 1) and trisomy 8 on the chromosomal level have been described to have prognostic relevance. Patients and Methods: In order to elucidate new molecular mechanisms underlying these tumors, we carried out a molecular analysis with a genome-wide human high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, in 9 patients. Results: Single samples showed numerical aberrations on chromosomes (Chrs) 20 and 6 with either trisomy 20 or monosomy 6. No trisomy 8 could be detected. Recurrent heterozygous deletions were found in Chr 5 q (including the APC gene locus, n = 3) and Chr 8 p 23 (n = 4, containing coding regions for the potential tumor suppressor gene CSMD 1). This novel deletion in 8 p 23 showed an association with local recurrence. In addition, structural chromosomal changes (gain of Chrs 8 and 20) were found in a minority of cases.

40|$|Tenosynovial giant-cell tumor (TGCT) and {{pigmented}} villonodular synovitis (PVNS) {{are related}} conditions with features of both reactive inflammatory disorders and clonal <b>neoplastic</b> <b>proliferations.</b> Chromosomal translocations involving chromosome 1 p 13 {{have been reported}} in both TGCT and PVNS.

In some cases of both TGCT and PVNS, CSF 1 is fused to COL 6 A 3 (2 q 35). The CSF 1 translocations result in overexpression of CSF 1. In cases of TGCT and PVNS carrying this translocation, it is present in a minority of the intratumoral cells, leading to CSF 1 expression only in these cells, whereas the majority of cells express CSF 1 R but not CSF 1, suggesting a tumor-landscaping effect with aberrant CSF 1 expression in the neoplastic cells, leading to the abnormal accumulation of nonneoplastic cells that form a tumorous mass...|$|R
40|$|Hyperplasia of usual type (HUT) {{is part of}} the {{spectrum}} of benign proliferative disease in the breast and confers an increased risk of developing invasive cancer. Its role as a putative precursor of invasive ductal carcinomas in the breast is, however, controversial. HUT is occasionally seen bilaterally {{but it is not clear}} whether there is a genetic predisposition to the process. This study has analysed 14 cases of bilateral HUT in the breast (28 independent lesions) by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis to define DNA copy number changes and to investigate any commonality in these genetic alterations. The mean number of alterations seen was 1. 6 (46 / 28) in all lesions, with common losses at chromosomes 1 p, 16 p, 17 q, and 22 q. Bilaterally, only five alterations were seen in common across both lesions in both breasts, but no single locus was altered preferentially. These data indicate that a proportion of HUT in the breast are indeed clonal, <b>neoplastic</b> <b>proliferations</b> which exhibit genetic alterations in common with invasive breast cancer, albeit at very low levels. The limited data from these experiments do not reveal a specific predisposition locus. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Desmoids are poorly-understood, locally aggressive, non-metastasizing fibromatoses {{that occur}} with disproportionate {{frequency}} {{in patients with}} familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

We examined clonality of 25 samples of desmoid tissue from 11 female FAP patients by assessing patterns of X-chromosome inactivation to calculate a clonality ratio. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a polymorphic CAG short tandem repeat (STR) sequence adjacent to a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme site within the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) gene using fluorescent-labelled primers enabled analysis of PCR products by Applied Biosystems Genescan IITMsoftware.
