40|$|Introduction Typical dry {{fermented}} sausages {{have been}} produced for centuries using <b>natural</b> <b>casings,</b> which are portions of animal intestines derived from slaughtering. <b>Natural</b> <b>casings</b> are very important components of many traditional meat fermented products, and they represent a peculiar case study of gut-derived environments that are used {{for the production of}} edible fermented foods. Materials & Methods In the present study we investigated by means of culture-dependent methods and Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons the bacterial ecology of hog, cow and ovine casings at different stages of their preparation for sausages production. Results Several strains of Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Vagococcus and Clostridium were counted in significant amounts, isolated and characterized at phylogenetic level. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed a highly diverse bacterial diversity, which differed strongly between casings of different animal species. The technological processes involved in the preparation for casing had also a strong impact on the casings bacterial ecology, with a significant reduction of undesired microorganisms, and an increase in the proportion of lactobacilli and staphylococci. Conclusions Overall results indicate that <b>natural</b> <b>casings</b> are an important source of several bacterial species whose role both in the fermentation and in the microbiological properties of the final products has been underestimated...|$|R
40|$|Aw as {{possible}} parameter {{for the preservation}} of dried <b>natural</b> <b>casings</b> was studied by investigating the survival of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes during the drying process of the casings. Individual dried beef casings were rehydrated and subsequently inoculated with Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. On day 30 post inoculation, the presence of E. coli and B. cereus could no longer be confirmed, while over 4 log cfu / g casing L. monocytogenes remained. This study indicates that the drying period of 30 days at low aw levels is not sufficiently long to eliminate all bacteria present on the <b>natural</b> <b>casings.</b> Aw solely can therefore not serve as a useful parameter for the correct preservation of dried casings. It is useful to link other parameters such as microbial growth...|$|R

25|$|Lincolnshire {{sausages}} – most butchers in Lincolnshire {{have their}} own secret recipe for these and a competition is held each year to judge the best sausages in the county. Traditional Lincolnshire sausages are made entirely from minced pork, stale bread crumb (rusk is used nowadays) pepper, sage and salt.

50|$|The latest {{generation}} of collagen casings are usually more tender than natural casings {{but do not}} exhibit the “snap” or “bite” of <b>natural</b> <b>casing</b> sausages. The biggest volume of collagen casings are edible, but a special form of thicker collagen casings is used for salamis and large caliber sausages where the casing is usually peeled off the sausage by the consumer. Collagen casings are less expensive to use, give better weight and size control, and are easier to run when compared to natural casings.|$|E

Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCasing {{is part of}} sausages, {{giving it}} shape, size and integrity, but also having a role in volumetric, {{structural}} and chemical changes which occur in sausage during different production phases. For fermented sausages, <b>natural</b> or artificial <b>casings</b> can be used. Artificial casings have an advantage from the hygienic point of view, because microbiological contamination is negligible, storage at low temperatures unnecessary, {{and there is no}} problem with product spoilage during storage and transport. Today, artificial sausage casings are a better choice for production of large diameter sausages, while they are equivalent to <b>natural</b> <b>casings</b> for production of small diameter sausages...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, sausage casings {{were made}} of the cleaned intestines, or stomachs {{in the case of}} haggis and other {{traditional}} puddings. Today, however, <b>natural</b> <b>casings</b> are often replaced by collagen, cellulose, or even plastic casings, {{especially in the case of}} industrially manufactured sausages. Some forms of sausage, such as sliced sausage, are prepared without a casing. Additionally, luncheon meat and sausage meat are now available without casings in tin cans and jars.|$|R
40|$|Bovine intestines, {{bladders}} and oesophagus {{are used}} {{for the production of}} <b>natural</b> <b>casings</b> ("beef casings") as edible sausage containers. Derived from cattle experimentally infected with FMDV (initial dosage 10 (4) TCID(50) /mL, strain A Iran 97), these beef casings were treated with sodium chloride (NaCl) or phosphate supplemented salt (P-salt). In addition, different in-vitro experiments using beef casings were done on a small scale with other FMDV strains (A Turkey 06, C-Oberbayern and O(1) Manisa) as "proof of principle". Based on the combined results of the in-vivo and in-vitro experiments, it can be concluded that the storage period of 30 days at 20 °C in NaCl is sufficiently effective to inactivate a possible contamination with FMDV in beef casings and that the usage of P-salt does not clearly enhance the inactivation of FMDV infectivity. Storage of salted beef casings at about 20 °C for 30 days is already part of the Standard Operating Procedures (included in HACCP) of the international casing industry and can therefore be considered as a protective measure for the international trade in <b>natural</b> <b>casings...</b>|$|R
