500|$|Chesimard {{changed her}} name to Assata Olugbala Shakur in 1971. Assata is a West African name, derived from the Arabic name Aisha, said to mean [...] "she who struggles", while Shakur means [...] "thankful one" [...] in Arabic. Olugbala means “love for the people” in Yoruba. She now {{identified}} as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: “It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I didn’t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no amerikan. I felt like an African woman”.|$|E
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And it has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that I feel as though he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1972 Hans Jayanti, {{an annual}} festival celebrating the {{birthday}} of Rawat's guru was attended by over 500,000 people. Six Jumbo jets were chartered by American followers who paid extra so that South Americans could fly from New York to India for free. Other countries made similar arrangements to help the less financially able. On arrival, Indian customs impounded a suitcase containing cash, jewelry and wristwatches worth between US$27,000 and $80,000 which they said had not been properly declared. Rawat said, [...] "It has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> it {{is an attempt to}} harm the Divine Light Mission. When someone grows, others get jealous of him, and the Divine Light Mission has just blasted like an atomic bomb all over the world." [...] A DLM spokesman said that the money had been pooled by 3,000 followers to cover expenses, and that the valuables were gifts. The finances of Rawat and the DLM in India and overseas were investigated by the Indian government. In June 1973 the investigation was still under way, and Rawat had to post a $13,300 bond in order to leave the country. Charges were never filed, and the Indian government later issued an apology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} received media criticism {{due to her}} American accent {{upon her}} reintroduction in 2003. Johnson said, [...] "I knew that would happen because I'm the only character who speaks differently. I haven't taken any of that to heart." [...] However, when the accent was altered from American to British, this received criticism too with Ian Hyland from the Daily Mirror describing it as [...] "hilarious" [...] and branding the character [...] "Go Away Again Vicki". [...] He added, [...] "Presumably the producers decided the reason viewers found her so annoying was her whiny American voice. Try again, guys." [...] Upon her departure in 2004, Johnson was also critical about her character's alternating accent: [...] "When I took the job they weren't sure what accent they wanted Vicki to have and about a week before they told me it should be American. I did that {{for a few months}} and then one day out of the blue I arrived on set and they told me they wanted me to change to Cockney. It was the producer's decision. I was as stunned as everyone else - all the criticism was perfectly justified. It's probably the most stupid decision they could have made. People assumed I was slipping out of the accent - but it was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I've taken a lot of stick. But it doesn't bother me because I know the truth." ...|$|E

Her mother later said that the incident prompted Yeomans to tell her family, [...] "It is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Daddy, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Mummy, and <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you Sarah (her sister).
