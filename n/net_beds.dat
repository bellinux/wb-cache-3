40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} on a dissipative beach to quantify inner surf and swash-zone bed level change during periods of inundation and throughout a tidal cycle. Elevation changes were acquired at millimeter resolution with a new conductivity concentration profiler that allowed quantification of the bed level throughout {{the duration of the}} wave/swash cycle and also during periods of bed exposure. Bed level change spectra showed the highest energy at low frequencies even though event-scale <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> level changes were observed to exceed the tidal-scale <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> level change. <b>Net</b> <b>bed</b> level change for individual events was nearly normally distributed with most individual events displaying little or no <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> level change. "Large" erosion and accretion events with bed level elevation magnitudes that exceeded net tidal elevation change occurred with similar frequency. The similarity between the frequency of large erosion and large accretion events suggests that a few events may be ultimately responsible for the observed net elevation change over the tidal cycle. The large events displayed different hydrodynamic characteristics. Erosion events had longer duration onshore-directed flow and higher maximum onshore-directed velocity magnitude than offshore-directed velocity magnitude. The opposite was found for accretion events that had longer duration offshore-directed flow and a higher maximum offshore-directed velocity magnitude than onshore-directed velocity magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{progress}} {{made in the}} last decades, malaria persists as a pressing health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection and serious health outcomes for themselves and their unborn child. Risk can be mitigated through appropriate use of control measures such as insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Although social networks can influence uptake of preventive strategies, the role of social influence on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership has not been explored. During an evaluation of a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution programme, the influence of non-health care advisors on ownership and use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> by pregnant women in Kumasi, Ghana was examined. Methods: Data were collected through in-person interviews with 300 pregnant women seeking antenatal care in an urban hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Participants were asked about their <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership, <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use, and information about three personal contacts that they go to for pregnancy advice. Information about these advisors was combined into an influence score. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between the score and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership. Those who owned a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> were further assessed to determine if interpersonal influence was associated with self-reported sleeping under the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the previous night. Results: Of the 294 women in the analysis, 229 (78 %) reported owning <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Of these <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> owners, 139 (61 %) reported using a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the previous night. A dose response relationship was observed between the interpersonal influence score and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use. Compared to the lowest influence score, those with the highest influence score (> 1 SD above the mean) were marginally more likely to own a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> [OR = 2. 37, 95 % CI (0. 87, 6. 39) ] and much more likely to use their <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> [5. 38, 95 % CI (1. 89, 15. 25) ] after adjusting for other factors. Conclusions: Interpersonal influence appears to have modest impact on ownership and use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> by pregnant women in an urban area of Ghana. Further investigations would need to be conducted to determine if the relationship is causal or if individuals who associate are simply more likely to have similar practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{identify}} independent predictors for <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use, respondents from 643 households selected randomly from 21 clusters were interviewed in Mbarara municipality, Uganda. Respondents answered questions about demographic characteristics, social economic conditions, causes and transmission of malaria, beliefs about severity and complications of malaria, malaria morbidity and health care–seeking behavior, perceived control of malaria prevention, beliefs about utility of <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> perceived susceptibility to malaria, and whether they use <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> or not. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors for <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. Fifty-five percent (356 of 643) of the households had <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> users. The independent factors that favored <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use were as follows: 1) age � 30 years, 2) ownership of a television, 3) having mosquito nets in ventilators of the house, 4) being a skilled worker or a professional, or owning a major business, 5) living in a permanent house, 6) believing that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> prevent malaria, 7) believing that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are worth their cost, 8) not believing that convulsions cannot be cured by modern medicine, and 9) believing that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are not expensive. The strongest predictors of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use {{are living in a}} permanent house and agreeing that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are worth their cost, with adjusted odds ratios of 4. 29 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 76 – 6. 71) and 3. 93 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 5 – 26. 13), respectively.

40|$|While {{providing}} nursing care, in exceptional {{cases it}} is necessary to use restrictive measures to calm down a patient by applying physical restraints. However, since these are methods that seriously interfere with the patient´s personal liberty, {{it is necessary}} to observe certain principles {{in such a way that}} the methods minimize the risk of various complications, which may be both mental and physical, but also legal. Therefore, the indication for the use of these measures is especially the patient´s behavior that involves significant imminent danger or harm to the patient and others. The aim of our study was to determine what is the most frequent indication for putting the patient to a <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosure in traumatological and psychiatric wards, to find out whether nurses have at their disposal the standards developed in relation to restraints, to find out what nurses regard as advantages and disadvantages in placing patients into <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosures, to identify how nurses see the public´s attitude to the issue of the use of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> enclosures and to determine the public opinion on the use of <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosures. It can be seen from the results that over several years the approach to this issue of both the public and the medical management has changed and there is a readiness to use physical restraints or <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosures properly and in accordance with human rights and human dignity. This thesis may be used as a theoretical basis for training students of non-medical disciplines or in training nurses on the issue related to the restraints. Furthermore, it could be used as a guide for the public to get the notion how the restraints and <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosures are being used, how much attention is being paid to human dignity and personal liberty. This thesis also provides an overview of how the issue has evolved over time and what level it has reached at present. The issue of <b>net</b> <b>bed</b> enclosures and restraints in general is very "sensitive". Over the past ten years this issue has undergone many changes, has aroused indignation, but also understanding. Forms of restraints will certainly be the subject of a lot of negative or positive discussions in the future. It is important that nurses consider the patients, in which restraints have been applied, as their partners, that they meet all their needs and do their best to provide comfort taking into consideration their individualities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To combat malaria, the Kenya Ministry of Health {{and nongovernmental}} {{organizations}} (NGOs) have distributed insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for use over beds, with coverage for children under five years of age increasing rapidly. Nevertheless, residents of fishing villages have started to use these <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for drying fish and fishing in Lake Victoria. This study investigated the extent of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> misuse in fishing villages. Methods Seven fishing villages along the lake were surveyed to estimate how widely <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were being used for fishing and drying fish. Villagers were asked why they used the <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for such purposes. Results In total, 283 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were being used for drying fish. Of these, 239 were long-lasting insecticidal <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (LLIN) and 44 were non-long-lasting insecticidal <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (NLLIN). Further, 72 of the 283 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were also being used for fishing. The most popular reasons were because the <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were inexpensive or free and because fish dried faster on the nets. LLINs were preferred to NLLINs for fishing and drying fish. Conclusion There is considerable misuse of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for drying fish and fishing. Many villagers are not yet fully convinced {{of the effectiveness of}} LLINs for malaria prevention.

40|$|Background: Challenges {{persist in}} {{ensuring}} {{access to and}} optimal use of long-lasting, insecticidal <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (LLINs). Factors associated with ownership and use may differ depending {{on the history of}} malaria and prevention control efforts in a specific region. Understanding how the cultural and social-environmental context of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use may differ between high- and low-risk regions is important when identifying solutions to improve uptake and appropriate use. Methods: Community forums and a household, cross-sectional survey were used to collect information on factors related to <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use in western Kenya. Sites with disparate levels of transmission were selected, including an endemic lowland area, Miwani, and a highland epidemic-prone area, Kapkangani. Analysis of ownership was stratified by site. A combined site analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with use of all available <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Logistic regression modelling was used to determine factors associated with ownership and use of owned <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Results: Access to <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> as the leading barrier to their use was identified in community forums and cross-sectional surveys. While disuse of available <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> was discussed in the forums, it was a relatively rare occurrence in both sites. Factors associated with ownership varied by site. Education, perceived risk of malaria and knowledge of individuals who had died of malaria were associated with higher <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership in the highlands, while in the lowlands individuals reporting it was easy to get a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> were more likely to own one. A combined site analysis indicated that not using an available <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> was associated with the attitudes that taking malaria drugs is easier than using a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> and that use of a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> will not prevent malaria. In addition, individuals with an unused <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> in the household were more likely to indicate that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are difficult to use, that purchased <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are better than freely distributed ones, and that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> should only be used during the rainy season. Conclusion: Variations in factors associated with ownership should be acknowledged when constructing messaging and distribution campaigns. Despite reports of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> being used for other purposes, those in the home were rarely unused in these communities. Disuse seemed to be related to beliefs that can be addressed through education programmes.

40|$|Abstract. In Africa anopheline {{mosquitoes}} transmit malaria and {{lymphatic filariasis}} (LF); insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> significantly reduce transmission of both. Insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> provision to children under 5 (U 5) and pregnant women (PW) {{is a major}} goal of malaria control initiatives, but use in Africa remains low because of cost and logistics. We therefore integrated insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution with the 2004 LF/onchocerciasis mass drug administration (MDA) program in Central Nigeria. Community volunteers distributed 38, 600 insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> while simultaneously treating 150, 800 persons with ivermectin/albendazole (compared with 135, 600 in 2003). This was subsequently assessed with a 30 -cluster survey. Among surveyed households containing U 5 /PW, 80 % (95 % CI, 72 – 87 %) owned 1 insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net,</b> a 9 -fold increase from 2003. This first linkage of insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution with mass drug administration resulted in substantial improvement in insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> own-ership and usage, without adversely affecting mass drug administration coverage. Such integration allowed two programs to share resources while realizing mutual benefit, and is one model for rapidly improving insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage objectives...|$|R

40|$|Background Bed nets reduce malaria-related {{illness and}} deaths, by forming a {{protective}} barrier around people sleeping under them. When impregnated with long-lasting insecticide formulations they also repel or kill mosquitoes attempting to feed upon sleeping humans, {{and can even}} suppress entire populations of malaria vectors that feed predominantly upon humans. Nevertheless, an epidemiological study in 2012 demonstrated higher malaria prevalence among <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> users than non-users in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods Focus group discussions were conducted with women from four selected wards of Dar es Salaam city, focusing on four major themes relating to <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use behaviours: (1) reasons for <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use, (2) reasons for not using <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> (3) stimuli or reminders for people to use a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> (4) perceived reasons for catching malaria while using a <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> An analytical method by framework grouping of relevant themes was used address key issues of relevance to the study objectives. Codes were reviewed and grouped into categories and themes. Results All groups said {{the main reason for}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use was protection against malaria. Houses with well-screened windows, with doors that shut properly, and that use insecticidal sprays against mosquitoes, were said not to use <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> while frequent attacks from malaria was the main stimulus for people to use <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Various reasons were mentioned as potential reasons that compromise <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> efficacy, the most common of which were: (1) <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> sharing by two or more people, especially if one occupant tends to come to bed late at night, and does not tuck in the net 71...|$|R

Intra-household access was strongly associated with provincial residence, where the child was born and frequency of reading newspapers. Furthermore, disuse of available nets for children was associated with marital status, <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use of the head of the house-hold, and residing in rural communities at higher elevations.

40|$|Malaria {{is among}} the most common causes of death along Lake Tanganyika, a problem which many aid {{organizations}} have attempted to combat through the distribution of free mosquito <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> to high-risk communities. The Lake Tanganyika Floating Health Clinic (LTFHC), a health-based non-governmental organization (NGO), has observed residents of the Lake Tanganyika basin using <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> to fish small fry near the shoreline, despite a series of laws that prohibit <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use and other fine-gauge nets for fishing, implemented to protect the near-shore fish ecology. The LTFHC sought to quantify the sources of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and whether they were being used for fishing. The LTFHC conducted a survey of seven lakeside villages in Lagosa Ward, Tanzania. The government has divided each village into two to six pre-existing geographic sub-villages depending on population size. Seven households per sub-village were chosen at random for survey administration. The survey consisted of 23 questions regarding mosquito <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> practices, including the use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for fishing, as well as questions pertaining to any perceived changes to the fish supply. A total of 196 surveys were administered over a four-week period with a 100 % response rate. Over 87 % of households surveyed have used a mosquito <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> for fishing at some point. The majority of respondents reported receiving their <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> for free (96. 4 %), observing "many" residents of their village using <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for fishing (97. 4 %), and noticing a subjective decrease in the fish supply over time (64. 9 %).

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the level of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage in populations at risk of malaria infection. These revealed large variations in <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use across countries, regions and social strata. Such studies are often aimed at identifying populations with low access to <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> that should be prioritized in future interventions. However, often spatial differences in malaria endemicity are not taken into account. By ignoring variability in malaria endemicity, these studies prioritize populations with little access to <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> even if these happen to live in low endemicity areas. Conversely, populations living in regions with high malaria endemicity will receive a lower priority once a seizable proportion is protected by <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Adequately assigning priorities requires accounting for both {{the current level of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and the local malaria endemicity. Indeed, as shown here for 23 African countries, there is no correlation between the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and the level of malaria endemicity in a region. Therefore, the need for future interventions can not be assessed based on current <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage alone. This paper proposes the Adjusted Bed net Coverage (ABC) statistic as a measure taking into account both local malaria endemicity and the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. The measure allows setting priorities for future interventions taking into account both local malaria endemicity and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. Methods. A mathematical formulation of the ABC as a weighted difference of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and malaria endemicity is presented. The formulation is parameterized based on a model of malaria epidemiology (Smith et al. Trends Parasitol 25 : 511 - 516, 2009). By parameterizing the ABC based on this model, the ABC as used in this paper is proxy for the steady-state malaria burden given the current level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. Data on the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage in under five year olds and malaria endemicity in 23 Sub-Saharan countries is used to show that the ABC prioritizes different populations than the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage by itself. Data from the following countries was used: Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo Democratic Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The priority order given by the ABC and the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage are compared at the countries' level, the first level administrative divisions and for five different wealth quintiles. Results: Both at national level and {{at the level of the}} administrative divisions the ABC suggests a different priority order for selecting countries and divisions for future interventions. When taking into account malaria endemicity, measures assessing equality in access to <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> across wealth quintiles, such as slopes of inequality, are prone to change. This suggests that when assessing inequality in access to <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> one should take into account the local malaria endemicity for populations from different wealth quintiles. Conclusion: Accounting for malaria endemicity highlights different countries, regions and socio-economic strata for future intervention than the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage by itself. Therefore, care should be taken to factor out any effects of local malaria endemicity in assessing <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and in prioritizing populations for further scale-up of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. The ABC is proposed as a simple means to do this that is derived from an existing model of malaria epidemiology. © 2013 Vanderelst and Speybroeck; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

This study investigated the extent to which <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were used and which factors influence <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use among Jinuo Ethnic Minority in China-Myanmar-Laos border areas. This study combined a quantitative household questionnaire survey and qualitative semi-structured in-depth interviews (SDI). Questionnaires were administered to 352 heads of households. SDIs were given to 20 key informants. The <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> to person ratio was 1 ∶ 2. 1 (i. e., nearly one net for every two people), however only 169 (48. 0 %) households owned at least one net and 623 (47. 2 %) residents slept under <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> the prior night. The percentages of residents who regularly slept under nets (RSUN) and slept under nets the prior night (SUNPN) were similar (48. 0 % vs. 47. 2 %, P> 0. 05), however the percentage correct use of nets (CUN) was significantly lower (34. 5 %, P< 0. 0001). The annual cash income per person (ACIP) was an independent factor that influenced <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use (P< 0. 0001), where families with an ACIP of CNY 10000 or more were much more likely to use nets. House type was strongly associated with <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use (OR: 4. 71, 95 % CI: 2. 81, 7. 91; P< 0. 0001), where those with traditional wood walls and terracotta roofs were significantly more likely to use nets, and the head of household's knowledge was an independent factor (OR: 5. 04, 95 % CI: 2. 72, 9. 35; P< 0. 0001), where those who knew <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> prevent malaria were significantly more likely to use <b>nets</b> too.

Bed nets are widely used to prevent malaria; however, few data are available on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution within displaced populations. Mixed methods study in a single internally displaced persons (IDP) camp and neighboring community in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Qualitative data (focus group discussions, FGDs) and quantitative data (door-to-door survey and individual testing using malaria rapid diagnostic test, RDT) were collected. Ten FGDs were conducted with 55 individuals. Although malaria was widely recognized as a significant threat and <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were freely distributed in the camp, many households did not own or use them. IDPs converged on the following reasons for low <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use: inconvenience of net installation and sale of nets to meet immediate needs such as food. One hundred households, comprised of 411 individuals, were surveyed in Birambizo. The burden of malaria was high (45 / 78 (58 %) of children < 5 were positive for malaria by RDT) and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> utilization was low (29 / 100 (29 %) households owned a <b>bed</b> <b>net,</b> and 85 / 411 (20 %) individuals slept under a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the previous night).

A total of 1410 households and 6598 individuals were included in the study. Overall, the proportion of households with at least one net was 92 % while <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> usage was reported among 72 % of household members. Of the households surveyed, a total ownership of 2768 nets was reported, of which about 96 % were reportedly LLINs received from the ULC.

Net use at the household level was examined against four variables: <b>bed</b> availability, <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> availability, house size, and number of rooms. Results Bed net use by children between five and 15 years of age was lower than that among the other age classes. However, age was dropped from the final model, and sleeping arrangement was significantly associated with net use. Net use was significantly associated with bed availability, number of rooms and their interaction. Conclusion Net use was affected by sleeping arrangement and availability of suitable locations for hanging nets, in addition to net availability. Most residents had likely not realized that sleeping arrangement was a factor in net use. The ease of hanging a net is particularly important for children. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Universal {{long-lasting}} insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage (ULC) {{has reduced}} malaria {{morbidity and mortality}} across Africa. Although information is available on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use in specific groups, such as pregnant women and children under 5 years, there is paucity of data on their use among the general population. Bed net source, ownership and determinants of use among individuals from households in an eastern Rwanda community 8 months after a ULC were characterized. METHODS: Using household-based, interviewer-administered questionnaires and interviewer-direct observations, data on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> source, ownership and key determinants of net use, including demographics, socio-economic status indicators, house structure characteristics, {{as well as of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> quantity, type and integrity, were collected from 1400 randomly selected households. Univariate and mixed effects logistic regression modelling was done to assess for determinants of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. RESULTS: A total of 1410 households and 6598 individuals were included in the study. Overall, the proportion of households with at least one net was 92 % while <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> usage was reported among 72 % of household members. Of the households surveyed, a total ownership of 2768 nets was reported, of which about 96 % were reportedly LLINs received from the ULC. By interviewer-physical observation, 88 % of the nets owned were of the LLIN type with the remaining 12 % did not carry any mark to enable type recognition. The odds of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use were significantly lower among males and individuals: from households of low socio-economic status, from households with /=two sleeping spaces, and those reporting to have not slept on a bed. CONCLUSION: In this study, despite high a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage, over 25 % of members reported not to have slept under a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the night before the survey. Males were particularly less likely to use <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> even where nets were available. Household socio-economic status, number of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and type and number of sleeping spaces were key determinants of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. To maximize impact of ULC, strategies that target males as well as those that ensure ITN coverage for all, address barriers to feasible and convenient <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use including covering over all sleeping space types, and provide net hanging supports, are needed...|$|R

40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} increased funding for malaria control. Malaria experts {{have used the}} opportunity to advocate for rollout of such interventions as free <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> A free <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution strategy {{is seen as the}} quickest way to improve coverage of effective malaria control tools especially among poorest communities. Evidence to support this claim is however, sparse. This study explored the effectiveness of targeted free <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution strategy in achieving equity in terms of ownership and use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and also reduction of malaria prevalence among children under-five years of age. National malaria indicator survey (MIS) data from Angola, Tanzania and Uganda was used in the analysis. Hierarchical multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyse the relationship between variables of interest. Outcome variables were defined as: childhood test-confirmed malaria infections, household ownership of any mosquito net and children's use of any mosquito nets. Marginal effects of having free <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution on households with different wealth status were calculated. Angolan children from wealthier households were 6. 4 percentage points less likely to be parasitaemic than those in poorest households, whereas those from Tanzania and Uganda were less likely to test malaria positive by 7 and 11. 6 percentage points respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The study estimates and present results on the marginal effects based on the impact of free <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution on children's malaria status given their socio-economic background. Poorest households were less likely to own a net by 21. 4 % in Tanzania, and 2. 8 % in Uganda, whereas both poorer and wealthier Angolan households almost achieved parity in <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Wealthier households had a higher margin of using nets than poorest people in both Tanzania and Uganda by 11. 4 % and 3. 9 % respectively. However, the poorest household in Angola had a 6. 1 % net use advantage over children in wealthier households (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). This is the first study to use nationally representative data to explore inequalities in <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership and related consequences on childhood malaria infection rates across different countries. While targeted distribution of free <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> improved overall <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership, it did not overcome ownership inequalities as measured by household socioeconomic status. Use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> was disproportionately lower among poorest children, except for Angola where <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use was higher among poorest households when compared to children in wealthier households. The study highlights the need for malaria control world governing bodies and policy makers to continue working on finding appropriate strategies to improve access to effective malaria control tools especially by the poorest who often times bears the brunt of malaria burden than their wealthier counterparts...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundInsecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (ITNs), used {{extensively}} to reduce human exposure to malaria, work through {{physical and chemical}} means to block or deter host-seeking mosquitoes. Despite the importance of ITNs, very {{little is known about}} how host-seeking mosquitoes behave around occupied <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> As a result, evidence-based evaluations of the effects of physical damage on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> effectiveness are not possible and there is a dearth of knowledge on which to base ITN design. MethodsThe dispersion of colony-raised female Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles albimanus was observed in 2 -hr laboratory experiments in which up to 200 mosquitoes were released inside a mosquito-proof 320 m 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03032 ̆ 01422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030320 m tent housing a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> arrayed with 18 3020 cm 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03032 ̆ 01422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0303020 cm sticky screen squares on the sides, ends and roof. Numbers of mosquitoes caught on the sticky squares were interpreted as the 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆dcmosquito pressure 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 on that part of the net. ResultsPresence of a human subject in the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> significantly increased total mosquito pressure on the net for both species and significantly re-oriented An. gambiae to the roof of the net. Anopheles albimanus pressure was greatest on the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> roof in both host-present and no-host conditions. The effects of different human subjects in the <b>bed</b> <b>net,</b> of different ambient conditions (dry, cool conditions vs warm, humid conditions) and of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> treatment (deltamethrin-treated or no insecticide) on mosquito pressure patterns were tested for both species. Species-specific pressure patterns did not vary greatly as a result of any of these factors though some differences were noted that may be due the size of the different human subjects. ConclusionsAs a result of the interaction between host-seeking responses and the convective plume from the net occupant, species-specific mosquito pressure patterns manifest more or less predictably on the <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> This has implications for <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> design and suggests that current methods of assessing damaged <b>bed</b> <b>nets,</b> which do not take damage location into account, should be modified...|$|R
40|$|Background: Malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death in Mozambique in {{children}} under five years old. In 2009, Mozambique developed a novel <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution model to increase coverage, based on assumptions about sleeping patterns. The coverage and impact of a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution campaign using this model in four districts in Sofala Province, Mozambique was evaluated. Methods: Paired household, cross-sectional surveys were conducted one month after the 2010 distribution of 140, 000 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and again 14 months after the campaign in 2011. During household visits, malaria blood smears were performed and haemoglobin levels were assessed on children under five and data on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership, access and use were collected; these indicators were analysed at individual, household and community levels. Logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of malaria infection and anaemia.

40|$|Background/MethodsQualitative {{studies suggest}} that <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> affect the thermal comfort of users. To {{understand}} and reduce this discomfort the effect of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> on temperature, humidity, and airflow was measured in rural homes in Asia and Africa, {{as well as in}} an experimental wind tunnel. Two investigators with architectural training selected 60 houses in The Gambia, Tanzania, Philippines, and Thailand. Data-loggers were used to measure indoor temperatures in hourly intervals over a 12  months period. In a subgroup of 20 houses airflow, temperature and humidity were measured at five-minute intervals for one night from 21. 00 to 6. 00  hrs inside and outside of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> using sensors and omni-directional thermo-anemometers. An investigator set up a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> with a mesh size of 220 holes per inch 2 in each study household and slept under the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> to simulate a realistic environment. The attenuation of airflow caused by <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> of different mesh sizes was also measured in an experimental wind tunnel. Results The highest indoor temperatures (49. 0  C) were measured in The Gambia. During the hottest months of the year the mean temperature at night (9  pm) was between 33. 1  C (The Gambia) and 26. 2  C (Thailand). The <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> attenuated the airflow from a minimum of 27 % (Philippines) to a maximum of 71 % (The Gambia). Overall the <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> reduced airflow compared to un-attenuated airflow from 9 to 4  cm sec- 1 or 52 % (p &lt;  0. 001). In all sites, no statistically significant difference in temperature or humidity was detected between the inside and outside of the <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> Wind tunnel experiments with 11 different mesh-sized <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> showed an overall reduction in airflow of 64 % (range 55 - 71 %) compared to un-attenuated airflow. As expected, airflow decreased with increasing net mesh size. Nets with a mesh of 136 holes inch- 2 reduced airflow by 55 % (mean; range 51 - 73 %). A denser net (200 holes inch- 2) attenuated airflow by 59 % (mean; range 56 - 74 %). Discussion Despite concerted efforts to increase the uptake of this intervention in many areas uptake remains poor. Bed nets reduce airflow, but have no influence on temperature and humidity. The discomfort associated with <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> is likely to be most intolerable during the hottest and most humid period of the year, which frequently coincides with the peak of malaria vector densities and the force of pathogen transmission.

40|$|ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Malaria {{remains a}} big {{challenge}} in Africa where 45 countries, including Nigeria, are endemic for the disease. Pregnant women living in malaria-endemic countries are of interest because of the reduced immunity during pregnancy. Reports show that malaria control efforts {{by the government and}} other programs like Roll Back Malaria might not be effective due to limited resources. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the knowledge of pregnant Nigerian women regarding malaria and their behavior towards the use of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> as a method for malaria control. Specifically, this study examined the effect of malaria knowledge on the use of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> among pregnant Nigerian women. This study will provide insight for a further study. METHODS: The study was conducted at the Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria. The study population consisted of 61 pregnant women that attended the antenatal care clinic. Questionnaires were given to women who gave their consent and the questionnaires were self administered. RESULTS: The pregnant women had very good knowledge of the general knowledge on malaria. However, the amount of pregnant women who choose the correct answer reduced with questions pertaining to malaria’s effect on the mother and fetus health. General knowledge had no effect on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use but the more knowledgeable the pregnant women were in regards to how malaria affected the mother’s health and fetus’ health, the more likely they were to use <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> In this study, 73 % of the women used <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> Conclusion: In this study, the use of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> was higher than other studies and this might have been due to <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> been distributed at the clinic. Even though many of the women used <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> and other preventive measures, about 56 % of the pregnant women had experienced malaria during their current pregnancy. General knowledge on malaria did not seem to affect <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use; however, knowledge on the consequences of malaria affected <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. The pregnant women who had the knowledge of how malaria affected the fetus were more likely to use <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> For programs like Roll Back Malaria and other government programs to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate due to malaria, it will be beneficial to provide the pregnant women tailored information about the health consequences of malaria and how malaria affects the mother and the fetus.

40|$|Background: Insecticide treated {{materials}} {{remain the}} mainstay for malaria prevention. The current study {{reports on the}} entomological impact of cyfluthrin impregnated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> on malaria transmission in Mbandjock, a semi urban locality in southern Cameroon. Several findings pertaining to the recent distribution of LLINs across Cameroon are discussed. Methods: Malaria transmission and vector bionomics were monitored before and after impregnated net coverage. Bed nets were distributed in Mbandjock, whereas the locality of Nkoteng was free of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> during the entire study period. January to June 1997 represented the period before <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and September 1997 to September 1998 was the period after <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. Adult mosquitoes were collected by human landing catches. Mosquito genus and species were identified with morphological and molecular diagnostic tools. Anopheline salivary glands and ovaries were dissected to determine female infectious status and parity rates respectively. Results: A total of 6959 anophelines corresponding to 6029 in Mbandjock and 930 in Nkoteng were collected {{in the course of}} the study. Seven species were recorded in both cities : Anopheles coustani, An. funestus, An. gambiae sl, An. moucheti, An. ziemanni, An. nili and An. paludis. An. gambiae s. l. (> 95 % An. gambiae S molecular form) was the most abundant species representing 75. 6 % and 86. 6 % of the total anophelines caught in Mbandjock before and after <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage respectively. The human biting rate (HBR) in Mbandjock decreased from 17 bites/human/night before <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage to less than 4 bites/human/night during the first 7 months following impregnated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. A significant decrease of mosquito parity rate was recorded when comparing the period before (52 %) and after (46. 5 %) <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution. The average infection rate of malaria vectors significantly decreased from 5. 3 % before to 1. 8 % after <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage (p < 0. 0001). The entomological inoculation rate in Mbandjock was reduced by 74 % varying from 124. 1 infected bites/human/year before <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution, to 32. 5 infected bites/human/year after <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. All entomological indexes were relatively stable in Nkoteng and no reduction of malaria transmission was recorded in this locality. Conclusion: The study confirms the effectiveness of cyfluthrin impregnated nets in reducing malaria transmission. Lessons from this study could be essential to draw guidelines for the management of the recent nationwide distribution of LLINs across Cameroon in 2011...|$|R

40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in the tropical parts of the world, causing about 1. 5 to 2. 7 million deaths annually. Ninety percent of these deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and 5 % of children die from the disease before reaching 5 years. Malaria is responsible globally for 500 million clinical cases and represents a public health problem for 2. 4 billion people. People living in lowland areas, where malaria is common, acquire some degree of immunity against it due to frequent exposure. In the highland areas, however, people don’t have immunity against the disease. If malaria is introduced to such a highland area, people are at a higher risk of getting serious malaria and epidemics (highland malaria). The spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum throughout the African continent has stimulated a search for alternative technologies that may play a role in the malaria control strategy. Insecticide treated nets have been clearly proven to reduce transmission, morbidity and mortality rates of malaria in many high-endemic malaria countries. Studies have shown that use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> is relatively uncommon in many communities, but there is limited information about the reasons behind this, especially in areas where malaria has recently been introduced. The objective of this study is to describe factors influencing the use and re-impregnation of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> in an area where malaria has recently been introduced. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in three highland villages in Tanzania from September to November 2001. The study consisted of two methods. First, a quantitative household survey was conducted; thereafter 12 informants took part in a qualitative inquiry using semi-structured interviews. The quantitative survey used a two-stage stratified sampling procedure in which 303 households - 100 without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> all, 100 with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 103 with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> - were identified, and the heads of households interviewed. A survey team consisting of 3 persons conducted the interviews. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to interview the subjects at their homes. Finger pricking was used to obtain blood samples, which were examined for malaria parasites. Data analysis was done using SPSS for Windows, version 11. 0. Chi squared (χ²) or Gamma tests were used for analysis of categorical data, T-test was used for numerical data in two groups at a time and odds ratios were used to measure the strength of the association between independent and dependent variables. The level of significance was set to P< 0. 05 at 95 % CI. In the qualitative part, a purposeful sampling approach was used to select informants. Hand-written notes were taken during the interviews. The analysis started during the data gathering. Later, the material was read through in order to identify common themes, code parts of the text, identify similarities and generate concepts. It was found in this study that households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had significantly younger household heads (mean age 32. 71 years) than those with untreated (36. 72 years) and no nets (42. 10 years). Heads of households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had a significantly higher overall level of knowledge about malaria, <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides - with an average score of 26. 97 out of 29 knowledge questions (93 %) - than households with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (83 %) and without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (73 %). They were also significantly more literate (98 % vs. 75 % and 55 %, respectively), and had spent more time in school (7. 0 years vs. 4. 5 and 3. 3 years, respectively). Households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had a much higher average income per person per year (Tshs. 69, 499) than households with untreated (Tshs. 29, 773) and no nets (Tshs. 23, 372), and the differences were significant. A higher proportion of the households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had heads who felt that insecticides were expensive (67 %) than households with untreated (49 %) and treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (18 %). These findings were statistically significant. Almost all of the households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (99 %) had heads who believed that insecticides have no side effects, as compared to 85 % of household heads with untreated, and 76 % of households without, <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Again, the differences were statistically significant. Almost all households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had heads who indicated that insecticides were available in their villages (99 %), as compared to 78 % of households with untreated nets and 63 % of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> These differences were statistically significant. There were also significant differences regarding the perception of insecticides. All household heads with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> felt that insecticides help “very much” in the prevention of malaria, as compared to 95 % of households with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 83 % of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Thirteen percent of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 4 % with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> said insecticides help to prevent malaria to “a certain extent”. The qualitative part of this study explored lay people’s own understandings of these issues. It seemed clear that many people perceived malaria as a major health threat in their villages, and they thought that the seriousness and complications of the disease were the cause of their low economical status. The majority believed that malaria was caused by mosquito bites and that a lack of use of treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and a lack of destruction of mosquito breeding sites contributed to it. Many people knew how malaria could be transmitted and prevented, but some people did not seek medical treatment early due to social and local traditions and beliefs. Many people perceived the use of insecticide treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> as an effective way of preventing malaria, but some believed that insecticides could cause harmful effects to human beings. Many informants said that people do not treat their <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> because they don’t have enough money, and half said that they fear side effects of insecticides. Some said people do not treat their <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> because they don’t understand very well how insecticides could prevent malaria and because they don’t see mosquitoes in their hamlets, especially during the dry season. Only one informant said the reason was that sometimes insecticides are not available in his village. This study concludes that low levels of knowledge about malaria, <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides, unaffordability of insecticides, unavailability of insecticides, misconceptions about the effectiveness of insecticides, and myths about side effects of insecticides are associated with low rates of use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> with insecticides. Younger persons seem to adapt to nets and insecticides significantly better than older persons. It is recommended that the designing and implementation of ITN programs, should consider all the factors associated with the use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> A joint effort from a combination of different disciplines and sectors is needed to overcome these obstacles. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities should be designed in such a way that they would reach the entire population in the area, but special efforts should also be considered in order to reach the less beneficial groups who are the majority without ITNs. Innovative ways of reaching poor households should be explored. Income-generating projects should be considered in these villages since the purchasing power is so low. The price of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides should be made affordable through subsidisation especially in areas where malaria has recently been introduced. Different types of colours, sizes and types of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> should be made available to satisfy the preferences of the customers. Several different sales points of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides should be considered to maintain the availability. Any big construction project in developing countries should include a health impact assessment and mitigation program like the one that was implemented at the Lower Kihansi 5461 Hydropower project in Tanzania...|$|R

To examine the long-term resistance, 31 PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were also distributed among villagers, and were re-collected to perform bioassay tests after 1, 2 and 5 years. In the first phase of this study, the insecticidal effect of the conventionally-treated nets significantly decreased due to repeated washings (P < 0. 001); however, it was not significant regarding PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (P = 0. 92 in continuous exposure and P = 0. 12 in mortality tests). In the long-term phase of this study, the time required for knockdown of PermaNet® 2. 0 increased over the first 2 years and then decreased.

40|$|Abstract Background Malaria is {{the most}} {{prominent}} disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) have been distributed free of charge since 2006 to combat the disease. However, {{the success of this}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> campaign depends on sufficient <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use in all age groups. This study was designed to examine the factors affecting <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use in villages outside of Kinshasa. Methods Two villages along the Congo River, totalling 142 households with 640 residents, were surveyed using a standard questionnaire. The interview determined the number, ages, and sexes of family members; the education level of the family head; the number, colour, and type of nets owned; and the number of nets used in the previous night. The size of house was also measured, and numbers of rooms and beds were recorded. These variables were examined to reveal important factors that affect <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. Results A total of 469 nets were counted, and nearly all nets were white LLINs. Of these nets, 229 (48. 8 %) nets were used by 284 (44. 4 %) residents. Bed nets were used by over 90 % of children 5 to 15 years of age, whereas less than 50 % of the residents in other age groups used <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> The important variables affecting <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use were numbers of beds and rooms {{in the house and the}} education level of the family head of household. Conclusion Education was the most important factor affecting <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use in the villages outside Kinshasa. Development of an educational programme, particularly one directed toward parents, is necessary to reduce misconceptions and increase prevalence of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use among all age groups. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The Imagine No Malaria {{campaign}} has seen success {{in many different}} areas in Africa. In April 2010, in a coordinated effort with many different religious faiths and institutions, 25,000 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were distributed in Lubumbashi, DRC. [...] In another effort, the program distributed 5,000 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> in Nyadire, Zimbabwe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> are {{the preeminent}} malaria control means; {{though there is}} no {{consensus}} as to a best practice for large-scale insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution. In order to determine the paramount distribution method, this review assessed literature on recent insecticide treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution programmes throughout sub-Saharan Eastern Africa. Inclusion criteria were that the study had taken place in sub-Saharan Eastern Africa, targeted malaria prevention and control, and occurred between 1996 and 2007. Forty-two studies were identified and reviewed. The results indicate that distribution frameworks varied greatly; and consequently so did outcomes of insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. Studies revealed consistent inequities between urban and rural populations; which were most effectively alleviated through a free insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> delivery and distribution framework. However, cost sharing through subsidies was shown to increase programme sustainability, which may lead to more long-term coverage. Thus, distribution should employ a catch up/keep up programme strategy. The catch-up programme rapidly scales up coverage, while the keep-up programme maintains coverage levels. Future directions for malaria should include progress toward distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets. </p...|$|R
