5|$|District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) {{operates}} the city's 123 public schools. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> DCPS steadily decreased for 39 years until 2009. In the 2010–11 school year, 46,191 students {{were enrolled in}} the public school system. DCPS has one of the highest-cost yet lowest-performing school systems in the country, both in terms of infrastructure and student achievement. Mayor Adrian Fenty's administration made sweeping changes to the system by closing schools, replacing teachers, firing principals, and using private education firms to aid curriculum development.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{services}} in Deir al-Balah {{are under the}} jurisdiction of the Khan Yunis Directorate of Higher Education. There were a total of 85 schools in the Deir al-Balah Governorate in 2007-08 according to the PNA's Ministry of Education and Higher Education. The Palestinian government operated 39 school while four were privately owned. The remainder were run by UNRWA and were mostly located in refugee camps in Deir al-Balah's vicinity. The total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the governorate was 67,693, of which 50.3% were male 49.7% female.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E

25|$|If 50% of {{the total}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{students}}</b> <b>in</b> the class are male, that means that 50 out of every 100 students are male. If there are 500 students, then 250 of them are male.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{inflation}} during the later portion of Arroyo's administration was so high. Common consumer goods became prohibitive in cost. There was a marked decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> universities. Privately owned universities closed in numbers.|$|E
50|$|In September 2007, the {{freshman}} class had about 320 students, {{a significant increase}} over the school's other classes, which had fewer than 300 each. The school hired more teachers to keep the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> each classroom below 30.|$|R
50|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> {{enrolled}} <b>in</b> the college's {{higher education}} provision has grown considerably {{over the last}} decade. In 2009/2010 there were 450 undergraduate students on degree courses.

50|$|With rising <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> <b>in</b> the {{following}} years the proportion of paid teaching staff rose, as did the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> professorships. A degree could not be awarded by the Hochschule für Politik until the mid-1920s, due to the difficulties in making the education sufficiently academic.|$|R
25|$|In 1982 John Illston succeeded Sir Norman Lindop as the director. A {{sports hall}} {{was built on}} the Hatfield Campus in 1984 and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> that year was more than 5000. The number of staff, in the same year, had {{increased}} to 824.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005 Cumberland {{adopted a}} {{long-term}} {{plan for the}} school. One call of {{the plan is to}} gradually downsize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> order to provide smaller classes and closer individual attention to students. In 1995 the entering class was 212 and by 2007 that number had been reduced to 159.|$|E
25|$|Over 60% of {{university}} {{students in the}} region are native to the region. The region with the next-highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the North-West is Yorkshire and the Humber, so approximately 80% {{of university}} students in the area are from the north of England.

25|$|In {{the colonial}} era, the gurukul system {{began to decline}} as the system {{promoted}} by the British began to gradually take over. Between 1881–82 and 1946–47, the number of English primary schools grew from 82,916 to 134,866 and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> English Schools grew from 2,061,541 to 10,525,943. Literacy rates in accordance to British in India rose from 3.2 per cent in 1881 to 7.2 per cent in 1931 and 12.2 per cent in 1947.|$|E
25|$|After Libya's {{independence}} in 1951, its first university– the University of Libya– {{was established in}} Benghazi by royal decree. In the 1975–76 academic year the number of university students {{was estimated to be}} 13,418. , this number has increased to more than 200,000, with an extra 70,000 enrolled in the higher technical and vocational sector. The rapid increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> the higher education sector has been mirrored by {{an increase in the number}} of institutions of higher education.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} {{religious}} segregation causing greater society wide segregation {{can be seen}} in private schools. When parents choose {{to send their children to}} private schools, they are often religious institutions, and because religious institutions are often racially segregated, this means that students are in turn in racially segregated classrooms. There is some concern that an increase in the use of school vouchers in the United States will also then increase the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> segregated schools, as school vouchers are generally used to send children to private religious institutions.|$|E
25|$|With the war's ever {{increasing}} need for able bodied men consuming America's labor {{force in the}} early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements. Consequently, many states had to change their child-labor laws to allow these teenagers to work. The lures of patriotism, adulthood, and money led many youth {{to drop out of}} school and take a defense job. Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6 million in 1944, as a million students—and many teachers—took jobs.|$|E
25|$|The {{undergraduate}} {{student body}} {{government is the}} UC San Diego Associated Students, organized as a cabinet and senate, while graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Association, a proportional representative body with membership depending on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> each graduate department. Additionally, graduate students who serve as teaching assistants are represented by the UC-wide union of Academic Student Employees. Each of the six residential colleges has its own student council as well. Most student media publications distributed on-campus are services provided and governed by ASUCSD, including Triton TV, a film studio and TV station, and the KSDT radio station. A notable exception is The Guardian, which is directly governed by the university's Student Affairs department.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>of</b> raising <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> Regensburg, the {{government}} of Oberpfalz decided to expand the educational offers of the Bauschule in Regensburg.

25|$|In 1873, Stebbing {{produced}} {{his first}} paper on crustaceans, {{and began to}} study the Amphipoda the following year. In 1877, Stebbing moved to Royal Tunbridge Wells, where he lived in Ephraim Lodge, {{on the edge of}} Tunbridge Wells Common, to benefit from the greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> London, and to be closer to the libraries, museums and scientific circles in the capital. As his finances improved, he was able to give up teaching altogether and concentrate on writing. He died in Ephraim Lodge on 8 July 1926. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Church, Rusthall, where Stebbing had officiated when requested; since its churchyard was inadequate, Stebbing's body was buried in the town's public cemetery. His wife survived him by only a few months.|$|E
25|$|An August 2009 study {{published}} in Megamot by Sorel Cahan of Hebrew University's School of Education demonstrated that the Israeli Education Ministry's budget for special assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds severely discriminated against Arabs. It also showed that the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This {{was the result of}} the allocation method used – assistance funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems, according to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the largest proportion of such students in the Arab system, they received less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said that it had already decided to discontinue this allotment method in favor of a uniform index method, without first dividing the funds between the school systems.|$|E
25|$|Technical education, {{which is}} {{provided}} in three-year and five-year programs, includes schools in three different fields: industrial, commercial and agricultural. The UN and other multilateral organizations are working towards improving the technical and vocational training system in Egypt. It is recommended to the Ministry of Education to introduce broad vocational skills in the curricula of general secondary schools. In this way students {{will be able to}} gain certification in practical skills needed in the job market. The Ministry of Education (MoE) controls pre-tertiary, school-based programs that can start after grade 6 and that enroll the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> TVET-over 2 million students. The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) controls the middle technical institutes (MTIs). These draw their enrollments from MoE's general secondary schools or technical schools and have much smaller enrollment numbers. Graduates of the MoE's vocational programs can enter vocational training centers (VTCs). From the 2004 data, it is estimated that 30 percent of the secondary students have opted for the vocational track.|$|E
40|$|A peer {{teaching}} {{program was}} implemented {{to alleviate the}} problem <b>of</b> a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lab instructors attempting to teach large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>in</b> two different undergraduate microbiology lab courses. The benefit of having peer teachers was immediately obvious to the lab instructors, faculty and staff who were responsible for conducting the labs, but it was soon evident that there were also benefits for everyone else involved in the program. The <b>students</b> enrolled <b>in</b> the labs reported that having peer teachers in the lab enhanced their learning, and they felt comfortable receiving help from a peer teacher who had recently completed the course. The peer teachers discovered that they gained valuable experience and confidence while teaching other students, and they appreciated the chance to gain hands-on experience.
