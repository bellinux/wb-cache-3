5|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>diffraction</b> is an {{excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E

The cytosol of many microorganisms, isolated from saline environments, reversibly accumulates molar concentrations of the osmolyte ectoine to counterbalance fluctuating external salt concentrations.

25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} {{refers to}} the wave nature of electrons. However, from a technical or practical point of view, it may {{be regarded as a}} technique used to study matter by firing electrons at a sample and observing the resulting interference pattern. This phenomenon is commonly known as wave–particle duality, which states that a particle of matter (in this case the incident electron) can be described as a wave. For this reason, an electron can be regarded as a wave much like sound or water waves. This technique is similar to X-ray and <b>neutron</b> <b>diffraction.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the {{industry}} strives to reduce {{maintenance and repair}} costs, non-destructive testing of structures becomes increasingly valued both in production control and {{as a means to}} measure the utilization and condition of key infrastructure. There are several measurement techniques to measure stress in a material. However, techniques using optical measurements, magnetic measurements, X-ray diffraction, and <b>neutron</b> <b>diffraction</b> are all limited to measuring surface or near surface stress or strains. Acoustic waves propagate with ease through materials and provide thus a means to probe the interior of structures, where the stress and strain level is important for the overall structural integrity.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{electron}} diffraction {{is often}} {{regarded as a}} qualitative technique suitable for symmetry determination, but too inaccurate for determination of lattice parameters and atomic positions. But there are also several examples where unknown crystal structures (inorganic, organic and biological) have been solved by electron crystallography. Lattice parameters of high accuracy can in fact be obtained from electron diffraction, relative errors less than 0.1% have been demonstrated. However, the right experimental conditions {{may be difficult to}} obtain, and these procedures are often viewed as too time-consuming and the data too difficult to interpret. X-ray or <b>neutron</b> <b>diffraction</b> are therefore often the preferred methods for determining lattice parameters and atomic positions.|$|E

2500|$|Bragg {{diffraction}} (also {{referred to}} as the Bragg formulation of X-ray diffraction) was first proposed by William Lawrence Bragg and his father William Henry Bragg in 1913 in response to their discovery that crystalline solids produced surprising patterns of reflected X-rays (in contrast to that of, say, a liquid). [...] They found that these crystals, at certain specific wavelengths and incident angles, produced intense peaks of reflected radiation.

2500|$|In a liquid, atoms do {{not form}} a {{crystalline}} lattice, {{nor do they}} show {{any other form of}} long-range order.

In radial direction, the diffraction intensity smoothly oscillates. This is usually described by the static structure factor S(q), with wavenumber q=(4π/λ)sinθ given by the wavelength λ of the probe (photon or neutron) and the Bragg angle θ. The oscillations of S(q) express the near order of the liquid, i.e. the correlations between an atom and a few shells of nearest, second nearest, ... neighbors.|$|E
