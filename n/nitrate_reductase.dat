25|$|Nitric oxide (NO) — {{serves as}} signal in {{hormonal}} and defense responses (e.g. stomatal closure, root development, germination, nitrogen fixation, cell death, stress response). NO {{can be produced}} by a yet undefined NO synthase, a special type of nitrite reductase, <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase or non enzymatic processes and regulate plant cell organelle functions (e.g. ATP synthesis in chloroplasts and mitochondria).|$|E
25|$|In plants, {{nitric oxide}} can be {{produced}} by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also {{plays a role in}} plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before wilting.|$|E
25|$|Ammonium {{is thought}} to be the {{preferred}} source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (<b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase).</b> There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus. These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.|$|E
50|$|Eukaryotic <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> {{are part}} of the sulfite oxidase family of molybdoenzymes. They {{transfer}} electrons from NADH or NADPH to nitrate.|$|R
40|$|Many {{species of}} Bacteria and Archaea respire nitrate using a molybdenum-dependent membrane-bound {{respiratory}} system called Nar. Classically, the ‘Bacterial’ Nar system is oriented such that nitrate reduction {{takes place on}} the inside of this membrane. However, the active site subunit of the ‘Archaeal’ Nar systems has a twin arginine (‘RR’) motif, which is a suggestion of translocation to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. These ‘Archaeal’ type of <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> are {{part of a group of}} molybdoenzymes with an ‘RR’ motif that are predicted to have an aspartate ligand to the molybdenum ion. This group includes selenate reductases and possible sequence signatures are described that serve to distinguish the Nar <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> from the selenate reductases. The ‘RR’ sequences of <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> of Archaea and some that have recently emerged in Bacteria are also considered and it is concluded that there is good evidence for there being both Archaeal and Bacterial examples of Nar-type <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> with an active site on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, the bioenergetic consequences of nitrate reduction on the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane have been explored...|$|R
50|$|<b>Nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> are molybdoenzymes {{that reduce}} nitrate (NO) to nitrite (NO). This {{reaction}} {{is critical for}} the production of protein in most crop plants, as nitrate is the predominant source of nitrogen in fertilized soils.|$|R
25|$|In all the studied cases, carnivory allows {{plants to}} grow and {{reproduce}} using animals {{as a source of}} nitrogen, phosphorus and possibly potassium. However, there is a spectrum of dependency on animal prey. Pygmy sundews are unable to use nitrate from soil because they lack the necessary enzymes (<b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase</b> in particular). Common butterworts (Pinguicula vulgaris) can use inorganic sources of nitrogen better than organic sources, but a mixture of both is preferred. European bladderworts seem to use both sources equally well. Animal prey makes up for differing deficiencies in soil nutrients.|$|E
25|$|The sundew genus (Drosera) {{consists}} of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne {{at the end}} of long tentacles, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey (thigmotropism) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of D. burmanii can bend 180° in a minute or so. Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the Antarctic mainland. They are most diverse in Australia, the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as D. pygmaea and to a number of tuberous sundews such as D. peltata, which form tubers that aestivate during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.|$|E
25|$|Independent of {{nitric oxide}} synthase, an {{alternative}} pathway, coined the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, {{have been shown}} to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant-derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet.|$|E
40|$|Two <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases,</b> NRA and NRZ, {{are present}} in Escherichia coli. These {{isoenzymes}} have the same αβγ, subunits composition and have similar size and genetic organization. Corresponding subunits of the complexes share at least 75 % Identity. By subcloning the different genes and expressing them from separate transcriptional units, we have demonstrated (i) that the translation of the subunits and their assembly are not coupled processes, since subunits produced concomitantly but independently can meet efficiently and associate to form active enzymes, and (ii) that the α subunit of a given complex can be replaced by its counterpart from the other isoenzyme to yield an active membrane-bound heterologous enzyme. One such heterologous enzyme, αAβZγZ, has been purified; it is less stable than the native enzymes, more susceptible to thermal denaturation, and shows increased sensitivity to proteolysis. It is also less stably bound to the membrane and, consequently, its activity with physiological electron donors is drastically reduced. The possibility that heterologous <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> could be formed in vivo is discussed {{with reference to the}} existence of porin heterotrimers of the outer membrane proteins OmpC, OmpF and PhoE.

Nitrate-induced seedlings contained more NADH-nitrate reductase than NAD(P) H-nitrate reductase, whereas chloramphenicol-induced seedlings contained primarily NAD(P) H-nitrate reductase.

5000|$|Cytochromes b5 are {{ubiquitous}} electron transport hemoproteins {{found in}} animals, plants, fungi and purple phototrophic bacteria. The microsomal and mitochondrial variants are membrane-bound, while bacterial and those from erythrocytes and other animal tissues are water-soluble.

500|$|Sundews are {{perennial}} (or rarely annual) herbaceous plants, forming prostrate or upright rosettes between [...] in height, {{depending on}} the species. Climbing species form scrambling stems which can reach much longer lengths, up to [...] {{in the case of}} D.erythrogyne. Sundews {{have been shown to be}} able to achieve a lifespan of 50 years. The genus is specialized for nutrient uptake through its carnivorous behavior, for example the pygmy sundew is missing the enzymes (<b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> in particular) that plants normally use for the uptake of earth-bound nitrates.|$|E
500|$|The {{other common}} {{adaptation}} is {{the possession of}} cluster roots, which allow it to extract enough nutrients {{to survive in the}} oligotrophic soils in which it grows. With the onset of autumn rains, the lateral roots form dense surface mats of cluster roots in the top [...] of soil, just below the leaf litter, where most minerals are concentrated. These roots exude chemicals that enhance mineral solubility, greatly increasing the availability and uptake of nutrients in impoverished soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. For as long as surface water is available, they take in water and a range of minerals. In B.prionotes they are principally responsible for the uptake of malate, phosphate, chloride, sodium and potassium. When soils are high in nitrates, they may also perform some <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase</b> activities, primarily the conversion of ammonium into amino acids such as asparagine and glutamine.|$|E
2500|$|Anaerobic bacteria, {{which do}} not use oxygen as a {{terminal}} electron acceptor, have terminal reductases individualized to their terminal acceptor.

Two strains of L. fermenti also reduced nitrates. In static culture, agar and anaerobiosis were not essential for nitrate reduction, contrary to speculations in the literature. Nitrate reduction was possible only in media with restricted carbohydrate and with the pH value maintained a t a relatively high value within the activity range of <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases.</b> For good growth, lactobacilli for the nitrate test have been customarily grown in media with high carbohydrate content, with consequent low final pH values.

2500|$|Denitrification is the {{utilization}} of nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] It is a widespread process {{that is used by}} many members of the Proteobacteria. [...] Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential. [...] Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric iron (...) and some organic electron acceptors. [...] Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to nitrite (...) , nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (...) , and dinitrogen (...) by the enzymes <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase,</b> nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. [...] Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration. [...] Some organisms (e.g. E. coli) only produce <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductase</b> and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite. [...] Others (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans or Pseudomonas stutzeri) reduce nitrate completely. [...] Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important greenhouse gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce nitric acid, a component of acid rain. [...] Denitrification is also important in biological wastewater treatment where it is used {{to reduce the amount of}} nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.|$|E

40|$|The {{short-lived}} radiotracer 13 N {{was used}} to study feedback regulation of nitrate influx through the inducible high-affinity transport system of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Steptoe) roots.

The result with the mutant, in which the flux of nitrogen into reduced products is greatly reduced, indicated that nitrate itself was capable of exercising feedback regulation upon its own influx. This conclusion {{was supported by the}} observation that feedback in wild-type plants occurred in both the presence and absence of L-methionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of ammonium assimilation. Nitrite and ammonium were also found to be capable of exerting feedback inhibition upon nitrate influx, although it was not determined whether these ions themselves or subsequent metabolites were responsible for the effect.

40|$|Our {{investigations}} {{show that}} nonlethal concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) abrogate the antibiotic activity of b-lactam antibiotics against Burkholderia pseudomallei, Escherichia coli and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. NO protects B. pseudomallei already exposed to b-lactams, {{suggesting that this}} diatomic radical tolerizes bacteria against the antimicrobial activity of this important class of antibiotics. The concentrations of NO that elicit antibiotic tolerance repress consumption of oxygen (O 2), while stimulating hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) synthesis. Transposon insertions in genes encoding cytochrome c oxidase-related functions and molybdenum assimilation confer B. pseudomallei a selective advantage against the antimicrobial activity of the b-lactam antibiotic imipenem. Cumulatively, these data support a model by which NO induces antibiotic tolerance through the inhibition of the electron transport chain, rather than by potentiating antioxidant defenses as previously proposed. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of terminal oxidases and <b>nitrate</b> <b>reductases</b> tolerizes aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to b-lactams. The degree of NO-induced b-lactam antibiotic tolerance seems to be inversely proportional to the proton motive force (PMF), and thus the dissipation of DH+ and DY electrochemical gradients of the PMF prevents b-lactam-mediated killing.
