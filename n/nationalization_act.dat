40|$|Introduzione This {{article has}} the purpose to assess if and how party system {{nationalization}} affects individual voting behaviour. Previous studies on party system nationalization {{have focused on}} systemic processes, exclusively dealing with aggregate data. The authors address this topic from a new empirical perspective, arguing that party system <b>nationalization</b> could <b>act</b> as a context dimension interacting with the vote choice function. How does this specific context dimension moderate the explanatory power of individual-level characteristics? On which determinants of vote choice does party system nationalization have a greater impact? To answer these questions, the authors focus on 23 European countries {{through the use of}} the 2009 European Election Study. The empirical analysis shows that in nationalized contexts the impact of the left-right dimension on party support is higher than in territorialized contexts, whereas that of class as well as of culture-related variables is lower. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings...|$|R

50|$|Unscientific mining {{practices}} {{adopted by}} some of them and poor working conditions of labor {{in some of the}} private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalize the private coal mines. The nationalization was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973. In October, 1971, the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of coking coal mines and coke oven plants pending nationalization. This was followed by the Coking Coal Mines (<b>Nationalization)</b> <b>Act,</b> 1972 under which the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalized on May 1, 1972 and brought under the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the coking and non-coking coal mines in seven States including the coking coal mines taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalization of all these mines on May 1, 1973 with the enactment of the Coal Mines (<b>Nationalization)</b> <b>Act,</b> 1973 which now is the piece of Central legislation determining the eligibility of coal mining in India.|$|E

In 1889 the line was extended to the east to Kobe Station (as a dual track section) and Tatsuno Station (in Tatsuno, Hyōgo Prefecture) to the west. The Sanyō Railway was progressively extended to the west, reaching Okayama and the Fukuyama in 1891, Hiroshima in 1894 and in 1901 it reached Bakan (now Shimonoseki) Station. Under the Railway <b>Nationalization</b> <b>Act</b> of 1906 it was purchased by the Japanese government and renamed Sanyō Main Line.|$|E
