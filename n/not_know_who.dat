5|$|In {{political}} {{circles in}} The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|The initial coup was {{postponed}} to September 1, 1919. However, some PMO units began their actions (cutting telegraph wires, damaging railways, etc.) as scheduled previously– {{on the night}} of August 27 to 28. The Lithuanian intelligence intercepted and decoded the order to delay the coup. They had known before that Poles were plotting, but did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> and when. The Lithuanian government was informed about the cut telegraph wires and intercepted order in the morning of August 28. However, the government did not consider the threat real and did not take appropriate action.|$|E

5|$|On {{the front}} side, on the Rokin, the rescue {{operations}} of the fire department were also hampered. There were so many people standing on the window ledges screaming that the fire fighters did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> to save first. Time was also lost because some people threw their luggage in the life net and then jumped into it themselves, causing injuries. Some people fell {{to the side of}} the net and were severely injured. Just before 7:00am the part of the hotel which faced the Kalverstraat collapsed. The burning debris landed on the fire engine in the Kalverstraat, and the fire fighters barely escaped to safety. The nearby book store was also burned out and fires broke out in several buildings on the other side of the Kalverstraat, which were quickly brought under control.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was that they did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E

When Vera Atkins investigated the deaths of missing SOE agents, she initially confused Inayat Khan with Olschanezky (they were similar in appearance), who was unknown to her, believing that Inayat Khan had been killed at Natzweiler, correcting the record only when she discovered Inayat Khan’s fate at Dachau.|$|E
