40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose an {{alternative}} to calibration of linearized singular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. Given an a-theoretical econometric model {{as a representative of}} the data generating process, I will construct an information measure which compares the conditional distribution of the econometric model variables with the corresponding singular conditional distribution of the theoretical model variables. The singularity problem will be solved by using convolutions of both distributions with a <b>non-singular</b> <b>distribution.</b> This information measure will then be maximized to the deep parameters of the theoretical model, which links these parameters to the parameters of the econometric model and provides {{an alternative to}} calibration. This approach will be illustrated by an application to a linearized version of the stochastic growth model of King, Plosser and Rebelo...|$|E
40|$|Non-annually {{resolved}} palaeoclimate {{records in}} the Australasian region were compiled to facilitate investigations of decadal to centennial climate variability over the past 2000  years. A total of 675  lake and wetland, geomorphic, marine, and speleothem records were identified. The majority of records are located near population centres in southeast Australia, in New Zealand, and across the maritime continent, and there are few records from the arid regions of central and western Australia. Each record was assessed against a set of a priori criteria based on temporal resolution, record length, dating methods, and confidence in the proxy–climate relationship over the Common Era. A subset of 22  records met the criteria and were endorsed for subsequent analyses. Chronological uncertainty was the primary reason why records {{did not meet the}} selection criteria. New chronologies based on Bayesian techniques were constructed for the high-quality subset to ensure a consistent approach to age modelling and quantification of age uncertainties. The primary reasons for differences between published and reconstructed age–depth models were the consideration of the <b>non-singular</b> <b>distribution</b> of ages in calibrated 14 C dates and the use of estimated autocorrelation between sampled depths as a constraint for changes in accumulation rate. Existing proxies and reconstruction techniques that successfully capture climate variability in the region show potential to address spatial gaps and expand the range of climate variables covering the last 2000  years in the Australasian region. Future palaeoclimate research and records in Australasia could be greatly improved through three main actions: (i)  greater data availability through the public archiving of published records; (ii)  thorough characterisation of proxy–climate relationships through site monitoring and climate sensitivity tests; and (iii)  improvement of chronologies through core-top dating, inclusion of tephra layers where possible, and increased date density during the Common Era...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{continues}} the Wu-Shamai-Verdu program [3] on characterizing the {{degrees of freedom}} (DoF) of interference channels (ICs) through Renyi information dimension. Specifically, we find a single-letter formula for the DoF of vector ICs, encompassing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ICs, time- and/or frequency-selective ICs, and combinations thereof, as well as scalar ICs as considered in [3]. The DoF-formula we obtain lower-bounds the DoF of all channels [...] {{with respect to the}} choice of the channel matrix [...] and upper-bounds the DoF of almost all channels. It applies to a large class of noise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result by Guionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa triangle inequality for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and Madiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving full DoF requires the use of singular input distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices to enforce singularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This can be realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space, which is in accordance with the idea of interference alignment, and, most importantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit vectors to have <b>non-singular</b> <b>distributions.</b> The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a unified treatment of "classical" interference alignment a la Cadambe and Jafar [5], and Maddah-Ali et al. [6], and the number-theoretic schemes proposed in [7], [8]. Moreover, it allows to calculate the DoF achieved by new signaling schemes for vector ICs. We furthermore recover the result by Cadambe and Jafar on the non-separability of parallel ICs [9] and we show that almost all parallel ICs are separable in terms of DoF. Finally, our results apply to complex vector ICs, thereby extending the main findings of [2] to the complex case.

40|$|Closed-form {{expressions}} of the stress fields in notched rounded bars subjected to torsion are obtained. The notch profile is mathematically described according to Neuber's conformal mapping z = (u + iv) (q), which gives parabolic and hyperbolic profiles depending on q. The notch axis is inclined {{with respect to the}} rounded bar axis. This condition results in two eigenvalue functions: the former is associated with the antisymmetric stress field and gives a stress distribution of asymptotic nature when the notch radius is equal to zero. Conversely, the latter is associated with the symmetric stress field and results in a <b>non-singular</b> stress <b>distribution.</b> This specific condition has been noted in the literature only rarely, where only the antisymmetric part of the stress field is discussed in detail. Theoretical results are compared with numerical data as determined from two models weakened by a parabolic notch and a hyperbolic notch, both notches having the local axis inclined to 45 degrees with respect to the bar longitudinal axis.

40|$|A {{theory for}} the {{structure}} of isothermal, self-gravitating gas spheres in pressure equilibrium in a softened gravitational field is developed. The one parameter spline softening proposed by Hernquist & Katz (1989) is used. We show that the addition of this extra scale parameter implies that the set of equilibrium solutions constitute a one-parameter family, rather than {{the one and only}} one isothermal sphere solution for Newtonian gravity. We demonstrate the perhaps somewhat surprising result that for any finite choice of softening length and temperature, it is possible to deposit an arbitrarily large mass of gas in pressure equilibrium and with a <b>non-singular</b> density <b>distribution</b> inside of r_ 0 for any r_ 0 > 0. The theoretical predictions of our models are compared with the properties of the small, massive, quasi-isothermal gas clumps which typically form in numerical Tree-SPH simulations of 'passive' galaxy formation of Milky Way sized galaxies. We find reasonable agreement despite the neglect of rotational support in the models. We comment on whether the hydrodynamical resolution in our numerical simulation of galaxy formation is sufficient, and finally we conclude that one should be cautious, when comparing results of numerical simulations involving gravitational softening and hydrodynamical smoothing, with reality.

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-parametric family of radially anisotropic models with <b>non-singular</b> density <b>distribution</b> in the centre. If highly eccentric orbits are locked near the centre, the characteristic {{growth rate of}} the instability is {{much less than the}} Jeans and dynamic frequencies of the stars (slow modes). The instability occurs only for even spherical harmonics and the perturbations are purely growing (aperiodic). On the contrary, if all orbits nearly reach the outer radius of the sphere, both even and odd harmonics are unstable. Unstable odd modes oscillate having characteristic frequencies of the order of the dynamical frequencies (fast modes). Unstable even harmonics contain a single aperiodic mode and several oscillatory modes, the aperiodic mode being the most unstable. The question {{of the nature of the}} radial orbit instability (ROI) is revisited. Two main interpretations of ROI were suggested in the literature. The first one refers to the classical Jeans instability associated with the lack of velocity dispersion of stars in the transverse direction. The second one refers to Lynden-Bell's orbital approach to bar formation in disc galaxies, which implies slowness and bi-symmetry of the perturbation. Oscillatory modes, odd spherical harmonics modes, and non-slow modes found in one of the models show that the orbital interpretation is not the only possible.

40|$|AbstractThe contact {{problem of}} a {{straight}} orthotropic beam pressed onto a rigid circular surface is considered using beam theories that account for transverse shear and transverse normal deformations. The circular nature of the rigid surface emphasizes the difference between Euler Bernoulli theory behavior, where point loads develop {{at the edge of}} contact, and the higher order theories that predict <b>non-singular</b> pressure <b>distributions.</b> While Timoshenko beam theory is the simplest theory that addresses this behavior, the prediction of a maximum value of pressure at the edge of contact contradicts the elasticity theory result that contact pressure must drop to zero. Transverse normal strain is therefore introduced, both to study this fundamental discrepancy and to include an important effect in many contact problems. To investigate this effect, higher order beam theories that account for both constant and linear transverse normal strain through the beam thickness are derived using the principle of virtual work. The resulting orthotropic beam theories depend on the bending stiffness (EI), shear stiffness (GA), axial stiffness (EA 1) and transverse normal stiffness (EA 2), which are independent stiffness parameters that can differ by orders of magnitude. The above mentioned contact problem is then solved analytically for these theories, along with the Timoshenko beam model which assumes zero transverse normal strain. The results for different orthotropic materials show that inclusion of transverse normal deformation has a significant effect on the contact pressure solution. Furthermore, the solution using higher order beam theories encompasses the two extremes of a Hertz-like contact pressure when the half contact length is smaller than the thickness of the beam, and the Timoshenko beam theory case when the half contact length is much larger than the thickness. Concerning the behavior of the pressure at the edge of contact, adherence to the boundary conditions required by the principle of virtual work, shows that while the pressure does tend to zero, it does not become zero unless artificially enforced. In this regard the solution for the case of linear strain is better than that for constant strain. All beam solutions are validated with plane elasticity solutions obtained using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS...|$|R

40|$|Context: Understanding the {{evolution}} of the dark matter halos of galaxies after they become part of a cluster is essential for understanding {{the evolution}} of these satellite galaxies. Aims: We investigate the potential of galaxy-galaxy lensing to map the halo density profiles of galaxies in clusters. Methods: We propose a method that separates the weak-lensing signal of the dark-matter halos of galaxies in clusters from the weak-lensing signal of the cluster's main halo. Using toy cluster models as well as ray-tracing through N-body simulations of structure formation along with semi-analytic galaxy formation models, we test the method and assess its performance. Results: We show that with the proposed method, one can recover the density profiles of the cluster galaxy halos in the range 30 - 300 kpc. Using the method, we find that weak-lensing signal of cluster member galaxies in the Millennium Simulation is well described by an Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. In contrast, <b>non-singular</b> isothermal mass <b>distribution</b> (like PIEMD) model provide a poor fit. Furthermore, we do not find evidence for a sharp truncation of the galaxy halos in the range probed by our method. Instead, there is an observed overall decrease of the halo mass profile of cluster member galaxies with increasing time spent in the cluster. This trend, as well as {{the presence or absence of}} a truncation radius, should be detectable in future weak-lensing surveys like the Dark Energy Survey (DES) or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey. Such surveys should also allow one to infer the mass-luminosity relation of cluster galaxies with our method over two decades in mass. Conclusions: It is possible to recover in a non-parametric way the mass profile of satellite galaxies and their dark matter halos in future surveys, using our proposed weak lensing method.
