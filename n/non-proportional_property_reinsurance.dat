40|$|The {{well-known}} inflation-independent exposure rating curves from <b>Property</b> <b>reinsurance</b> (see e. g.

Instead, German insurance and reinsurance companies apply a specific system of increased limits factors introduced already in 1936 by the pioneer of German non-life insurance mathematics, Paul Riebesell. In the paper, Riebesell’s system is analysed {{in the light of the}} Collective Model of Risk Theory. It is shown that Riebesell’s system is consistent with the Collective Model only above some threshold u> 0 and under the assumption that there the claims sizes have a Pareto distribution F(x) = 1 – (x/c) -α with parameters c < u and α < 1. Furthermore, evidence is given that the admissible range of values for α and u is reasonable for practical applications. Thus, Riebesell’s system provides an easy and consistent way of exposure rating which does not have to be adjusted for inflation or changes of currency. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{invention}} of PEBELS, or policy exposure based excess loss smoothing, {{was motivated by}} the need to develop estimates of high layer expected loss cost for extremely small, non-credible segments of a primary property book of business. The existing actuarial literature provides methods for estimating high layer excess loss cost for large property portfolios in aggregate, but does not provide a method to produce similar provisions for smaller subsets of such a book. PEBELS was developed to be just such a method. PEBELS generalizes existing pricing theory from published <b>property</b> per risk <b>reinsurance</b> exposure rating methods and leverages increasingly available exposure data to produce a method which allows the practitioner to develop accurate high layer expected loss cost estimates down to the policy level. Once the theoretical framework required to implement this method in practice has been formulated, this paper continues to explore applications of PEBELS outside of primary insurance pricing where granular segmentation of expected loss by layer would refine results, such as adjusting modeled catastrophe average annual losses (AALs) for bias from implicit linearity assumptions, improving the predictiveness of property predictive models including generalized linear models (GLMs), and refining the published <b>property</b> per risk <b>reinsurance</b> exposure rating method. Motivation. Develop a practical method to determine property large loss provisions. Method. Property exposure analysis. Results.

The method showed noteworthy improvement for longer time series durations. Modal analysis of the Dolmsundet Bridge measurements were carried out with SOBI method and compared with results from Covariance-driven Stochastic Subspace Identification. Similar modes obtained from the two methods showed little deviation in the obtained frequencies. The influence of the temporary support structure is found to be significant. Predicted values are available for two periods during construction, received from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. The numerically predicted stage one follows the tendency found from the measurements, while the numerically predicted second building stage shows significant deviation from the observed tendency. The last mode of interest in the experimental data appears at a lower frequency than the numerically predicted mode. The damping estimates are more scattered. The predicted damping ratio appears to be non-conservative for the investigated wind loading. Modal parameters obtained from a more extensive dataset will contribute to updates of analytical models, increase knowledge and contribute to the safety during construction stage under more challenging conditions...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Demonstrates the {{feasibility}} of, and introduces a practical approach to enhancing, reinsurance efficiency using index-based instruments. Design/methodology/approach – First reviews the general mathematical framework of reinsurance optimization. Next, illustrates how index-based instruments can potentially enhance reinsurance efficiency through a simple yet self-contained example. The simplicity allows the analytical {{examination of the}} cost and benefits of an index-based contract. Finally, introduces a real-world model that optimizes index-based reinsurance instruments using the genetic algorithm. Findings – Identifies the key factors that determine the efficiency of index-based reinsurance contracts and demonstrates that, in the <b>property</b> catastrophe <b>reinsurance</b> market, the combined effect of these factors frequently allows {{the construction of an}} index-based hedging program that is more efficient than a traditional excess-of-loss reinsurance contract. A robust optimization model based on the genetic algorithm is introduced and shown to be effective in optimizing index-based reinsurance contracts. Research limitations/implications – Most financial optimization procedures are subject to parameter risk, which can adversely affect the robustness of their solutions. The reinsurance optimization approach presented in this paper is not completely immune from this problem. It remains a challenging problem for actuarial researchers and practitioners. Practical implications – The concept and method proposed in this paper can be applied to designing real-world reinsurance programs. Originality/value – This paper makes two contributions to the risk finance literature: a systematic approach for evaluating {{the costs and benefits of}} index-based reinsurance instruments, and an innovative and practical model for optimizing reinsurance efficiency.

40|$|A {{building}} {{in which the}} center of stiffness (CR) is not coincident with center of mass (CM) along only one horizontal plan axis {{is defined as a}} one-way asymmetric building. Further, if such building is constructed with supplemental damping, e. g. viscous dampers in the braces, it becomes a non-proportionally or non-classically damped system. Its damping matrix can not be diagonalized from the mode shapes of the undamped system. Not counting the time-consuming direct integration of the equation of motion for the original multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system, the conventional seismic analysis of the noted structures can be categorized into two types. One is based on the use of complex mode shapes and the other one on neglecting the off-diagonal elements of the transformed damping matrix. The shortcomings of the two approaches are that they are either too complicated for practicing engineers or result in unacceptable errors. An approximate method is proposed for the seismic analysis of this kind of structure. The proposed method is a modal analysis method that uses two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) modal equations. Since the proposed 2 DOF modal equations inherit the <b>non-proportional</b> damping <b>property</b> of the original MDOF system, the modal translation and rotation are not proportional even in an elastic state. Three numerical examples, which include two one-story and one three-story prototype buildings, are worked out in this research. The results are compared with those obtained by the direct integration of the equations of motion for the original MDOF system and the typical simplified modal analysis by neglecting the off-diagonal elements in the transformed damping matrix. These examples illustrate that the use of the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of the analytical results, without significantly increasing the computational efforts...|$|R
40|$|Frequent and {{extremely}} damaging severe weather {{conditions in the}} United States during 1991 – 94 caused $ 40 billion in insured losses, creating major impacts and eliciting diverse responses in the weather insurance industry. Population, {{one reason for the}} growing national sensitivity to storm damage, explained much of {{the increase in the number}} of catastrophes (property losses> $ 10 million) as well as the increases in the amount of losses. The largest increases in storms occurred in areas experiencing the greatest population growth (west, southwest, south, and southeast). Shifts in atmospheric variables (particularly in the frequency of extratropical cyclones) explained most of the 1949 – 94 fluctuations found in the intensity of catastrophic storms (losses divided by storm frequency). The property-casualty sector raised rates, made major changes in insurance availability in high-risk areas, tightened underwriting restrictions in hurricane-prone areas, and is making extensive assessments of weather risks. The reinsurance industry raised rates up to 200 %, sought and received funds from the financial markets, and developed new firms. However, some existing firms also withdrew from the marketplace.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Ph. D. thesis is twofold. Firstly, we {{concentrate}} on mathematical <b>properties</b> of <b>reinsurance</b> risks and the analysis of related risk measures. A particular emphasis is laid on asymptotic results. Secondly, {{we deal with the}} asymptotic behavior of a specific ratio of random variables and closely related estimators of risk measures. All our asymptotic results make heavy use of the theory of regular variation and classical extreme value theory. Chapter 1 concerns mathematical preliminaries. We start with the introduction of basic concepts and notation. Next, we specify the classes of distributions which are used in this thesis, namely specific heavy-tailed classes and also the extremal classes that naturally appear in applications of extreme value theory. In particular, the distributions with a regularly varying right tail constitute a prominent class of heavy-tailed distributions. Important and useful properties about functions of regular variation are then collected. We also discuss the notions of the domain of attraction of an extreme value distribution and the domain of attraction of a stable distribution which are closely connected to regular variation. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of a counting process and related notions are given. The specific counting processes encountered in this dissertation are then defined. Among them, the mixed Poisson process turns out to play a major role. The first part of the thesis (Chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5) is devoted to reinsurance. Chapter 2 gives an introduction to reinsurance. After the definition of the collective risk model, we review usual reinsurance treaties depending on whether they are of random walk type or of extreme value type. Then, we specify the modelling assumptions that are frequently made to study these treaties. For the claim number process, three major models are actually used. For the claim size distribution, appropriate models obviously differ according as small claims or large claims are involved. In Chapters 3 and 5, we deal with treaties of extreme value type since we have the coverage of large claims in mind. Chapter 3 is devoted to the study of asymptotic properties mainly for the reinsured amount in the ECOMOR treaty {{and to a lesser extent}} for the reinsured amount in the LC treaty. Depending on the heavy-tailed character of the claim size distribution, asymptotic equivalences and bounds are established for the tail of the distribution of the reinsured amount in the ECOMOR treaty. For a mixed Poisson claim number process and a claim size distribution that belongs to an extremal class, weak convergence results are derived for the suitably normalized reinsured amounts in the ECOMOR and LC treaties. Finally, an asymptotic comparison of the ECOMOR-reinsured amount with the total claim amount is given. In Chapter 5, we study asymptotic and finite time properties for the reinsured amount in the QDXL treaty. After establishing the distribution of the QDXL-reinsured amount, a weak convergence result is derived for a properly normalized version of it. Next, the exact expression of the moments of the QDXL-reinsured amount is obtained. The asymptotic behavior of these moments is then given. Also, the asymptotic expression of the moments of the appropriately normalized QDXL-reinsured amount is derived. All the asymptotic results are established under the assumptions that the claim number process is mixed Poisson and that the claim size distribution belongs to an extremal class. Finally, we look at some risk measures for the QDXL-reinsured amount in a fixed time setting. In Chapter 4, we analyze finite time properties of several risk measures for reinsurance layers. First, risk measures are considered for a general layer defined in terms of some proportionality factor and lower and upper retentions. Next, we assume a reinsurance chain for a proportion of the insurer's total claim amount where each layer depends on different values of the retentions. The effect of reinsurance on the partners involved in the risk sharing is then investigated by comparing risk measures for the different layers. Let us remark that although Chapter 4 does not focus on asymptotic properties, it is nevertheless placed before Chapter 5 because the reinsured amount in the QDXL treaty is a particular version of the general layer considered in Chapter 4. The second part of the thesis (Chapters 6 and 7) is devoted to the asymptotic analysis of the ratio of the random sum of squares of a. s. positive i. i. d. random variables over the square of the random sum of these random variables whose common distribution is assumed to have a regularly varying right tail. The number of summands is then itself a random variable that is governed by a counting process. The ratio is actually closely related to the usual estimator of the coefficient of variation of a randomly indexed sample of a. s. positive i. i. d. random variables. Extending earlier results in the literature for a non-random number of summands, we derive asymptotic expressions for the moments of the ratio when the counting process is mixed Poisson in Chapter 6 and we establish weak convergence results for the properly normalized ratio under various asymptotic assumptions on the counting process in Chapter 7. The results heavily depend on the range of the index of regular variation and hence on the number of existing moments of the underlying distribution. In Chapter 7, weak convergence results are also derived for the appropriately normalized sample coefficient of variation from those obtained for the ratio. Moreover, because the usual estimator of the dispersion of a randomly indexed sample of a. s. positive i. i. d. random variables can be expressed in terms of a slight modification of the ratio, weak convergence results are obtained for the suitably normalized sample dispersion by appropriate adaptations. Both the coefficient of variation and the dispersion are popular risk measures that found many applications within the context of insurance and reinsurance. Preface Chapter 1.
