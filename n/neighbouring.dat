5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{formally}} the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued {{to control the}} west of Normandy. The struggle between Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but began to build a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and <b>neighbouring</b> Ponthieu. Robert allied himself with Philip I of France. In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made appeals to the <b>neighbouring</b> ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's first {{established}} {{church was}} St Margaret of Antioch which was consecrated in 1769 at Hollinwood, however late 19th century boundary changes means it now lies within <b>neighbouring</b> Oldham.|$|E

5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few <b>neighbouring</b> countries. The varied culture of the town {{reflects}} its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its <b>neighbouring</b> town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned urbanisation.|$|E

Tiku took {{an active role in}} a {{successful}} campaign against the <b>neighbouring</b> state, and when Pasusu was defeated Tiku took his place as ruler of Baruppu'. The newly annexed kingdom was rich in rice fields and easily defensible, giving Tiku great power. Although the Torajans traditionally valued manpower and did not kill more people than necessary, Baruppu' oral history describes Tiku as killing men, women, and children with abandon.|$|E

5|$|Due to the village's {{small size}} and small {{population}} of 578, most amenities are located outside the village. Many {{are located in}} the slightly larger <b>neighbouring</b> village of Niton, such as a Pharmacy and doctor's surgery. Others {{are located in the}} nearby town of Ventnor.|$|E
5|$|French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in <b>neighbouring</b> Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi {{turned out to}} be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the <b>neighbouring</b> constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow this. In his 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
