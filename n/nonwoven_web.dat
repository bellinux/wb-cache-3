This phenomenon will leads to the data loss and the test error. In this paper, a region-based image fusion algorithm based on fibers ’ natural boundaries was proposed. First, the one-pixel-wide boundaries were extracted from the point-based image fusion process. Then, the image fusion regions were formed by the sharpness diffusion from the source points which have the highest sharpness at local gradient {{within the boundaries of}} fibers. Finally, a fused clear image of the <b>nonwoven</b> <b>web</b> was constructed by replacing the regions with the corresponding regions which have the highest sharpness gradient from the series images at different focus positions of the light microscope...|$|E

The process of manufacturing paper hand sheets from pulp was modified to manufacture flat fibreglass <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs.</b> The effects of dispersion and fibre length on the quality of these webs were investigated. It was found that the quality of these webs improved due to the dispersion. These <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> were then impregnated with epoxy resin by using the resin infusion method of vacuum bagging to make composite samples. The effects of dispersion, fibre length and multiple layering on the quality and mechanical properties of these composites were studied. It was found that it is necessary to disperse the fibreglass strands in order to manufacture composites of better quality. The quality and strength of these composites also improved due to the increase in the fibre length and multiple layering. Some initial studies were done to manufacture 3 D fibreglass <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> by using the vacuum forming technique and 3 D fibreglass nonwoven composites were also made using these webs.

40|$|In {{nonwoven}} industry, meltblowing {{has been}} widely used as an important technique {{for the production of}} <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> consisting of microfibres, suitable for various applications. Recently, great attention is being paid to fabricate <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> consisting of nanofibres, commonly known as nanowebs. In this paper, polypropylene has been successfully used for the fabrication of nanowebs by meltblowing process with the injection of different fluids (such as air and water) at the vent port of commercial meltblowing equipment. The lowest average fibre diameters achieved were 755 and 438 nm by the use of air and water, respectively. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed the presence of single melting peaks in the first heating cycle and double melting peaks in the second, due to the re-crystallisation and re-organisation by heating during the experiments. The results obtained from thermo gravimetric analysis and intrinsic viscosity studies showed thermal degradation of the nanofibres during meltblowing. X-ray diffraction studies showed that all the meltblown polypropylene fibres produced with the injection of the fluids contained low degrees of crystallinity and monoclinic -form crystals. The crystallinity was increased with annealing.

The process uses hot air to draw the fibers and does not require precise, individual control of each filament as in the conventional fiber sprnning processes. It was demonstrated that recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) can be melt blown into <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs,</b> but with poorer performance properties, due to the larger diameter of the fibers. Three methods of improving the melt blown processing of post-consumer recycled PET and the performance properties of the melt blown <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> produced from them were explored. They were, (1) using undried PET instead of dried PET, (2) blending recycled PET with other polymers, and (3) processing recycled PET at a higher temperature. The webs produced with undried PET had smaller fiber diameter, higher tenacity in the machine direction and lower air permeability. The greater drop in intrinsic viscosity indicated that more hydrolytic degradation occurred during processing of the undried PET. The webs produced from blends of recycled-PET/PBT as well as recycled-PET/low IV-PET had smaller fiber diameter, lower air permeability and higher tenacity in machine direction than those of 100 % recycled PET webs.

40|$|Nonwoven fabrics are web {{structures}} of randomly-oriented fibres, bonded {{by means of}} mechanical, thermal or chemical techniques. This paper focuses on nonwovens manufactured with polymer-based fibres and bonded thermally. During thermal bonding of such fibres, as a hot calender with an engraved pattern contacts the fibre web, bond spots are formed by melting of the polymer material. As {{a result of this}} bonding process, a pattern of bond points connected with randomly oriented polymer-based fibres form the <b>nonwoven</b> <b>web.</b> Due to their manufacturing-induced composite microstructure and random orientation of fibres, nonwovens demonstrate a complex mechanical behaviour. Two distinct modelling approaches were introduced to simulate the non-trivial mechanical response of thermally bonded nonwovens based on their planar density. The first modelling approach was developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of high-density nonwovens, and the respective fabric was modelled with shell elements with thicknesses identical to those of the bond points and the fibre matrix having distinct anisotropic mechanical properties. Random orientation of individual fibres was introduced into the model in terms of the orientation distribution function {{in order to determine the}} material’s anisotropy.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} and functional performance of nonwoven fabric critically {{depends on the}} fibre architecture. The fibre laydown process {{plays a key role}} in controlling this architecture. The fibre dynamic behaviour during laydown is studied through a finite element model which describes the role of the parameters in defining the area covered by a single fibre when deposited on the conveyor belt. The path taken by a fibre is described in terms of the radius of gyration, which characterises the area covered by the fibre in the textile, and the spectrum of curvature, which describes the degree of fibre looping as a function of the arc length. Starting from deterministic and idealised fibre curvature spectra, stochastic Monte Carlo simulations are undertaken to generate full <b>nonwoven</b> <b>web</b> samples and reproduce the uniformity of fibre density. A novel image analysis technique that allows measurement of the uniformity of real spunbonded nonwoven samples from images of textiles is used to confirm the validity of the model.

Grafting was confirmed via infrared spectroscopy and thermo-gravimetric analyses. The polymermatrix consisted of electrospun nanofibers that were collected as nonwovenwebs. Themorphology as well as thermal and mechanical properties of filled and unfilled nanofibers were elucidated by scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis, respectively. The addition of CNXs into PCL produced minimal changes in the thermal behavior of the electrospun fibers. However, a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the nanofibers after reinforcement with unmodified CNXs was confirmed. Fiber webs from PCL reinforced with 2. 5 % unmodified CNXs showed ca. 1. 5 -fold increase in Young’s modulus and the ultimate strength compared to PCL webs. Compared to the case of grafted nanocrystals, the unmodified ones imparted better morphological homogeneity to the nanofibrillar structure.

40|$|A {{solution}} blow spinning {{technique is}} a method developed recently for making <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> of micro- and nanofibres. The principal advantage of this method compared to a more traditional electrospinning process is its significantly higher production rate. In this work, the solution blow spinning method was further developed to produce nonwoven polymeric scaffolds based on a copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with vinylidene fluoride solution in acetone. A crucial feature of the proposed method is that high-voltage equipment is not required, which further improves the method's economics. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the samples demonstrated that the surface morphology of the nonwoven materials {{is dependent on the}} polymer concentration in the spinning solution. It was concluded that an optimum morphology of the nonwoven scaffolds for medical applications is achieved by using a 5 % solution of the copolymer. It was established that the scaffolds produced from the 5 % solution have a fractal structure and anisotropic mechanical properties. X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that the fabricated nonwoven materials have crystal structures that exhibit ferroelectric properties. Gas chromatography has shown that the amount of acetone in the nonwoven material does not exceed the maximum allowable concentration of 0. 5 %.

The comprehensive and flexible optimisation opportunities provided by the CFD has been used to aid in the control and optimisation of the thermal bonding process and machinery. To optimise the process and product quality, the complex system composing of several components and various physical phenomena occurring during processing is simulated using a hierarchical methodology.

For an example, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is the main component of acrylic fibers and the main precursor for carbon fibers. Inspired by this concept, various preparation methods were explored to improve the water absorbency of {{textile materials}} and hence widen their applications. PAN, which is the main component of acrylic fibers, was selected to prepare the superabsorbent hydrogel. Facile and versatile electrospinning was employed to fabricate the PAN nanofibers as a <b>nonwoven</b> <b>web.</b> Further oxidative heat treatment was applied to stabilize the structure of PAN nanofibers. This stabilized structure was studied in depth by several characterization methods. The relative rate of three main reactions - dehydrogenation, cyclization and carbonylationwas investigated and revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The resultant PAN nanofibers were crosslinked that was confirmed by the gel fraction obtained from soxhlet extraction in DMF and the fiber integrity retained after alkaline hydrolysis. The heated PAN electrospun web was subsequently hydrolyzed in an alkaline solution to produce hydrogel. Oxidative stabilization plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of PAN nanofibers under harsh alkaline hydrolysis condition. The resultant hydrogel with highly interconnected three-dimensional pore network was obtained. Due to the formation of solubilizing groups and porous structure, the obtained hydrogel achieved both remarkable water absorption ratio and rate. The optimized hydrogels absorbed over 100 g/g within 1 min, making them to be useful in drug delivery systems and personal care products. Silk, which is another common natural textile fiber, was modified by in situ polymerization of two monomers acrylamide and sodium acrylate after swelling in 4. 65 M lithium bromide solution. Because of its high swelling degree in LiBr as observed under optical microscope, these two synthetic monomers were able to penetrate into silk yarn. X-ray diffraction suggested the conformational changes of silk in 4. 65 M LiBr, while dissolution test and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of interpenetrating synthetic polymer network. An interesting ladder structure was observed in between the adjacent filaments of modified silk yarns. These modified silk yarns showed improvement in water absorption and mechanical property in both dry and wet states. The water absorption ratio of silk yarn modified by sodium acrylate achieved 7. 6 g/g that was 9 times higher than that of raw silk yarn. This novel modified silk also showed low cytotoxicity towards skin keratinocytes, being promising in biomedical textiles such as wound dressings and sutures. Moreover, another effective approach to modify silk fiber via environmentally friendly photoredox catalysis was introduced. In this study, the photocatalyst tris(2, 2 '-bipyridyl) dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate was employed. This green chemical reaction was able to induce the crosslinking of the tyrosyl in silk protein under visible light at room temperature; meanwhile, it was found to be useful in initiating the polymerization of sodium acrylate. This photocatalyst system is beneficial to silk fiber modification through crosslinking and polymerization. The modified silk fibers displayed enhancement in water absorption that achieved at least 4 times higher than that of the control silk fiber. These modified silks were ready to be woven or knitted into fabrics, having potentials in biomedical textiles like wound dressings and dermal sealants. To conclude, the water absorbency of two common textile materials PAN and silk has been successfully improved via various routes demonstrated in this study. These modification methods can be fully utilized in the textile materials which their applications are hence broadened. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

Polystyrene (PS) electrospun web can be used as an excellent substrate for superhydrophobic surface due to its low surface energy (~ 33 mN/m) and processibility to form various roughness. As the Cassie-Baxter model explains, the presence of roughness amplifies anti-wettability of materials whose surface energy is low (hydrophobic, WCA > 90 ˚). This study aims to fabricate superhydrophobic PS <b>nonwoven</b> <b>webs</b> by electrospinning process and vapor deposition of 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane (PFDTS) and to investigate the influence of fiber morphology and surface energy on wettability. To this end, PS webs with various fiber morphologies were electrospun under different polymer concentrations and solvent mixtures. PS substrates were treated by air plasma to attach –OH groups before the vapor deposition of PFDTS. Air plasma treatment itself increased the surface energy of PS; however, with PFDTS coating, the surface energy was decreased. The wettability was characterized by WCA and sliding angle measurement. WCAs on the electrospun webs were greater than that of flat PS film (WCA= 95 ˚) due to the increased roughness of the web. The web with beads or grooved fibers achieved superhydrophobicity (WCA> 150 ˚). PFDTS deposition lowered the surface energy of PS surface to about 15. 8 mN/m. PS web with PFDTS deposition presented high water contact angle up to 169 ˚ and low sliding angle about 3 ˚. Also it was attempted to characterize the interfacial area between water and a solid surface on irregular fibrous webs. The fraction of solid surface area wet by the liquid (solid fraction) was observed by staining the rough electrospun web with a hydrophobic fluorescent dye, coumarin. The actual solid fraction corresponded fairly well with the theoretical solid fraction calculated by the Cassie-Baxter equation, demonstrating that the treated superhydrophobic surface follows the Cassie-Baxter wetting state...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic nanofibrous {{scaffolds}} of poly(caprolactone) (PCL) incorporating magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) were produced, {{and their}} effects on physico-chemical, mechanical and biological properties were extensively addressed to find efficacy for bone regeneration purpose. MNPs 12 nm in diameter were citrated and evenly distributed in PCL solutions up to 20 % and then were electrospun into <b>nonwoven</b> nanofibrous <b>webs.</b> Incorporation of MNPs greatly improved the hydrophilicity of the nanofibers. Tensile mechanical properties of the nanofibers (tensile strength, yield strength, elastic modulus and elongation) were significantly enhanced {{with the addition of}} MNPs up to 15 %. In particular, the tensile strength increase was as high as ∼ 25 MPa at 15 % MNPs vs. ∼ 10 MPa in pure PCL. PCL-MNP nanofibers exhibited magnetic behaviors, with a high saturation point and hysteresis loop area, which increased gradually with MNP content. The incorporation of MNPs substantially increased the degradation of the nanofibers, with a weight loss of ∼ 20 % in pure PCL, ∼ 45 % in 10 % MNPs and ∼ 60 % in 20 % MNPs. Apatite forming ability of the nanofibers tested in vitro in simulated body fluid confirmed the substantial improvement gained by the addition of MNPs. Osteoblastic cells favored the MNPs-incorporated nanofibers with significantly improved initial cell adhesion and subsequent penetration through the nanofibers, compared to pure PCL. Alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of genes associated with bone (collagen I, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein) were significantly up-regulated in cells cultured on PCL-MNP nanofibers than those on pure PCL. PCL-MNP nanofibers subcutaneously implanted in rats exhibited minimal adverse tissue reactions, while inducing substantial neoblood vessel formation, which however, greatly limited in pure PCL. In vivo study in radial segmental defects also signified the bone regeneration ability of the PCL-MNP nanofibrous scaffolds. The magnetic, bone-bioactive, mechanical, cellular and tissue attributes of MNP-incorporated PCL nanofibers make them promising candidate scaffolds for bone regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The present PhD thesis {{deals with}} the {{stabilization}} of aqueous protein solution of biotechnologically manufactured proteins R 16 and R 16 -Arg 8 similar to spider silk proteins, in a form of aqueous dispersions, their electrospinability, degradability and investigation of arginine release in terms of future applications as wound dressing. The proteins investigated in the present work are biotechnologically produced using bacteria E. coli. In {{the course of the}} dissertation numerous protein stabilization methods have been developed. The developed stabilization methods are based on application of different compounds and could be classified according to the mechanism of action as “biological stabilization”, “chemical stabilization” and “physical stabilization”. All these above mentioned methods have its advantages and disadvantages. The obtained dispersions made it possible to electrospin spider silk similar proteins. The protein dispersions were successfully electrospun with an addition of the polyethylene oxide from 1. 5 % to 2. 0 % as a viscosity reducing agent. In the course of the present work the spider silk like protein solution stabilization methods were developed. The stabilized protein solutions were successfully electrospun producing <b>nonwoven</b> nanofiber <b>webs.</b> Both the final nanofibrous nonwoven materials and initial stabilized protein solutions were investigated using different analytical methods. The protein micelles presence was detected in the investigated stabilized protein solutions. All produced protein/polymer nonwoven nanofibrous materials showed alpha- i. e. disordered secondary protein structure, which was successfully changed in beta-structure upon treatment with 100 % methanol. The degradation of elaborated protein nonwoven nanofibrous materials in the presence of natural wound effluent was proved by numerous experiments. An ex vivo skin stamping model demonstrated a faster re-epithelisation of the wound using R 16 protein and particularly R 16 -Arg 8. All these results suggest the application of the spider silk like proteins in a form of nanofiber webs as wound dressing materials...|$|R
