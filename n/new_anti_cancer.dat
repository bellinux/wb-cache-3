40|$|Conventional cancer therapies {{are often}} limited due to toxic {{side effects and}} low {{therapeutic}} response. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches that focus on selectivity for cancer cells and avoidance of undesired toxic side effects are urgently needed. TRAIL is a promising anti tumour agent, which induces apoptosis selectively in malignant cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are normally responsible for eradicating dysfunctional, damaged or infected cells. They are present in high numbers in the tumour environment but fail to kill cancerous cell. This article proposes to exploit the properties of TRAIL and CTLs in a new therapeutic approach. By fusing TRAIL to CTLs we obtain a lymphocyte equipped with adequate tools for inducing selectively apoptosis in tumour cells. Administration of these CTLs equipped with TRAIL would be realized through adoptive cells transfer. This article addresses several aspects of this potential new therapy: TRAIL characteristics and according fusion protein, positive CTL characteristics, CTL engineering, patient administration, survival promotion of CTLs equipped with sTRAIL and possible interventions in the tumour environment. There are many hurdles to take, that all need intensive research, before this approach could be clinically applied. Even though, CTLs equipped with sTRAIL {{could prove to be}} an important novel approach in the search for <b>new</b> <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> therapies. ...|$|E

We carried out a comprehensive analysis of properties for 24 natural products derived anti cancer drugs including clinical development candidates and a set of 27 natural products derived anti cancer lead compounds. In particular, we focused on understanding the interplay among eight physicochemical properties including like partition coefficient (log P), distribution coefficient at pH= 7. 4 (log D), topological polar surface area (TPSA), molecular weight (MW), aqueous solubility (log S), number of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA), number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and number of rotatable bonds (nRot) crucial for drug design and relationships between physicochemical properties, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) attributes, and in silico toxicity profile for these two sets of compounds.

40|$|Background: Hydroxypyrones {{represent}} several {{classes of}} molecules {{known for their}} high synthetic versatility. This family of molecules shows several interesting pharmaceutical activities and is considered as a promising source of <b>new</b> <b>anti</b> neoplastic compounds. Methods: In the quest to identify <b>new</b> potential <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> agents, a <b>new</b> maltol (3 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl- 4 -pyrone) -derived molecule, named malten (N,N′-bis((3 -hydroxy- 4 -pyron- 2 -yl) methyl) -N,N′-dimethylethylendiamine), has been synthesised and analysed at both biological and molecular levels for its antiproliferative activity in eight tumour cell lines. Results: Malten exposure led to a dose-dependent reduction in cell survival in all the neoplastic models studied. Sublethal concentrations of malten induce profound cell cycle changes, particularly affecting the S and/or G 2 -M phases, whereas exposure to lethal doses causes the induction of programmed cell death (apopotosis). The molecular response to malten was also investigated in two biological models: JURKAT and U 937 cells. It showed the modulation of genes having key roles in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Finally, {{as part of the}} effort to clarify the action mechanism, we showed that malten is able to impair DNA electrophoretic mobility and drastically reduce both PCR amplificability and fragmentation susceptibility of DNA. Conclusion: Taken together, these results show that malten may exert its antiproliferative activity through the induction of complex DNA structural modifications. This evidence, together with the high synthetic versatility of maltol-derived compounds, makes malten an interesting molecular scaffold for the future design of new potential anticancer agents...|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{the second}} {{cause of death in}} The Netherlands. Although the {{treatment}} options {{over the past few decades}} have substantially improved, the cure rate for patients with advanced cancer remains low. In addition, hopefully new therapies will induce less severe side effects compared to the present therapies. Overall, <b>new</b> <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> drugs are still very much needed to improve treatment outcome of patients. Many active cytotoxic agents originate from natural resources, mainly plants (e. g. paclitaxel originates from the Taxus tree). The search for marine compounds started 50 years ago and new compounds isolated from various marine sources have been described as anti-cancer agent and some have already entered clinical studies. In this thesis, three novel marine derived anti cancer drugs were investigated, i. e. thiocoraline, aplidine, and ET- 743. Thiocoraline is derived form the Micromonospora marina, which grows in the Mozambique strait. Aplidine originates from the Mediterranean tunicate Aplidium albicans and ET 743 from the Ecteinascidia turbinata from the Caribbean. All three anti-cancer drugs showed promising activity against various tumor types in preclinical studies. Aplidine and ET- 743 have already entered clinical trials and thiocoraline will be investigated in patients in the near future. Little is known about the biotransformation of thiocoraline, aplidine, and ET 743 in the human body. Information on the enzymes involved and the knowledge of the patient enzyme activity may help to improve the treatment of the individual patient and reduction of side effects. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the involvement of the different enzymes with the biotransformation of the anti-cancer drugs thiocoraline, aplidine, and ET 743. The research is focused on the elucidation of the human biotransformation pathways of these drugs. Furthermore, the toxicity of the metabolites was investigated to elucidate if bioactivation or bioinactivation occurred. The cytochrome P 450 enzyme 3 A 4 was found to be very important in the biotransformation of thiocoraline and CYP 2 C 8 was involved to a lesser extent. UGT 1 A 1 and 1 A 9 were involved in the conjugation of thiocoraline. No involvement of other phase II enzymes was found. Furthermore, the metabolites formed from the CYP reaction were further conjugated by the phase II enzymes UGT, SULT, and GST. Aplidine was mainly metabolized by CYP 3 A 4, but also by CYP 2 A 6, 2 E 1, and 4 A 11. Four metabolites were identified from which three were specifically formed by CYP 3 A 4 and one by CYP 2 A 6. Only the UGTs 1 A 3 and 1 A 9 were involved in the direct conjugation of aplidine. The metabolites formed by CYP were further conjugated by UGT, SULT, and GST. Cell culture experiments showed that the aplidine metabolites were less toxic compared to aplidine, thus aplidine was bioinactivated by these enzymes. ET- 743 was also mainly metabolized by CYP 3 A 4 and a number of other CYPs played a minor role, namely CYP 2 C 9, 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1. In addition, ET- 743 was conjugated by GST and UGT. The metabolites formed by cytochrome P 450 were less toxic compared to ET- 743 itself in cell culture experiments, thus ET- 743 was bioinactivated by the CYPs involved in its biotransformation. The studies performed to unravel the biotransformation of the here investigated marine derived anti-cancer agents may help to improve clinical evaluation of anti cancer activity and safety of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|Enzymes {{that are}} {{involved}} in the synthesis and processing of oligosaccharides, such as glycosidases, are important catalysts for the specific assembly of oligosaccharide structures on proteins. Design and preparation of selective inhibitors of these enzymes are of high interest as these molecules can be used to modulate cellular functions. Moreover, they may provide potential drugs in new therapeutic strategies. In particular, swainsonine (Swa), a natural inhibitor of Golgi α-mannosidase II, reduces certain tumors and hematological dysfunctions. Nevertheless, some side effects resulted in limitations for the development of this compound in medicinal treatments. Recently, our laboratory has developed a new combinatorial methodology for the disclosure of glycosidase inhibitors based on the dihydroxypyrrolidine scaffold found in Swa. This method allowed the preparation of a new family of selective and competitive a-mannosidase inhibitors with inhibitory activities (Ki values) ranging from 3 µM to 135 nM for the best congeners toward α-mannosidase from jack bean, a reliable model enzyme for mammalian Golgi α-mannosidase II. The aim of the present work was to design and synthesise optimized inhibitors of α-mannosidases II based on a 2 -aminomethyl- 3, 4 -dihydroxypyrrolidine scaffold and to assess their potential as <b>new</b> <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> leads. In a first time, a structural study was carried out through the analysis of x-ray structures of the best inhibitors previously developed in our laboratory complexed to Golgi α-mannosidase II from Drosophila melanogaster (dGMII), which presents a high sequence identity with the human enzyme. The binding mode of these inhibitors could be thus established. This study combined with docking experiments allowed us to design inhibitors of α-mannosidase II, with improved efficacy. The best congener (3 R, 4 R, 5 R) - 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 5 -({[(1 R) - 2 -hydroxy- 1 -phenylethyl]amino}methyl) - 1 -methylpyrrolidin- 2 -one displayed an enhanced inhibitory potency against dGMII (IC 50 = 0. 5 µM vs 80 µM for the first generation inhibitor). Introduction of a polar substituent on the C(5) position of the pyrrolidine ring accounted for this improved activity as revealed by the x-ray structure of this new derivative complexed to dGMII which displayed additional interactions with active site residues. In a second time, these new α-mannosidase inhibitors have been evaluated as anti cancer agents and their effects were determined on human cancer cells from glioblastoma and melanoma, two tumors associated with a high proliferative and invasive potential, multiple resistance toward conventional chemotherapeutic agents, and poor prognosis. As these compounds were not able to inhibit cellular growth, probably due to a poor cellular uptake, derivatization of our inhibitors into more lipophilic esters, ethers and amides derivatives was envisaged. In particular, introduction of a 4 -bromobenzoate moiety resulted in an improvement of cellular uptake, leading to a complete inhibition of cellular growth at 300 µM with inhibitors (2 R) - 2 -({[(2 R, 3 R, 4 S) - 3, 4 -dihydroxypyrrolidin- 2 -yl]methyl}amino) - 2 -phenylethyl 4 -bromobenzoate and (2 R) - 2 -({[(2 R, 3 R, 4 R) - 3, 4 -dihydroxy- 1 -methyl- 5 -oxopyrrolidin- 2 -yl]methyl}amino) - 2 -phenylethyl 4 -bromobenzoate. Under the same conditions, Swa didn't provide any significant growth inhibition. Moreover, exposure of human fibroblasts, as model of healthy cells, to our lead derivatives revealed some selectivity toward tumoral cells. It was hypothesized that cellular esterases were able to hydrolyse the ester moiety and thus release the more hydrophilic parent inhibitors within the tumoral cells. Finally, in order to get more insights into the mode of action of our derivatives, their inhibitory activity on α-mannosidases from human glioblastoma extracts was determined and compared to the activity of Swa. The first generation inhibitor presented a moderate inhibitory potency on α-mannosidases whereas the optimized derivative displayed potent inhibitory activity on human α-mannosidases (IC 50 = 50 µM decreased to 0. 5 µM). Nevertheless, Swa presented higher potency than our new lead (IC 50 = 10 - 50 nM). It was also determined by gel filtration that the cellular α-mannosidases targeted by our pyrrolidine based inhibitors displayed apparent molecular weight of about 120 kD...|$|E

40|$|Obwohl viele Krebserkrankungen initial erfolgreich behandelt werden können, verlangen rezidive und refraktäre Tumore die Entwicklung neuer Chemotherapeutika. Die vorliegende Masterarbeit untersuchte hierzu zwei ethnomedizinischen Pflanzen aus Guatemala, Critonia morifolia und Neurolaena lobata, die bereits seit hunderten Jahren traditionell in der Medizin der Mayas Anwendung finden, als potentielle Quellen zukünftiger Chemotherapeutika. Aus dem Pflanzenmaterial wurden jeweils fünf Extrakte unterschiedlicher Polaritäten hergestellt und im Zellversuch in HL 60 Zellen auf ihre anti kanzerogene Wirkung getestet. Für jede der Pflanzen wurde das Extrakt mit den stärksten anti proliferativen und pro apoptischen Effekten ausgewählt und mittels weiterführender Untersuchungen, u. a. Western Blot und FACS Analyse, versucht zugrundeliegende Mechanismen zu ermitteln. Die Proliferationshemmung des C. morifolia Petroleumetherextraktes beruhte vermutlich eher auf der frühen Induktion der Apoptose vermittelt durch aktive Caspase 3. Die Aktivierung des zellregulatorischen Proteins Chk 2 und der damit korrelierende S Phase Arrest nach 24 Stunden wäre demnach durch DNA Schäden aufgrund des vorschreitenden Zelltod verursacht. Der rasche Verlust an Bioaktivität des Extraktes lässt auf in hohem Maße instabile Verbindungen schließen, die einen zukünftigen Einsatz als Chemotherapeutikum limitieren könnten. Im Fall von N. lobata wurde das Dichlormethanextrakt (10 15 µg/ml) in humanen SR 786 und murinen 417 NPM ALK positiven ALCL Zelllinien getestet. In beiden war ein Zellzyklusarrest in G 2 M zu beobachten, der mit der Aktivierung von Chk 1, der Abnahme an c Myc und der Induktion des Tumorsupressor Proteins p 21 korrelierte. Zusätzlich induzierte das Extrakt Apoptose vermittelt durch Caspase 3 Aktivierung und gefolgt von H 2 AX Phopsphorylierung. Die Exposition humaner Lungenfibroblasten gegenüber 20 µg/ml Extrakt ließ auf eine geringe Toxizität gegenüber normalen Zellen schließen. Desweiteren führte das Extrakt zu einer deutlichen Abnahme des onkogenen NPM ALK Transkriptes und Proteins. Da die NPM Proteinexpression unverändert blieb, wird ein post transkriptioneller Mechanismus hinter dieser Beobachtung vermutet. Im Gegensatz zu N. lobata nahmen Behandlungen mit Vincristine und C. morifolia Extrakt keinen Einfluss auf die NPM ALK Proteinexpression. Mit PDGFR β wurde, neben NPM ALK, eine weitere Rezeptor Tyrosinekinase durch N. lobata herunterreguliert. Zusammengefasst verhinderte das N. lobata Extrakt die Expression wichtiger Proto Onkogene, dessen exakten Mechanismus es noch zu klären gilt. Although many cancers can {{be treated}} {{efficiently}} in first line chemotherapy, relapse and refractory cancers require the discovery and development of <b>new</b> <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> agents. The present work analyzed the potential anti neoplastic activity of two rainforest species of the Asteraceae family, Critonia morifolia and Neurolaena lobata, that successfully passed hundreds of years of usage as home remedies in the long lasting medical tradition of the Central American Mayas. The plant material, collected in Guatemala, was lyophilized and sequentially extracted with five solvents of increasing polarity to provide an initial separation of plant constituents. For each plant, the extract exhibiting the most potent anti proliferative and pro apoptotic effects in HL 60 cells was subjected to more detailed investigations including western blot and FACS analyses. The anti proliferative properties of the C. morifolia petroleum ether extract {{turned out to be}} attributable to the induction of cell death as the apoptotic executioner protein caspase 3 was already activated within 2 hours of incubation. Changes in the levels of cell regulatory proteins were observed thereafter, in particular, Chk 2 was activated upon DNA cleavage initiated by the foregoing onset of apoptosis,and this correlated with the S phase cell arrest after 24 hours. The loss in bio activity of this extract indicated that considerably unstable compounds triggered the anti neoplastic effects, which may limit its potential use as anti cancer remedy. The other plant, N. lobata, tested in human SR 786 and murine 417 NPM ALK positive ALCL cell lines, was more promising. In both cell lines, 10 15 µg/ml of the dichloromethane extract inhibited the cell cycle in G 2 M phase, which correlated with the activation of Chk 1 and the depletion of the proto oncogene c Myc paralleled by the upregulation of the p 21 tumor suppressor protein. The extract strongly triggered apoptosis, inducing caspase 3 followed by phosphorylation of H 2 AX. Overall toxicity was low since normal human lung fibroblasts remained viable even upon exposure to extract concentrations beyond 15 µg/ml. The extract led to a substantial decrease in oncogenic NPM ALK transcript and protein expression, but not in that of nucleophosmin. This suggested that the extract affected a post-transcriptional mechanism, i. e. mRNA stability rather that mRNA transcription. The chemotherapeutic agent vincristine and the C. morifolia extract did not affect NPM-ALK expression. Apart from NPM ALK, a second tyrosine kinase, namely PDGFR β, was also downregulated by the N. lobata extract. Taken together, the N. lobata extract blocked the expression of several proto oncogenes by a mechanism that needs to be determined in future investigations...|$|E

Selenium (also known as the moon element) has been recognized for almost 49 years as an antioxidant and <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> agent. The weight of evidence supports the position of selenium as an <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> agent for HCC but the molecular mechanism of how selenium inhibits HCC is still unknown. Numerous theories have been proposed and selenium induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest is the predominant one so far...|$|R
40|$|Nature {{contains}} an endless supply of natural products and has for {{long been a}} source of inspiration for the pharmaceutical industry. Many of the drugs currently in clinical use originate from natural products. Paclitaxel, the active substance in the <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> medicine Taxol, was first isolated from the Pacific yew tree (Taxus brevifolia) in the early 1960 s during a screening program for novel <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> agents, initiated by NCI. After the discovery of paclitaxel’s unique mechanism of action as a microtubule stabilizer, intense research followed, which despite drawbacks such as supply problems and low water solubility, resulted in the successful <b>anti</b> <b>cancer</b> medicine Taxol. At present, Taxol is used in the treatment of ovarian, breast and non-small cell lung cancer. The primary intention with the work presented in this thesis was to design and synthesize paclitaxel mimetics, based on a rigid skeleton decorated with the groups important for the paclitaxel activity. Molecular modelling was used to identify a spiro-bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane skeleton as a suitable substitute for the rigid paclitaxel core. Four different paclitaxel mimetics have successfully been synthesized and tested for their biological activity in five breast-derived cell lines. In addition, some intermediates were also included in the biological evaluation. Some of the compounds tested were shown to be toxic but were less active than paclitaxel itself. In addition, methodology for the synthesis of bridgehead substituted bicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane- 2, 6 -diones were developed followed by evaluation of the products as substrates in the asymmetric baker’s yeast reduction...|$|R
