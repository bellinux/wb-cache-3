60|$|In {{order to}} make a {{comparison}} between the schools of London and those of New York, I have called them both free schools. They are, in fact, more free in New York than they are in London; because in New York every boy and girl, let his parentage be what it may, can attend these schools without any payment. Thus an education as good as the American mind can compass, prepared with every care, carried on by highly-paid tutors, under ample surveillance, provided with all that is most excellent in the way of rooms, desks, books, charts, maps, and implements, is brought actually within the reach of everybody. I need not point out to Englishmen how different is the nature of schools in London. It must not, however, be supposed that these are charity schools. Such is not their nature. Let us say what we may as to the beauty of charity as a virtue, the recipient of charity in its customary sense among us is ever more or less degraded by the position. In the States that has been fully understood, and the schools to which I allude are carefully preserved from any such taint. Throughout the States a separate tax is levied for the maintenance of these schools, and as the taxpayer supports them, he is, of course, entitled to the advantage which they confer. The child of the <b>non-taxpayer</b> is also entitled, and to him the boon, if strictly analyzed, will come {{in the shape of a}} charity. But under the system as it is arranged, this is not analyzed. It is understood that the school is open to all in the ward to which it belongs, and no inquiry is made whether the pupil's parent has or has not paid anything toward the school's support. I found this theory carried out so far that at the deaf and dumb school, where some of the poorer children are wholly provided by the institution, care is taken to clothe them in dresses of different colors and different make, in order that nothing may attach to them which has the appearance of a badge. Political economists will see something of evil in this. But philanthropists will see very much that is good.|$|E

5000|$|From 6 April 1999 ACT was abolished, and the {{tax credit}} on {{dividends}} was reduced to 10%.

However, as a result of the high unemployment rate, a large gap exists between tax and non-tax contributors. The question can now be asked whether it is fair that just a small percentage of taxpayers are responsible for the total funding of the NHI. Furthermore, it could be asked whether the taxpayer is aware of the additional tax burden the NHI will impose on him/her. The purpose of this research was to investigate three countries, namely, Brazil, Spain and Germany, where some form of NHI is in operation, in order to find a possible appropriate funding model for South Africa's NHI and, ultimately, to make conclusions and recommendations based on the outcomes. It was subsequently found that, although the taxpayer should be more heavily taxed in order to fund the NHI, there are a few other possibilities for distributing the tax burden more evenly. However, the impact of the proposed adjustment to increase VAT could have a negative impact on the <b>non-taxpayer</b> and might contribute to greater poverty in South Africa. Master...|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{the last}} three decades, regular surveys on {{household}} income were rare or nonexistent in many developed countries, {{making it difficult for}} economists to compare income distribution in the long run. Using taxation statistics, which tend to be available over a longer time span, Andrew Leigh propose a method for imputing the incomes of <b>non-taxpayers,</b> and deriving the underlying distribution of income. Because taxation statistics are typically disaggregated by gender, it is possible to derive separate income distribution series for men and women in countries where individuals file separately. Leigh shows that over the past four decades, the distribution of adult male incomes is a good proxy for the distribution of family incomes. Applying this method to Australia, he develops a new annual series for inequality from 1942 - 2000. Inequality fell in the 1950 s and the 1970 s, and rose during the 1980 s and 1990 s - a pattern similar to the United Kingdom...|$|R

Analysis of government action sees the existence of the informal sector as a problem due to its <b>non-taxpayer</b> status, its illegal occupation of land and the poor environment and image it creates for the wider city. The government’s response to such a situation is to bulldoze the activities and associated development. The land use change that has occurred in the study area identified a precinct designated for residential uses that is currently occupied by commercial activity. This research identified the networks between the formal industrial activity in the industrial estate, and this commercial activity, both formal and informal. It also assessed the impact of the surrounding residential community on land use change. The study then analysed the planning approaches adopted that attempt to segregate land use between industrial and non-industrial uses and the attempts to limit the development of an informal, unplanned, unregulated land use.

The appropriateness of land use segregation via zoning regulations to minimize the negative impact of industrial activity and to optimise the benefit of industrial land use networks was evaluated.

40|$|The Tax Court is an Article I court. It {{resolves}} {{more than}} 95 % of all tax-related litigation—actually nearly 97 % {{of the total}} federal tax docket in 2012. Despite this substantial role in federal litigation, scholars and courts have generally put aside {{the issue of what}} standard is appropriate when a U. S. federal court of appeals reviews Tax Court procedural questions. Section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C.) grants jurisdiction to the courts of appeals to review Tax Court decisions “in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district courts in civil actions tried without a jury. ”Unlike district courts, which must follow the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), the Tax Court operates under its own separate set of procedural rules—the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure (Tax Court Rules). Congress explicitly authorized the Tax Court to choose its own procedural rules under I. R. C. § 7453. Where there is no applicable Tax Court procedural rule, Tax Court Rule 1 (b) provides that the Tax Court “may prescribe the procedure, giving particular weight to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure {{to the extent that they}} are suitably adaptable to govern the matter at hand. ”Currently, no judicial decision analyzes the appropriate standard for appellate review of a Tax Court’s decision to apply (or not apply) a federal procedural rule where the Tax Court lacks its own applicable procedure. The appropriate standard of appellate review for Tax Court procedural decisions garnered attention when the U. S. Virgin Islands (USVI) recently sought to intervene in several Tax Court proceedings under FRCP 24 (a) (2). The Tax Court Rules lack an intervention procedure and the Tax Court, acting pursuant to its discretion under Rule 1 (b), has never granted a third party non-taxpayer’s motion to intervene under FRCP 24 (a) (2). Given the outcome-determinative potential of the standard of review,these recent USVI cases—discussed individually below— provide an important opportunity to determine whether the abuse of discretion or de novo standard should govern appellate review of Tax Court procedural decisions. In 2014, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit became the third federal appellate court to overturn a Tax Court decision denying a motion by the USVI to intervene in a dispute between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a taxpayer. In Huff v. Commissioner, 10 the Eleventh Circuit joined the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the Third and Eighth Circuits in allowing the USVI to intervene in a Tax Court proceeding. However, not all federal appellate courts have ruled this way. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit created a circuit split when it affirmed the Tax Court in denying intervention to the USVI. The Huff decision deepened the current circuit split and complicatedthe matter further. The Eleventh Circuit in Huff—unlike the other three circuits that have addressed this issue—allowed intervention as a matter of right under FRCP 24 (a) (2). This approach is novel, as the Tax Court has never allowed a third party <b>non-taxpayer</b> to intervene under this provision—although it has the discretion to do so under Tax Court Rule 1 (b). The Huff decision presents two issues worthy of discussion in this Comment. The first is whether de novo review is appropriate when a court of appeals reviews Tax Court procedural decisions. Generally, under I. R. C. § 7482, the appeals courts review Tax Court decisions “in the same manner and to the same extent” as district court decisions. Yet, given the Tax Court’s general power to prescribe its own procedural rules under I. R. C. § 7453, 16 the Huff court erred in applying the de novo standard of review to the Tax Court’s decision to not apply FRCP 24 (a) (2). The second issue the Huff opinion presents—regarding the substance of the case—is whether the USVI has a right to intervene under FRCP 24 (a) (2). This issue turns on whether a Tax Court proceeding is the proper forum in which to confront the weighty concerns of fair implementation and coordination of two separate but interrelated taxing agencies—the IRS and the USVI’s Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). Part I of this Comment briefly summarizes the pertinent facts of Huff. Part II surveys the current circuit split on intervention in Tax Court proceedings. Part III analyzes the proper standard for review of the USVI’s motion to intervene under FRCP 24 (a) (2), as well as the proper standard regarding all appellate review of Tax Court procedural decisions—a discussion that is largely absent from both scholarly works and court opinions. This Comment concludes in Part III with a critique of the Huff court’s FRCP 24 (a) (2) analysis...|$|E
40|$|Dr. Herbert Asher, {{distinguished}} Professor of Political Science, was {{for many}} years Special Assistant for Government Relations in the administrations of Presidents Edward Jennings and Gordon Gee. After his formal retirement he continued {{to serve as a}} Special Counselor to Presidents Gee, Kirwan, and Holbrook. He presents a unique insider’s view of various key issues including university budgets, funding, tuition, and describes rival interests that also compete for the same public and private dollars. These would include secondary and primary education, Medicaid, the twelve other four-year state universities in Ohio, and the prison system. Some comparisons are made to other public universities in Ohio, including Miami, Cleveland State, Ohio, and Toledo, and the work of the Inter-University Council, and institutions in other states, such as Illinois and Michigan. The issue of the rivalry between Ohio State University and “downtown” over construction of either one or two large public arenas (“the arena wars”) is examined. Ultimately, of course, Gordon Gee decided the university must have its own, and Schottenstein Center was built at Ohio State, and Nationwide Arena downtown. 	During both the Jennings and Gee administrations there was concern that the academic ranking of Ohio State was less than it should be. It was decided to move from conditional to selective admissions, and to provide special funding to departments to recruit and finance distinguished faculty. The legislature was generally supportive of the move to selective admissions since this would reduce the need for remediation. Conditional/Unconditional admissions were instituted which warned students that if they lacked a set number of high school credits in key areas such as English, math, foreign language, etc., that these must be made up at Ohio State, without earning credits for graduation. It was a non-cost method to get students to do in high school what they should have been doing all along. Another positive innovation was the introduction of the Selective Excellence package that included Eminent Scholars and chaired professorships. 	A controversial issue that surfaced in the 1980 ’s was the use of animals for research. A coalition of state universities and other groups succeeded in defeating a proposed bill that would have placed serious limitations of the use of animals. One animal rights advocate when asked by a legislator “If we can’t use animals for research, what should we do?” replied, “We should use prisoners. ” This remark helped kill the proposal. On campus researchers who used animals for research were often stridently challenged. Another key legislative issue was the need to clarify the rules by which Ohio State could better protect intellectual property, and to allow faculty and universities to benefit by commercialization of their discoveries. Dr. Asher also took an active role in opposing two proposed constitutional amendments that would have repealed all of the recent tax increases and require that any future tax increases be approved by a super-majority of 60 % of the Ohio legislators. He also describes his methods of interacting personally with legislators and other lobbyists. The university also opposed the imposition of term limits on Ohio legislators. Gordon Gee gave serious thought to running for Governor and, as Asher explains, this never happened. Had Gee done so, it was unclear to Asher if he would have run as a Democrat or a Republican. Gee had been unusually successful in his dealings with legislators, local leaders, editors, and alumni groups around the state. He endeavored to visit all 88 counties in Ohio, and took faculty with him on these visits. He spoke frequently at high schools. He strengthened ties with the Cooperative Extension Service including the 4 -H program. His successful outreach efforts helped gain support from the legislature for Gee’s advocacy of promoting OSU as a great national sports center, with all the buildings and equipment needed in support. Since most of the substantial costs incurred in building various state-of-the art athletic facilities came from <b>non-taxpayer</b> sources, the legislators, many of whom were football fans, raised few objections. The one substantial investment of state monies was $ 15 million for construction of Schottenstein Center. Gee seemed to think that he could sell the OSU academic side better if he had a strong athletic program. He believed it built a sense of community, a sense of identification, and opened some doors. Asher was less convinced of this and doubted that a potential big giver would give less to the university if the football team were not doing well. Nor did he see any connection in the legislature between appropriations and athletic success. Many faculty members did not understand why reconstruction of the football stadium took precedence over remodeling the library. 	Occasionally Asher worked with forums outside the legislature. He worked with the Board of Trustees on the issue of divestiture from South Africa and indirectly with fundraisers. His close ties with legislators, and numerous contacts around the state, provided much useful information. During the Gee administration Asher {{was a member of the}} Governor’s Task Force that was, among other things, was charged with adopting a two-tier system of higher education, with Ohio State and Cincinnati to be designated as the two comprehensive research institutions. Other state universities feared their own programs would suffer, and Governor Voinovich was also opposed. The proposal was dead on arrival. It was determined to seek to achieve the same result through other means. Much was said about Ohio State being the “flagstaff institution” of the state. Ads were placed touting OSU as the “number one university in the State of Ohio,” although, as Asher says, it was “not exactly an impressive accomplishment to say you’re number one in Ohio. ” One basic problem was that Ohio had too many universities trying to do the same thing. Most of these had aspirations to become a higher ranked research institution. Clearly the state could not afford this proliferation. There was also some serious talk of converting the branch campuses to community colleges, a proposal that caused an outcry in Marion, Lima, Mansfield, and Newark. Other state universities had their own branch campuses, including Ohio, Miami, Kent State, and Youngstown. 	Dr. Asher also played an important but lesser role in working at the national level, particularly in the area of health sciences and medical education. It was largely a role of largely keeping in touch with friends and contacts in Washington, especially the Ohio congressional delegation. There was also “The Midwestern Universities Alliance,” a consortium of some of the Big Ten schools and several other institutions. Federal work was done largely in the context of this organization, although other groups that also helped were the National Association of State Colleges and Land Grant Universities, AAU, and some others. Certain powerful interest groups within the university, notably agriculture and medicine, had their own, independent outreach programs at both the state and federal levels. Asher had an excellent working relationship with President Jennings and Gee, and they, in turn, worked quite well with faculty. Jennings, for example, allowed Asher to continue as Chairman of the Steering Committee of the University Senate, at the same time he also worked as a Special Assistant to the President. Usually he felt comfortable telling Jennings of possible problems, although Asher now regrets he never shared with Jennings his distrust of the former athletic director, Rick Bay. In particular he refers to Bay’s “treachery” in going public one week before the end of the football season, contrary to Jennings’ specific instructions, that football coach Earl Bruce was to be fired. Asher’s work with two different presidents gave him an increased awareness of the wide influence of the presidents beyond the university community. On the state level they were free to pick up the phone and call the Governor, the Speaker, or other key legislators. At the invitation of Leslie Wexner, Gee was made a member of The Titans, a small but highly influential group of key leaders who enjoyed influence at both the local and state levels. For some years Asher taught a course on Ohio Politics, and his work in the president’s office gave him a much keener insight into political realities in the state. Ohio, he said, “really is a series of city states,” each much given to regionalism and localism. Consequently the proposal to designate Ohio State and Cincinnati as the two research universities could go nowhere. Asher had much respect for Vern Riffe, the Speaker of the House, an “incredibly talented” man who effectively dealt with local as well as larger issues. Riffe was known to complain about the ongoing demands of Roy Kottman, former Dean of Agriculture, that whatever monies the state appropriated for Agriculture that it was never enough. He had a much better relationship with Max Lennon, Kottman’s successor. Riffe was a genius in getting legislation passed that he favored. “He was as good as anybody in the political process. ” 	Dr. Asher retired from Ohio State near the end of the Gee presidency, but he continued to be busy as a “Counselor to the University President,” a new post that Gee created for him. He served as a lobbyist for Ohio State until he was appointed to the Ohio Ethics Commission. Gee’s successor, Brit Kirwan, continued to use Asher as a counselor. He also served for two years as Interim Director of the John Glenn Institute for Public Service and Public Policy. He worked effectively to get the Institute solidly launched and funded, it’s mission defined, and he was involved in plans for the renovation of Stillman Hall, the first home of the Institute. Asher has high praise for his successor, Debbie Merritt, as Director of the Glenn Institute. Community Research Partners, a partnership between the City of Columbus, United Way, and the University, was another successful entity within the Glenn Institute. Asher continued as “Counselor to the President” through the first year of the Karen Holbrook administration. At that time he resigned. He never held the title as Vice President, but felt this never limited his access or effectiveness with Jennings and Gee. He also worked closely with the OSU Alumni Advocates, a unit of the OSU Alumni Association, and grass-roots lobbying organization, which worked closely with state legislators especially on funding and tuition issues. In an era of term limits grass roots lobbying is more important than ever. Asher never regretted his decision to come to Ohio State. However, he feels that the university is under-appreciated. Despite the reservations of some Asher concluded that Ohio State is a major, major flagship institution, “a wonderful institution, with a wonderful history department and a wonderful political science department. ”Edward Jennings: President of Ohio State University (1981 - 1990), numerous references [...] Gordon Gee: President of Ohio State University (1990 - 1997), numerous references [...] Brit Kirwan: president of Ohio State (pp. 37, 90 - 91) [...] Karen Holbrook: President of Ohio State (pp. 91 - 92) [...] Bill Napier: Special Assistant to President Harold Enarson, and lobbyist (pp. 1 - 2, 37) [...] Vern Riffe: Speaker of the House in Ohio Legislature, numerous references [...] Stan Aronoff: President at times of Ohio State Senate, various references [...] Patrick Sweeney: representative in Ohio legislature (pp. 8 - 9) [...] Mike Stinziano, representative from Columbus who represented university area (p. 8) [...] Paul Gilmore: President for a time of Ohio State Senate (p. 9) [...] Jack Hollander: Research Vice President at OSU (p. 9) [...] Bill Shkurti: Fiscal officer for OSU (p. 13) [...] George Voinovich: Governor of Ohio, various references [...] Inter-University Council, various references [...] John Glenn: John Glenn Institute (pp. 89 - 90) [...] Manuel Tzagournis: influential Dean of the Medical School (pp. 25 - 26) [...] Paul Pfeiffer: Ohio State Senator and Supreme Court Judge (p. 30) [...] Dick Celeste: Governor of Ohio (pp. 41, 52) [...] Greg Browning: Budget Director, state of Ohio (p. 47) [...] Robert Bennett: State Republican Chairman (p. 62) [...] Gregory Lashutka: Mayor of Columbus (p. 63) [...] Rick Bay: Athletic Director (pp. 76 - 77) [...] Earle Bruce: football coach (pp. 76 - 77) [...] Jim Rhodes: Governor of Ohio, several references [...] Roy Kottman: Dean of the College of Agriculture (p. 83) [...] Max Lennon: Vice President for Agriculture (pp. 83 - 84...|$|E

Additionally, as much as he was opposed to centralism in politics he was opposed to concentration of capitalism by supporting a number of early progressive laws regulating Interstate commerce and limiting the power and concentration of corporations.

50|$|In 1997, the {{tax credit}} was {{scrapped}} for <b>non-taxpayers</b> (except charities and PEPs), which had a particular impact on pension funds, which could no longer claim a refund for any amount {{that had previously been}} paid as ACT. The effect of the change was that pension funds became effectively taxed on dividend income by way of the now non-refundable ACT, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly resulting in the winding up of some pension funds. Treasury argued that the change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth. The Times obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act in April 2007 that showed the chancellor Gordon Brown had been advised that pension funds would suffer a £67 billion loss of the actuarial value of their assets as a net result of a combination of policies including the ACT change.|$|R
