5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> personally killing anyone and <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Abraham Thornton {{was charged}} {{with the murder of}} Mary Ashford. Thornton had met Ashford at a dance, and had walked with her from the event. The next morning, Ashford was found drowned in a pit, with little outward signs of violence. Although public opinion was heavily against Thornton, the jury quickly acquitted him, and also found him <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> rape.|$|E

5|$|On June 29 the FIA World Motorsport Council {{found the}} teams guilty {{on the first}} two counts, that is, of not being in {{possession}} of suitable tyres for the event, but with strong mitigating circumstances, and that of wrongfully refusing to allow their cars to start the race. The teams were found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> the other three counts. The punishment, however, was not decided, and was not to have been announced until September 14.|$|E
5|$|The jury {{never left}} the box, but instead conferred {{together}} and found Thornton not guilty in six minutes. They were then resworn on the rape allegation. The prosecution informed the court {{that it had no}} evidence to offer on that count, and Mr Justice Holroyd directed the jury to find the prisoner <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> rape, which they did. Thornton was set free.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{presents}} evidence that Deng {{was convicted of}} prostitution two years ago. Deng denies the charge and says she had been gang-raped by the soldiers who killed her husband. Deng's credibility weakens further when the defense presents a surprise witness, Daniel Achok, who testifies that he had advised her to fabricate the gang rape on her application for political asylum. The jury reached verdicts {{on two of the}} three charges, finding DiStasio guilty of unlawful imprisonment and <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> assault but deadlocks on the rape charge, and Benson says that he will likely serve a year in prison.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> espionage.|$|E
5|$|The court deliberated {{for nearly}} two months before passing {{judgement}} on 30 September, with the defendants being individually sentenced on 1 October. Hess was found guilty on two counts: crimes against peace (planning and preparing a war of aggression), and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes. He was found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> war crimes and crimes against humanity. He was given a life sentence, one of seven Nazis to receive prison sentences at the trial. These seven were transported by aircraft to the Allied military prison at Spandau in Berlin on 18 July 1947. The Soviet member of the tribunal, Major-General Iona Nikitchenko, filed a document recording his dissent of Hess's sentence; he felt the death sentence was warranted.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Mantle {{performed}} in the black comedy The Ladykillers, playing the part of Major Courtney. He was forced {{to withdraw from the}} touring production in March 2013 after he was attacked at the Travelodge hotel in Newcastle. On the night of Saturday 23 March, he became involved in a brawl after asking a group of fellow guests to keep the noise down, during which part of his right ear was bitten off. He had to have emergency surgery at the Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital to have it sewn back on. A 32-year-old man from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire was charged over the incident and appeared before a magistrate in April 2013, and another man was released on bail in connection to the incident; a third man has been released without charge. In June 2014 the two accused were found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> all charges.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated that he was <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was {{trying to put the}} blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
50|$|On August 30, 2004, Hirte {{was charged}} with first-degree murder. He was held in Winnebago County jail on $400,000 bond. He pleaded <b>not</b> <b>guilty,</b> and later changed his plea to <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> by reason <b>of</b> mental disease or defect. If he were found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> by reason <b>of</b> mental disease or defect, Hirte {{would be able to}} {{petition}} every six months for release.|$|R

5|$|Zoe {{is found}} <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> Sarah's murder, {{due to the}} court believing Sarah {{committed}} suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her what she saw, and tells her she believes Zoe {{is trying to get}} Mike on her side {{to make it look like}} she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she could try to get Zoe on her side, she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out of the flat.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian texts take {{different}} views {{on whether the}} gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly. Misfortune was often seen {{as a product of}} isfet, the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat, and therefore the gods were <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> causing evil events. Some deities who were closely connected with isfet, such as Set, could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods. But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery, while others give theodicies in the gods' defense. Beginning in the Middle Kingdom, several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth. Because of this human misbehavior, the creator is distant from his creation, allowing suffering to exist. New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom. They emphasize humans' direct, personal relationships with deities and the gods' power to intervene in human events. People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives. As a result, upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods' favor as a way to guarantee a good life. Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid, and after the New Kingdom came to an end, government was increasingly influenced by oracles communicating the gods' will.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the ICTY {{secretly}} indicted Arkan for {{war crimes}} carried out in Sanski Most in 1995, but not for those in Bijeljina. In January 2000, {{he was killed in}} a Belgrade hotel lobby by masked gunmen, and did not face trial. In 1999, Milošević was indicted for carrying out a genocidal campaign that included Bijeljina and other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges, but he died mid-trial in March 2006. In February 2000, Plavšić and Momčilo Krajišnik, the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, were indicted for the same genocidal campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges. On 2 October 2002, Plavšić pleaded guilty to persecuting the non-Serb populations in 37 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bijeljina. This plea was entered under an agreement that involved the prosecution moving to dismiss the remaining charges. She was subsequently sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. On 27 September 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty on a five counts of crimes against humanity, including the same count as Plavšić regarding the persecution of non-Serb populations in municipalities including Bijeljina, but he was found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> genocide. In 2009, he was handed a twenty-year prison sentence. After serving two-thirds of her sentence, Plavšić was released in October 2009. Krajišnik was released in August 2013, having served two-thirds of his sentence (including time spent in custody).|$|E

5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in his hand as if he were heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E
