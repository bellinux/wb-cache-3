40|$|The rotary {{compressor}} with rolling piston {{is a widely}} used compressor with less <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> while it is minimized from normal scale to meso or micro scale, the input and exit ports dimension is limited by port requirement and lead to a certain <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> therefore, keeping or improving its volume efficiency is an important issue. Although rolling piston compressor {{is a kind of}} compact structure compressor, the existence of the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is inevitable in a compressor, the more the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> the lower the volumetric efficiency of compressor. The overflow is a method to improve the volumetric efficiency of a compressor which had been discussed in wankel compressor, in the overflowing process the clearance space with high pressure is connected directly with the space with lower pressure, mostly that is in the moment, one of the chambers in the {{rotary compressor}} {{is at the end of}} the exhaust process, and another chamber is at the sucking stage or the initial compression process. The gas pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> is visibly higher than that in the compression chamber. The high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume</b> flows into the compression cylinder via a certain way; this flow considerably increases the pressure in the compression cylinder and decreases the pressure in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> Thus, the intake and exhaust times means to be extended, and the volumetric efficiency and the cooling capacity of the compressor can be substantially enhanced. In this paper, we introduce the effect of input and exit dimensions on the volume efficiency of rolling piston compressor, and the overflow design on a rolling piston compressor that fully uses the high-pressure gas in the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume,</b> and discuss its effect on the performance of a compressor by theoretical analyses. Usually, the coefficient of performance of a vapor refrigeration cycle with the compressor overflow has a certain decrease compared with the conventional compressor, but the volumetric efficiency of the compressor with overflow and the cooling capacity of the thermodynamic cycle recesses are visibly higher than those of the conventional compressor in terms of the same operation and dimension parameters. The overflow has beneficial effect on miniaturizing the compresso...|$|R

One aspect of engine performance is considered in great detail, namely the combustion performance at increased <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> This aspect was of particular interest because variable compression ratio (VCR) systems normally operate by varying the <b>clearance</b> <b>volume.</b> The investigation relied upon results obtained both from experimental and computer simulating models. The experimental tests were carried out using a single-cylinder direct-injection diesel engine, under simulated turbocharged conditions at a reduced compression ratio.

The NACA single-cylinder universal test engine equipped with both a fuel-injection system and a carburetor was used.

Tests were conducted for a range of compression ratios from 5. 5 to 8. 5. Except for variable speed tests, all tests were conducted at an engine speed of 1, 500 r. p. m.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oesophageal {{clearance}} of {{acid reflux}} {{consists of an}} initial <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> followed by neutralisation of the acidified mucosa by swallowed saliva (chemical clearance). Ineffective oesophageal motility (IOM), a frequent finding in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), has been claimed to underlie prolonged acid clearance by affecting oesophageal emptying and saliva transport. Intraluminal impedance allows non-radiological monitoring of movement of oesophageal liquids. AIMS: To evaluate the relevance of IOM during oesophageal <b>volume</b> and chemical <b>clearance</b> using combined pH impedance measurements. SUBJECTS: Impedance was validated with fluoroscopy to study <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> in three healthy subjects. Acid clearance tests were performed in 10 healthy subjects in the upright and supine positions, before and after oesophageal peristaltic disruption with sildenafil 50 mg. METHODS: After instillation of an acid bolus, simultaneous manometry, pH, and impedance were used to study oesophageal motility, chemical <b>clearance,</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance,</b> respectively. RESULTS: Impedance allowed assessment of <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> accurately, showing a strong correlation with fluoroscopy (r(2) = 0. 89). Sildenafil provoked a graded impairment in oesophageal motility in healthy subjects without affecting saliva secretion. In the upright position, <b>volume</b> <b>clearance</b> was slightly prolonged only with severe IOM (> 80 % abnormal peristaltic sequences). In the supine position, severe IOM significantly prolonged chemical and <b>volume</b> <b>clearance.</b> Moderate IOM (30 - 80 % abnormal peristalsis) had no effect. With normal peristalsis and moderate IOM, clearance times were similar in the upright and supine positions. Severe IOM however had {{a greater impact on}} clearance in the supine than in the upright position. CONCLUSION: Ineffective oesophageal motility has little effect on oesophageal clearance during upright acid reflux. With supine reflux, only severe IOM is associated with prolonged oesophageal clearance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rotordynamic {{and thermal}} {{analyses}} of compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings were performed. First, compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings with pad radial compliance (CFTPBs) were introduced and designed for high-speed oil-free micro turbomachinery. The pad radial compliance was for accommodation of large rotor growth at high speeds. Parametric studies on pivot offset, preload, and tilting stiffness were performed using non-linear orbit simulations and coast-down simulations for an optimum design. Second, coast-down tests for imbalance response {{and stability of}} typical rotor-bearing system with a rigid rotor and two CFTPBs designed from the above design studies were conducted over operating speeds up to 55 krpm. Prediction of synchronous rotordynamic responses was made in terms of critical speed for various imbalance modes by using a rotordynamic analysis software (XLTRC), combined with dynamic force coefficients from the perturbation analysis. For stability analyses, a generalized orbit simulation program was developed considering both the translational and angular rotor motions with two different bearings. Linear stability analyses for the conical vibration mode were also performed by using XLTRC and the perturbation analysis based on the Lund method. Predictions of whirl speed showed good agreement to the tests, but the estimated onset speed of instability appeared lower than the measured instability. Finally, a new thermo-hydrodynamic analysis model of a typical rotor-bearing system with CFTPBs was presented, accompanying linear perturbation analyses to investigate thermal effects on the rotordynamic performance. A numerical procedure was established for solving the generalized Reynolds equation, the 3 -D energy equation, and the associated boundary conditions at the pad inlet flow and solid walls (rotor and pad) simultaneously. Parametric studies were conducted on <b>nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> and external load. <b>Nominal</b> <b>clearance</b> showed significant influence on temperature fields, and external load had uneven thermal effects among pads. Case studies with heat flux and temperature boundary conditions on the rotor end surface were performed to simulate various working conditions of the bearing.

A model was developed using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM) to describe the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of ifosfamide by linking the ifosfamide plasma concentrations to the extent of the autoinduction. The proposed model revealed the effect of autoinduction on the disposition of ifosfamide. The initial <b>clearance,</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution, rate constant for enzyme degradation, induction half-life of the enzyme and the ifosfamide concentration at 50 % of the maximum inhibition of enzyme degradation were estimated at 2. 94 +/- 0. 27 l h- 1, 43. 5 +/- 2. 9 l, 0. 0546 +/- 0. 0078 h- 1, 12. 7 h and 30. 7 +/- 4. 8 microM, respectively. Interindividual variabilities of initial <b>clearance,</b> <b>volume</b> of distribution, rate constant for enzyme degradation were 24. 5, 23. 4 and 22. 7 %, respectively. Proportional and additive variability not explained by the model were 13. 6 % and 0. 0763 microM, respectively. The absence of a lag time for the autoinduction of ifosfamide metabolism could be the result of an immediate inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of CYP 3 A 4 by ifosfamide.
