5000|$|Under the 2015 standard, for {{the first}} time, storage water heaters with {{capacities}} of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a 75 gal gas storage water heater with a <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> of [...] or less was able to have an energy factor as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, {{which can only be}} achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> of 75,000 btu or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since energy factor is not defined for such units. An 80 gal electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum energy factor of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with heat pump technology. It should be noted that this efficiency rating measures efficiency at the point of use. Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30-35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity {{on the other end of}} the generator. Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, transmission and distribution losses in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation. In contrast, 90% of natural gas’ energy value isdelivered to the consumer. (In neither case is the energy expended exploring, developing and extracting coal or natural gas resources included in the quoted efficiency numbers.) Gas tankless water heaters shall have an energy factor of 82% or greater under the 2015 standards, which corresponds to the pre-2015 Energy Star standard.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternative}} model {{starts with}} the notion that any economy involves a large number of heterogeneous types of inputs, including both fixed capital equipment and labor. Both main types of inputs can be unemployed. The upward-sloping AS curve arises because (1) some <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> prices are fixed in the short run and (2) as output rises, more and more production processes encounter bottlenecks. At low levels of demand, there are large numbers of production processes that do not use their fixed capital equipment fully. Thus, production can be increased without {{much in the way of}} diminishing returns and the average price level need not rise much (if at all) to justify increased production. The AS curve is flat. On the other hand, when demand is high, few production processes have unemployed fixed inputs. Thus, bottlenecks are general. Any increase in demand and production induces increases in prices. Thus, the AS curve is steep or vertical.|$|E

The control strategy is implemented using Internal Model Control based on a multivariable linear state-space model obtained by the Maximum Likelihood method. The linear model describes the variations of the average temperature around a nominal trajectory. This trajectory is obtained as the response to <b>nominal</b> <b>inputs</b> that have been proved to work well in real leaching applications, and is computed using a comprehensive high complexity mathematical model developed by BHP Billiton Innovation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the comparative advantages of producing tomato and cucumber in Khorasan Razavi for crop year 2013 - 2014. Results revealed that the province enjoys comparative advantages of producing these crops. As the producer Nominal Protection Coefficient (NPC) for both crops is less than 1, the burden of tax is indirectly imposed on the producer. The <b>Nominal</b> <b>Inputs</b> Protection Coefficient (NIPC) is greater than 1 for both tomato and cucumber; this means that an indirect taxed is imposed on producers in using inputs. The Effective Protection Coefficient (EPC) is less than 1, or government’s interventions come to producers harm. Finally, the Net Social Profitability (NSP) is positive for both crops.

50|$|An SMPS {{designed}} for AC input {{can usually be}} run from a DC supply, because the DC would pass through the rectifier unchanged. If the power supply is {{designed for}} 115 VAC and has no voltage selector switch, the required DC voltage would be 163 VDC (115 × √). This type of use may be harmful to the rectifier stage, however, as it will only use half of diodes in the rectifier for the full load. This could possibly result in overheating of these components, causing them to fail prematurely. On the other hand, if the power supply has a voltage selector switch, based on the Delon circuit, for 115/230V (computer ATX power supplies typically are in this category), the selector switch {{would have to be}} put in the 230 V position, and the required voltage would be 325 VDC (230 × √). The diodes in this type of power supply will handle the DC current just fine because they are rated to handle double the <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> current when operated in the 115 V mode, due to the operation of the voltage doubler. This is because the doubler, when in operation, uses only half of the bridge rectifier and runs twice as much current through it. It is uncertain how an Auto-ranging/Active-PFC type power supply would react to being powered by DC.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, output {{tracking}} {{control of a}} helicopter model is investigated. The model is derived from Newton-Euler equations by assuming that the helicopter body is rigid. First, we show that for several choices of output variables exact input-output linearization fails to linearize the whole state space and results in having unstable zero dynamics. By neglecting the couplings between moments and forces, we show that the approximated system with dynamic decoupling is full state linearizable by choosing positions and heading as outputs. We prove that bounded tracking is achieved by applying the approximate control. Next, we derive a diffeomorphism showing that an approximation {{of the system is}} differentially flat, thus state trajectory and <b>nominal</b> <b>inputs</b> can be generated from a given output trajectory.

40|$|Models with {{information}} frictions display output and inflation dynamics {{that are consistent}} with the empirical evidence. However, an assumption in the existing litera-ture is that pricing managers do not interact with production managers within firms. If this assumption were relaxed, nominal shocks would not have real effects on the economy. In this paper, I present a model with perfect communication within firms in which nominal shocks have real effects. In this model, intermediate goods firms accumulate output inventories, observe aggregate variables with one period lag, and observe their <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> prices and demand at all times. Firms face idiosyncratic shocks and cannot perfectly infer the state of nature. After a contractionary nominal shock, <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> prices go down, and firms accumulate inventories because they perceive some positive probability that the nominal price decline is due to a good pro-ductivity shock. This prevents firms ’ prices from decreasing and makes current profits, households ’ income, and aggregate demand go down. According to my model simula-tions, a 1 % decrease in the money growth rate causes output to decline 0. 17 % in the first quarter and 0. 38 % in the second followed by a slow recovery to the steady state. Contractionary nominal shocks also have significant effects on total investment, which remains 1 % below the steady state for the first 6 quarters. I show that if firms make investment decisions and if their <b>nominal</b> <b>input</b> prices and demand do not perfectly re-veal the state of nature, the economy exhibits money non-neutrality even under flexible prices and perfect communication within firms...|$|E
