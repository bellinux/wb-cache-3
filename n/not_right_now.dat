[...] For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world (pure mathematics) and, in particular, his own special field of number theory. Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>now),</b> so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.

50|$|His name, {{understood}} as 'One-Leg', suggests god K of Postclassic and Classic Maya iconography, a deity of lightning with one human leg, and one leg {{shaped like a}} serpent. God K is {{commonly referred to as}} Bolon Tzacab and K'awiil or Kauil. The name may ultimately derive from huracan, a Carib word, and the source of the words hurricane and orcan (European windstorm). Huracan also helped destroy the manikins, the results of their second try. Huracan sent dogs and turkeys into the manikin's homes proclaiming revenge for the dogs and turkeys slain and eaten. Also, frying pans, mortars, pestles, and even stones came alive. The frying pans complained about their mouths being filled with ash and declared that they will be treated as them. The mortars complained about being banged with a pestle every day and that they will be beaten by pestles as their punishment. The pestles complained about their mouths being filled with grain each and every day. Finally, the stones shot out of the fireplacecrushing the helpless manikins. Some sought refuge in trees but fell off after the branches shook them down. Some sought refuge in caves, but huge boulders closed the entrance entombing them forever. Some say you can still hear their sad wails to this day. The survivors ran into the forest and were chased by Huracan and the dogs and turkeys. They ran day and night until they could not go on. Huracan was pleased that there was no more manikins and so he walked until he found a field full of corn. He and Gúcumatz,the plumed serpent, handed the corn to Xmucane, who mixed corn with water to make dough. Out of this dough they made four men, Jaguar Quitze, Jaguar Night, <b>Not</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Now</b> and Dark Jaguar. Humans {{used to be able to}} do anything, fly, see oceans from far away, and inside rocks. Huracan clouded their vision so that they couldn't see so far. Huracan also sent Hunahpu and Xbalanque on their missions and presided over the decapitation of Zipacna the earth monster.|$|E
5000|$|On 6 March 1943, Goebbels in his {{capacity}} as the Gauleiter of Berlin ordered all of the people imprisoned at Rosenstrasse 2-4 released, writing [...] "I will commission the security police not to continue the Jewish evacuations in a systematic manner during such a critical time reference to the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad. We want to rather spare that for ourselves until after a few weeks; then we can carry it out that much more thoroughly". In reference to the protests, Goebbels attacked the RSHA, stating [...] "One has to intervene all over the place, to ward off damages. The efforts of certain officers are so lacking in political savvy that one cannot let them operate on their own for ten minutes!". On 1 April 1943, the American Legation in Bern reported to Washington: [...] "Action against Jewish wives and husbands {{on the part of the}} Gestapo ... had to be discontinued some time ago because of the protest which such action aroused". Leopold Gutterer, who was Goebbels's deputy at the Propaganda Ministry, remembered that Goebbels stated if force was used to crush the demonstrations, it would prompt wider protests all over Berlin, which might soon become political, and could possibly even lead to the overthrow of the Nazi regime. Gutterer stated in an interview: [...] "Goebbels released the Jews in order to eliminate that protest from the world. That was the simplest solution: to eradicate completely the reason for the protest. Then it wouldn't make any sense to protest anymore. So that others didn't take a lesson the protest, so others didn't begin to do the same, the reason the protest had to be eliminated. There was unrest, and it could have spread from neighborhood to neighborhood ... Why should Goebbels have had them protestors all arrested? Then he would have only had even more unrest, from the relatives of these newly arrested persons". Gutterer also said: [...] "That protest was only possible in a large city, where people lived together, whether Jewish or not. In Berlin were also representatives of the international press, who immediately grabbed hold of something like this, to loudly proclaim it. Thus news of the protest would travel from one person to the next". Goebbels swiftly realized that to use force against the women protesting on the Rosenstrasse would undermine the claim that all Germans were united in the volksgemeinschaft, which was especially threatening as belief in the volksgemeinschaft held the German home front together. Furthermore, using force against the protestors would not only damage the volksgemeinschaft, which provided the domestic unity to support the war, but was also draw unwanted attention to the [...] "Final Solution to the Jewish Question". Stolzfus wrote: [...] "A public discussion about the fate of deported Jews threatened to disclose the Final Solution and thus endanger the entire war effort." [...] Despite the news blackout imposed by Goebbels, the news of the protests on the Rosenstrasse had travelled swiftly by word of mouth all over Germany and beyond; in Switzerland, British and American diplomats heard rumors of the Rosenstrasse protests, and in the first week of March 1943, British and American newspapers reported on the protests in Berlin. Goebbels hit back by having the German newspapers claim that the women were actually protesting against the British bombing of Berlin, and far from cracking, the volksgemeinschaft was stronger than ever, stating that charity donations in Germany had gone up 70% in the last year a sign that the volksgenossen. Hitler himself expressed concerns that the protestors on the Rosenstrasse reminded him too much of those Germans who protested against World War I in 1918, which presaged the November Revolution. The National Socialist regime had based its claim to legitimacy to a very large extent on the claim the volksgemeinschaft had been created in 1933, and anything that suggested that the volksgemeinschaft was maintained only by force instead of free will thus threatened the regime's claim to legitimacy. On 9 March 1943, during a meeting, Hitler told Goebbels that he acted [...] "correctly" [...] as he understood the [...] "psychological" [...] reasons for the Rosenstrasse protests. Having praised Goebbels for [...] "having done the right thing", Hitler added he still expected Goebbels to make certain the Jews of Berlin [...] "disappeared", if just <b>not</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> The Reichsfüherer SS Heinrich Himmler, through he intensely disliked Goebbels, also approved of releasing the Jews held on the Rosenstrasse. Himmler, who liked to boast that he [...] "felt the pulse of the German people", had advised in 1941 during the protests against Action T4 program to cancel the program as it was creating too many protests, now advised that it was better to give in as to use force would only cause more protests.|$|E
