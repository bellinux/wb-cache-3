The challenge has been to report on "ultimate outcomes" (i. e., the production and dissemination of <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> statistics along best international practices) rather than on "inputs" (i. e., the number of <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> missions fielded by AFW), as it has been the case to date. The paper concludes that the "ultimate outcome" of producing and disseminating robust <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> is work in progress, with AFW''s technical assistance efforts mainly focusing on source data assessments and methodological issues underpinning the compilation of <b>national</b> <b>accounts.</b> The pending challenge is to further support a more timely production and dissemination of <b>national</b> <b>accounts</b> data, as recommended in the Data ROSCs and by the IMF mission teams to AFW member countries.

40|$|According to KENDRICK (1996, p. 1), <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> {{have become}} “an {{indispensable}} tool for macroeconomic analysis, projections, and policy formulation”. The paper elaborates on this statement, addressing policy domains that {{rely heavily on}} <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> data. Yet – useful as they are – <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> can also be misused {{in the context of}} governance. The most common misapplication of <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> relates to the field of international comparisons. For instance, according to <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> data, the U. S. have outperformed all other high-income economies {{over the course of the}} 90 s and up through the new millennium. In many European countries, public debate centres on the question how to devise ‘structural reforms’ in order to make the set-up of the respective economy more similar to that of the United States. Arguably, the main impact of <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> on governance can be found here. Still, there are large differences in the ways <b>National</b> <b>Accounts</b> calculations are carried out even among European countries, let alone between Europe and the U. S. The paper discusses several such differences, showing that the divergence in growth rates between the U. S. and the EU since 1997 can be explained almost entirely in terms of differing statistical methods. <b>National</b> <b>Accounts,</b> governance, inflation and growth comparisons, deflation methods, statistical artefacts...|$|R

2500|$|In recent years, feminist {{critiques of}} neoclassical {{economic}} models gained prominence, {{leading to the}} formation of feminist economics. Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a positive and objective science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors (homo economicus); exogenous tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of unpaid work; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. Feminist economics developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. In 1988, Marilyn Waring published the book If Women Counted, in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores women's unpaid work and the value of nature; according to Julie A. Nelson, If Women Counted [...] "showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within <b>national</b> <b>accounting</b> systems" [...] and [...] "issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability." [...] Bjørnholt and McKay argue that the financial crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet.|$|E
