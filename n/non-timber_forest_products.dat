In making this argument, Siebert wants to address Western ignorance about rattan and the timber bias in tropical forest management. The book reflects Siebert's admirable commitment to long-term and grounded ecological research as it draws on over 25 years of fieldwork with forest-dependent communities, especially in Indonesia and Philippines. Written as a personal "reflection," it complements his previous scientific papers on the ecology and management of rattan. As such, it is clearly positioned as a descriptive account aimed especially at engaging students...|$|R
