25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and {{if we want to}} believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> electrons <b>to</b> say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|R

25|$|The idea of {{the social}} sharing of emotion derived from studies about {{emotional}} trauma. These studies show that after natural disasters, catastrophes, or life-change events people {{have a tendency to}} talk about their experiences and disclose their feelings and emotions. For example, in a 1975 study exploring the psychological reactions to the death of a loved one, it was found that 88% of bereavers felt a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the event to others. Other studies produced similar findings for people who experienced natural disasters and for cancer patients. Rimé later proposed the term “social sharing of emotions” to describe this phenomenon.|$|E

The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also taking time to defend Löw: [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> mistakes and learn from them, {{it does not mean that}} it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally.

Sometimes you talk about Ronaldinho and Eto'o and people like that; you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the proper footballer who made the difference, and that was Henrik Larsson tonight." [...] Henry also remarked, [...] "You {{have to remember that}} Barcelona is a team. It's not Eto'o, it's not Ronaldinho. On Wednesday, the man who made the difference was Henrik Larsson. You have to give him credit for that because when he came on he made some amazing runs around the box and he showed he is a team player. You saw two times he fed the ball back to people and that's what I always talk about, he is a team player. He did that against us, even though the first goal was a close offside decision." [...] Larsson's addition giving Barcelona the cutting edge required to overcome Arsenal was noted by international press.|$|E

500|$|St Asaph {{explained}} that the only interpretation of the video lies on the opinion of each viewer about Spears's personal life, and how active a role each person imagines she plays in it. It was noted by St Asaph that although most pop stars release videos that draw from their personal lives, they do not make the viewer uncomfortable. The same cannot be said for Spears and Rihanna, {{and it does not}} matter if they themselves have moved on from past situations, because the discussion around them has not. St Asaph also expressed that neither Spears or Rihanna said much about the parallels to their lives, but that they do not need to: their videos are much more effective than anything they could reveal in an interview. Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly also compared it to [...] "We Found Love", saying that both videos feature an anti-British sentiment. She wrote that all the villains in the video – her boyfriend and the policemen – are British, whereas her savior in the video is an American criminal. Alexandra noted that Spears and Rihanna chose to films their [...] "grittiest videos" [...] in a country with a lower crime rate than the United States, that is also so against guns that politicians felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. According to her, the videos continue with a xenophobic portrayal of British people as villains by American pop culture.|$|E
500|$|Don't Look Now {{has been}} much admired by and an {{influence}} on subsequent filmmakers. [...] Danny Boyle cites Nicolas Roeg as a key influence on his work and counts it amongst his favourite films. Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, and Jeremy Dyson drew upon Don't Look Now considerably for their television series The League of Gentlemen; Pemberton ranks it among the top three British horror films of the 1960s and 1970s, and says that he wants things he has written to make audiences feel the way he felt when he watched The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now. Similarly, Ryan Murphy considers his TV series American Horror Story to be a throwback to '60s and '70s psychological horror, citing Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Shining as particular examples. Thematic and narrative similarities with Lars von Trier's Antichrist have also been observed, with Antichrist's cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, commenting that he has watched Don't Look Now more times than any other film. Fabrice Du Welz, whose film Vinyan has often been compared to Don't Look Now, has stated {{that it is a}} film he is [...] "obsessed with", and one of his favourites, while Lynne Ramsay cited it as an influence on We <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>about</b> Kevin, which incidentally is also produced by Roeg's son, Luc. Ami Canaan Mann has also acknowledged she was influenced by atmospheric thrillers such as Picnic at Hanging Rock and Don't Look Now while directing her debut feature, Texas Killing Fields.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "We <b>Need</b> <b>To</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Kevin", Dean escapes Purgatory {{with the}} help of the vampire Benny, but Castiel is not with him. He later tells Sam that things got hairy near the end and that Castiel didn't make it, that he [...] "let go". While Dean doesn't elaborate, he is clearly {{affected}} by this. In a flashback scene, Dean is shown looking for Castiel in Purgatory, interrogating a vampire for his location. As a result, he meets Benny and only agrees to Benny's deal to get out if they find Castiel first and help him escape too. Castiel appears in flashbacks in the following episode, where he reveals that he fled Dean to keep him safe from the Leviathans and other monsters that are angry at Castiel, but Dean refuses to leave Purgatory without Castiel. When talking with another angel at an auction for the second Word of God tablet, Dean again states that Castiel did not make it out of Purgatory. He later escapes with the aid of an army of angels sent to rescue him – having initially remained behind as penance for his actions to stop a duo of Leviathans that were trying to attack Dean and Benny as they left Purgatory – but the other angels not only erase his memory that they were responsible for his escape, but also erase his memory of their subsequent 'check-ins' to discuss the Winchesters' actions, with Castiel forced to tell them about the Winchesters' progress in the search for the tablet. Apparently back to full power, Castiel helps the Winchesters save Kevin from Crowley – who has been abducting future Prophets to try to find another means of reading the Word of God tablet – and destroy the tablet to prevent Crowley using it, retaining half of the tablet while Crowley flees with the other half. Afterwards, in [...] "Hunteri Heroici", Castiel cuts off his ability to listen into the other angels and decides to become a full-time hunter to avoid facing the other angels about what he has done. Castiel proves instrumental in solving the case, using his abilities to enter the mind of a man with reality warping powers, allowing Sam to bring him back to reality with a speech about not running from it. Later, at the request of the man, Fred, Castiel strips him of his powers so he is no longer a danger to anyone though it leaves him mentally damaged. Castiel, having listened to Sam's speech about running from reality as well as Fred, decides to return to Heaven to try to make up for what he did, but is forbidden by Naomi, the angel who ordered his rescue. Instead, Castiel stays to watch out for Fred for a while, but accepts that he can no longer run from what he has done.|$|E

2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C.

[...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. Our crew picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it".
