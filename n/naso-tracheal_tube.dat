40|$|A simple {{manoeuvre}} {{is described}} which may enable one {{to pass a}} proper size <b>naso-tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> from nasopharynx to oropharynx without risk of excessive trauma, in patients widi anatomical deformities of the posterior pharyngeal wall such as to offer difficulties in the usage of an adequately sized nasotracheal tube. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pass a nasotracheal tube through the nasopharynx into the oropharynx {{because of the presence}} of anatomical deformities in die nasopharyneal region. At the level of the palate the nasal part of the pharynx narrows and continues as the oral part. The sphenoid and the base of the occipital bone forming the posterior pharyngeal wall or the first cervical vertebra may have a bony protrusion, ridge or a spur. In addition the posterior pharyngeal wall in this region contains in childre...|$|E
40|$|Management of an {{anticipated}} difficult airway {{relies heavily}} on flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope (FFB) guided awake intubations. In a pediatric patient with difficult airway, doing an awake procedure may be difficult, and hence the child is either deeply sedated or anesthesia is induced before attempting intubation with an appropriate sized FFB. We present the anesthetic management of a 6 -year-old child with a lacerated tongue and fractured mandibular condyle, with subsequent inability to open his mouth, who was posted for urgent exploration and open reduction under anesthesia. Unhindered by a damaged pediatric FFB, we innovated by positioning the tip of an adult FFB just outside the larynx, passing a j-tipped guidewire through the working channel of the FFB, and successfully railroaded a <b>naso-tracheal</b> <b>tube</b> over the guidewire. The surgery, reversal and extubation, and the postoperative period were uneventful...|$|E
40|$|This report updates, expands, {{and replaces}} the {{previously}} published CDC "Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia". The new guidelines {{are designed to}} {{reduce the incidence of}} pneumonia and other severe, acute lower respiratory tract infections in acute-care hospitals and in other health-care settings (e. g., ambulatory and long-term care institutions) and other facilities where health care is provided. Among the changes in the recommendations to prevent bacterial pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia, are the preferential use of oro-tracheal rather than <b>naso-tracheal</b> <b>tubes</b> in patients who receive mechanically assisted ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation to reduce the need for and duration of endotracheal intubation, changing the breathing circuits of ventilators when they malfunction or are visibly contaminated, and (when feasible) the use of an endotracheal tube with a dorsal lumen to allow drainage of respiratory secretions; no recommendations were made about the use of sucralfate, histamine- 2 receptor antagonists, or antacids for stress-bleeding prophylaxis. For prevention of health-care [...] associated Legionnaires disease, the changes include maintaining potable hot water at temperatures not suitable for amplification of Legionella spp., considering routine culturing of water samples from the potable water system of a facility's organ-transplant unit when it is done as part of the facility's comprehensive program to prevent and control health-care-...|$|R

In the section on aspergillosis, the revised recommendations include the use of a room with high-efficiency particulate air filters rather than laminar airflow as the protective environment for allogeneic HSCT recipients and the use of high-efficiency respiratory-protection devices (e. g., N 95 respirators) by severely immunocompromised patients when they leave their rooms when dust-generating activities are ongoing in the facility. In the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) section, the new recommendation is to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to administer monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) to certain infants and children aged < 24 months who were born prematurely and are at high risk for RSV infection. In the section on influenza, the new recommendations include the addition of oseltamivir (to amantadine and rimantadine) for prophylaxis of all patients without influenza illness and oseltamivir and zanamivir (to amantadine and rimantadine) as treatment for patients who are acutely ill with influenza in a unit where an influenza outbreak is recognized. In addition to the revised recommendations, the guideline contains new sections on pertussis and lower respiratory tract infections caused by adenovirus and human parainfluenza viruses and refers readers to the source of updated information about prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
