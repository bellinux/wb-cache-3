Evidence points to pristine <b>norites</b> as substantial contributors to highlands breccias; the bulk major element compositions of breccias average noritic anorthosite, and <b>norites</b> are the second-most abundant of pristine samples. In addition, plots of element abundances in breccias indicate that KREEP in highlands breccias is not of Apollo 14 composition but is higher in Ti and Sc, and probably lower in incompatibles...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{remaining}} uncertainties {{in model}} parameters and assumptions in {{the calculation of}} model ages, {{it is not yet}} possible to resolve the precise dating and duration of lunar crust-mantle differentiation phenomena. <b>Norites</b> 78236 and 73255, 27, 45 were examined utilizing the Sm-Nd radiometric system.

40|$|The Pushtashan suprasubduction zone {{assemblage}} of volcanic rocks, gabbros, <b>norites</b> and peridotites {{occurs in the}} Zagros suture zone, Kurdistan region, northeastern Iraq. Volcanic rocks are dominant in the assemblage and consist mainly of basalt and basaltic andesite flows with interlayered red shale and limestone horizons. Earlier lavas tend to be MORB-like, whereas later lavas display island arc tholeiite to boninitic geochemical characteristics. Tholeiitic gabbros intrude the <b>norites</b> and display fractionation trends typical of crystallisation under low-pressure conditions, whereas the <b>norites</b> display calc-alkaline traits, suggesting their source included mantle metasomatised by fluids released from subducted oceanic crust. Enrichment of Rb, Ba, Sr, Th {{and the presence of}} negative Nb anomalies indicate generation in a suprasubduction zone setting. Trondhjemite and granodiorite intrusions are present in the volcanic rocks, gabbros and <b>norites.</b> SHRIMP U-Pb dating of magmatic zircons from a granodiorite yields a mean 206 Pb/ 238 U age of 96. 0  ±  2. 0  Ma (Cenomanian). The initial ɛHf value for the zircons show a narrow range from + 12. 8 to + 15. 6, with a weighted mean of + 13. 90  ±  0. 96. This initial value is within error of model depleted mantle at 96  Ma or slightly below that, in the field of arc rocks with minimal contamination by older continental crust. The compositional bimodality of the Pushtashan suprasubduction sequence suggests seafloor spreading during the initiation of subduction, with a lava stratigraphy from early-erupted MORB transitioning into calc-alkaline lavas and finally by 96  Ma intrusion of granodioritic and trondhjemitic bodies with juvenile crustal isotopic signatures. The results confirm another Cretaceous arc remnant preserved as an allochthon within the Iraqi segment of the Cenozoic Zagros suture zone. Implications for the closure of Neo-Tethys are discussed...|$|R

The rock samples considered are 14 basaltic rock fragments (Luna 16) and 13 rock {{fragments of the}} ANT suite (Luna 20). On the basis of bulk composition, two types of basaltic rocks have been differentiated and defined in the Luna 16 regolith: mare basalts (fundamental crystalline rocks of Mare Fecunditatis) and high-alumina basalts. The bulk analyses of rock fragments of the ANT suite also enabled distinction of two rock types: anorthositic <b>norites</b> and troctolites and/or spinal-troctolites (the most abundant crystalline rocks of the highland region, the landing site of luna 20), and anorthosites.

This trend in mineral compositions has a steeper slope than the previous Mg-suite field. The parent magmas for these Mg-suite rocks formed by partial melting deep in the lunar mantle.

40|$|Seventeen trace {{elements}} have been determined by {{neutron activation analysis}} in 33 lunar samples from Apollo 14, 5 from Apollo 12, and 2 from Luna 16. Apollo 14 soils and breccias contain at least two, and possibly three, ancient meteoritic components of unusual composition, probably derived from the Imbrian and Serenitatis impacts, and mixed planetesimal debris from the pre-Imbrian regolith. These components have a lower ratio of volatiles to siderophiles than any known class of chondrites.
