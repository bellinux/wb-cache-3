The Darlington riot divided the state politically as Tillman prepared to seek Butler's seat in the Senate, which would be filled by the legislature in December 1894.|$|E
5|$|With {{this growth}} in commerce, Tudor's initial {{monopoly}} on the trade broke down, but he continued to make significant profits from the growing trade.

5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company.

At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 <b>new</b> <b>companies.</b> These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP.
