5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain swill. The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes.</b> In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E

Bonfire refuse can be disposed of quickly into drainage ditches or waterways feeding the ocean or local water supplies.|$|E
25|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act sets certain {{standards}} for building access and other design considerations in all new construction and major renovations in the U.S. An architectural barrier is any feature that makes access {{or use of}} a building difficult, unreasonably dangerous or impossible. This can include aisles that are too narrow for easy access by a wheelchair. Often, {{the only way to}} get from a row of chairs, shelves, workstations, etc., to an exit is by an aisle. Historically, many deaths and serious injuries have occurred due to fire, inhalation of smoke or <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes,</b> etc., because blocked or partially blocked aisles prevented persons from promptly leaving a dangerous area.|$|E
40|$|Acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is {{an important}} and potentially life-threatening complication in humans that arises subsequent {{to a variety of}} primary insults including <b>noxious</b> <b>fume</b> inhalation, infection, and trauma. Here we describe the first two cases of ARDS reported in association with postoperative complications in rhesus macaques. In agreement with the multifactorial nature of the human syndrome, ARDS in one monkey was attributed to sepsis, whereas in the other it was ascribed to neurogenic trauma. Despite the different etiologies, both monkeys demonstrated clinical features of ARDS, including progressive dyspnea and pulmonary edema, and syndrome-defining histopathologic criteria including edema with intraalveolar neutrophils, fibrinohemorrhagic effusions with crescentic membranes, and interstitial vascular degeneration. Recognition and aggressive treatment of ARDS at an early stage may improve survival rates in dyspneic nonhuman primates with underlying extrapulmonary diseases...|$|R

25|$|Fires {{sometimes}} {{occur in}} coal beds underground. When coal beds are exposed, the fire risk is increased. Weathered coal can also increase ground temperatures {{if it is}} left on the surface. Almost all fires in solid coal are ignited by surface fires caused by people or lightning. Spontaneous combustion is caused when coal oxidizes and airflow is insufficient to dissipate heat; this more commonly occurs in stockpiles and waste piles, rarely in bedded coal underground. Where coal fires occur, there is attendant air pollution from emission of smoke and <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes</b> into the atmosphere. Coal seam fires may burn underground for decades, threatening destruction of forests, homes, roadways and other valuable infrastructure. The best-known coal-seam fire may be the one {{which led to the}} permanent evacuation of Centralia, Pennsylvania, United States.|$|E
25|$|The Greenside smelt mill {{was built}} in 182728, down in the Glenridding valley {{at the bottom of}} the Swart Beck, where there was a good water supply and where fuel could be brought up the valley without too much difficulty. Inside the mill there was {{probably}} a furnace to prepare the ore and a single ore hearth. The air blast was produced by bellows powered by a water wheel. Further buildings were erected in the 1830s, to house a slag hearth furnace, and a silver refinery. There was no extended chimney: clouds of toxic lead oxides and acid sulphurous fumes would have made the valley an unhealthy place. The flue {{was built in}} 1841 to a chimney 150m up the hillside; in 1855 it was extended to a chimney on the ridge above. Later, loops were added to increase its length. This long flue not only removed the <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes,</b> it also enabled the lead-rich dust to be recovered and returned to the smelter. The flue was built as a stone-arched cutting, following or cut into the bedrock. This served as a giant prospecting cross-cut and proved there was no extension to the Greenside Vein to the south.|$|E

Gann's book recounts a near-collision with the Taj Mahal after takeoff in a heavily loaded C-87 when full flaps had to be hastily deployed to increase the aircraft's altitude to avoid the edifice. The aircraft's auxiliary long-range fuel tanks were linked by improvised and often leaky fuel lines that crisscrossed the crew compartment, choking flight crews with <b>noxious</b> gasoline <b>fumes</b> and creating an explosion hazard. The C-87 also had a tendency to enter an uncontrollable stall or spin when confronted with even mild icing conditions, a frequent occurrence over the Himalayas.

25|$|Oz is {{completely}} surrounded {{on all four}} sides by a desert which insulates {{the citizens of the}} Land of Oz from discovery and invasion. In the first two books, this is merely a natural desert, with only its extent making it dangerous to the traveler, but in The Road to Oz it is said to turn anyone who touches it to sand. Indeed, in The Marvelous Land of Oz, Mombi tries to escape through it and Glinda chases her over the sands. Still, it is the dividing land between the magic of Oz and the outside world, and the Winged Monkeys can not obey Dorothy's command to carry her home because it would take them outside the lands of Oz. In Ozma of Oz, it has become a magical desert called the Deadly Desert with life-destroying sands and <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes,</b> a feature that remained constant {{through the rest of the}} series, although no actual destruction is depicted in the Oz books, unlike in the film Return to Oz. The desert has nonetheless been breached numerous times, both by children from our world (mostly harmless), by the Wizard of Oz himself, and by more sinister characters, such as the Nome King, who attempted to conquer Oz. After such an attempt in The Emerald City of Oz, the book ends with Glinda creating a barrier of invisibility around the Land of Oz, for further protection. This was, indeed, an earnest effort on Baum's part to end the series, but the insistence of readers meant the continuation of the series, and therefore the discovery of many ways for people to pass through this barrier as well as over the sands. Despite this continual evasion, the barrier itself remained; nowhere in any Oz book did Baum hint that the inhabitants were even considering removing the magical barrier.|$|E

Constant work with damp ore might have led to rheumatic problems. The extraction of arsenic from the tin and copper ores sometimes led to exposure to arsenic fumes. Constant bending, lifting, and carrying often led to muscular strains. The need to hold chunks of ore with one hand while hammering them with the other led to some bal maidens suffering permanent damage to their left hands. The noise generated by industrial machinery, particularly after the introduction of the steam engine, could cause hearing difficulties, with some groups of bal maidens developing private sign languages. <b>Noxious</b> <b>fumes,</b> notably arsenic, lead and antimony could cause [...] digestive problems, bowel disorders and amenorrhoea and other disruptions of the reproductive system.

50|$|The sugar {{industry}} and the township of Bundaberg increased in both demographic size and political influence during the late nineteenth century, stimulating the demand for municipal landscaping that reflected this affluence. Municipal landscaping enhanced the streetscapes by adding character and dignity, also providing essential shade in the main business precinct of a city. Trees were also incorporated for the benefits {{to the health of}} the city, thought to assist in clearing of <b>noxious</b> smoke and <b>fumes.</b> The Ficus family were a popular choice for such plantings due to the dense foliage and broad spread of the canopy, which when planted in close proximity provided a continuous avenue of shade. The use of planting in the centre of the street, resolved the concern over the root system interfering with building foundations. Bourbong Street was gazetted two chains wide allowing ample room for two way traffic and centre plantings on the road reserve.|$|R

[...] Before any reply could be received, Peale objected on December 24, complaining that the relief of the head of Liberty was so high that pieces struck using the Philadelphia Mint's steam-powered machinery could not fully bring out the design—the coin sent to Meredith had been coined on a medal press, by hand. In addition, Peale alleged that the head was in such high relief that the coins would not stack. Patterson sent Peale's letter to Meredith on December 25, noting that this meant there would be a lengthy delay.|$|E
500|$|... 1988 {{was a big}} {{year for}} {{wildfires}} in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major. Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, over 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes</b> from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|E
500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes</b> and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} {{supported}} by the French Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development was to evaluate the technical advantages or drawbacks procured by introducing a flame retardant in a polymer. The incorporation of flame retardants (FRs) presents the advantage of reducing the fire hazard due to flame spread, but might increase the toxicity of fire emissions. In fact, the efficiency of flame retardants is real when the benefits from improvement of the fire resistance properties overbalances the undesired formation of <b>noxious</b> / toxic <b>fumes.</b> The originality {{of the study is}} to analyse the presence of toxic fumes as resulting from thermal degradation/combustion reactions of FR polymer systems. In this paper, we propose to describe preliminary results on the smoke toxicity from binary association of one polymer (polyvinyl chloride) and one typical flame retardant (antimony oxide or aluminum oxide) during combustion. In particular, we report on the interactions between gases (synergistic, additive or antagonist effects), because smoke is confirmed to be the major threat in accidental fires. The paper is finally a contribution to the analysis of cost/benefit issues of adding FRs in polymer systems considering potential role of related toxic products versus gain in terms of overall fire behaviour...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the many}} {{similarities}} between the T-54/T-55 and T-62 tanks is their ability to create a smokescreen by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust system. Like the T-54 and T-55, the T-62 has an unditching beam mounted {{at the rear of}} the hull. The tank can be fitted with a thin snorkel for operational usage and a large diameter snorkel for training. The thin snorkel can be disassembled and carried in the back of the turret when not used. The commander's cupola is located on the left of the top of the turret. The loader has a single piece hatch located on the right side of the turret and further back than the commander's cupola. The loader's hatch has a periscope vision block that can be used to view the areas in front of and behind the vehicle. The commander's cupola has four periscopes, two are located in the hatch cover while the other two are located in the forward part of the cupola. The driver has a single piece hatch located on the left front of the vehicle, directly in front of the left side of the turret. The tank uses the same sights and vision devices as the T-55 except for the gunner, who received a new TSh-2B-41 sight which has x4 or x7 magnification. It is mounted coaxially with an optic rangefinder. The gunner has two periscope vision blocks, one of which is used in conjunction with the main searchlight mounted coaxially on the right side of the main armament. There are two other smaller searchlights. One of these is used by the commander and is mounted on his cupola. The tank has two headlights on the right front of the vehicle, one of which is infrared while the other one is white. Curved hand rails around the turret allow easier entry for the commander, the gunner, and the loader. They also help the infantry to mount and dismount the tank while performing a tank desant. The tank has a box-shaped radiation detector/actuator mounted on the right hand side of the turret, behind the compressed air tanks. While the T-62 did not feature an automatic loader (as would become characteristic of later Russian tanks), it had a unique [...] "ejection port" [...] built into the back of the turret, which would open as the main gun recoiled, ejecting spent shell casings outside. This was considered advantageous since the spent casings would otherwise clutter the floor of the tank and fill the interior with <b>noxious</b> burnt-propellant <b>fumes.</b> There is a blower mounted in the rear of the turret, to the left of the spent cartridge ejection port.|$|R
500|$|An {{earthquake}} {{on the sea}} bed—a [...] "seaquake"—could {{have caused}} sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of Mary Celestes cargo, thus releasing <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes.</b> Rising fears of an imminent explosion could plausibly have led Briggs to order the ship's abandonment; the displaced hatches suggest that an inspection, or an attempted airing, had taken place. The New York World of January 24, 1886, drew attention to a case where a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded. The same journal's issue of February 9, 1913, cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels {{as the source of}} gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in Mary Celestes hold. Briggs's cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory as providing a sufficiently alarming scenario—rumblings from the hold, the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion—for Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship. In his haste to leave the ship before it exploded, Briggs may have failed to properly secure the yawl to the tow line. A sudden breeze could have blown the ship away from the occupants of the yawl, leaving them to succumb to the elements. The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case. In 2006 an experiment was carried out for Channel Five television by Andrea Sella of University College, London, the results of which helped to revive the [...] "explosion" [...] theory. Sella built a model of the hold, with paper cartons representing the barrels. Using butane gas, he created an explosion that caused a considerable blast and ball of flame—but contrary to expectation, no fire damage within the replica hold. [...] "What we created was a pressure-wave type of explosion. There was a spectacular wave of flame but, behind it, was relatively cool air. No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{complaints}} in 1925 regarding crop and forest destruction {{as a result}} of smoke from the smelter, COMINCO accepted responsibility and offered to compensate the farmers who were affected. COMINCO also proposed installing fume-controlling technologies to limit future damage and reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide. [...] The company had initially raised smoke stacks to four hundred feet in an effort to increase the dispersion of pollutants; however, this had resulted in prevailing winds moving the <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes</b> downwind to the inhabitants of the Columbia River Valley, thereby making the situation worse. The company also tried to offer payments to the affected residents or even offered to purchase the land outright, which some would have accepted. [...] However, the company was denied this method of compensation because of Washington State's prohibition of property ownership by foreigners. This led to the official petition by the farmers and landowners of Washington in 1927 for state and federal support against the smelter, claiming the smoke was damaging United States lands. In 1931, the IJC awarded the farmers $350,000 in damages, but did not set guidelines for sulphur dioxide emission reduction. The compensation was far less than the plaintiffs had expected and the IJC settlement was eventually rejected under the pressure of Washington's State Congressional Delegation. [...] The unsatisfactory result of the IJC decision led to the establishment of a three-person Arbitral Tribunal to resolve the dispute in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|The star fort, {{also known}} as the bastion fort, trace italienne, or renaissance fortress, was a style of {{fortification}} that became popular in Europe during the 16th century. As a response to gunpowder artillery, European fortifications began displaying architectural principles such as lower and thicker walls in the mid-1400s. Cannon towers were built with artillery rooms where cannons could discharge fire from slits in the walls. However this proved problematic as the slow rate of fire, reverberating concussions, and <b>noxious</b> <b>fumes</b> produced greatly hindered defenders. Gun towers also limited the size and number of cannon placements because the rooms could only be built so big. Notable surviving artillery towers include a seven layer defensive structure built in 1480 at Fougères in Brittany, and a four layer tower built in 1479 at Querfurth in Saxony. Eventually defensive artillery towers gave way to the star fort's angle bastions. The bastion and star fort was developed in Italy, where the Florentine engineer Giuliano da Sangallo (1445-1516) compiled a comprehensive defensive plan using the geometric bastion and full trace italienne that became widespread in Europe. The main distinguishing features of the star fort were its angle bastions, each placed to support their neighbor with lethal crossfire, covering all angles, making them extremely difficult to engage with and attack. Angle bastions consisted of two faces and two flanks. Artillery positions positioned at the flanks could fire parallel into the opposite bastion's line of fire, thus providing two lines of cover fire against an armed assault on the wall, and preventing mining parties from finding refuge. Meanwhile, artillery positioned on the bastion platform could fire frontally from the two faces, also providing overlapping fire with the opposite bastion. Overlapping mutually supporting defensive fire was the greatest advantage enjoyed by the star fort. As a result, sieges lasted longer and became more difficult affairs. By the 1530s the bastion fort had become the dominant defensive structure in Italy. Outside Europe, the star fort became an [...] "engine of European expansion," [...] and acted as a force multiplier so that small European garrisons could hold out against numerically superior forces. Wherever star forts were erected the natives experienced great, but not insurmountable difficulty, in uprooting European invaders.|$|E
