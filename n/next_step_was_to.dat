5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> take an oral {{examination}} and to diagnose a patient. After {{less than two}} weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, {{at the age of}} 28. During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other's work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete.|$|E
5|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> broach {{the matter}} with the Canadians. The Lord President, Sir John Anderson, as the {{minister}} responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British High Commissioner to Canada, Malcolm MacDonald, who {{had been involved in}} Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding Eldorado's uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with C. J. Mackenzie, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see C. D. Howe, the Minister of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the war in August 1945, the Manhattan Project's {{priority}} {{shifted from}} speed to economy and efficiency. By early 1946, with K-27 in operation, the K-25 plant was producing 3.6kg per day, enriched to 30 percent. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> increase the enrichment further to 60 percent. This was achieved on 20 July 1946. This presented a problem, because Y-12 was not equipped to handle feed that was so highly enriched, but the Los Alamos Laboratory required 95 percent. For a time, product was mixed with feed to reduce the enrichment to 30 percent. Taking the concentration up to 95 percent raised a number of safety concerns, as there was the risk of a criticality accident.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} clear to Tiberius that support for Sejanus was not as strong as the emperor had feared, his <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> choose Naevius Sutorius Macro, {{previously}} prefect of the vigiles (Roman police and fire department), to replace Sejanus and effect his downfall. On October 18, AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a Senate meeting by a letter from Tiberius, ostensibly to bestow the tribunician powers upon him. At dawn, he entered the Senate; but while the letter was being read, Macro assumed control of the Praetorian Guard and members of the vigiles led by Graecinius Laco surrounded the building. The senators at first congratulated Sejanus but when the letter, which first digressed into completely unrelated matters, suddenly denounced him and ordered his arrest, he was immediately surrounded and escorted to prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more restrictive ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and teetotaler, called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties were dry. In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically restrictive local option, {{and the number of}} dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
25|$|Daimler's and Maybach's <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{install the}} engine {{in a test}} bed to prove the {{viability}} of their engine in a vehicle. Their goal was to learn what the engine could do, and not to create a motorcycle; {{it was just that}} the engine prototype was not yet powerful enough for a full size carriage.|$|E

25|$|With the {{technical}} institutions {{of government in}} place, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> extend {{the control of the}} Kingdom of Ireland over all of its claimed territory. This took nearly a century, with various English administrations in the process either negotiating or fighting with the independent Irish and Old English lords. The conquest was completed during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I, after several bloody conflicts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{secure the}} cura of a medicus. If {{the patient was}} too sick to move one sent for a clinicus, {{who went to the}} clinum or couch of the patient. Of higher status were the chirurgii (which became the English word surgeon), from Greek cheir (hand) and ourgon (work). In {{addition}} were the eye doctor, ocularius, the ear doctor, auricularius, and the doctor of snakebites, the marsus.|$|E
25|$|Boeing Phantom Works {{developed}} the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft concept {{in cooperation with}} the NASA Langley Research Center. In an initial effort to study the flight characteristics of the BWB design, a remote-controlled propeller-driven blended wing body model with a 17ft (5.2 m) wingspan was flown in 1997. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> fly the 35ft (10.7 m) wide X-48A in 2004, but the program was canceled before manufacturing.|$|E

25|$|The Human Genome Project {{was started}} in 1990 {{with the goal of}} {{sequencing}} and identifying all three billion chemical units in the human genetic instruction set, finding the genetic roots of disease and then developing treatments. It is considered a Mega Project because the human genome has approximately 3.3 billion base-pairs. With the sequence in hand, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify the genetic variants that increase the risk for common diseases like cancer and diabetes.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{figured that}} the best way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the first}} two decades of the Fringe, each {{performing}} group used its own performing space, or venue. However, by the late 1960s, the concept of sharing a venue became popular, principally {{as a means of}} cutting costs. It soon became common for halls to host up to six or seven different shows per day. The obvious <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> partition a venue into two or more performing spaces; the majority of today's major venues fit into this category.|$|E

25|$|Once this {{agreement}} was settled upon, the <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> choose a subject, something which took some time. Several subjects came to Verdi's attention: for example, Byron's The Corsair was considered, {{but the right}} baritone was not available. In thinking about an opera about the Venetian Foscari family, he {{found that it was}} forbidden by the censor in order avoid upsetting any of the descendants of that family who were then living in Venice. However, both of these subjects were to become later Verdi operas, Il corsaro and I due Foscari.|$|E
25|$|Once all 88 (later {{increased}} to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members {{to serve on}} one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop {{electric}} sound technology. The first electric {{musical instrument}} was the Denis d'or, {{which was built}} by Vaclav Prokop Dovis in 1753. It was incorporated with 700 strings temporarily electrified to enhance their sonic qualities. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde developed the clavecin Ã©lectrique. This was a keyboard instrument incorporated with plectra and activated by electricity. But both instruments were not using electricity to produce sound. Elisha Gray invented an electric musical instrument called the musical telegraph. It made sound from an electromagnetic circuit's vibration. He incorporated a basic single note oscillator. Next he added a loudspeaker consisting of diaphragm to make data audible.|$|E

25|$|By September 1, 2005, {{the mouth}} of the 17th Street Canal had been sealed with the sheet piling {{preventing}} lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal was drained so that permanent repairs could be made to the levee. To allow drainage, backhoes mounted on marsh buggies and draglines mounted on barges cut breaches in some other levees. Marsh buggies are tracked vehicles whose wide tracks enable them to operate in soft, marshy terrain.|$|E
25|$|The <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{present the}} revised {{plan to the}} Board of Supervisors by February 2009 in order to decide if the 11-member board would {{recommend}} {{to continue with the}} congestion pricing plan. The plan will need approval at the local and state legislative levels, and possibly some non-objection at the federal level. It has not been decided if San Francisco residents will vote to approve the plan's implementation. Final study results were expected by late 2009, and SFCTA staff estimates that if the proposal moves forward in 2009, implementation will still take several years, as at least two to three years would be spent doing the environmental studies required by law.|$|E
25|$|Barkas's <b>next</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> run popular {{demonstrations of}} camouflage. He would {{assemble}} about 60 trucks, coaches and smaller vehicles and discuss with the non-commissioned officers how to hide these from the air. They {{would agree that}} a line of trucks could be parked by a hedge and all together draped with nets to appear as a thick belt of vegetation, or arrange a vehicle as a pitched-roof outhouse to a building. Then the commanders would arrive, and Barkas would give a speech about camouflage methods to defeat aerial reconnaissance. He would then signal the start, the unit would hide all its vehicles, and a moment later, using his film-making skill with timing, an aircraft would arrive and start observing. It rarely found {{more than a few}} of the vehicles.|$|E
