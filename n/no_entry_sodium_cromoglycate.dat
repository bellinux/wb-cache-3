40|$|The {{effects of}} 2, 10, and 20 mg of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> {{delivered}} by aerosol {{were compared with}} those of placebo in a double blind study in 11 patients with extrinsic and exercise induced asthma. The effect of nebulised <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> delivered through a Wright nebuliser (estimated dose 12 mg) was also studied. Patients exercised on a treadmill for six to eight minutes at submaximal work loads on five days, 30 minutes after inhaling placebo or <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> The FEV 1 was recorded before treatment, before exercise, and up to 30 minutes after exercise.

40|$|Background <b>Sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> {{has been}} {{recommended}} as maintenance treatment for childhood asthma for many years. Its use has decreased since 1990, when inhaled corticosteroids became popular, {{but it is}} still used in many countries. Objectives To determine the efficacy of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> compared to placebo in the prophylactic treatment of children with asthma. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register (October 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (January 1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (January 1985 to November 2007) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> In 2007 we updated the review. Selection criteria All double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trials, which addressed the effectiveness of inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> as maintenance therapy, studying children aged 0 up to 18 years with asthma. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We pooled study results. Main results Of 3500 titles retrieved from the literature, 24 papers reporting on 23 studies could be included in the review. The studies were published between 1970 and 1997 and together included 1026 participants. Most were cross-over studies. Few studies provided sufficient information to judge the concealment of allocation. Four studies provided results for the percentage of symptom-free days. Pooling the results did not reveal a statistically significant difference between <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> and placebo. For the other pooled outcomes, most of the symptom-related outcomes and bronchodilator use showed statistically significant results, but treatment effects were small. Considering the confidence intervals of the outcome measures, a clinically relevant effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> cannot be excluded. The funnel plot showed an under-representation of small studies with negative results, suggesting publication bias. Authors' conclusions There is insufficient evidence to be sure about the efficacy of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> over placebo. Publication bias is likely to have overestimated the beneficial effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> as maintenance therapy in childhood asthma...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Aerosols {{generated}} from metered dose inhalers may be highly charged. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether lining the walls of a polycarbonate spacer device with an antistatic agent would result in an increase in drug output. The effects of multiple actuations of drug into the spacer device and increasing residence time of drug within the spacer were also determined. METHODS [...] The amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> contained in particles of various size available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) from a 750 ml polycarbonate spacer was determined by impinger measurement and spectrophotometric assay. RESULTS [...] Lining the spacer with an antistatic agent increased the mean (SD) amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> in particles < 5 microns available for inhalation (per 5 mg actuation) by 244 % from (0. 59 (0. 03) to 1. 44 (0. 2) mg). When there was a 20 second interval between actuation into the spacer device and inhalation, <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in particles < 5 micrograms decreased by 67 % (from 0. 59 (0. 03) mg to 0. 2 (0. 01) mg). Use of the spacer device increased <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in respirable particles (< 5 microns) by 18 % compared with direct delivery by metered dose inhaler. Multiple actuations into the spacer decreased the amount of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> available for inhalation in particles < 5 microns by 31 % after two actuations and 56 % after three acutations. CONCLUSIONS [...] Multiple actuations of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> into a spacer device before inhalation should be avoided, and inhalation from spacer devices should take place immediately after actuation to ensure maximum dose. Lining of a standard spacer device with an antistatic agent significantly increased output of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> This may have implications for improved therapeutic response and drug cost...|$|R

Thirteen subjects showed better morning and evening flow meter readings while taking <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> than while taking placebo and eight better readings with placebo than with <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> (p less than 0. 05). Improvement in lung function did not correlate with baseline lung function or baseline PC 20 H, or with features of atopy. These results suggest that long term <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> treatment does not alter non-specific bronchial responsiveness in adult asthmatic subjects...|$|R
40|$|In {{thirteen}} {{patients with}} extrinsic asthma {{the effects of}} placebo, <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate,</b> ipratropium bromide, and ipratropium bromide plus <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> were studied in a random double-blind fashion to assess their inhibitory action in exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Exercise testing consisted of steady state running on an inclined treadmill for up to eight minutes. In eight of the 13 patients studied the baseline ratio of expiratory flow at 50 % vital capacity (VC) breathing helium-oxygen (V 50 He) to V 50 air was over 1. 20 and they were called responders; the remaining five patients were called non-responders. There was a significantly lower baseline maximum mid-expiratory flow rate (MMEF) in non-responders (P less than 0. 02) as compared to responders but no difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). <b>Sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> (P less than 0. 02), ipratropium bromide (P less than 0. 01), and ipratropium bromide plus spdium cromoglycate (P less than 0. 01) all significantly inhibited the percentage fall in FEV 1 after exercise in the responders. Ipratropium bromide had no preventive action on non-responders, unlike <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> (P less than 0. 05) and ipratropium bromide plus <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> (P less than 0. 02). It is postulated that mediator release {{is an important factor}} in development of EIA in most extrinsic asthmatics, whereas cholinergic mechanisms are relevant only in those patients in whom the main site of airflow obstruction is in the large central airways...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen {{asthmatic}} {{children aged}} 9 - 14 years {{participated in a}} double blind randomised trial to compare the effectiveness and duration of action of 2 formulations of sodium cromoglycate; one a 20 mg capsule of powdered <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> delivered by turbo inhaler (spinhaler), and the other 1 mg of aerosolised <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> delivered by pressurised cannister inhaler (aerosol). The children performed exercise tests on each of 3 days in a 10 day period [...] 15 minutes, 2 hours, and 6 hours after inhalation of powder, aerosol, or a placebo. Two patients were not protected from exercise induced asthma by either formulation of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> Among the remaining patients both formulations gave good protection from exercise induced asthma 15 minutes after inhalation, {{and the effect of}} both wore off steadily over the next 6 hours. The spinhaler gave appreciably better protection than the aerosol at 15 minutes after inhalation, and was the only formulation to provide good protection at 2 hours and 6 hours. The more limited effectiveness of the aerosol may be explained by the lower dose of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> and the more complicated inhalation technique required...|$|R
40|$|Since {{many factors}} may alter lung {{epithelial}} permeability (LEP) to water soluble molecules, {{the effect of}} histamine on the absorption and clearance of inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> was examined in seven mildly asthmatic patients with hyperresponsive airways and eight normal subjects. The subjects underwent histamine challenge to determine the provocative concentration of histamine required to reduce the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) by 20 % (PC 20) from baseline. On two further visits they inhaled either saline placebo or histamine and 5 min later inhaled an aerosol containing <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> Measurements of FEV 1 were made and blood samples taken for analysis of plasma <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> concentration at intervals for 3 h. In the asthmatic group histamine inhalation led to a 24 +/- 4 % reduction in FEV 1 but {{had no effect on}} the normal subjects. When compared with inhaled saline, histamine increased the initial pulmonary absorption of SCG without influencing the total amount of drug absorbed in both asthmatics and normals. These observations suggest that the pharmacokinetics of inhaled <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> may be altered significantly by inflammatory mediators present at the site of drug absorption from the airways...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{output of}} the drug and the {{particle}} size produced by various nebulisers were assessed, and sensible nebulisation times for <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> calculated. Three of the four nebuliser systems tested produced over 80 % of total drug output within the first five minutes of nebulisation. We suggest that five minutes is an optimum nebulisation time for <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate</b> using these nebuliser combinations. Nebulisation treatment can upset both child and parent, especially when it is prolonged. Parents frequently report spending up to 20 minutes nebulis-ing a 2 ml charge of <b>sodium</b> <b>cromoglycate.</b> As evaporation {{makes it impossible to}} determine out-put of the drug directly from weight loss of the nebuliser chamber, we have used a multistage liquid impinger to determine {{output of the}} drug and aerosol particle size. This has enabled us to suggest an optimum nebulisation time for sodium cromo...|$|R
