500|$|The episode {{aired on}} Thanksgiving Day 1983, {{a year after}} Lee's final {{appearance}} as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. [...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, [...] "There was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> take. [...] It was perfect". [...] Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there was <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

Lisa Randall refers to the film as [...] "the bane of scientists". Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that water molecules can be influenced by thought (as popularized by Masaru Emoto), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates, and that quantum physics implies that [...] "consciousness is the ground of all being." [...] The film was also discussed in a letter published in Physics Today that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to [...] "expose the mysteries physics has encountered [...] reveal the limits of our understanding". In the letter, the authors write: [...] "the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense." [...] It {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided," [...] and that [...] "a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics," [...] a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which [...] "we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered".|$|E
