5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E

According to the species authors, L.decorosa would fit best in the Biannularieae tribe of the Tricholomataceae as described by Rolf Singer in his comprehensive monograph on the Agaricales.
