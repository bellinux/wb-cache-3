5|$|The German {{occupation}} of Luxembourg in World War I {{was the first}} of two military occupations of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by Germany in the twentieth century. From August 1914 until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, Luxembourg was under full occupation by the German Empire. The German government justified the occupation by citing the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> their armies in neighbouring France, although many Luxembourgers, contemporary and present, have interpreted German actions otherwise.|$|E
5|$|At the 2010 Asian Para Games in Guangzhou, China, Jacobs won {{a bronze}} medal. Before the {{competition}} {{he had only}} a month to train. He competed in several international tournaments, winning a gold in Thailand, silver in Beijing, bronze in the Czech Republic, silver in the United Kingdom, and gold in Taiwan. At the 2011 ASEAN ParaGames in Surakarta, Jacobs won seven gold medals: men's singles (open), men's doubles (open), mixed doubles (open), men's doubles, mixed doubles, team, and single. In January of the following year Jacobs took on Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in a three-game series. Although the president won one game with a score of 13–11, Jacobs took the series, winning two games with the scores 11–7 and 11–9. After the competition, Yudhoyono gave a speech of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Indonesia's disabled athletes.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E

5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E
5|$|On 16 December, Minnesota steamed out of Hampton Roads {{with the}} Great White Fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise was {{intended}} as a show of force to Japan, the United States' rival in the Pacific, to assert the United States' status as a global naval power, and to convince Congress of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> increased naval expenditures. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather than being a symbol of a weak man’s <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E

25|$|Because tank {{locomotives}} {{are capable}} of running equally fast in both directions (see below) they usually have symmetrical wheel arrangements to ensure the same ride and stability characteristics regardless of the direction travelled, producing arrangements with only driving wheels (0-4-0T and 0-6-0T) or equal numbers of leading and trailing wheels (2-4-2T, 4-6-4T etc.). However other requirements, such as the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> a large bunker, would require a non-symmetrical layout such as 2-6-4T.|$|E

25|$|The {{growth in}} the local economy and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the growing {{population}} meant that the keep tower was demolished in 1844, and the following year the Afonsino tower, were partially destroyed to build other structures. Between 1845 and 1846, the wall's gates began to slowly be destroyed. With this slow deterioration, the castle slowly lost its importance, resulting in the 1875 authorization to demolish the fortress. The earliest attempt to recover importance of the castle began in 1905, with work done to repair wall cracks.|$|E
25|$|The first {{graphical}} character-based interactive {{environment is}} Club Caribe. First released as Habitat in 1988, Club Caribe {{was introduced by}} LucasArts for Q-Link customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could interact with one another, chat and exchange items. Although the game's open world was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established off-line by Ultima and other games) and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> modem data transfer rates as low as 300 bits per second. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, {{eliminating the need for}} network transfer.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a period of advance in the {{technical}} standards of ballet and the period when ballet became a serious dramatic art form on par with the opera. Central to this advance was the seminal work of Jean-Georges Noverre, Lettres sur la danse et les ballets (1760), which focused on developing the ballet d'action, in which the movements of the dancers are designed to express character and assist in the narrative. Noverre believed that: ballet should be technical but also move the audience emotionally, plots need to be unified, the scenery and music <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the plot and be unified within the story, and that pantomime needs to be simple and understandable.|$|E

25|$|In 1912 Barnes's family, facing {{financial}} ruin, split up. Elizabeth {{moved to}} New York City with Barnes {{and three of}} her brothers, then filed for divorce, freeing Wald to marry Fanny Clark. The move gave Barnes an opportunity to study art formally for the first time; she attended the Pratt Institute for about six months, but the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> herself and her family—a burden that fell largely on her—soon drove her to leave school and take {{a job as a}} reporter at the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Upon arriving at the Daily Eagle, Barnes declared, “I can draw and write, and you’d be a fool not to hire me”, words that were inscribed inside the Brooklyn Museum.|$|E
25|$|The space-based portion {{will not}} <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> itself against gravity (other than {{relatively}} weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but {{will have to}} cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (PV) and solar dynamic (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. Wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.|$|E
25|$|This Oamaru Hotel {{is one of}} Lawson's {{more adventurous}} forays into {{classical}} architecture. Forsaking Palladian-influenced temple-like columns and porticos, he initially took as his inspiration the mannerist palazzi, which were {{a reaction to the}} more ornate high renaissance style of architecture popular in early 16th century Italy. There are even some minor similarities between this building and the Palazzo del Te. Just as at street level the palazzi often have a ground floor of rusticated stone, so did this hotel. Massive blocks of ashlar were used to create an impression of strength, supporting the more delicately designed floor above; this feeling of strength was further enhanced by double pilasters serving merely to imply a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the great weight above.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, King Constantine I (who {{ascended to}} the throne in 1913) keeps Greece in a policy of {{neutrality}} towards German Empire and the other powers of the Triple Alliance. Brother-in-law of Emperor William II, the Greek sovereign was accused by the Allies of being pro-German because he spent part of his military training in Prussia. This situation leads to the rupture between the sovereign and his Prime Minister, Eleftherios Venizelos, who was convinced of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> {{the countries of the}} Triple Entente to link the Greek minorities of the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans to the Hellenic Kingdom. At the end, Constantin I was deposed in 1917 and replaced by his youngest son Prince Alexander, considered more malleable than his elder brother Diadochos George by the Triple Entente.|$|E
25|$|A linear Fresnel {{reflector}} {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers and dishes with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs and dishes). The mirrors also do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.|$|E
25|$|Therapsids {{and earlier}} mammaliaforms had their jaw joints very {{far back in}} the skull, partly because the ear was at the rear end of the jaw but also had {{to be close to}} the brain. This {{arrangement}} limited the size of the braincase, because it forced the jaw muscles to run round and over it. Hadrocodium's braincase and jaws were no longer bound to each other by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the ear, and its jaw joint was further forward. In its descendants or those of animals with a similar arrangement, the brain case was free to expand without being constrained by the jaw and the jaw was free to change without being constrained by the need to keep the ear near the brain — in other words it now became possible for mammaliaforms both to develop large brains and to adapt their jaws and teeth in ways that were purely specialized for eating.|$|E
