5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of political control whereby one <b>nation</b> <b>or</b> group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another <b>nation</b> <b>or</b> group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E

5|$|A {{party can}} expand into an alliance, {{with up to}} three parties combined, {{with a total of}} 18 players. Alliances are {{necessary}} to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, <b>nation</b> <b>or</b> territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).|$|E

5|$|And others again, whom God {{had formed}} with mild and gentle dispositions, think it {{necessary}} to put a force upon their own tempers, by acting a noisy, violent, malicious part, {{as a means to}} be distinguished.

5|$|In The Ethnostate, Robertson {{declares}} polyethnicity as {{an ideal}} that only lessens each culture. He believes that, within a polyethnic culture, the <b>nation</b> <b>or</b> region {{as a whole is}} less capable of cultural culmination than each of the individual ethnicities that make it up. Essentially, polyethnicity promotes the dilution of ethnicity and thus hinders each ethnicity in all aspects of culture.|$|E

No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.|$|E

5|$|The {{sole right}} to issue trading {{privileges}} anywhere in Albany County rested {{with the mayor}} and Common Council. Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time, {{as well as the}} state of Vermont. All residents of New York, except those of Albany, were specifically banned from trading with any Iroquois <b>nation,</b> <b>or</b> with any other native tribe to the west, east, or north of the city of Albany, or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County.|$|E
5|$|The storyline is {{primarily}} followed with missions through the governing nations {{that exist in}} the base game as well as each expansion that the player is affiliated with. <b>Nation</b> <b>or</b> governing body affiliation is relatively simple, sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story. Some missions are even required to be completed to further progress into the start of the additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1166 Maimonides went to Egypt {{and settled}} in Fustat, where he gained much renown as a physician, practising in the family of Saladin and in that of his vizier Ḳaḍi al-Faḍil al-Baisami, and Saladin's successors. The title Ra'is al-Umma or al-Millah (Head of the <b>Nation</b> <b>or</b> of the Faith), was {{bestowed}} upon him. In Fustat, he wrote his Mishneh Torah (1180) and The Guide for the Perplexed. Some of his writings were later discovered among the manuscript fragments in the geniza (storeroom) of the Ben Ezra Synagogue, located in Fustat.|$|E

5|$|In some European Celtic or Germanic {{countries}} {{prior to}} the adoption of Christianity, the ruler upon his election was raised on a shield and, while standing upon it, was borne on the shoulders of several chief men of the <b>nation</b> (<b>or</b> tribe) in a procession around his assembled subjects. This was usually performed three times. Following this, the king was given a spear, and a diadem wrought of silk or linen (not to be confused with a crown) was bound around his forehead as a token of regal authority.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{inability}} {{to secure a}} more stable financial footing during this era can largely {{be attributed to the}} existence of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard. Given the choice between funding technological research at the oldest university in the <b>nation,</b> <b>or</b> at an independent and adolescent institution, potential benefactors were indifferent or even hostile to funding MIT's competing mission. Earlier overtures from Harvard President Charles William Eliot towards consolidation of the two schools were rejected or disrupted by Rogers in 1870 and 1878. Despite his tenure at the analogous Sheffield School of Yale University, Walker remained committed to MIT's independence from a larger institution. Walker also repeatedly received overtures from Leland Stanford to become the first president of his new university in Palo Alto, California, but Walker remained committed to MIT owing to his Boston upbringing.|$|E
5|$|On the Silk Road caravans with Chinese silk; pepper, ginger, cinnamon, {{and nutmeg}} {{came to the}} West from the Spice Islands via the transcontinental trade routes. Eastern diets were {{introduced}} to Europeans as well. Indian muslins, cottons, pearls, and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods from Iran. Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the near and far East. Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the GDP of each <b>nation</b> <b>or</b> society that {{was involved in the}} trade system. Μany of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size.|$|E
