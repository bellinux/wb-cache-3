He held this position until May, 1951, when he was named president, succeeding Francis J. Gavin who had been in office since 1939.

50|$|The 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement, or UK-US Mutual Defence Agreement, is a {{bilateral}} treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on nuclear weapons}} cooperation.

5000|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Northern</b> European <b>cooperation</b> on {{e-commerce}} and e-procurement, {{representatives from}} Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, UK and Iceland set up a working group for developing a Northern European subset of UBL 2.0 documents. The main focus of NES is to define the semantic use of UBL 2.0 as applied to specific business processes. To achieve this the UBL 2.0 standard is restricted on additional levels by using [...] "profiles" [...] that apply to defined business situations. The use of individual elements is specifically described to avoid conflicting interpretation. Additionally each country has developed guidelines that describe {{the application of the}} NESUBL subset to domestic business practices. The goal is to enable companies and institutions to implement e-commerce by agreeing to a specific profile and thus eliminate the need for bilateral implementation. Additional countries have shown interest in joining the work. The NESUBL subset was published in March 2007.|$|R
2500|$|The 1958 US–UK Mutual Defense Agreement, or UK–US Mutual Defence Agreement, is a {{bilateral}} treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on nuclear weapons}} cooperation. The treaty's full name is Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and <b>Northern</b> Ireland for <b>Cooperation</b> on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries, including France and some NATO countries, this agreement {{is by far the}} most comprehensive. Harold Macmillan called it [...] "the Great Prize".|$|R
3000|$|Another current {{project of}} the FDZ focuses on data on {{transnational}} commuting in the German–Danish border region. The IAB [...] Regional Office <b>Northern</b> Germany in <b>cooperation</b> with the Department of Border Region Studies of the University of Southern Denmark is building up a dataset which enables {{for the first time}} the analysis of transnational commuting between Germany and Denmark in both directions. By using the method of record-linkage, transnational commuters are identified both in the German and Danish data (see Buch et al. 2009). Together with the FDZ the project partners work on a dataset containing individual employment biographies, which will be accessible via the FDZ. Beside nationality and gender, the data will also contain information on payment, industry codes and firm size therefore allowing structural analyses of transnational mobility.|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} is {{the first}} joint venture of the Joint Equality and Human Rights Forum. The Forum brings together the human rights and equality bodies in Britain, Ireland and <b>Northern</b> Ireland. The <b>cooperation</b> being developed within the Forum seeks to support new thinking on equality issues and to advance the establishment of increasingly effective equality strategies. The exploration of identity and how people hold multiple identities has been a key dimension to this cooperation since the Forum began its work. The purpose of this joint research project is threefold: • To accord a visibility to groups of people whose identity, situation and experience has yet to achieve an adequate focus in equality strategies. • To contribute to new thinking about and understandings of equality {{on the basis of}} an exploration of the multiple identities that people hold. • To open a debate on the practical implications for effective equality strategies that flow from the specific experience, situation and identity of particular groups of people holding multiple identities...|$|R
40|$|The Finnish-Russian {{border is}} one of the oldest {{dividing}} lines on the European continent, but also the most stable and peaceful new border the EU has been sharing with Russia since 1995. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, it became both a site and an instrument of increased crossborder interaction and institutional innovation, as illustrated by the establishment of Euregio Karelia in 2000. The paper recalls the historical background of good-neighbourhood in the Finnish-Russian/Soviet borderlands and calls on constructivist IR theory to elaborate a model for analysing the factors, actors and mechanisms that contributed to the partial integration of this frontier. With Russian regions adjacent to the EU/Finnish border participating in the <b>Northern</b> Dimension, cross-border <b>cooperation</b> contributed to the growing regionalisation of the EU-Russia 2 ̆ 01 cstrategic partnership 2 ̆ 01 d.

40|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the interim administration (IA) mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has failed in its aim to transform the society and contributed to a complicated completion of the mission. In this article, primarily reports of the UN General-Secretary (SG) on UNMIK are analyzed to answer the question posed in the title. Important development points during the reporting periods that cover key research areas such as security, political <b>cooperation,</b> <b>Northern</b> Kosovo, ethnic tensions, and violence are analyzed. The transitional process and the mode of transition have been influenced by three important factors that significantly undermined the aim of interim administrators to achieve benchmarks. Moreover, conflicting ethnic interest has emerged as the most influential factor that has had a serious detrimental impact on the mode of transition. The IA has failed to transform individual interests that are still very deeply rooted in the political system and in society. Present diplomatic achievements are still strongly imperiled by a deep hostility in the region, largely because of a chronic ignorance on the part of administrators of the intensity of conflicting ethnic interests. To ensure security in the area an international presence will probably be needed in Kosovo for a very long time...|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} 1990s, Tunander wrote on {{military}} strategy, confidence-building measures, region-building and US remaking of world order. He headed a Nordic study group, [...] "A new Europe", from mid-1980s with Ole Wæver, Iver B. Neumann, Sverre Jervell, and Espen Barth Eide. Robert Bathurst (PRIO and U.S. Naval Postgraduate School) and Tunander initiated Norwegian-Russian dialogue seminars {{in the early}} 1990s. In 1994, he co-edited a volume on the post-Cold War regional cooperation in Arctic Europe, The Barents Region. Tunander wrote contributions about <b>Northern</b> Europe, Nordic <b>Cooperation,</b> and Scandinavism published by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swedish Olof Palme International Center. He contributed to the Russian journal International Affairs. Tunander wrote and edited two Swedish books on power, identity, and territory and co-edited Geopolitics in Post-Wall Europe (1997). Some of these books were on the reading lists for universities and military colleges in Europe and the United States, {{and a number of}} these projects were carried out for the Norwegian ministries of defence and foreign affairs. After 2000, he organized Nordic-Chinese dialogue conferences with the Chinese Institute of International Studies and the Nordic peace research and international affairs institutes. He also participated in a Washington dialogue. His new focus on China might be explained by his marriage with Yao Xiaoling, who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Chinese reform policy.|$|R
