5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information sharing and facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking <b>National</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E

40|$|Volunteering {{and media}} belong to worlds apart: {{specialized}} literature often complaint about news media carelessness and misunderstanding about voluntary activities; {{the complex and}} heterogeneous world of the third sector hardly has space in the news and isn’t able to develop effective communicative strategies. This work aims to understand {{the image of the}} voluntary sector conveyed by Italian newspapers in 2010, theoretically framed in the tradition of social representations. Drawing on the <b>National</b> <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centres</b> for Voluntary Service daily press review, a lexicographic analysis was performed on the news published by 99 newspapers between January 1 st and December 31 th 2010 on issues related to voluntary activities, third sector, foundations and “ 5 per thousand”. The corpus- made up of 3, 000 items- was processed with TalTac 2 application. The analysis has highlighted how newspapers have reported a year of “voluntary activities”. This paper intends to reconstruct the symbolic dimension conveyed by the media, under the hypothesis that this is a relevant factor in the process of social and political legitimacy of the third sector.

40|$|The {{legacy of}} the 2000 s whole-of-government reform agenda {{promotes}} that public sector agencies work across the sector, encouraging an inter-agency collaborative approach to resolve the so called ‘wicked problems’ facing New Zealand. The initial 1980 s public service reform agenda, established on a neoliberal philosophy, afforded greater decision-making autonomy to public servants and hierarchical simplification. Yet the author’s experience of inter-agency collaboration as a mid-level public sector official is that, despite best intentions, it is difficult in practice due to the paradoxical requirement of autonomous decision-making power and obligation to individual departments and their Chief Executives. These paradoxes manifest as tensions between the collaborative causal powers (agency) of public servants and the structure and practices of New Zealand’s Westminster system of governance that remains palpably hierarchical. This research uses Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as a methodological means of validating this hypothesis {{within the context of}} a case study of the <b>National</b> Maritime <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre.</b> This theoretically driven research presents CDA as an alternative and instructive lens that provides an enhanced understanding of the real world issues associated with collaboration within New Zealand’s public sector to present possibilities for change...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} and analyzes {{the data of}} the Italian system for take-back and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipments (WEEEs) in the start-up period 2008 – 2010. The analysis was focused particularly on the data about the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments. In fact, the wastes of cooling and freezing equipments have a high environmental impact. Indeed, in their compressor oil and insulation polyurethane (PU) foams chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) ozone-depleting gases are still present. In the period 2001 – 2004 Northern Italy resulted the main source in Europe of CFCs. The European Directive on WEEE management was enacted in 2002, but in Italy it was implemented by the legislative Decree in 2005 and it became operational in 2008. Actually, in 2008 the <b>national</b> WEEE <b>Coordination</b> <b>Centre</b> was founded in order to organize the WEEE pick-up process and to control collection, recovery and recycling targets. As a result, in 2010 the average WEEE collection per capita exceeded the threshold of more than 4 kg per inhabitant, as well as cooling and freezing appliances represented more than one fourth of the Italian WEEE collection stream. During the treatment of end-of-life cooling and freezing equipments, CFCs were recovered and disposed principally by burner methods. The analyses of defined specimens collected in the treatment facilities were standardized to reliably {{determine the amount of}} recovered CFCs. Samples of alkaline solid salt, alkaline saline solution, polyurethane matrix and compressor oil collected during the audit assessment procedure were analyzed and the results were discussed. In particular, the analysis of PU samples after the shredding and the warm pressing procedures measured a residual CFCs content around 500 – 1300 mg/kg of CFCs within the foam matrix...|$|R
