From {{the viewpoint of}} different groups participating in <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> systems, different system functions and targets required by each group are analyzed. Then the corresponding system targets and evaluation rules required by the administrator are mainly studied. Four primary aspects which have great impacts on <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> efficiency are proposed and the corresponding evaluation index framework and method are studied. Finally, this paper evaluates and compares the <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> efficiency of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, 3 most important metropolitan areas in China. The main impact factors of <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> efficiency of each city are summarized...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTransportation is an {{important}} safeguard for the running and development of a city. While, on the one hand, contribute to the soar and scale expansion of <b>urban</b> economy, <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> dominated by small vehicles, on the other hand, triggered various urban problems with respect to congestion, energy consumption and environment protection. Although demand-driven transportation development strategy has proved to effectively relieve congestion problems in <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> for {{a certain period of}} time, such strategy also led to an even swift inflation of traffic demand and thus it is not a thorough {{solution to the problem of}} supply and demand imbalance in <b>urban</b> <b>transportation.</b> Therefore, policies concerning the management of the demand of <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> represented by congestion charging policy gradually enter into the sight of decision makers of <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> and become an effective measure for first-tier cities in China to relieve congestion and improve air quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{uncontrolled}} growth in urbanization and motorization generally contributes to an urban {{land use and}} transportation system that is socially, economically, and environmentally unsustainable. This paper uses Karachi as a case study, {{which is the largest}} urban and economic centre of Pakistan, passing through an uncontrolled phase of rapid urbanization and motorization. The paper first reviews research related to sustainable transportation systems to comprehend the concept of sustainable development and transporta-tion. The paper then evaluates the existing transportation and infrastructure system, national <b>transportation</b> policies, and <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> projects to determine if the current paradigm is moving toward or away from sustainable transportation. Furthermore, the principles for sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> are devel-oped to see what significance national transportation policies have given to <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> from a sus-tainable transportation point of view. Finally some strategies are suggested, adoption of which may lead to a sustainable <b>urban</b> development and <b>transportation</b> system in Karachi.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{difficult}} to macroscopically characterize <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network with various traffic operation components. Two-fluid model that was suggested by Herman and Prigogine (1979) is well known as a predominant method based on traffic flow theory, which provides a macroscopic measure {{of the quality of}} traffic service in an <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network. The two-fluid model needs individual probe vehicle data such as total travel time, stop and running time per unit distance. Therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} collect these input data for practical applications. This paper presents the application of GPS data to the two-fluid model for the “Kangnam” supernetwork in Seoul. The result shows that the GPS data is reliable to estimate the two-fluid model parameters. There are many applications of two-fluid model to <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network in the world, and if more researches are conducted, it is obvious that the two-fluid model would be a useful method to analyze <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network theoretically...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} the findings {{on a project}} undertaken to develop a geo-spatial mathematical model relating landuse, road type and air quality. The model shows how spatial elements and issues were quantified to accurately represent the usual and unusual urban environment {{in the development of}} residential land-use. The mathematical relationship was based on the optimum distance between residential area and <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network. This mathematical analysis would provide a better planning for <b>urban</b> <b>transportation.</b> The spatial data (urban land-use and urban network development) were generated using satellite images, aerial photos and land use maps. Geospatial analyses were performed to find the effect and impact of urban air quality with respect to <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> networks. The output of the study would assist the task to reduce negative transport environmental impacts particularly in the field of air pollution. It would also be useful in identifying the potential residential area with respect to <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> network towards achieving sustainable development.

40|$|For <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> {{planners}} {{these are}} challenging times. Mounting practical concerns are mirrored by more fundamental critiques.

The first is that the <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> system behaves in an evolutionary fashion. The second hypothesis is that because of this, <b>urban</b> <b>transportation</b> planning needs also to focus on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the system. Changes in transport and land use development patterns and policies and in the broader context in the post-war period in the Amsterdam region are analysed in order to illustrate the two core-hypotheses.
