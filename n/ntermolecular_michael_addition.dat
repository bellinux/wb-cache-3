40|$|Previous {{work in the}} Simpkins group {{includes}} the <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> reactions of triketopiperazines (TKPs). These were performed asymmetrically using modified cinchona alkaloid catalysts. The aim of this project was to expand the range of substrates {{that could be used}} in similar organocatalytic reactions. Cyclic substrates such as hydantoins and the drug thalidomide did not show any reactivity under the <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> conditions. Acyclic substrates were also tested and some limited success was achieved with an α-phenyl amide substrate. However, a strongly basic guanidine catalyst was required, so investigations were therefore carried out into developing chiral guanidine catalysts. In the course of the project a new method for the arylation of a TKP was developed which used diphenyliodonium triflate (DPIT) as the electrophile. The Phenyl-TKP was subsequently used in asymmetric <b>Michael</b> <b>additions.</b> A range of catalysts were screened, with a modified-quinine catalyst performing the best. The PMB-protected TKP was also synthesised and this gave even better yields and selectivities when a range of unsaturated ketones were used.

Furthermore, some excellent yields and selectivities have been achieved for organocatalytic <b>Michael</b> <b>additions...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{family of}} cinchona-based and {{thiourea}} pyrrolidine-based organocatalysts were synthesised and fully characterised. Their catalytic activity and selectivity in 1, 4 -conjugate <b>additions</b> involving the <b>Michael</b> acceptor, nitrostyrene, was evaluated. Thiourea catalysts {{based upon the}} cinchona alkaloid framework were found to exhibit excellent activity and enantioselectivity (up to 95 % yield and 97 % ee) at loadings of 10 mol% when 1, 3 -diketones were employed as the pronucleophile. This result demonstrated that a thiourea cinchona catalyst was much more efficient at catalysing this <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> than previously reported. The same thiourea organocatalysts were employed in the first successful <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> of the sterically challenging dipivaloylmethane to β-nitrostyrene. Thiourea catalysts based upon the pyrrolidine motif were also employed in the <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> of cyclohexanone to nitrostyrene, furnishing up to 97 % yield and 48 % ee. The organocatalysed conjugate addition reactions involving less activated Michael acceptors, such as ,-unsaturated diesters, ketones and acrylate esters was also investigated. Although these acceptors are challenging substrates and are considerably less reactive than nitrostyrene, we herein report the first organocatalytic <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> to an ,-unsaturated diester using a H-bonding bifunctional catalyst. These thiourea catalysts were excellent promoters of the <b>Michael</b> <b>addition</b> of acetylacetone to dimethyl ethylidenemalonate and the yields were high (up to 99 %) {{for all of the}} catalysts tested.
