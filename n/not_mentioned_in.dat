This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

The lack of preceding outlooks was attributed to the storm's unusual location and the sparsity of data for storms in the region.|$|E

5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially at the gates, and the fire raged unchecked.
