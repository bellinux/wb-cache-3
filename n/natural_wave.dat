His appearance confirmed their anticipation. His fair complexion and nut brown hair tinged with gold, cut somewhat short, but with a <b>natural</b> <b>wave,</b> contrasted with their darker locks and faces bronzed by the sun. There was an honest and frank look in his grey eyes, and an expression of good temper on his face, though the square chin and firm lips spoke of earnestness and resolution of purpose. The official took him round the circle and presented him first to the knights and then to each of his comrades.|$|E

I've talked to {{quite a number of}} people who knew him in those days, white men, and they all agree that the first time you saw him his beauty just took your breath away. They called him Red on account of his flaming hair. It had a <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> and he wore it long. It must have been of that {{wonderful}} colour that the pre-Raphaelites raved over. I don't think he was vain of it, he was much too ingenuous for that, but no one could have blamed him if he had been. He was tall, six feet and an inch or two--in the native house that used to stand here was the mark of his height cut with a knife on the central trunk that supported the roof--and he was made like a Greek god, broad in the shoulders and thin in the flanks; he was like Apollo, with just that soft roundness which Praxiteles gave him, and that suave, feminine grace which has in it something troubling and mysterious. His skin was dazzling white, milky, like satin; his skin was like a woman's." ...|$|E
60|$|Gerty MacDowell who {{was seated}} near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far {{away into the}} {{distance}} was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good {{much better than the}} Widow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.|$|E
40|$|Wind {{generated}} laboratory {{waves are}} compared with water waves measured during field experiments on the Lake of Constance. Wave ordinates largely {{differ from the}} normal distribution. While the wave heights on the Lake of C. obey the Raleigh distribution, wave heights in the laboratory resemble the Gaussian distribution. Contrary to <b>natural</b> <b>waves,</b> laboratory waves often appear in groups. Laboratory waves represent a quasi regular system with randomized wave heights. Wave shape analysis revealed that laboratory waves are much more steep than <b>natural</b> <b>waves.</b> Laboratory waves almost reach the limit steepness according to the criterium by Miche. Laboratory wave spectra are very narrow, and the energy is concentrated {{in the region of}} the dominating frequency. Lake surface waves are characterized by a much broader distribution and a more pronounced directional behaviour.

40|$|Abstract Polarization {{evolution}} of radio {{waves in the}} plasma of pulsar magnetosphere is con-sidered. The polarization state of the <b>natural</b> <b>waves</b> linearly polarized in orthogonal directions is found to change considerably because of the wave mode coupling and the cyclotron aborp-tion. It is shown that the original <b>natural</b> <b>waves</b> acquire elliptical polarization and become slightly non-orthogonal. A model of the individual pulse polarization is suggested based on an idea of fluctuations in the plasma flow. The implications of the individual pulse polariza-tion data for diagnostics of pulsar plasma are outlined as well. Key words: plasmas — polarization — pulsars: general — waves...|$|R

We study {{a broad range}} of operating conditions with Kapitza and Reynolds numbers ranging from Ka = 191 - 3394 and Re 24 - 251, respectively. We compare film thickness measurements, conducted by a laser triangulation scanner, with those obtained by directly solving the full Navier-Stokes equations in two dimensions and using the volume of fluid (VOF) numerical framework. We examine the evolution of the liquid film at multiple locations over a vertical distance of 4. 5 meters. In both our experiments and simulations we identify a <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> frequency of the system of approximately 10 Hz. We investigate the formulation of the inlet boundary condition and its effects on wave formation.

40|$|The wave induced yaw drift {{moment on}} {{floating}} structures {{is of particular}} interest when the lateral yaw motion of the structure should be controlled by moorings and/or active dynamic positioning systems. In the present paper, the estimation of the yaw drift moment in the modeled <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> environment is conducted by application of a nonlinear time domain numerical method accounting for the motion of arbitrarily shaped floating bodies in waves. The computational method is based on linear potential theory and includes the non-linear hydrostatic terms in an exact way, whereas the higher-order wave-induced effects are partly approximated. Despite the approximate modeling of the second order hydrodynamic forces, the method proved to satisfactorily approach the dominant part of the exerted hydrodynamic forces enabling the calculation of drift forces and of other drift effects in irregular waves. Hence, the subject yaw drift moment in the modeled <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> environment is derived, resulting to a basic reference for the design of similar type floating structures.

40|$|Pulsar radio {{emission}} is modelled as a sum of two completely polarized non-orthogonal modes with the randomly varying Stokes parameters and intensity ratio. The modes {{are the result}} of polarization evolution of the original <b>natural</b> <b>waves</b> in the hot magnetized weakly inhomogeneous plasma of pulsar magnetosphere. In the course of wave mode coupling, the linearly polarized <b>natural</b> <b>waves</b> acquire purely orthogonal elliptical polarizations. Further on, as the waves pass through the cyclotron resonance, they become non-orthogonal. The pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of the final polarization characteristics and the intensity ratio of the modes are attributed to the temporal fluctuations in the plasma flow. The model suggested allows to reproduce the basic features of the one-dimensional distributions of the individual-pulse polarization characteristics. Besides that, propagation origin of pulsar polarization implies a certain correlation between the mode ellipticity and position angle. On a qualitative level, for different sets of parameters, the expected correlations appear compatible with the observed ones. Further theoretical studies are necessary to establish the quantitative correspondence of the model to the observational results and to develop a technique of diagnostics of pulsar plasma on this basis.

The data comprise measurements of ripple lengths, heights and crest orientations, assessments of sediment activity, and associated hydraulic conditions measured by waverider bouys and electromagnetic current meters. The data {{are limited in}} that they were obtained at a single water depth (approximately 24 m) under low wave conditions (Hs < 1. 5 m and 7 s < T < 14 s). Interpretation of the data, however, could be generalised to a limited extent {{through the application of}} dimensional analysis techniques. The field data are assessed in the light of other limited field data and the extensive laboratory data set with a view to determining the appropriate statistical parameters describing <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> spectra to be used for predicting bedform size and sediment activity under <b>natural</b> <b>wave</b> motion. The results indicate that the size of wave-generated bedforms can be predicted approximately from natural, wave-induced, near-bed, velocity spectral data if periods corresponding to the frequencies at which the spectral energy densities peak are used with values of near-bed orbital displacements (or velocities) approximately twice those of the "significant" displacement parameters, and D 50 for the sediment grain size, in conjunction with the laboratory-determined bedform curves presented by Mogridge and Kamphuis (1972). A rippled bed incipient motion criterion is developed empirically from the field data using dimensional analysis techniques. This criterion incorporates the contribution to boundary shear stress made by the presence of bedforms as well as particle size.
