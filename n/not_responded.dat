5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was {{produced}} by Coyle's production company, Ten Ten Films, and the company Farnam Street II, in association with Cabin 14 Productions. It was distributed by First Look International. About {{a year before the}} film was released, Coyle asked Anne Marie Gillen to serve as executive producer. Gillen said she had <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to a script in such an emotional way since the 1991 drama film Fried Green Tomatoes, which she also produced. Filming, which began in May 2008, took place entirely in Minneapolis. It included several scenes staged in the city's Uptown commercial district, where Coyle lived.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs that have <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and {{in cases of}} tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a bottle with water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E

5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin {{told her he was}} marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; the president has <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
5|$|While Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is away at an {{emergency}} Federation conference, the Enterprise crew discovers an ancient space capsule from Earth. Inside they find three humans in cryonic chambers. Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) asks {{to move the}} chambers to the Enterprise and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) agrees. Picard returns and orders the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone, as several Federation outposts near {{the edges of the}} zone have <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to communications. He explains that the conference was about the potential threat of the Romulans, who have not been seen for the last several decades. As Data and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) work to thaw the cryonically preserved humans, Picard admonishes Data for bringing them aboard during a crucial time, and puts Riker in charge of looking after them.|$|E

25|$|Biologic {{treatments}} {{such as the}} TNF inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab {{are commonly}} used to treat people with UC who are no longer responding to corticosteroids. Tofacitinib, vedolizumab, and etrolizumab can also produce good clinical remission and response rates in UC. Usually, these medications are only used if other options have been exhausted (i.e., the person has received and <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> favorably to high-dose corticosteroids and immunomodulators such as azathioprine and mesalazine).|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the deaths}} and damage in Texas City were due to the {{destruction}} and subsequent burning of several chemical plants (including Monsanto and Union Carbide), oil storage, and other facilities near the explosions. 27 of the 28 members of Texas City's volunteer fire department and 3 members of the Texas City Heights Volunteer Fire Department {{who were on the}} docks near the burning ship were killed. One firefighter, Fred Dowdy, who had <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to the initial call, coordinated other firefighters arriving from communities up to 60 miles (100km) away. Eventually 200 firefighters arrived, {{from as far away as}} Los Angeles. Fires resulting from the cataclysmic events were still burning a week after the disaster, and the process of body recovery took nearly a month. All four fire engines of Texas City were twisted and burned hulks.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 16 {{children}} with ADEM, 10 recovered completely after high-dose methylprednisolone, one severe case that {{failed to respond to}} steroids recovered completely after IV Ig; the five most severe cases -with ADAM and severe peripheral neuropathy- were treated with combined high-dose methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin, two remained paraplegic, one had motor and cognitive handicaps, and two recovered. A recent review of IVIg treatment of ADEM (of which the previous study formed the bulk of the cases) found that 70% of children showed complete recovery after treatment with IVIg, or IVIg plus corticosteroids. A study of IVIg treatment in adults with ADEM showed that IVIg seems more effective in treating sensory and motor disturbances, while steroids seem more effective in treating impairments of cognition, consciousness and rigor. This same study found one subject, a 71-year-old man who had <b>not</b> <b>responded</b> to steroids, that responded to an IVIg treatment 58 days after disease onset.|$|E
