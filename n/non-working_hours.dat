Method We recruited 76 non-smoking employees from venues that allowed smoking (n= 9), had mixed policies (smoking and non-smoking areas, n= 13) or were smoke-free (n= 2) between April and August 2008 in Santiago, Chile. Employees used personal air nicotine samplers during working and <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> for a 24 -h period to assess occupational vs. non-occupational secondhand tobacco smoke exposure and hair nicotine concentrations to assess overall secondhand tobacco smoke exposure. Results Median hair nicotine concentrations were 1. 5 ng/mg, interquartile range (IQR) 0. 7 to 5. 2 ng/mg. Time weighted average personal air nicotine concentrations were higher during working hours (median 9. 7, IQR 3. 3 – 25. 4 µg/m 3) compared to <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> (1. 7, 1. 0 – 3. 1 µg/m 3). Hair nicotine concentration was best predicted by personal air nicotine concentration at working hours. After adjustment, a 2 -fold increase in personal air nicotine concentration in working hours {{was associated with}} a 42 % increase in hair nicotine concentration (95 % confidence interval 14 – 70 %). Hair nicotine concentration was not associated with personal air nicotine concentration during <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> (non-occupational exposure).

Effect of environmental and occupancy parameters on the concentrations of PM during working and <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> (i. e., activity and non-activity periods, respectively) are also investigated. Average outdoor concentration of PM and PM were found to exceed the 24 -h averaged national standard values, showing a polluted environment surrounding the studied building. During working hours, indoor PM concentration was found 6 - 10 times, both PM and PM were 1. 5 - 2 times, higher than the <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> in the selected MEs. The variations of indoor concentrations were highest (17. 1 - 601. 2 μg/m) for PM compared with PM (16. 9 - 102. 6 μg/m) and PM (10. 6 - 63. 6 μg/m). The I/O for PM, PM, and PM varied from 0. 37 - 3. 1, 0. 2 - 3. 2, and 0. 17 - 2. 9, respectively.

40|$|IntroductionBased on {{data from}} the Baden-Wuerttemberg stroke registry, we aimed to explore the diurnal {{variation}} of acute ischemic stroke (IS) care delivery. Materials and methods 92, 530 IS patients were included, of whom 37, 471 (40 %) presented within an onset-to-door time ≤ 4. 5 [*]h. Daytime was stratified in 3 -h time intervals and working vs. <b>non-working</b> <b>hours.</b> Stroke onset and hospital admission time, rate of door-to-neurological examination time ≤ 30 [*]min, onset-/door-to-imaging time IV thrombolysis (IVT) rates, and onset-/door-to-needle time were determined. Multivariable regression models were used stratified by stroke onset and hospital admission time to assess the relationship between IVT rates, quality performance parameters, and daytime. The time interval 0 : 00 [*]h to 3 : 00 [*]h and working hours, respectively, were taken as reference. ResultsThe IVT rate of the whole study population was strongly associated with the sleep–wake cycle. In patients presenting within the 4. 5 -h time window and potentially eligible for IVT stratification by hospital admission time identified two time intervals with lower IVT rates. First, between 3 : 01 [*]h and 6 : 00 [*]h (IVT rate 18 %) and likely attributed to in-hospital delays with the lowest diurnal rate of door-to-neurological examination time ≤ 30 [*]min and the longest door-to-needle time Second, between 6 : 01 [*]h and 15 : 00 [*]h (IVT rate 23 – 25 %) compared to the late afternoon and evening hours (IVT rate 27 – 29 %) due to a longer onset-to-imaging time and door-to-imaging time. No evidence for a compromised stroke service during <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> was observed. ConclusionThe analysis provides evidence that acute IS care is subject to diurnal variation which may affect stroke outcome. An optimization of IS care aiming at constantly high IVT rates {{over the course of}} the day therefore appears desirable...|$|E
40|$|Background Sedentary {{behaviour}} is {{an independent}} risk factor for mortality and morbidity, especially for type 2 diabetes. Since office work is related to long periods that are largely sedentary, it is of major importance to find ways for office workers to engage in light intensity physical activity (LPA). The Inphact Treadmill study aims to investigate the effects of installing treadmill workstations in offices compared to conventional workstations. Methods/Design A two-arm, 13 -month, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Healthy overweight and obese office workers (n[*]=[*] 80) with mainly sedentary tasks will be recruited from office workplaces in Umeå, Sweden. The intervention group will receive a health consultation and a treadmill desk, which they will use {{for at least one}} hour per day for 13  months. The control group will receive the same health consultation, but continue to work at their regular workstations. Physical activity and sedentary time during workdays and non-workdays as well as during working and <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> on workdays will be measured objectively using accelerometers (Actigraph and activPAL) at baseline and after 2, 6, 10, and 13  months of follow-up. Food intake will be recorded and metabolic and anthropometric variables, body composition, stress, pain, depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and functional magnetic resonance imaging will be measured at 3 – 5 time points during the study period. Interviews with participants from the intervention group will be performed {{at the end of the}} study. Discussion This will be the first long-term RCT on the effects of treadmill workstations on objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time as well as other body functions and structures/morphology during working and <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> among office workers. This will provide further insight on the effects of active workstations on our health and could fill in some of the knowledge gaps regarding how we can reduce sedentary time in office environments.

Methods: We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 1997 through 2007 using multivariate binary and polytomous logistic regression adjusted for survey design to determine the effect of predictors on specified outcome variables. Results: Overall, 4, 726 observations representing 16. 4 million NTDC-related ED visits were identified. Significant differences in rates of NTDC-related ED visits were observed with 40 %– 50 % higher rates during <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> and 20 % higher rates on weekends than the overall average rate of 170 visits per hour. Compared with 19 – 33 year olds, subjects < 18 years old had significantly higher relative rates of NTDC-related ED visits during nonworking hours [relative rate ratio (RRR) = 1. 6 to 1. 8], whereas those aged 73 and older had lower relative rates during nonworking hours (RRR = 0. 4; overall P = 0. 0005).

40|$|This is a non-final {{version of}} an article {{published}} in final form in MANSOUBI, M. [...] . et al., 2016. Using sit-to-stand workstations in offices: is there a compensation effect? Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 48 (4) pp. 720 - 725. PURPOSE: Sit-to-stand workstations are becoming common in modern offices and are increasingly being implemented in sedentary behavior interventions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether the introduction of such a workstation among office workers leads to reductions in sitting during working hours, and whether office workers compensate for any reduction in sitting at work by increasing sedentary time and decreasing physical activity (PA) outside work. METHODS: Office workers (n= 40; 55 % female) were given a WorkFit-S, sit-to-stand workstation for 3 months. Participants completed assessments at baseline (prior to workstation installation), 1 -week and 6 -weeks after the introduction of the workstation, and again at 3 -months (post-intervention). Posture and PA were assessed using the activPAL inclinometer and ActiGraph GT 3 X+ accelerometer, which participants wore for 7 -days during each measurement phase. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly decreased (75 ± 13 % versus 52 ± 16 - 56 ± 13 %), and time spent standing and in light activity significantly increased (standing: 19 ± 12 % versus 32 ± 12 - 37 ± 15 %, light PA: 14 ± 4 % versus 16 ± 5 %) during working hours at all follow-up assessments. However, compared to baseline, the proportion of time spent sitting significantly increased (60 ± 11 % versus 66 ± 12 - 68 ± 12 %) and light activity significantly decreased (21 ± 5 % versus 19 ± 5 %) during <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> across the follow-up measurements. No differences were seen in moderate-to-vigorous activity during <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> throughout the study. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that introducing a sit-to-stand workstation can significantly reduce sedentary time and increase light activity levels during working hours. However, these changes were compensated for by reducing activity and increasing sitting outside of working hours. An intervention of a sit-to-stand workstation should be accompanied by an intervention outside of working hours to limit behavior compensation...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} the {{relationship}} between telework and the actual time employees put into their jobs. One of the reported threats to teleworkers' personal lives is {{that in order to}} finish their work, they not only use up saved commuting time, but also part of their <b>non-working</b> <b>hours,</b> even to the extent of becoming workaholics. Recent empirical analyses show that teleworkers do seem to work longer hours than non-teleworkers. Yet there is an interesting observation to be made: teleworkers are not found to work longer hours when compared with employees who are given the teleworking option but not taking it. One might hypothesise, therefore, that there might be other factors accounting for the longer working hours of teleworkers (and of "teleworkable" job-holders), rather than teleworking as such. For that reason, the effect of teleworking on working hours was controlled for job and pay system characteristics. In line with expectations, salaried work, higher wages, and some fringe benefits accounted for longer hours, and telework did not. Therefore, telework may be rightly used as an HRM-tool to attract and/or retain (scarce) personnel, for it allows employees to save commuting time and, consequently, contributes to a better work-home balance...|$|E
40|$|Why do a {{production}} of The Menaechmus Twins by Plautus at Marquette University in Milwaukee? Most people think of Milwaukee as the city of Laverne and Shirley, where {{a large percentage of}} the population is employed in one of numerous breweries, and citizens spend their <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> in bowling alleys or at fish fries. True, Milwaukee boasts more bowling alleys per capita than any other city in the country, but Milwaukee has more Equity theatres than breweries, one of which is an outstanding LORT A repertory theatre with an international reputation. The University itself features a major in classics, and offers a full complement of upper division courses in Cicero, Livy, Vergil, Horace, Roman philosophy, Roman art, and even a course in Roman comedy. The University also has classical scholars in its administrative ranks, among them Vice-president for Academic Affairs Francis M. Lazarus, author of a dissertation at Cornell University on classical anthropology and philology. Lazarus described Plautus (250 - 183 B. C.) as 2 ̆ 2 the greatest comic playwright Rome ever produced 2 ̆ 2 in an essay for the production program, and he, along with faculty members throughout the University strongly advocated presentations of 2 ̆ 2 classical 2 ̆ 2 drama on campus in the Evan P. and Marion Helfaer Theatre...|$|E
40|$|Working time {{reduction}} is {{high on the}} political agenda, but preferences and practices have not been studied extensively. Using large-scale survey data of 17, 308 employees in Dutch banks after {{the introduction of the}} 36 -hours working week by the end of 1996, ordinal and logistic regression analyses are performed to determine (1) which employees have favourable or unfavourable attitudes with regard to the working time reduction and (2) which employees are assigned reduced working hours and which are not. The results indicate that with regard to employee preferences the maximizing income thesis is mostly supported: low-income, breadwinning and part-time employees are less in favour of RWT. Theses on maximizing working hours or maximizing <b>non-working</b> <b>hours</b> are partly supported. Female employees have more favourable attitudes, although this is not related to the presence of young children. Supervisors have less favourable attitudes. The working time reduction aimed at work sharing to prevent dismissals, but the analyses indicate that the employees in redundant jobs hardly have more favourable attitudes. The thesis of minimizing working hours is hardly supported. The explanatory power of the model is low and the issue definitely needs more investigation. In explaining employer’s strategies to assign reduced working hours to employees, the thesis on th...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{measures}} {{the association between}} hospital staff’s job strain (JS), mental quality of life (MQL) {{and how they are}} influenced by the organization models within emergency and critical care units. Material and Methods: This study describes workers employed in emergency departments and intensive care units of a French public hospital. A selfadministered questionnaire was used to survey the demographic and organizational characteristics of their work, as well as work-related mental stress, psychosocial and organizational constraints, and their MQL. Results: Among 145 workers participating in the study, 59. 3 % of them report job strain and 54. 5 % of them have low MQL scores. The majority of staff with job strain has reported working more than 2 weekends per month, were regularly on-call, worked in dysfunctional environments and did not participate in regular meetings. The staff with low MQL worked more frequently in dysfunctional environments, had significant complaints regarding employer’s efforts to promote communications or provide adequate staffing levels than the workers with a high MQL score. Conclusions: If stress reduction and improved MQL in emergency and intensive care units is to be achieved, hospital management needs to design work schedules that provide a better balance between working and <b>non-working</b> <b>hours.</b> Additionally, ergonomic design, functional environments and improved communications needs to be implemented...|$|E
