40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{assessment}} of the position of English, American, French and German law, UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG), the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and Principle of European Contract Law (PECL) regarding the problem of economic hardship in performance of contracts. As such, it has four aims: first, to establish a comprehensive concept of economic hardship; second, {{on the basis of the}} concept of economic hardship established, to examine this concept in the four main legal systems to determine the extent to which they recognise this problem and what kind of legal consequences they consider for it; third, by a comparative approach, to consider and explore the points of convergence and divergence between the legal systems under study; and, fourth, by examining some international and regional laws and models to find out how non-domestic laws and models have treated the issue. In relation to the first aim, after establishing that a general theory of hardship is needed, it is argued that economic hardship occurs when, as a result of unforeseen and unforeseeable supervening events for which none of the parties is responsible and could not have been avoided the consequences, the performance of the contract has become excessively onerous and the original equilibrium of the contract has been fundamentally altered. In relation to the second aim, different conclusions are reached in the four legal systems being studied: in English law, although the doctrine of frustration by its dominant test of ‘fundamental change’ is theoretically applicable to cases of economic hardship, in practice, English courts have rejected the notion that hardship can be regarded as a ground for excuse for <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> In American law, the modern doctrine of commercial impracticability has recognised the problem of economic hardship. However, in practice American courts have been unsuccessful in properly applying this doctrine to cases of economic changes in contracts. French law has only accepted economic changes as a ground for revision in administrative contracts under the doctrine of imprévision.  The German doctrine of frustration has played a broader function compared to that of other legal systems; German law has recognised the problem of economic hardship as a ground for excuse of <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> in its case law and also in its recently revised Civil Code. In relation to the third aim, it is submitted that CISG, an international convention for international sale of goods, has not adopted the concept of economic hardship, and impossibility is the only ground for the exemption rule under Article 79 of CISG. However, the two modern models UNIDROIT Principles and PECL have properly recognised the problem of economic hardship and anticipated appropriate solutions for it. Although the presence of a concept of economic hardship is needed as a general guidance in changed economic circumstances, it is concluded that the most peaceful way to deal with the problem of economic hardship is to provide express causes at the time of conclusion of the contract.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{economic}} crisis has led to an increased number of shipping and trade cases before the courts which raise the issue of economic hardship as an excuse for <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> As a legal concept, even in western legal systems, the cultural and normative differences pose a serious challenge for judicial and arbitral tribunals to find the right solution. The two extremes are either that hardship does not excuse performance or that it requires the contract to be modified, either judicially or by the parties. This article highlights some of these differences between the legal systems and emphasises that commercial people can and should be trusted to find solutions to the disruptive effects to contractual relations. However, commercial arrangements or solutions are only as successful as the legal system on which they are founded. This article thus aims to study the developments in European commercial law thinking which might be said to support or hinder commercial creativity and innovation. From an English law point of view, it will be demonstrated that these developments could not be said to be doctrinal developments per se, but merely a more pragmatic, as consistent with the heritage of the common law, application of the current doctrinal rules. The doctrinal challenges however could impede these pragmatic solutions as would be argued. Shipping contracts provide a useful backdrop because of their globalised and transnational nature. Of course, shipping contracts are often seen as a pure version of contracts given the presumed equal bargaining positions of both parties...|$|E
40|$|I herein want to emphasise the {{prerequisites}} of {{the resolution}} of a contract according to the Romanian Civil Code of 2009. The prerequisites {{of the resolution}} of a contract are substantially different from those identified under the former fundamental civil legislation (the Romanian Civil code of 1864). This study aims at {{a better understanding of}} the new prerequisites of the resolution of a contract: a. a fundamental non-performance of the obligation; b. an unjustified non-performance of the obligation; c. mora debitoris The analysis of these prerequisites reveals a new possible trait of the resolution: a remedy for the <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> rather than a sanction or a variety of contractual liability. Thus the modern legislator of the Romanian Civil Code of 2009 proposed to partially change the physiognomy of the resolution of a contract, different from the former institution and here we are in front of a new law institution. The resolution of a contract under the Romanian Civil Code of 2009 is regulated under The 5 th Book – The Obligations, The second chapter – The enforcement of the Obligations, The 5 th Section – Resolution of the Contract, respectively under the Article 1549 – 1554. As will be shown below, the resolution of a contract has a homogeneous structure without being spread in different parts of the Civil code. The earning lies in the action of organism the new legal provisions, apparently enriched in comparison to those found in the Romanian Civil Code of 1864. Most notably, the Romanian Civil Code of 2009 preserves the Roman legacy. The modern legislator had a difficult task: 146 years of legal doctrine and jurisprudence transposed into a new legislation which, of course, has its flaws. Nevertheless, it should be praised, as it encompasses useful tools to regulate social relation...|$|E

The strengths in setting out such time-limits and the difficulties without such time-limits are discussed. This article also considers how Chinese courts interpret and apply these time-limits.

The replanting obligations under the 1913 agreement was binding, but also it was limited to what was reasonably practicable. Specific performance would not be decreed because all relevant landowners had not been before the court, and they were limited in a claim for compensatory damages, and these would be nominal because the claimants had failed to prove that their loss resulted from not replanting as opposed to diminution in <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land because <b>of</b> <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covenant.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays in the {{construction}} industry, <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>non-performance</b> by <b>the</b> contractor have become a common thing faced by the client. This problems usually happens the contractor failed to execute <b>the</b> according <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> It has been a common issue in Malaysia when dealing with contractor's non-performance. Thus the client needs a protection in the event when the Contractor fails or defaults in its performance under <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> such as abandonment or <b>the</b> works is <b>of</b> proof or any defects in the work appearing during the defects liability period. Contractor's performance guarantee is the feature or a management tool to handle <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>non-performance</b> by <b>the</b> contractor.

40|$|The essay {{points out}} that {{over-indebtedness}} and its related issues regarding consumers protection cannot be tackled simply by public law regulations, nor by insolvency provisions alone, {{such as the ones}} contained in Law n. 3 / 2013 and in similar statutory instruments enacted in many European countries: contract law rules can help preventing over-indebtedness and also offer remedies once the debtor has become over-indebted. Nevertheless over-indebtedness challenges traditional contract law concepts and rules. Notably, with regard to prevention <b>of</b> over-indebtedness, <b>the</b> Italian legislator has failed to put in place specific remedies in case <b>of</b> <b>non-performance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “hybrid” duties, to assist the borrowers and to assess their creditworthiness, which have been set on lenders by the Directives on credit for consumption purposes and mortgage credit; at the same time, the provisions on standard unfair contract terms, usury and late payment interest do not suffice to protect debtors from <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> over-indebtedness: those rules address only certain types of harmful conducts by lenders and, in order to be applied to a wider range of cases, they need to be complemented by the principle that compels the creditor to exercise his rights and defenses in conformity with good faith and that forbids any abus du droit (Article 1175 Italian Civil Code). Moreover, traditional contract law remedies do not offer an effective protection in case of bounded rationality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> borrower or exploitation by <b>the</b> lender <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumer’s information asymmetry or economic distress. Once <b>the</b> condition <b>of</b> over-indebtedness has occurred, the unforeseeable events causing the difficulty or inability to repay (financial hardship) do not excuse the debtor in case of breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> under <b>the</b> rules on general obligations. In order to cure the problem, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific relationship between creditor and debtor, <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract’s</b> terms can be regarded as the most effective remedy: the debtor is entitled to <b>the</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> terms under <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> good faith. Conclusively, the Author argues that insolvency law remedies – discharge among them – should be seen as a last resort means of protection, a form of social insurance, applicable in case of failure of all other remedies. The insolvency perspective is indeed aimed at tackling a social problem, while, on the contrary, <b>the</b> implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the borrower and the lender should be addressed at an earlier stage, by the rules on credit <b>contracts</b> supplemented by <b>the</b> general principles <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law...|$|R
