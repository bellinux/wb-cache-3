There are currently four big research projects about alternative fuels running under the 6 th framework programme of the European Union. The EU promotes the development mostly for environmental reasons, but supply security is also an issue. The project BIOGASMAX deals with the production of biogas in different European cities and regions. Biogas is produced {{from all kinds of}} waste and subsequently upgraded to <b>biomethane</b> (<b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> quality), distributed and eventually used as vehicle fuel. It {{is the responsibility of the}} GaBi group to conduct Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies of the various biomethane provision chains. LCA of the different technologies at sites all over Europe requires an efficient data collection. A detailed evaluation framework was developed in BIOGASMAX, including automatic data upload procedures as well as a tool to provide specific online questionnaires and ad hoc calculation of indicators and charts. From the LCA point of view, challenging methodological questions have to be answered, e. g. the evaluation of the complex and interrelated systems of "waste disposal", "(bio-) fertilizer production" and "fuel production"...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNatural gas {{used for}} power {{generation}} {{will be increasingly}} sourced from more geographically diverse sites, and unconventional sources such as shale and <b>biomethane,</b> as <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves diminish. A consequential life cycle approach {{was employed to examine}} the implications of an evolving gas supply on the greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of a future United Kingdom (UK) electricity system. Three gas supply mixes were developed based on supply trends, from present day to the year 2050. The contribution of upstream gas emissions - such as extraction, processing/refining, - is not fully reported or covered by UK government legislation. However, upstream gas emissions were seen to be very influential on the future electricity systems analysed; with upstream gas emissions per MJ rising between 2. 7 and 3. 4 times those of the current supply. Increased biomethane in the gas supply led to a substantial reduction in direct fossil emissions, which was found to be critical in offsetting rising upstream emissions. Accordingly, the modelled high shale gas scenario, with the lowest biomethane adoption; resulted in the highest GHG emissions on a life cycle basis. The long-term dynamics of upstream processes are explored in this work to help guide future decarbonisation policies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{potential}} {{application of a}} novel biogas upgrading technology called alkaline with regeneration (AwR). This technology uses an alkaline solution, along with carbon mineralization, to remove and store CO 2 from biogas {{in order to create}} biomethane, a substitute of <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> Three different applications of biogas were explored for their potential economic benefits along three different biogas generation capabilities of landfills in Spain (250 Nm 3 /h, 1000 Nm 3 /h and 5000 Nm 3 /h). The scenarios include upgrading biogas using AwR and injecting the <b>biomethane</b> into the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> grid, or selling the gas as a vehicle fuel. The third reference scenario assessed directly burning the biogas for the production of electricity. The latter showed an annual profit of 0. 2 - 5 million € 2012 while upgrading the biogas to obtain biomethane showed an annual loss of 3 - 50 million € 2012. This was due to the operational costs involved in AwR, namely the cost of NaOH (principal reagent) and the treatment of wastewater. Increasing revenue can help obtain an annual profit. In order to break-even it would be necessary to raise CO 2 credits to 99 € 2012 /t or, through feed in tariffs, increase the price of the sale of biomethane to 0. 25 € 2012 /kWh...|$|R

To this purpose, a research project titled HYSOL has developed a new power plant, consisting of a combined cycle configuration with a 100 MWe steam turbine and an 80 MWe gas-fed turbine with biomethane. Technological developments must be supported by the identification, quantification, and evaluation of the environmental impacts produced. The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the environmental performance of a CSP plant based on HYSOL technology using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology while considering different locations. The scenarios investigated include different geographic locations (Spain, Chile, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and South Africa), an alternative modelling procedure for biomethane, and the use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as an alternative fuel. Results indicate that the geographic location has a significant influence on the environmental profile of the HYSOL CSP plant. The results obtained for the HYSOL configuration located in different countries presented significant differences (between 35 % and 43 %, depending on the category), especially in climate change and water stress categories. The differences are mainly attributable to the local availability of solar and water resources and composition of the national electricity mix. In addition, HYSOL technology performs significantly better when hybridizing with <b>biomethane</b> instead of <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> This evidence is particularly relevant in the climate change category, where biomethane hybridization emits 27. 9 – 45. 9 kg CO 2 eq per MWh (depending on the biomethane modelling scenario) and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> scenario emits 264 kg CO 2 eq/MWh...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biomethane</b> or {{synthetic}} <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (Bio-SNG) {{produced from}} gasified renewable woody {{biomass is a}} promising option for replacing fossil <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> The complete interchangeability with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in all its conventional applications {{such as in the}} power generation, transportation and chemical industry sector is of particular interest. This work presents results from a comprehensive process integration study of different process alternatives for Bio-SNG production from gasified biomass. The influence of the main conversion steps in the process chain – drying, gasification, gas cleaning, methanation, and gas upgrade – on the overall process performance is investigated. Process bottlenecks and both heat and material integration opportunities are highlighted. Using future energy market scenarios the energetic, economic, and carbon footprint performance of the investigated processes are evaluated from a system perspective clearly showing the sensitivity of the obtained results to underlying assumptions. It is shown that drying of the biomass feedstock prior to gasification using excess process heat – using steam drying or low-temperature air drying technology – is an important aspect for improving the process energy efficiency. The results also indicate that indirect and direct gasification technologies perform equally well within the overall Bio-SNG production process. Existing infrastructure in the form of biomass-fired combined heat and power plants based on fluidised bed combustion technology presents interesting opportunities for integrating indirect gasification for Bio-SNG production, with beneficial effects on the cogeneration of electricity from the Bio-SNG process excess heat. The choice of methanation technology between fixed and fluidised bed is not a critical one with respect to process integration, since both technologies allow for efficient heat recovery and consequent cogeneration. For gas upgrade, in particular removal of CO 2 from the product gas, amine based separation is shown to achieve better energy efficiency and economic performance than membrane based or pressure swing adsorption processes. Preliminary estimations of Bio-SNG costs are significantly higher than current <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> prices, thus dedicated and long term policy measures are necessary in order to stimulate Bio-SNG production. The process integration aspects presented in this thesis can contribute to reducing production costs by increasing energy efficiency and in consequence increasing economic robustness of Bio-SNG process concepts. </html...|$|R
40|$|The Feed-In-Tariff {{scheme in}} the UK has {{generated}} attractive economics in the investment for anaerobic digestion (AD) to convert sewage sludge into biogas and digested sludge for energy and agricultural applications, respectively. The biogas {{is a source}} of <b>biomethane</b> to replace <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the gas grid system. Biogas can be utilised to generate combined heat and power (CHP) on-site, at household micro and distributed or community scales. These biogas CHP generation options can replace the equivalent <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> based CHP generation options. Digested sludge can be transformed into fertiliser for agricultural application replacing inorganic N:P:K fertiliser. Biogas and digested matter yields are inter-dependent: when one increases, the other decreases. Hence, these various options need to be assessed for avoided life cycle impact potentials, to understand where greatest savings lie and in order to rank these options for informed decision making by water industries. To fill a gap in the information available to industry dealing with wastewater, the avoided emissions by various AD based technologies, in primary impact potentials that make a difference between various systems, have been provided in this paper. 1 m 3 biogas can save 0. 92 m 3 <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> An average UK household (with a demand of 2 kWe) requires 180, 000 MJ or 5000 Nm 3 or 4. 76 t biogas per year, from 15. 87 t sewage sludge processed through AD. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM FC) is suitable for building micro-generations; micro gas turbine (Micro GT), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and SOFC-GT hybrid are suitable for distributed generations upto 500 kWe and occasionally over 500 kWe; engine and ignition engine above 1 MWe. These CHP technologies can be ranked from the lowest to the highest impacts per unit energy production: PEM FC is the environmentally most benign option, followed by SOFC, SOFC-GT, Engine or Micro GT and Ignition engine (with the highest impact potential), respectively. In terms of avoided global warming, acidification and photochemical ozone creation potentials, compared to equivalent <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> based systems, the biogas based PEM FC micro-generation and Micro GT distributed systems achieve the greatest avoided emissions with the most cost-effectiveness. Application of digested sludge as fertiliser has more toxicity impacts, however, has greater avoided emissions in acidification and photochemical ozone creation potentials on the basis of inorganic N:P:K fertiliser, compared to the biogas production for the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> grid system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Among the alternatives of upgrading biogas to biomethane, this work focuses on membrane permeation. Taking cellulose acetate as membrane material and spiral-wound as membrane configuration, five layouts are assessed. All layouts have the same biogas plant rated at 500 m 3 /h (STP), yet they may adopt: (i) one- or two-stage permeation, (ii) permeate or residue recycle, and (iii) a water heater or a prime mover (internal combustion engine or a micro gas turbine) to exploit residues as fuel gas. Since residues are consumed, all layouts have zero emission of methane into the atmosphere. The membrane material is modeled considering the phenomenon of plasticization; the membrane modules are described by a crossflow permeation patterns without pressure drops. The results indicates that specific membrane areas range from 1. 1 to 2. 4 m 2 h/m 3 (STP), specific energy from 0. 33 to 0. 47 kWh/m 3 (STP), and exergy efficiencies from 57. 6 % to 88. 9 %. The splitting of permeation over two stages and the adoption of water heater instead of prime movers is a convenient option. The preferred layout employs a single compressor, a two-stage membrane permeation at 26 bar, a water heater fueled by the first-stage permeate, and a second-stage permeate recycle.
