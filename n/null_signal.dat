The troopship, carrying 463 officers and crew, 80 civilians, 286 British Army soldiers, 1,793 Italian prisoners of war, and 103 Polish soldiers (guards) {{off the coast of}} West Africa, was hit by a second torpedo on Number Two hold and sank. After realising that the passengers were primarily POWs and civilians the U-boat started rescue operations while flying the Red Cross flag. A U.S. Army Air Corps bomber flying out of a secret South Atlantic airbase on Ascension Island attacked the U-boat. The U-boat abandoned the rescue effort and left the survivors to drift to Africa. Over half the survivors died.

40|$|Abstract — In the paper, {{we propose}} a {{modified}} chaotic on-off keying (COOK) modulation scheme for mitigating {{the effect of}} inter-symbol interference (ISI).

The chaotic signal is sent {{in the first half of}} the bit duration, After that, <b>null</b> <b>signal</b> is sent in the second half of the bit duration for guard interval. By inserting guard interval, the influence of the multipath delay spread can effectively be eliminated.

To this end we allow for a simultaneous bump in the variance and specify its impact on the difficulty to detect the <b>null</b> <b>signal</b> against a single bump with known signal strength. This is done by calculating lower and upper bounds, both based on the likelihood ratio. Lower and upper bounds together lead to explicit characterizations of the detection boundary in several subregimes depending on the asymptotic behavior of the bump heights in mean and variance. In particular, we explicitly identify those regimes, where the additional information about a simultaneous bump in variance eases the detection problem for the signal. This effect is made explicit in the constant and / or the rate, appearing in the detection boundary. We also discuss the case of an unknown bump height and provide an adaptive test and some upper bounds in that case. Comment: 32 pages, 6 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|To render cosmic shear {{an astronomical}} tool of high precision, it is {{essential}} to eliminate systematic effects upon its signal, {{one of the most significant}} ones being correlations between the gravitational shear and the intrinsic ellipticity of source galaxies. Because of the crudeness of current models of intrinsic alignment, we have developed a model-independent, purely geometrical method to remove shear-ellipticity correlations. We eliminate the contributions to a tomographic cosmic shear signal that may be subject to contamination by shear-ellipticity correlations, making use of the characteristic dependence of these correlations on redshift. By introducing an appropriately chosen weight function to the lensing efficiency that <b>nulls</b> <b>signals</b> stemming from certain distances, new second-order measures of cosmic shear, free of intrinsic alignment, can be constructed. The loss of information induced by this nulling technique and the subsequent degradation of constraints on cosmological parameters is quantified in a likelihood analysis. Concerning the construction of optimal weight functions, good agreement is achieved between all approaches considered. For a survey divided into 20 redshift bins we find that the area of credible regions increases by 20 % up to about 50 % after the application of nulling, depending on the cosmological parameters considered. We demonstrate that due to an optimization of the weight functions nearly all information is contained in a small subset of the new second-order measures. The use of a significantly smaller number of redshift bins than 20 for the nulling considerably degrades parameter constraints under conservative assumptions, emphasizing the need for detailed redshift information.
