There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{released}} November 26, 2002, with a January 2003 cover date. It premiered with five series: Dragon Ball Z, Sand Land, Yu-Gi-Oh!, YuYu Hakusho, and One Piece. With {{the launch of}} the magazine considered successful, Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha's editors, but declined, {{due to a lack of}} interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects. After six issues had been released, Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff. Reflecting back later, he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that [...] "I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I'd quit. It probably wasn't a really <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to do." [...] He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief, being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi.|$|E
500|$|Ian Hyland of News of the World {{disliked the}} episode, stating [...] "After this week's 'Cyberwoman' nonsense, 'Torch Script' {{would be a}} better idea." [...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> we can find to say is that the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] really should have delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind of a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2015, Smith {{was cast}} in the [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] of Masters for the second season, having previously worked with Butters and Fazekas on their television series Resurrection. Though the executive producers never thought {{that they would be}} able to get Smith for the series, they developed and wrote Masters with the actor in mind. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about that is we could go both ways on it. Maybe we never see him again or maybe we see him again and by the way he's full of Zero Matter now. The last thing you saw was Whitney Zero Mattering him and then getting interrupted. But it's still in him. Either way, we wanted to keep our options open." ...|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the last <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E

500|$|Stevie's {{relationship}} with Olly is complicated and he treats her badly, but she ignores his flaws and holds onto any <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> he does, however small. When he ends their relationship, Stevie is heartbroken, alone and lost, {{and does not}} fit in. She invites Asher to stay and is surprised when he brings Sol and Naz as well, but because Stevie loves to make new friends, she reacts in a way most people would not in that situation. She builds relationships with them and they grow to love her eventually. Fairbank-Hynes commented: [...] "Sol, Naz and Asher inform her about {{the real world and}} help her harden up just enough to survive in Albert Square!" [...] Stevie starts to see her new friends as the family she always wanted, but it proves to be difficult as they all have family issues of their own. Stevie wants to look after her new friends, which confuses them. The actress described the four friends as an unlikely gang, and said her favourite scenes were when Stevie and Sol caused a blackout across Albert Square, as the two characters did not have much interaction before then. Thompson described Stevie as a [...] "fish out of water", and Hussen said Stevie starts off being unappreciated, but eventually her friends see that she is important to them.|$|E
500|$|Allgame {{reviewer}} Steve Honeywell {{was also}} very positive with his comments, describing the plot as [...] "interesting", the graphics as [...] "appropriately cartoonish and fun" [...] and the locations as [...] "well-designed", but noting that above all [...] "what makes Sam & Max Hit the Road work is the humor". On the game's puzzles, Honeywell stated that [...] "some of the puzzles are pretty simple, while others are difficult in the extreme. One <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> is the almost complete absence of red herring items. Everything you find can be put to use somewhere". As with other reviews, Allgame praised the audio work, noting that [...] "the music is decent throughout the game, and the voice talent is stellar", closing with the comment that the game takes point-and-click adventures to [...] "insane new heights {{in terms of both}} fun and comedy". GamersHell praised the graphics of the game as [...] "superb" [...] but noted that [...] "it's not so friendly that it can only be played by kiddies". Although describing sound setup as [...] "a bit tricky", the reviewer praised the voice acting as [...] "very good" [...] and the music as [...] "top quality". However, although the review noted that the game had [...] "easy to use" [...] interfaces and menus, it was critical of the fact that [...] "at times it can be the frustrating 'hunt for the correct pixel' syndrome".|$|E
500|$|Season two {{is set in}} 1947, {{approximately}} {{six months}} to a year following the events of the first, with the time jump made to show [...] "people are in a little bit different positions, and things have happened between these seasons that we maybe don't know about." [...] Fazekas noted that [...] "the challenge" [...] for the season was to find a way to reunite Carter with Edwin Jarvis since he is [...] "not an agent....that's a really important relationship, how do we keep them together?...The <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about Peggy this season is she's not having to hide her agenda from the SSR. [...] is helping her out, just in a different way." [...] Elaborating on the SSR's role in the season, Fazekas explained that when Markus and McFeely created the organisation for [...] it was inspired by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was [...] "somewhat disbanded after the war, because it was created because of World War II. So now that the war is over, things are changing. And in real history, the OSS sort of became the CIA and some of its other functions went under other departments. There's a little bit of change going on within SSR and so Thompson [...] has a boss [...] that's going to be saying, [...] "Look, things are changing, and you need to look out for yourself."" [...] The season also sees Daniel Sousa promoted to the chief of the Los Angeles SSR office.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{followed}} the same storyline of Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, {{the first in the}} series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented and rocked by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some reviewers disliked Bond's clown costume, gorilla outfit and Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. James Berardinelli {{claimed that the}} movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff's performance, describing it as [...] "offensively bad" [...] and the worst performance of any Bond villain. By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on aircraft and the train were appreciated. Jeffrey Westhoff at Rotten Tomatoes praised Roger Moore as being [...] "". Neal Gabler and Jeffrey Lyons at the TV-show Sneak Previews praised the film and said [...] "Octopussy delivers" [...] and [...] "The <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> about Octopussy is that it's going back-to-basics, less gadgets, more hand-to-hand combat. It's more of an adventure movie in a more traditional sense and I like it for that". Danny Peary wrote that Octopussy [...] "has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren’t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers {{make the mistake of}} demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all the kids at the circus laugh at). It’s as if they’re trying to remind us that everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of From Russia with Love." [...] Entertainment Weekly chose Octopussy as the third worst Bond film, while Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the eighth worst, and IGN chose it as the seventh worst. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 42% rating.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Oliveri's backing vocal contributions, Homme noted: [...] "Nick and I {{have been}} friends since a couple weeks after {{everything}} went down in 2004. People don't know that, {{and it would be}} awkward for me to run around making sure everyone knew it. Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was going to drop off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.' That's a <b>nice</b> <b>thing.</b> It was easy. It's nice to know someone since you were a little kid, and still know them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, Tate began her next film, The Wrecking Crew (1969), a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an {{accident-prone}} spy, {{who was also a}} romantic interest for star Dean Martin, playing Matt Helm. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by Bruce Lee. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby criticized the film but wrote, [...] "The only <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl." [...] Martin commented that he intended to make another [...] "Matt Helm" [...] film, and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role.|$|E
2500|$|The name of {{the album}} was chosen because the band could not agree upon any other names. Taylor {{described}} the album title as being [...] "a very dumb pun in a way" [...] and felt it was [...] "quite an ugly sounding phrase" [...] but despite this, he felt the sentiment behind made it [...] "quite a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to say" [...] because, as in the title song, it refers to [...] "turning a one night stand into someone's whole life". Taylor stated that he liked [...] "that kind of way of expressing love towards someone" [...] {{and the idea of}} using a [...] "simple but quite clumsy turn on [...] cliché" [...] to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Sheffer portrays Keith Scott, Dan's older, kinder, under-achieving brother. Sheffer {{said that}} {{characters}} like Keith {{are not the}} most enjoyable to play. [...] "Keith is a very simple character. I actually prefer more of a challenge. He wasn't a hugely interesting character. But {{he was a good}} guy and he was just a really genuine human being with good intentions", commented Sheffer. [...] "And that's a <b>nice</b> <b>thing</b> to play and come {{home at the end of}} the day. You don't bring too much with you. We had some good scenes within the framework of a simple character, so there was some of that stuff to play, but also a lot of cheesy stuff." [...] After Dan chose Deb rather than Karen, Keith helped Karen to raise Lucas and fell in love with her, but they only get together in season three. He had a recurring drinking problem and rivalry with his brother.|$|E
