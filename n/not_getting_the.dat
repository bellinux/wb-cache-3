5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> championship. The night after No Way Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, {{in which he was}} pinned by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night Stand in a First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E

Shephard {{did not return}} for series 4 after being upset at <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> main ITV {{presenting}} job, and Fearne Cotton took over as presenter, for series 4 only, before leaving the show to concentrate on her career in America. Allegations of a falling-out with Cowell were also reported. For series 5, Cotton was replaced by presenter and close friend Holly Willoughby. Willoughby first presented The Xtra Factor on 9 August 2008, a week before series 5 was broadcast. Konnie Huq replaced Willoughby as the new Xtra Factor presenter for series 7. However, Huq decided to depart from the series in March 2011 because of work commitments.|$|E
25|$|The {{next night}} on Raw Is War, after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn {{continued}} {{and he also}} altered his character considerably {{over the next few}} months, in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who would complain incessantly when he felt he was <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even {{going so far as to}} hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still grateful to have Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on SmackDown!, when during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves The Two-Man Power Trip.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lyrics}} to the verses, Harrison focuses on the {{benefits}} of Transcendental Meditation rather than detailing the way to achieve these results. While Leng likens Harrison's approach to that of an advertiser selling anti-dandruff shampoo, author Joshua Greene describes the lyrical thrust of the song as: [...] "Is life getting you down? <b>Not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> breaks you want? Try illumination." [...] Harrison proffers greater awareness and a release from earthly limitations as the other benefits brought about by the meditation experience.|$|E

The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's interesting is that you're not really sure about him.

Directed by Judith Ivey, {{the play}} is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an [...] "appealing if overlong show", adding that [...] "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint {{the best parts of}} More. It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> degree or the kind of fame you craved.

500|$|Far Side Virtual was {{met with}} greater {{critical}} attention than Ferraro's previous releases. Just over a year after its release, Marc Masters at Pitchfork wrote that Far Side Virtual [...] "became Ferraro's most discussed and divisive effort, landing on year-end best-of lists as often as it got dismissed as a joke." [...] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on seven reviews. Critics tended to agree that Far Side Virtual takes the state of 21st-century consumerism as its subject, {{but there was no}} consensus regarding whether Ferraro intended to satirize, criticize or embrace this condition. Brandon Soderberg said that the album's concept [...] "seemed critic-proof, which was frustrating ... Negative reviews could be dismissed as the listeners simply <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> joke." ...|$|E
500|$|In Congress on June 15, 1775, Massachusetts {{delegate}} John Adams nominated George Washington as commander-in-chief of {{the army}} then gathered around Boston. Years later, Adams wrote that Hancock had shown great disappointment at <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> command for himself. This brief comment from 1801 is the only source for the oft-cited claim that Hancock sought to become commander-in-chief. In the early 20th century, historian James Truslow Adams wrote that the incident initiated a lifelong estrangement between Hancock and Washington, but some subsequent historians have expressed doubt that the incident, or the estrangement, ever occurred. According to historian Donald Proctor, [...] "There is no contemporary evidence that Hancock harbored ambitions to be named commander-in-chief. Quite the contrary." [...] Hancock and Washington maintained a good relationship after the alleged incident, and in 1778 Hancock named his only son John George Washington Hancock. Hancock admired and supported General Washington, even though Washington politely declined Hancock's request for a military appointment.|$|E

500|$|The album's songs placed {{emphasis}} on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs {{that were found}} on the band's earlier LPs. It also features a rawer sound than Soundgarden's previous album Superunknown, as the band members produced the record themselves. Cornell summed up the changes with [...] "What we've lost in sonic precision we've gained so much in terms of feeling." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that Soundgarden [...] "retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven't dressed them up with detailed production." [...] The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a [...] "dual nature". He stated, [...] "It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they're <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> same album over and over." [...] Shepherd called the album [...] "the most accurate picture of what Soundgarden actually sounds like", stating, [...] "It's way more raw. It's way more honest.

Thus Miller's character was renamed [...] "Sally Manners", and Lorraine's character was renamed [...] "Audrey Dane" [...] (played by Virginia Bruce). In real life, Ziegfeld had reportedly been obsessed with Miller, and was involved in numerous sex scandals. In 1922 Miller had given an interview in which she accused him of [...] "making love to chorus girls" [...] and sending her a diamond ring as [...] "big as her hand"; this essence of Ziegfeld's character is captured in the film. Incidentally, Miller died from toxicity complications after surgery just before {{the release of the}} film on April 7, 1936, which led one reviewer writing in Liberty to denounce an urban legend which had arisen surrounding the timing of her death, saying, [...] "It's not true that Marilyn Miller died of a broken heart at <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> lead in this." [...] Another myth surrounding her untimely death at the age of 37 is that she had contracted syphilis.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Amondson was {{approached}} by Thompson Township, Pennsylvania tax assessor James Hedges, the Prohibition Party's only elected official. He convinced Amondson to seek the nomination of his faction of the Prohibition Party, which split over perennial presidential nominee Earl Dodge's leadership of the party. Hedges' faction felt Dodge was more concerned with his campaign button business than advancing the party's goals. Dodge had run as the party's nominee in every election since 1984, but received only 208 votes in the 2000 election, down approximately 1,000 from the 1996 election. Amondson commenced his first presidential campaign with the nomination of Hedges' faction. Dodge received the other faction's nomination. According to Dodge, Amondson had previously contacted him about the vice presidential nomination, but {{it had already been}} filled. Dodge reasoned Amondson was [...] "probably a very nice man... he may not have known exactly what he was getting into." [...] Conversely, Amondson referred to Dodge as a [...] "good man" [...] with whom he shared the same message, but argued, [...] "Dodge is just <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> job done.

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the Simpson family {{watching}} a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a [...] "kill-bot factory". Mirkin {{said this was a}} joke the staff [...] "particularly loved to do" [...] because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly [...] "always trying to scare everybody" [...] by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge [...] "getting high" [...] on LSD. Mirkin, however, defended the scene and argued Marge was not [...] "doing it on purpose", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out to him, however, that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there.

Luke Cafferty is seen with Becky at the bus depot departing for the Army. The second to the last scene is of Tim and Billy, taking a break while putting up the frame of Tim's new house. They sit back, crack open a beer, and Billy toasts, [...] "Texas Forever?" [...] to which Tim responds emphatically, [...] "Texas Forever" [...] and they clink their beers.

After practice, Eric recites the phrase: [...] "Clear eyes, full hearts..."
