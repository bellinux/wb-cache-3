5|$|After {{the first}} tower collapsed, FDNY commanders issued {{evacuation}} warnings. Due to technical difficulties with malfunctioning radio repeater systems, many firefighters {{never heard the}} evacuation orders. 9-1-1 dispatchers also received information from callers that was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> along to commanders on the scene. Within hours of the attack, a substantial {{search and rescue operation}} was launched. After months of around-the-clock operations, the World Trade Center site was cleared by the end of May 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{his message}} to the {{legislature}} in 1904, Beckham again {{raised the issue of}} a uniform school textbook law, which had <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{was one of}} a few Republicans to back {{a measure}} to reform {{spending}} requirements in Colorado's state constitution. The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as a sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative.|$|E

5|$|During the Texas Constitutional Convention of 1868, {{the delegates}} paid {{attention}} to northeastern portion of the state, especially the increasing need {{for the creation of}} new counties in the region. At the time, there were a total of twenty counties located in the region, compared to twenty-three presently. The convention originally met to write a new state constitution, but members quickly tried to shift the focus to other issues. During the convention, the Committee on Counties and County Boundaries presented proposals for the creation of three new counties in the region. They were to be called Delta, Webster, and Richland. Delta County was established on July 29, 1870, by the Twelfth State Legislature. The proposals for Webster and Richland counties, however, were <b>not</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Groundbreaking on the {{dam site}} {{occurred}} in May 1957 with {{the relocation of}} the Western Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the Feather River canyon. The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> until November 8, 1960 – and only by a slim margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary work contract was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began {{to register the}} Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This {{would have resulted in}} only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> into law.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was <b>not</b> <b>passed.</b> Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2007, Obama {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Fire Department {{deployed}} 200 units (half of the department) to the World Trade Center. Their {{efforts were}} supplemented by numerous off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians. The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel, and deployed its aviation unit. Once on the scene, the FDNY, the NYPD, and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians. As conditions deteriorated, the NYPD aviation unit relayed information to police commanders, who issued orders for its personnel {{to evacuate the}} towers; most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed. With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies, warnings were <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> along to FDNY commanders.|$|E

5|$|The {{complete}} set of observable traits {{that make up the}} structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment. As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism, who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance reform was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} surprise, the Allies did not bombard Morotai {{prior to}} the invasion and conducted only a few photographic reconnaissance flights over the island. An Allied Intelligence Bureau patrol had been landed in the island in June but the information it collected was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> on to the Sixth Army. Although the Tradewind Taskforce had little information on the invasion beaches or Japanese positions, the Sixth Army did not land any of its own reconnaissance patrols on Morotai, as it was feared that these could warn the island's defenders that an attack was imminent.|$|E

5|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, lead {{poisoning}} became {{common in the}} work setting. The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been occupational. An important step {{in the understanding of}} childhood {{lead poisoning}} occurred when toxicity in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897. France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the League of Nations followed suit in 1922. However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had <b>not</b> <b>passed,</b> but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units. To take advantage of the MiG-21’s speed and small size, pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations.|$|E

5|$|H.B. 444 was {{introduced}} in the Hawaii House of Representatives on January 26, 2009. It passed the Hawaii House Judiciary Committee on February 5, 2009, with 12members voting in favor and none opposed and was approved by the Hawaii House of Representatives on February 12, 2009, with 33 members voting in favor and 17 opposed, one vote fewer than the two-thirds vote needed to override a veto by the Republican Governor Linda Lingle, who did not indicate whether she considered a veto. It was referred to the Hawaii Senate on February 13, 2009. A hearing by the Committee on Judiciary and Government Operations (JGO) was held at the State Capitol on February 24, 2009, with the outcome of three senators supporting the bill and three opposed; the bill was <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> out of committee.|$|E
5|$|Macartney started {{poorly in}} the home series against the touring South Africans in the Test series of 1910–11. In the first three Tests, he {{accumulated}} 15 runs in five innings and took a solitary wicket. As a result, he was dropped for the Fourth Test. Up to this point he had <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> 45 in 13 innings for the season and taken only seven wickets in seven matches. He then made 119 and 126 for New South Wales against South Africa and took match figures of 4/155 as the tourists fell to a 44-run defeat. This prompted the selectors to restore him to the Test team, and Macartney bounced back with his first Test century, making 137 in the first innings and 56 in the second in just 40 minutes, as Australia completed a seven-wicket win. It was his third century in as many first class innings. The late-season hat-trick of centuries pushed Macartney's season total to 609 runs at 33.83 and 10 wickets at 54.90 in ten matches.|$|E
5|$|On 7 August Nansen and Johansen boarded Jackson's {{supply ship}} Windward, and sailed for Vardø where they {{arrived on the}} 13th. They were greeted by Hans Mohn, the {{originator}} of the polar drift theory, {{who was in the}} town by chance. The world was quickly informed by telegram of Nansen's safe return, but as yet there was no news of Fram. Taking the weekly mail steamer south, Nansen and Johansen reached Hammerfest on 18 August, where they learned that Fram had been sighted. She had emerged from the ice north and west of Spitsbergen, as Nansen had predicted, and was now on her way to Tromsø. She had <b>not</b> <b>passed</b> over the pole, nor exceeded Nansen's northern mark. Without delay Nansen and Johansen sailed for Tromsø, where they were reunited with their comrades.|$|E
