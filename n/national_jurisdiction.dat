When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the general {{characteristics of a}} state’s fiscal jurisdiction and how they influence the process of interaction with other <b>national</b> tax <b>jurisdictions.</b> The paper figures out essential internal substance of fiscal jurisdiction and its reflection on the necessity of interstate fiscal cooperation. After considering this substance the thesis goes on to explore the limits beyond which <b>national</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> cannot go in collection of taxes. Absence of common bases of these limits leads to conflicts between <b>national</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> and calls for close international fiscal cooperation. The thesis argues {{that the process of}} cooperation becomes more evident. In summary the thesis states that today’s main characteristics of a state’s jurisdiction to tax do not comply with the necessity of effective administration of national fiscal law in the integrated world. Thus, a particular fiscal jurisdiction needs another qualitative dimension, which can be achieved on the higher level of international systematic cooperation...|$|R
