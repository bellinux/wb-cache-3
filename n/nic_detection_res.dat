In this thesis, we consider the problem of forest <b>re</b> <b>detection</b> and monitoring as a possible application area of wireless sensor networks. Forest res are one of the main causes of environmental degradation nowadays. The current surveillance systems for forest res lack in supporting real-time monitoring of every point of the region at all time and early <b>detection</b> of the <b>re</b> threats.

To explore lineage-specific genomic changes of the molluscs that is good model for development of nervous system in invertebrate, we conducted comparative genome structure analyses of three molluscs, pygmy squid, nautilus and scallops using partial genome shotgun sequencing. Most effective elements on the genome structural changes are repetitive elements (REs) causing expansion of genome size and whole genome duplication producing large amount of novel functional genes. Therefore, we investigated variation and proportion of REs and whole genome duplication. We, first, identified variations of REs in the three molluscan genomes by homology-based and de novo <b>RE</b> <b>detection.</b> Proportion of <b>REs</b> were 9. 2 %, 4. 0 %, and 3. 8 % in the pygmy squid, nautilus and scallop, respectively.

We propose various image and video processing algorithms for wild re surveillance. The proposed methods include; classi er fusion, online learning, real-time feature extraction, image registration and optimization.

In the second part of this thesis, we investigate di erent formulations and mixture applications for passive-aggressive online learning algorithms. We propose a classi er fusion method {{that can be used to}} increase the performance of multiple online learners or the same learners trained with di erent update parameters. We also introduce an aerial wild <b>re</b> <b>detection</b> system to test the real-time performance of the analyzed algorithms. In the third part of the thesis we propose a real-time dynamic texture recognition method using random hyperplanes and deep neural networks. We divide dynamic texture videos into spatio-temporal blocks and extract features using local binary patterns (LBP). We reduce the computational cost of the exhaustive LBP method by using randomly sampled subset of pixels in the block. We use random hyperplanes and deep neural networks to reduce the dimensionality of the nal feature vectors. We test the performance of the proposed method in a dynamic texture database. We also propose an application of the proposed method in real-time detection of ames in infrared videos. Using the same features we also propose a fast wild <b>re</b> <b>detection</b> system using pan-tilt-zoom cameras and panoramic background subtraction. We use a hybrid method consisting of speeded-up robust features and mutual information to register consecutive images and form the panorama. The next step for multi-modal surveillance applications is the registration of images obtained with di erent devices. We propose a multi-modal image registration algorithm for infrared and visible range cameras.

40|$|Cerebral blood flow-dependent phase {{differences}} between tagged and control {{arterial spin labeling}} images are reported. A biophysical model is presented to explain the vascular origin of this difference. Arterial spin labeling data indicated that the phase difference is largest when the arterial component of the signals is preserved but is greatly reduced as the arterial con-tribution is suppressed by postinversion delays or flow-crush-ing gradients. Arterial vasculature imaging by saturation data of activation and hypercapnia conditions showed increases in phase accompanying blood flow increases. An arterial spin labeling functional magnetic resonance im-aging study yielded significant activation by magnitude-only, phase-only, and complex analyses when preserving the whole arterial spin labeling signal. After suppression of the arterial signal by postinversion delays, magnitude-only and complex models yielded similar activation levels, but the phase-only model detected nearly no activation. When flow crushers were used for arterial suppression, magnitude-only activation was slightly lower and fluctuations in phase were dramatically higher than when postinversion delays were used. Although the complex analysis performed did not improve detection, a simulation study indicated that the complex-valued activation model exhibits combined magnitude and phase de-tection power and thus maximizes sensitivity under ideal con-ditions. This suggests that, as arterial spin labeling imaging and image correction methods develop, the complex-valued detec-tion model may become helpful in signal <b>detection.</b> Magn <b>Re...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnosis {{based on}} prion {{detection}} in lymph nodes of {{sheep and goats}} can improve active surveillance for scrapie and, if it were circulating, for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). With sizes that allow repetitive testing and a location that is easily accessible at slaughter, retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) are considered suitable organs for testing. Western blotting (WB) of brain homogenates is, in principle, a technique well suited to both detect and discriminate between scrapie and BSE. In this report, WB is developed for rapid diagnosis in RLN and to study biochemical characteristics of PrP res. Results Optimal PrP <b>res</b> <b>detection</b> in RLN by WB was achieved by proper tissue processing, antibody choice and inclusion of a step for PrP res concentration. The analyses were performed on three different sheep sources. Firstly, in a study with preclinical scrapie cases, WB of RLN from infected sheep of VRQ/VRQ genotype – VRQ represents, respectively, polymorphic PrP amino acids 136, 154, and 171 – allowed a diagnosis 14 mo earlier compared to WB of brain stem. Secondly, samples collected from sheep with confirmed scrapie {{in the course of}} passive and active surveillance programmes in the period 2002 – 2003 yielded positive results depending on genotype: all sheep with genotypes ARH/VRQ, VRQ/VRQ, and ARQ/VRQ scored positive for PrP res, but ARQ/ARQ and ARR/VRQ were not all positive. Thirdly, in an experimental BSE study, <b>detection</b> of PrP <b>res</b> in all 11 ARQ/ARQ sheep, including 7 preclinical cases, was possible. In all instances, WB and IHC were almost as sensitive. Moreover, BSE infection could be discriminated from scrapie infection by faster electrophoretic migration of the PrP res bands. Using dual antibody staining with selected monoclonal antibodies like 12 B 2 and L 42, these differences in migration could be employed for an unequivocal differentiation between BSE and scrapie. With respect to glycosylation of PrP res, BSE cases exhibited a greater diglycosylated fraction than scrapie cases. Furthermore, a slight time dependent increase of diglycosylated PrP res was noted between individual sheep, which was remarkable in that it occurred in both scrapie and BSE study. Conclusion The present data indicate that, used in conjunction with testing in brain, WB of RLN can be a sensitive tool for improving surveillance of scrapie and BSE, allowing early detection of BSE and scrapie and thereby ensuring safer sheep and goat products. </p...|$|R

Previous studies have compared Ga- 68 -DOTATATE and Ga- 68 -DOTATOC in comparison to FDG PET/CT in patients with AC and TC [19, 23, 24]. In these studies, the main purpose was to look at the different rates of somatostatin receptor expression in TC and AC. We also looked at the degree of somatostatin receptor expression in TC and AC. Our findings, however, are contradictory to the previously reported results [19, 23, 24]. In our analysis, TC lesions were found to have a significantly lower tumor SUVmax and SUVratio than AC lesions (Fig.  2) whereas the previously published studies reported significantly higher SUVmax in TC as compared to AC [19, 23, 25]. This difference could be primarily due to the difference in the patient populations. While in our analysis, most of the patients (22 / 27; 81.5  %) underwent SR PET/CT for restaging after primary tumor resection, in the study from Kayani et al.

Furthermore, the ratio of TC (44  %) vs. AC (56  %) in our population is quite different in comparison to Kayani’s group [19] with 72  % TC (N[*]=[*] 11) vs. 11  % AC (N[*]=[*] 2) or Venkitaraman et al. [23] (TC[*]=[*] 81  %, N[*]=[*] 21 vs. AC 19  %, N[*]=[*] 5). In their analyses of SUV in TC and higher grade LNET, Kayani et al. [19] categorized SCLC and NSCLC with NET differentiation in one group and LCNEC together with AC into another group of NEN which is not in accordance with the WHO classification [4] and is also distinct from the classification suggested by Rindi et al. [14]. Rindi et al. [14] included information on findings by SR scintigraphy in three patients with TC and five patients with AC and found a higher incidence of negative scintigrams in TC as compared to AC (33  % vs. 20  %). Thus, our findings, based on a larger patient population, confirm these initial results by Rindi et al. showing that somatostatin receptor expression is also a valuable biomarker for tumor <b>detection</b> and (<b>re)</b> staging in patients with intermediate grade AC tumors.|$|R
40|$|Background Cancer, {{the disease}} of intricateness, has {{remained}} beyond our complete perception so far. Network systems biology (termed NSB) {{is one of}} the most recent approaches to understand the unsolved problems of cancer development. From this perspective, differential protein networks (PINs) have been developed based on the expression and interaction data of brain, cervix, lung, ovary and prostate for normal and cancer conditions. Methods Differential expression database GeneHub-GEPIS and interaction database STRING were applied for primary data retrieval. Cytoscape platform and related plugins named network analyzer; MCODE and ModuLand were used for visualization of complex networks and subsequent analysis. Results Significant differences were observedamong different common network parameters between normal and cancer states. Moreover, molecular complex numbers and overlapping modularization found to be varying significantly between normal and cancerous tissues. The number of the ranked molecular complex and the nodes involved in the overlapping modules were meaningfully higher in cancer condition. We identified 79 commonly up regulated and 6 down regulated proteins in all five tissues. Number of nodes, edges; multi edge node pair, and average number of neighbor are found with significant fluctuations in case of cervix and ovarian tissues. Cluster analysis showed that the association of Myc and Cdk 4 proteins is very close with other proteins within the network. Cervix and ovarian tissue showed higher increment of the molecular complex number and overlapping module network during cancer in comparison to normal state. Conclusions The differential molecular signatures identified from the work can be studied further to understand the cancer signaling process, and potential therapeutic and <b>detection</b> approach.

40|$|Abstract. This paper evaluates annual re {{maps that}} were {{produced}} from NOAA- 14 /AVHRR imagery using an algorithm {{described in a}} companion paper (Li et al., International Journal of Remote Sensing, 21, 3057 – 3069, 2000 (this issue)). Burned area masks covering the Canadian boreal forest were created by composit-ing the daily maps of re hot spots over the summer and by examining Normalized DiŒerence Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes after burning. Both masks were compared with re polygons derived by Canadian re agencies through aerial surveillance. It {{was found that the}} majority of re events were captured by the satellite-based techniques,but burnt area was generally underestimated. The burn boundary formed by the re pixels detected by satellite were in good agreement with the polygons boundarieswithin which, however, there were some res missed by the satellite. The presence of clouds and low sampling frequency of satellite observation are the two major causes for the underestimation. While this problem is alleviated by taking advantage of NDVI changes, a simple combination of a hot spot technique with a NDVI method is not an ideal solution due to the introduction of new sources of uncertainty. In addition, the performance of the algorithm used in the International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme (IGBP) Data and Information System (IGBP-DIS) for global <b>re</b> <b>detection</b> was evaluated by comparing its results with ours and with the re agency reports. It was found that the IGBP-DIS algorithm is capable of detecting the majority of res over the boreal forest, but also includes many false res over old burned scars created by res taking place in previous years. A step-by-step comparison between the two algorithms revealed the causes of the problem and recommendations are made to rectify them. 1...|$|R

The experiments involved time-resolved <b>RE</b> <b>detection</b> of the OH (A(2) Sigma(+) -> X- 2 Pi transition at lambda = 308 nm) radicals following FP of H 2 O/C 2 H 5 I/He, H 2 O/n-C 3 H 7 I/He, and H 2 O/iso-C 3 H 7 I/He mixtures. The OH(X- 2 Pi) radicals were produced by FP of H 2 O in vacuum-UV at wavelengths lambda > 120 nm. Decays of OH radicals in the presence of C 2 H 5 I, n-C 3 H 7 I, and iso-C 3 H 7 I were observed to be exponential, and the decay rates were found to be linearly dependent on the C 2 H 5 I, n-C 3 H 7 I, and iso-C 3 H 7 I concentrations. The results are described by the following Arrhenius expressions (units of cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1)) : k(1) (297 - 372 K) = (5. 55 +/- 3. 20) x 10 (- 12) exp[-(830 +/- 90) K/T], k(2) (300 - 370 K) = (1. 65 +/- 0. 90) x 10 (- 11) exp[-(780 +/- 90) K/T] and k(3) (299 - 369 K) = (7. 58 +/- 3. 70) x 10 (- 12) exp[-(530 +/- 80) K/T].

40|$|A {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (WSN) is comprised {{of a few hundred}} or thousand au-tonomous sensor nodes spatially distributed over a particular region. Each sensornode is equipped with a wireless communication device, a small microprocessor, anda battery-powered energy source. Typically, the applications of WSNs such as habitatmonitoring, <b>re</b> <b>detection,</b> and military surveillance, require data collection, process-ing, and transmission among the sensor nodes. Due to their energy constraints andhostile environments, the main challenge in the research of WSN lies in prolongingthe lifetime of WSNs. In this dissertation, we present four dierent topology management protocols forK-coverage and load balancing to prolong the lifetime of WSNs. First, we present a Randomly Ordered Activation and Layering (ROAL) protocolfor K-coverage in a stationary WSN. The ROAL suggests a new model of layer cov-erage that can construct a K-covered WSN using the layer information received fromits previously activated nodes in the sensing distance. Second, we enhance the faulttolerance of layer coverage through a Circulation-ROAL (C-ROAL) protocol. Us-ing the layer number, the C-ROAL can activate each node in a round-robin fashionduring a predened period while conserving reconguration energy. Next, MobilityResilient Coverage Control (MRCC) is presented to assure K-coverage in the presence of mobility, in which a more practical and reliable model for K-coverage with nodalmobility is introduced. Finally, we present a Multiple-Connected Dominating Set(MCDS) protocol that can balance the network trac using an on-demand routingprotocol. The MCDS protocol constructs and manages multiple backbone networks,each of which is constructed with a connected dominating set (CDS) to ensure a con-nected backbone network. We describe each protocol, and compare the performanceof our protocols with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and/or existing K-coveragealgorithms through extensive simulations. The simulation results obtained by the ROAL protocol show that K-coverage canbe guaranteed with more than 95 % coverage ratio, and signicantly extend networklifetime against a given WSN. We also observe that the C-ROAL protocol provides abetter reconguration method, which consumes only less than 1 % of the recongura-tion energy in the ROAL protocol, with a greatly reduced packet latency. The MRCCprotocol, considering the mobility, achieves better coverage by 1. 4 % with 22 % feweractive sensors than that of an existing coverage protocol for the mobility. The resultson the MCDS protocol show that the energy depletion ratio of nodes is decreasedconsequently, while the network throughput is improved by 35 %...|$|R
40|$|Motivation. Finding {{relevant}} {{scientific literature}} {{is one of}} the essential tasks researchers are facing on a daily basis. Digital libraries and web information retrieval techniques provide rapid access to a vast amount of scientific literature. However, no further automated support is available that would enable fine-grained access to the knowledge ‘stored’ in these documents. The emerging domain of Semantic Publishing aims at making scientific knowledge accessible to both humans and machines, by adding semantic annotations to content, such as a publication’s contributions, methods, or application domains. However, despite the promises of better knowledge access, the manual annotation of existing research literature is prohibitively expensive for wide-spread adoption. We argue that a novel combination of three distinct methods can significantly advance this vision in a fully-automated way: (i) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Rhetorical Entity (RE) detection; (ii) Named Entity (NE) recognition based on the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud; and (iii) automatic knowledge base construction for both NEs and REs using semantic web ontologies that interconnect entities in documents with the machine-readable LOD cloud. Results. We present a complete workflow to transform scientific literature into a semantic knowledge base, based on the W 3 C standards RDF and RDFS. A text mining pipeline, implemented based on the GATE framework, automatically extracts rhetorical entities of type Claims and Contributions from full-text scientific literature. These REs are further enriched with named entities, represented as URIs to the linked open data cloud, by integrating the DBpedia Spotlight tool into our workflow. Text mining results are stored in a knowledge base through a flexible export process that provides for a dynamic mapping of semantic annotations to LOD vocabularies through rules stored in the knowledge base. We created a gold standard corpus from computer science conference proceedings and journal articles, where Claim and Contribution sentences are manually annotated with their respective types using LOD URIs. The performance of the <b>RE</b> <b>detection</b> phase is evaluated against this corpus, where it achieves an average F-measure of 0. 73. We further demonstrate a number of semantic queries that show how the generated knowledge base can provide support for numerous use cases in managing scientific literature. Availability.
