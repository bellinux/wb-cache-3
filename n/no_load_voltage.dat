Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{exhibits}} a thermal conductivity {{similar to that}} of the electrically conductive chemical vapor deposition diamond (EC-CVD diamond) found to function as zero-wear electrodes at short pulse duration. In this study, PCD was used as electrodes applied to EDM on tungsten carbide. Two kinds of PCD (CTB- 010 and CTH- 025) with a flat surface were used. The wear of the PCD electrodes was about 1. 5 % for very short pulse duration such as te= 1 µs, but it was zero wear at te= 30 µs, though the wear of a Cu-W electrode was 10 % even on the machine recommended conditions for the low wear.

Under the conditions of a <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> of 60 V, a set peak current of 2 A, and a medium pulse duration of te= 15 µs, there was no wear on PCD electrodes when observed under the SEM, whereas a 50 µm-deep wear on the Cu-W electrodes even under the machine recommended condition for the low wear was observed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a new method 1 developed for equivalent loading for conducting heat run test for measuring full load temperature rise of three phase induction motors. This method {{does not require}} mechanical load, auxiliary machines or identical motor of similar rating. It simulates the running conditions with normally available apparatus avoiding laborious computations. The induction motor is run on <b>no</b> <b>load</b> at rated <b>voltages</b> across two phases with third phase open. The third phase is connected to a variable inductance. The rated load currents in all the phases are obtained by adjusting the third phase external inductance and making a little difference in two voltages. The different components of losses in new method are nearly same as the losses during normal full load operation. Hence the rise above ambient temperature can be determined accurately. The experimental results on heat run tests with new method and with conventional method show an excellent agreement with each other, confirming {{the validity of the}} proposed method.

This paper proposes a digital-signal-processor (DSP) -based <b>load</b> <b>voltage</b> control scheme that requires only information provided by the dc-bus <b>voltage</b> sensor. <b>Load</b> <b>voltage</b> estimation is based on ac line voltage reconstruction by means of a recursive least-square error algorithm that uses the information available on the dc bus and knowledge of the pulsewidth modulation gating pattern. Thus, the system minimizes the transducer count and, therefore, enhances reliability and ruggedness.
