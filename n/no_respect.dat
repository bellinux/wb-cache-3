5|$|Cersei Lannister {{meets with}} Tommen Baratheon, who {{brings up the}} High Sparrow. Tommen is {{reluctant}} to provoke him, but Cersei says he is dangerous because he has <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for the Crown. Tommen tells Cersei that Margaery's walk of atonement will happen soon. Cersei relays the information to Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell in the Small Council chamber. Tyrell is horrified and pledges her army to defeat the Sparrows. Kevan has been ordered not to attack by Tommen, but agrees to stand down his army after Cersei says that by destroying the Sparrows he can have back his son Lancel, who {{is part of the}} order, and that Tommen will forgive him when he has Margaery back.|$|E
5|$|Swan had <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for Heath and was {{not afraid}} to show it, and so Heath kept Swan's {{appearances}} to a minimum in 1996–97. He offered loan moves to Third Division Hartlepool United and Hereford United, offers which Swan dismissed out of hand, and so Heath placed him on the transfer list. The transfer took until August 1997, at which point {{he moved on to}} Bury for a fee of £50,000 – this reunited him with manager Stan Ternent. The move had been delayed after Heath left Burnley to be replaced by Chris Waddle, though Waddle quickly sanctioned the transfer. Ternent moved Swan back to his role as a striker, despite the player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs. He scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen-game goal drought. He helped the club to narrowly avoid relegation {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|The NBA All-Rookie Team is {{an annual}} National Basketball Association (NBA) honor given since the 1962–63 NBA season {{to the top}} rookies during the regular season. Voting is {{conducted}} by the NBA head coaches; who {{are not allowed to}} vote for players on their own team. The All-Rookie Team is generally composed of two five-man lineups, a first team and a second team. The players each receive two points for each first team vote and one point for each second team vote. The top five players with the highest point total make the first team, with the next five making the second team. In the case of a tie at the fifth position of either team, the roster is expanded. If the first team consists of six players due to a tie, the second team will still consist of five players with the potential for more expansion in the event of additional ties. Ties have occurred several times, most recently in 2012, when Kawhi Leonard, Iman Shumpert, and Brandon Knight tied in votes received. <b>No</b> <b>respect</b> is given to positions. For example, the first team had four forwards, and one guard in 2008, while the first team had four centers (two of which were forward-centers) and one guard in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process which he calls the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

25|$|Although the Army of Tennessee {{had about}} 52,000 {{men at the}} end of July, the Confederate {{government}} merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, into Bragg's Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg's army, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the Knoxville area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg's command who had little or <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for him. Buckner's attitude was colored by Bragg's unsuccessful invasion of Buckner's native Kentucky in 1862, {{as well as by the}} loss of his command through the merger. A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee's request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill, a general who had not gotten along with Robert E.

25|$|Early in 1854 she {{was offered}} the title role in a new opera by Charles Gounod, La nonne sanglante, but {{declined}} it. The role was instead offered to Palmyre Wertheimber, a new singer from the Opéra-Comique who had made her debut at the Opéra as Fidès in Le prophète and was much admired and praised by Théophile Gautier. Cruvelli, meanwhile, returned to London for engagements at Covent Garden, where she sang Desdemona in Rossini's Otello (with Antonio Tamburini and Giorgio Ronconi), Leonore (in Fidelio) and Donna Anna (Don Giovanni). Chorley, who never admired her, called it 'an inroad, the result of which in <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> bore out her popularity in the Haymarket.' She {{then went back to}} Paris to sing Alice in Robert le diable, and through that summer and autumn was the reigning goddess at the Opéra. She was required to sing only two nights a week and was receiving a very substantial fee for each performance. By autumn, rehearsals were under way for a new Verdi opera written specially for her, Les vêpres Siciliennes. Her performance of Les Huguenots , scheduled for the beginning of October 1854, was eagerly awaited.|$|E

A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee's request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill, a general who did not get along with Robert E. Lee in Virginia. The Confederate War Department asked Bragg in early August if he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements from Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. He was also concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside that was threatening Knoxville. Bragg withdrew his forces from advanced positions around Bridgeport, which left Rosecrans free to maneuver on the northern side of the Tennessee River. He concentrated his two infantry corps around Chattanooga and relied upon cavalry to cover his flanks, extending from northern Alabama to near Knoxville.|$|E

500|$|Writer Jon Spaihts created David as a {{shipboard}} android in {{the first}} draft of his screenplay for the prequel Alien: Engineers, as an exploration of the theme of creations and being in the presence of one's makers. Just as the humans aboard the Prometheus look to discover the secrets of their creators, the Engineers, David is already in the presence of his creators. Unlike his companions and android successors, David would be disillusioned by his creators and look to fashion himself into an entity defying their nature. Scott was in favor of the concept and urged writer Damon Lindelof to pursue it further while rewriting the script that would be adapted as Prometheus. Though David would perceive the concept of the Prometheus expedition to be frivolous, due to his disappointment in his creators, he would nonetheless be fascinated by the notion of creation. Therefore, the character's treacherous actions in the films, such as infecting the archaeologist Charlie Holloway with an alien mutagen, would be from a desire to create a new evolutionary generation of his own. Shortly after the release of Alien: Covenant, Scott explained that as David learns more about his lineage through humanity and the Engineers, [...] "He hates them. He has <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for Engineers and <b>no</b> <b>respect</b> for human beings," [...] and concludes that eradicating them from existence will be for the betterment of the universe.|$|E
