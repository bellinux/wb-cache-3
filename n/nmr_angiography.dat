40|$|The {{staging of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer still represents {{a challenge for}} surgeons involved in this field; radiological diagnostic methods used routinely (CT, <b>NMR,</b> <b>angiography)</b> may under-estimate this neoplasm; in fact, the presence of peritoneal or subglissonian hepatic micrometastasis (< 2 cm) is a frequent surprise at laparotomy and force the surgeon to undertake a palliative procedure. This policy need not be followed because {{it is possible to}} perform non-surgical palliation of jaundice or pain respectively by percutaneous radiological stent insertion and coeliac alcoholisation. Pre-operative staging thus acquires {{an important role in the}} correct treatment, surgical or medical. Laparoscopy allows us to overcome the understaging of the more common diagnostic methods and view directly the coelomatic space and the surface of the abdominal viscera; moreover during this procedure it is possible to perform a peritoneal wash to obtain other information on the cancer stage. We judged 56 patients by radiological diagnosis; 31 were excluded from surgery by laparoscopy; 10 of the other 25 cases were submitted to radical resection. The resectability operative rate was 40 %, compared with 18 % if we had submitted patients to surgery. Several patients underwent peritoneal wash, always with negative results; all were submitted to surgery and radically resected. In our opinion, laparoscopy and peritoneal wash represent useful tools in the staging of patients affected with pancreatic cancer...|$|E

Actually this policy has not to be followed because the possibility to perform non-surgical palliation of jaundice or pain respectively by percutaneous radiological stent insertion and celiac alcoholization. In this viewpoint, preoperative staging has acquired an important role for a correct treatment, be it surgical or medical. Laparoscopy allows it to overcome the understaging produced by the more common diagnostic means, with the possibility to view directly the celomatic space and {{the surface of the}} abdominal viscera; moreover, during this procedure it is possible to perform a peritoneal washing to obtain other information about the cancer stage. In our experience, 56 patients were judged as resectable by radiologic methods; 31 were excluded from surgery by laparoscopy; 10 of the remaining 25 cases were submitted to radical resection. The operative resectability rate resulted in 40 %, against 18 % in cases where we submitted to surgery all the patients. Seven patients underwent peritoneal washing, always with a negative result; all were submitted to surgery and radically resected.

40|$|Sarcomas of {{the soft}} tissue {{constitute}} a fairly rare group of neoplasms localized mainly {{at the level of}} the extremities, Apart from clinical and semeiotic investigations, diagnosis is based on imaging techniques, Among these (ultrasound, CT, <b>NMR</b> and <b>angiography),</b> all of which are helpful in diagnosis, NMR seems to provide the most complete data and sensitivity and specificity. In fact, it has greater specificity than ultrasound or CT as regards identification of any infiltration of the muscle or deep interstitial tissues and can also contribute information on the nature of the sarcoma, as it provides high definition of the structural composition of the tissues, Angiography remains important as a preoperative guide to the surgical approach, Surgery is the treatment of choice, although in recent years it has been integrated with radio or chemotherapy, Thanks to the progress in treatment constituted by combination treatments there has been a dramatic reduction in the need for amputations, compartmental excision and disinsertion of muscle groups. We report the case of a patient with fibrosarcoma of the thigh and discuss the various imaging techniques and different approaches to the treatment of these neoplasms...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBalloon {{dilation}} {{is effective}} in the immediate relief of obstruction due to unoperated coarctation of the aorta. However, the long-term benefits and complications of this procedure have not been established. Thirty-three patients underwant balloon dilation of unoperated coarctation using a percutaneous technique from November 1983 to December 1985. High quality biplane angiography was performed before and after dilation. Follow-up was obtained in 20 patients from 6 to 31 months following dilation. Angiography was performed at follow-up in 10, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging in 10 and both <b>NMR</b> imaging and <b>angiography</b> in 3. Balloon dilation was successful in 31 of the 33 patients with a decrease in average systolic pressure gradient from 46 to 8 mm Hg. There was no significant change in gradient on follow-up physical examination and at recatheterization in 10 patients. In addition, there was no evidene of restenosis on follow-up <b>angiography</b> and <b>NMR</b> imaging. In two patients, a small aneurysm formed {{at the site of}} balloon dilation. Balloon dilation of unoperated coarctation is effective, providing lasting relief of coarctation gradient and no evidence of restenosis. However, because of the uncertain natural history of aneurysms after dilation, this procedure should be considered investigational until further follow-up on patients with and without an aneurysm is available...|$|R
