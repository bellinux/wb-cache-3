40|$|A {{survey on}} the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on {{dangerous}} preparations by companies to Poisons Information Centres shows that each EU Member State has made different arrangements. This {{is the result}} of missing guidelines in the Preparations Directive 1999 / 45 /EC. The implementation of the 'Globally Harmonised System of classification and labelling of chemicals' (GHS) in the EU will replace the Preparations Directive. This is a good opportunity to harmonize product notification at an EU level and have it legally enforced. The notified product information is used for medical purposes, particularly to provide information on poisonings with these preparations. This report shows that in six countries the Poisons Information Centre (PIC) directly receives the information on the dangerous preparations. In most other countries, a governmental authority is appointed that makes the information available to the PICs. Between EU Member States different requirements are set concerning the notification of the composition of the product and the concentrations of the ingredients. There are also different procedures for notification and a considerable variety in used forms and/or applications for electronic notification. Harmonisation of product notification can be achieved if the receiving authorities first reach consensus on the required product information. Next, an agreement on an acceptable format for notification must be reached...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} architectural model and a reference implementation for push systems. Push systems reverse the pull-based communication paradigm on the world-wide web {{and in most}} other distributed systems to support easier information dissemination and discovery for users. The pull model requires the user to issue a request whenever information is needed, whereas push systems support asynchronous information distribution: Whenever information of the user's choice becomes available, it gets distributed. In the push communication model, an information producer announces the availability of certain types of information, an interested consumer subscribes to this information, and the producer periodically publishes the information (pushes it to the consumer). This simplifies the discovery of information and provides timely information dissemination but introduces complex problems that challenge the widespread deployment of push systems: scalability to large numbers of users in terms of network bandwidth, timely <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> availability, authenticity and integrity of information, and support for payment methods and business models. Current systems fall short in addressing these issues. Most available push systems actually use a pull-based distribution approach where clients check for new information at configurable intervals; frequently scalability is limited, many systems lack services to provide information authenticity and integrity, and moreover, the important issue of payment models is not adequately addressed by any existing system...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Korea’s fair disclosure regulation on the timeliness and informativeness of earnings announcements. The present regulation for Korean listed firms requires that if a company’s sales revenue, operating income (or loss) and net income (or loss) have changed by over 30 % compared to the prior year, the firm must disclose this information through a preliminary financial report (PFR) even before the company is audited by external auditors. To analyze {{the effects of this}} policy, we first investigate the timeliness of preliminary financial report disclosures. We examine the extent to which Korean listed companies actually comply with the requirement for prompt <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> concerning material changes in financial performance. Second, we investigate the informativeness of preliminary financial reports by analyzing differential stock market reactions to different timings of preliminary financial report disclosures. Our empirical results reveal {{that more than half of}} our sample firms release their preliminary financial reports after external audits are completed, thereby potentially invalidating the effectiveness of the regulation. In addition, we find that preliminary financial reports have information value only if they are disclosed prior to annual audit report dates. This finding supports the notion that timeliness increases the informativeness of preliminary financial report disclosure by curbing insiders’ ability to potentially profit from their information advantage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> system for oral clefts in the live births declaration (DNV), studying the 3 items of DNV related to malformation. All the patients' medical records registered in oral cleft reference centers were checked. The inclusion criteria were: a) to have any oral cleft and b) to be born from 01 / 01 / 1999 to 12 / 31 / 2004. Next step was to raise the information in the vital data sector of Municipal Health Secretary, where all the DNVs identified were subjects with oral clefts (63 children). The first item presented a large subnotification (only 53. 3 of the DNVs showed the register of malformation) and all types of clefts were not notified in any scale. Highest sub notification was observed for cleft palate (70 %). Second item (description of malformation) showed similarly a high number of errors referred to palate cleft, identified only in 25 % of the cases. All the documents showed no information about the third item (code of malformation). There was no statistical difference between professionals responsible for filling out the document. In conclusion, the DNV was inefficient to register the oral cleft cases due to imperfections related to 3 items studied, especially in the absence of information about CID- 10 codes...|$|E

40|$|With the {{exponential}} increase <b>of</b> <b>information</b> on the web, {{the emphasis}} {{has shifted from}} mere viewing <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to efficient retrieval and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> selective <b>information.</b> Currently, users have to poll the pages manually to check for changes of interest, resulting in waste of resources and associated high cost.

WebVigiL, a general-purpose, active capability-based information monitoring and notification system, handles specification, management, and propagation of customized changes as requested by a user. The emphasis of change detection in WebVigiL is to detect customized changes on the document, based on user intent. In this paper, we propose two different algorithms to handle change detection to contents of semi-structured and unstructured documents. Though the approach taken is general, we will explain the change detection {{in the context of}} HTML (unstructured) and XML (semi-structured) documents. We also provide a simple change presentation scheme to display the changes computed. We highlight the change detection in the context of WebVigiL and briefly describe the rest of the system...|$|R

In this study, we demonstrate the facile fabrication of a Stretchable Acoustic Device (SAD) using liquid metal coil of Galinstan where the SAD is operated by the electromagnetic interaction between the liquid metal coil and a Neodymium (Nd) magnet. To fabricate a liquid metal coil, Galinstan was injected into a micro-patterned elastomer channel. This fabricated SAD was operated simultaneously as a loudspeaker and a microphone. Measurements of the frequency response confirmed that the SAD was mechanically stable under both 50 % uniaxial and 30 % biaxial strains. Furthermore, 2000 repetitive applications of a 50 % uniaxial strain did not induce any noticeable degradation of the sound pressure. Both voice and the beeping sound of an alarm clock were successfully recorded and played back through our SAD while it {{was attached to the}} wrist under repeated deformation. These results demonstrate the high potential of the fabricated SAD using Galinstan voice coil in various research fields including stretchable, wearable, and bio-implantable acoustic devices.

40|$|Changes in {{accounting}} and financial reporting are inevitable (Hall & Aldridge, 2007). Hall and Aldridge (2007) stated that this happens because in preparing periodic financial statements, companies must take estimates and judgements to allocate costs and revenues. Accounting disclosure especially <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> {{on a business}} unit has become a widely studied area in the West (Benston, 1973). The issue of accounting change has been subject to considerable research attention during the 1990 s. The main interest has been directed at exploring changes in: accounting systems, accounting techniques, the accountancy profession, {{and the role of}} an accountant (for general references to such work, see Chua (1995) and Bhimani (1996)). In Malaysia, the accounting disclosure has yet to be studied vigorously (Hamzah, 1983). This however, does not mean that this issue is unimportant, and lately a lot of researchers have been researching on the report of extraordinary item (Shamsul & Nor Izah, 2000), cash flow statement (Ng, 1999), empirical studies on accounting and disclosure (Ng, 1998), uses of financial report (Azhar, 1999) and information that are needed by consumer and voluntary disclosures by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), currently name as Bursa Malaysia listed companies (Tan et al., 1990). Disclosure is a means whereby information regarding a business unit can be conveyed. Based on this information, interested parties and potential investors will be informed of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a particular business unit, in terms of profits made, and/or whether the management of the business unit act in a manner which can be of benefit to the potential investors (Hamzah, 1983). Consistency in the accounting policy as stated in the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) 1 is one of the accounting doctrine, which is the basis of financial planning and presentation. Users should be able to compare and differentiate every company financial statement for a period of time to identify financial position flow, performance, and cash flow. For that matter, the same accounting policy will be used for an accounting period. Changes in the accounting policy need to be done if directed by the law or the MASB, or if the change will give a more accurate result for presenting a situation or transaction in a company’s financial statement (MASB 3). This study is a preliminary study on the accounting disclosure by listed companies on the main board of the KLSE based on their annual financial report. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of accounting change. Section three discusses research methodology, followed by research findings. The paper ends with a conclusion and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the {{financial}} crisis central banks experienced a situation where standard monetary measures failed to create stability and restore growth to {{the financial}} markets and the overall economy. Therefore new response methods where introduced. One of the key responses was to extend longer maturity loans through auctions supported by {{a wider range of}} collateral (The Term Auction Facility or TAF program). In the aftermath of the crisis in financial markets the effect of this monetary measure has been widely discussed. A key topic of interest is how it affected the term structure of interbank interest rates and whether it restored access to liquidity for financial institutions. In this thesis we develop and apply three statistical tests to study if the TAF had the intended effect on US interbank rates, and whether or not spillover effects to other markets have been seen as well. First we compute the frequency of a directional move following term auctions, and compare this with the frequency in the overall financial crisis. Then we compute the expected size in such a move following auction dates, and compare expected sizes in such moves during the rest of {{the financial crisis}}. Third we use an event study to look for abnormal movements following auction dates. Here we estimate an affine term structure model driven by a vector autoregressive model with the credit premium, liquidity premium and short rate as driving factors in an affine term structure model. The thesis has four major findings; First, we find that the probability of drops in interbank interest rates and spreads tended to be more likely and larger in size following the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> regarding the results of TAF-auctions. Second, the Term Auction Facility caused international spillover effects which varied from market to market. Specifically we found that unsecured loans with more than 5 months to maturity became less expensive compared to unsecured loans with less than 5 months to maturity. These results were found in the UK and EU, and were highly significant. The same results indicate that interest rate levels tended to fall, but these results were not significant. Third, interest rates on loans with more than 4 months to maturity dropped more than what could be expected, even when credit and liquidity factors could be perfectly predicted. This suggests that the results from TAF-auctions went a long way in reducing premiums on unsecured loans in the interbank marked with longer maturities (5 - 12 months). Last, the Term Auction Facility seem to have pulled down premiums on credit and liquidity beyond what could be expected following the notification of results from the TAF auctions. These effects were seen to spill over to the settlement day as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. World wide web {{has gained}} a lot of {{prominence}} with respect to in-formation retrieval and data delivery. With such a prolific growth, a user inter-ested in a specific change has to continuously retrieve/pull information from the web and analyze it. This results in wastage of resources and more importantly the burden is on the user. Pull-based retrieval needs to be replaced with a push-based paradigm for efficiency and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> relevant <b>information</b> in a timely manner. WebVigiL is an efficient profile-based system to monitor, re-trieve, detect and notify specific changes to HTML and XML pages on the web. In this paper, we describe the expressive profile specification language along with its semantics. We also present an efficient implementation of these pro-files. Finally, we present the overall architecture of the WebVigiL system and its implementation status. ...|$|R

In this proposed scheme, spectrum components which experienced higher channel gain in the source to relay link are allocated to higher discrete frequencies in the relay to destination link, and the spectrum is shaped based on a water-filling theorem at the source and the relay nodes locally. Numerical analysis shows that this PA scheme achieves almost the same perfor-mance with joint optimal scheme with lower signal processing burden due to its CSI-notification-free feature. ...|$|R

To achieve this goal, we thoroughly analyzed existing Location-Based Services (LBS), reviewed LBS designs’ pitfalls and identified several key privacy requirements. Based on this research, we presented a SIP flow that meets the privacy requirements. This SIP message flow includes SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY and PUBLISH messages. A data format to carry geographic location information has also been introduced. The data format is based on Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). We define it as Location-enhanced PIDF, or LPIDF. LPIDF contains geographical information objects. We hope that the outcome of this research project will provide rich, convenient, privacy concerned architecture for LBS. Because LPIDF is based on SIP, this approach can be easily integrated into IP telephony services.
