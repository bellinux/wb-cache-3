6000|$|... "It is true, then," [...] {{he said to}} Father Roger <b>Necton,</b> the old clergyman of Cranwell, whom he had summoned {{from the}} vicarage. [...] "I thought that fool of a {{messenger}} must be drunk. What can have chanced, Father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That man of blood, Sir Christopher Harflete, who {{has caused}} {{us so much}} loss," [...] said the old monk who had been bidden to perform the office, as the clergyman, Father <b>Necton,</b> had gone also, fearing the vengeance of the Abbot {{for his part in}} the {{marriage}} of Cicely. [...] "A sad story, a very sad story. Wedded by night, and now buried by night, both of them, one in the flame and one in the earth. Truly, O God, Thy judgments are wonderful, and woe to those who lift hands against Thine anointed ministers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is not true," [...] said Emlyn in her bold voice. [...] "Am I who suckled you no friend, and is Father <b>Necton</b> here no friend, and is Sir Christopher no friend? Well, if {{you have}} lost your judgment, I have kept mine, and here it is. Yonder, not two bowshots away, stands a church, and before me I see a priest and a pair who would serve for bride and bridegroom. Also we can rake up {{witnesses}} {{and a cup of}} wine to drink your health; and after that let the Abbot of Blossholme do his worst. What say you, Sir Christopher?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So the white-haired {{and gentle}} Father <b>Necton,</b> having first read the King's order {{releasing}} Thomas from his vows, tied them fast {{according to the}} ancient rites and blessed them both. At length it was finished, and the pair walked from the old church to the Manor Farm, where they were to dwell, followed, as was the custom, by a company of their friends and well-wishers. As they went they passed through a little stretch of woodland by the stream, where on this spring day the wild daffodils and lilies of the valley were abloom making sweet the air. Here Emlyn paused a moment and said to her husband, Captain Bolle-- ...|$|E
60|$|By {{now they}} were across the moat and at {{the steps of the}} house, so, without answering, Christopher lifted her tenderly from the saddle, {{pressing}} her to his breast as he did so, for that seemed his best answer. A groom came to lead away the horses, touching his bonnet, and staring at them curiously; and, leaning on her lover's shoulder, Cicely passed through the arched doorway of Cranwell Towers into the hall, where a great fire burned. Before this fire, warming his thin hands, stood Father <b>Necton,</b> engaged in eager conversation with Emlyn Stower. As the pair advanced this talk ceased, evidently because it was of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It has an over-seas {{look about}} it," [...] murmured Cicely, as with eager, {{trembling}} fingers she cut the stitches. At length they were undone and a sealed inner wrapping also, revealing, amongst other documents, a little packet of parchments covered with crabbed, unreadable writing, {{on the back}} of which, however, they could decipher the names of Shefton and Blossholme by reason of the larger letters in which they were engrossed. Also there was a writing in the scrawling hand of Sir John Foterell, and at the foot of it his name and, amongst others, those of Father <b>Necton</b> and of Jeffrey Stokes. Cicely stared at the deeds, then said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Father <b>Necton</b> blew on {{his little}} book till the ink was dry, then hid {{it away in}} his robe. The old clerk, having {{pocketed}} a handsome fee from Christopher, lit the pair down the nave to the porch, where he locked the oaken door behind them, extinguished his lantern and trudged off through the snow to the ale-house, there to discuss these nuptials and hot beer. Escorted by their torch-bearers Cicely and Christopher walked silently arm-in-arm back to the Towers, whither Emlyn, after embracing the bride, had already gone on ahead. So having added one more ceremony to its countless record, perhaps the strangest of them all, the ancient church behind them grew silent as the dead within its graves.|$|E
60|$|The monks being gone Father Roger <b>Necton,</b> the old vicar of Cranwell, he who had united Christopher and {{his wife}} Cicely in strange circumstances, and for that deed been obliged to fly for his life when the last Abbot of Blossholme burned Cranwell Towers, came to tie the knot before his great congregation. Notwithstanding that they were both of middle age, Emlyn in her grand gown and the brawny, red-haired Thomas in his yeoman's garb of green, such as he had worn when he wooed her many years before he put on the monk's russet robe, made a fine and {{handsome}} pair at the altar. Or so folk thought, though some friend of the monks, remembering Bolle's devil's livery and Emlyn's repute as a sorceress, cried out from the shadow that Satan was marrying a witch, and for his pains got his head broken by Jeffrey Stokes.|$|E
6000|$|With {{respect to}} trees, {{the history of}} but few of the many {{varieties}} with curious or ornamental foliage is known; but several probably have originated by bud-variation. Here is one case:--An old ash-tree (Fraxinus excelsior) in the grounds of <b>Necton,</b> as Mr. Mason states, [...] "for many years has had one bough of a totally different character {{to the rest of}} the tree, or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being short-jointed and densely covered with foliage." [...] It was ascertained that this variety could be propagated by grafts. (11/61. W. Mason in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 878.) The varieties of some trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved laburnum, the parsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved beech, are apt to revert by buds to the common forms. (11/62. Alex. Braun 'Ray Soc. Bot. Mem.' 1853 page 315; 'Gardener's Chron.' 1841 page 329.) The fern-like leaves of the beech sometimes revert only partially, and the branches display here and there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like, and variously shaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so- called heterophyllus varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves of various forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have originated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping willow with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters states that a tree of this kind kept true in his garden for twenty-five years, and then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves. (11/63. Dr. M.T. Masters 'Royal Institution Lecture' March 16, 1860.) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{river is}} a {{tributary}} of the Great Ouse, rising at Shipdham, near East Bradenham in Norfolk, and flowing for nearly 31 mi through <b>Necton,</b> North Pickenham, South Pickenham, Great Cressingham, Ickburgh, Northwold and Stoke Ferry before joining the Great Ouse south of Downham Market, specifically in the small parish of Fordham. Its course has altered, as it originally flowed to Wisbech, which derives its name from the river, and historically, it has also been known as the River Stoke or Stoke River. The source, to the north of Shipdham, is close to the 260 ft contour, and is close to the source of the River Yare, which flows in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|Nekton or <b>necton</b> {{refers to}} the {{aggregate}} of actively swimming aquatic organisms in a body of water. The term was proposed by German biologist Ernst Haeckel to differentiate between the active swimmers in a body of water, and the passive organisms that were carried along by the current, the plankton. As a guideline, nektonic organisms have a high Reynolds number (greater than 1000) and planktonic organisms a low one (less than 10). However, some organisms can begin life as plankton and transition to nekton later on in life, sometimes making distinction difficult when attempting to classify certain plankton-to-nekton species as one or the other. For this reason, some biologists choose not to use this term.|$|E
50|$|At <b>Necton</b> in East Anglia {{a tunnel}} {{is said to}} run from the {{restored}} 14th-century church of All Saints to <b>Necton</b> Hall, in possession of the Mason family {{since the time of}} Henry VII.The first of a number of legendary tunnels under Norwich leads from the Castle (TM232085) to the Guildhall (TM231085) near the market-place, erected 1407-13 {{on the site of the}} old tollhouse. It still has a 14th-century vault below it that was the crypt (and prison) of the former building. A second tunnel (in which a pig was once lost) heads from the Castle for Carrow Priory (TM242073 area), a Benedictine nunnery whose scant 12th century remains on the outskirts of Norwich are incorporated into a residence of the Colman family, near the junction of King Street and Bracondale. The third tunnel from the Castle ran to the Norman cathedral to the north-east (TM235089), begun in 1096 by Bishop Herbert de Losinga and finally consecrated in 1101-2. Yet another subterranean way links the Castle with the Crown Derby near the Guildhall.At Norwich Cathedral another tunnel begins, running for about nine miles to the ruins of St Benet's Abbey (TG383157) on the marshes at Ludham. A much shorter one, allegedly used by monks, was said to run from the cathedral to Samson & Hercules House. The Anglia Restaurant in Prince's Street has a splendid groined crypt for a cellar, and two tunnels from here are said to lead to the cathedral and to St. Andrew's Hall. Monks supposedly used a tunnel from the cellars of the Shrub House at the corner of Charing Cross Street to the site of St. Benedict's Gates.|$|E
50|$|In January 2013, a {{commission}} of inquiry published a 90-page report about the events surrounding Mutharika's death.
