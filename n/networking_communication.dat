50|$|SIMNET was {{developed}} by three companies: Delta Graphics, Inc.; Perceptronics, Inc.; and Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), Inc. There was no prime contractor on SIMNET; independent contracts were let directly {{to each of these}} three companies. BBN developed the vehicle simulation and network software, as well as other software such as artillery, resupply, and semi-automated forces often used for opposing forces. Delta Graphics, based in Bellevue, Washington, developed the graphics system and terrain databases. Delta Graphics was eventually bought by BBN. Perceptronics, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the actual SIMNET simulators; the company's engineers, human factors personnel and manufacturing team designed, developed and built over 300 full-crew simulators, integrating the controls, sound systems and visual systems into the special simulator shells; they also installed the simulators in a number of facilities in the US and Germany, trained the operators and supported the system for several years. BBN was responsible for developing the dynamic simulation software for each of the simulators, as well as the distributed <b>networking</b> <b>communication</b> software that kept each simulator informed of the position (and other state information) of other simulators that were within potential line-of-sight within the shared virtual environment. Each simulator maintained its own copy of this virtual environment, and broadcast its own state information to the other simulators.|$|E
5000|$|What {{differentiated}} the NBC chimes {{from these}} earlier identifying sounds, {{at least in}} the beginning, is the use of the NBC chimes for network communications and coordination. Later they would also become a signature sound representing the network, but their primary initial purpose was to help ensure smooth network operations. In 1932, NBC explained that: [...] "The purpose of the chimes... is to synchronize local station identification announcements and to serve as a cue to engineers at relay points {{all over the country to}} switch various branches of the networks on or off as the programs change every 15 minutes." [...] This reflected the organization of the network schedule, which was divided into 15 minute program blocks. In addition, effective May 11, 1927, the Federal Radio Commission's General Order No. 8 specified that each station was [...] "directed to announce its call letters and location... not less than once during each 15 minutes of transmission". The use of the NBC chimes as network switching cues eventually allowed the network to save money on infrastructure costs. Until 1933 it was common practice to run a second line that used telegraphic signalling to provide <b>networking</b> <b>communication.</b> After that date the normal policy was to eliminate this second line and send the networking cues over the program lines.|$|E

30|$|These {{smart city}} {{services}} do not only need the various advanced technologies discussed here, but also need reliable and robust <b>networking</b> and <b>communication</b> infrastructures to enable efficient exchange of messages {{among the different}} components of the systems that provide a particular service. Smart city services are designed at different scales, which require various <b>networking</b> and <b>communication</b> technologies for their implementation and operations. Furthermore, different network and communication models and approaches can be utilized for smart city services. This paper investigates the communication and network issues of smart city systems. It also investigates networking technologies, architectures, and communication requirements for such systems. The suitability of existing network protocols for different smart city services will be discussed. Although there are significant research efforts to investigate different issues in smart cities and provide solutions for these issues, very {{little research has been}} done to investigate the <b>networking</b> and <b>communication</b> parts of smart city systems, which constitute the main objective of this paper.|$|R
