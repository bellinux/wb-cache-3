5000|$|The semi-final {{was held}} {{internally}} by NTU to select 15 entries {{to compete in}} the final. After the semi-final, it was reported that the performer Anastasiya Prykhodko and her manager claimed that neither the National Television Company of Ukraine (NTCU) nor the National Jury had used trustworthy methods to choose the contestants for the final. Prykhodko's interpretation of the rules was that in the semi-final, she had been entitled to perform something different from their Eurovision entry song. In fact, Paragraph 4.3 of the Rules of Eurovision Song Competition issued by the NCTU on 31 October 2008 stated literally:"On 8 February 2009 on the improvised stage set in the NTVU studios, the 30 semi-finalists perform their competition songs live." [...] On the grounds of the paragraph, the Jury disqualified Pryhodko for performing a song from her repertoire of the times of the Star Factory TV show called [...] "Vsyo dlya tebya". The national final, to be held on 8 March, was temporarily suspended by a <b>national</b> <b>arbitration</b> <b>committee</b> due to the protest filed by Prykhodko. However, the national final went ahead on 8 March at the Ukraina Palace in Kiev, where the winner was decided by a 50/50 mix of jury vote and public televote.

Ten members of the <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Committee</b> voted in favor of the ruling, thus preventing such users from editing existing articles or creating new articles on the site.
