5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress of this operation, with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had <b>not</b> <b>started</b> by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|Coulson {{was ruled}} {{out for the}} season with a {{cruciate}} ligament injury, while Kearns' loan was extended for a further two months. York conceded an 80th-minute equaliser at home to AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup, with Charlie Strutton the scorer, after substitute Jamie Reed had earlier given York the lead. Jonathan Smith was loaned to Conference Premier club Luton until January 2013, having <b>not</b> <b>started</b> a match since September 2012. Blair gave York the lead at home to Northampton Town, and despite playing most of the match with ten men, the away team equalised through Adebayo Akinfenwa. Winger Alex Rodman, who had previously played under Mills at Tamworth, was signed on a two-month loan from Aldershot. He made his debut in York's home league match against AFC Wimbledon, which finished as a 3–0 defeat, with the visitors scoring their goals in the second half.|$|E
5|$|Gneisenau and Potsdam {{were to be}} renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, {{the ships}} were {{intended}} to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters. Work on Jade was <b>not</b> <b>started</b> and the conversion project was abandoned in November 1942. She returned to service as a troopship, only to be sunk by a mine in the western Baltic. Elbe actually began the conversion process in December 1942, but only her passenger fittings were removed by the time work was halted in February 1943. She was converted into a barracks ship in Gotenhafen and seized by the United Kingdom {{after the end of}} the war. She remained in use until 1976, when she was broken up for scrap. A third ocean liner of the same class, , was purchased by the Imperial Japanese Navy and converted into the escort carrier Shin'yō. Shin'yō was torpedoed and sunk in the East China Sea by a United States Navy submarine.|$|E

Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had <b>not</b> <b>started</b> on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of the fates of the pair of incomplete boats of the U-107 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E
