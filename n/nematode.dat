5|$|Several {{species of}} entomopathogenic <b>nematode</b> are {{important}} predators of insect and other invertebrate pests. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a microscopic <b>nematode</b> that kills slugs. Its complex life cycle includes a free-living, infective {{stage in the}} soil where it becomes associated with a pathogenic bacteria such as Moraxella osloensis. The <b>nematode</b> enters the slug through the posterior mantle region, thereafter feeding and reproducing inside, {{but it is the}} bacteria that kill the slug. The <b>nematode</b> is available commercially in Europe and is applied by watering onto moist soil.|$|E
5|$|A <b>nematode</b> (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) {{causes the}} black-coloured gasters of workers to turn red. The {{parasite}} also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the <b>nematode.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is {{infected}} by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the <b>nematode</b> Spinicauda spinicauda. Another <b>nematode,</b> Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes—Mesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum—and an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode. S.spinicauda is usually only found in teiid lizards; {{it may have}} entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, {{was introduced to the}} island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M.alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S.spinicauda could explain the rarity of M.alvarengai and absence of T.alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|As a countermeasure, {{cultures}} of the <b>nematode</b> Deladenus siricidicola {{have been used as}} biological control to protect trees since the 1980s. This parasite feeds on the mycelia of A.areolatum and is therefore a food competitor of wood wasp larvae. Where S.noctilio larvae are present, the parasite infects and sterilizes the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the <b>nematode.</b> This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex–Amylostereum complex. In the Southern Hemisphere, where the technique has been widely employed, reductions of parasitism levels of 70%–100% have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|As other rays, {{spotted eagle}} rays are host {{to a variety}} of parasites. Internal parasites include the gnathostomatid <b>nematode</b> Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral intestine.

50|$|Nematophagous or nematode-trapping hyphomycetes either {{live their}} life-cycles in {{the bodies of}} dead <b>nematodes</b> or trap and kill <b>nematodes</b> in order to {{supplement}} their nitrogen requirements.

50|$|M. acidophila has {{adapted to}} this extreme {{environment}} {{to fend off}} predators. Outside the snottites {{there are a lot}} of mites that most likely prey on the <b>nematodes.</b> These <b>nematodes</b> provide a high nutritional value to the mites, especially carbon. Consequently, the <b>nematodes</b> have adapted to a more acidic area inside the snottites so that the mites have more difficulty accessing to the <b>nematodes.</b> This way the <b>nematodes</b> have a better chance of survival.|$|R
5|$|Helminths {{known to}} infest weasels include the {{trematode}} Alaria, the nematodes Capillaria, Filaroides and Trichinella and the cestode Taenia.

5|$|Termites {{are less}} likely to be {{attacked}} by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, Pyemotes mites, and a large number of <b>nematode</b> parasites. Most <b>nematode</b> parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus Mermis, Diplogaster aerivora and Harteria gallinarum. Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as Aspergillus nomius and Metarhizium anisopliae are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. M.anispliae is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with A.nomius only occurs when a colony is under great stress.|$|E
40|$|Minirhizotron root video {{observations}} of two experiments (in 1991 and 1992) in the Wageningen Rhizolab {{were used to}} investigate {{the extent to which}} potato cyst <b>nematodes</b> (Globodera pallida) without (1991) or with accompanying drought (1992) influenced the rooting dynamics of potatoes. The main effect of potato cyst <b>nematodes</b> in 1991 was a retarded root length. At a depth of 10 cm and without <b>nematodes,</b> the maximum total root length was produced 60 days after planting. At a depth of 45 cm, this point was reached after 80 days. With <b>nematodes</b> (2. 5, 10 and 40 living larvae per gram of soil), however, the date at which maximum root length was produced was retarded with at least 20 days, depending on the infestation level of the soil. At a depth of 45 cm, <b>nematodes</b> at the highest infestation level also eventually resulted in a shorter root length. At a depth of 10 cm, <b>nematodes</b> resulted in a somewhat greater root length. The effects of <b>nematodes</b> on the longevity of potato roots were analysed by following the fate of individual root segments. It was concluded that in the first experiment (1991), the rate at which roots decayed was higher without <b>nematodes</b> than with <b>nematodes.</b> Combining the data for root length production with root length decay, it was found that without <b>nematodes,</b> the standing living root length was only higher {{in the first part of}} the season. Also, from the second experiment (in 1992), in which the effect of <b>nematodes</b> was studied in combination with drought, potato roots did not show a reduced longevity with <b>nematodes.</b> The yield of potatoes in the presence of <b>nematodes</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Entomopathogenic <b>nematodes</b> (Steinernematidaeand Heterorhabditidae) {{were studied}} in Polish soils {{according}} to the: season, habitat and altitude.
