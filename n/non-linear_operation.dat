40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of SDF correlation filters vast amounts of {{work has been done}} on improving the filters¿ synthesis. Several different variations of classic SDF filter have been suggested. The objective is to create filters invariant to distortions from rotation, scaling, translation and inclusion of noise. Recently, the use of wavelets as a pre-processing stage of the images has been explored. Additionally, the application of <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations</b> as part of the pre-processing stages seems promising. This paper investigates those <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations</b> in filters like NLDOG SDF filter. We also discuss the newly introduced SDF-MACH filter in this paper. Advances in artificial neural network architectures emerged their wide availability in pattern recognition tasks. We have created a new non-linear neural model able to input analogue patterns. The paper focuses in exploring in detail how any <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations</b> are utilised in our model comparatively to correlation filters. We mathematically prove the non-linear superposition characteristics of the neural network. Finally simulation results are given to demonstrate both, the inside synthesis of SDF type correlation filters and the neural network design under the scope of those <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations.</b> We do not intend to provide an analytical comparison of correlation filters and neural networks rather to focus on the understanding of their underlying working functions...|$|R

Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled switch having essentially two levels of output. In fact, many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example - after all, all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog, so digital effects are only realized by constraining analog behavior.|$|E

Waveshaping is a <b>non-linear</b> <b>operation,</b> so it's hard to generalize {{about the effect of}} a waveshaping function on an input signal. The mathematics of non-linear operations on audio signals is difficult, and not well understood. The effect will be amplitude-dependent, among other things. But generally, waveshapers—particularly those with sharp corners (e.g., some derivatives are discontinuous) -- tend to introduce large numbers of high frequency harmonics. If these introduced harmonics exceed the nyquist limit, then they will be heard as harsh inharmonic content with a distinctly metallic sound in the output signal.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the modeling of <b>non-linear</b> <b>operation</b> of a silicon waveguide on an insulator of simox type with grating coupler in a dynamic regime, the simulation parameters are determined {{in accordance with}} the experiment, with the aim of achieving fast threshold optoelectronic switches. The optical non-linearities in the silicon are related to the change of the refractive index, and are used to obtain fast switching on the transmitted beam due to the propagation of the fundamental mode in the guide. The performances of these components are highly dependent of its rising time and its sensitivity. We will maximize the latter two. The model of <b>non-linear</b> <b>operation</b> of fast threshold optoelectronic switches are made in the dynamic regime based on the variations of the refractive index caused by both of the creation of free carriers and by the thermal effects due to the recombination of the carriers.

40|$|Abstract. Universal hashes {{are usually}} {{based on some}} multivariate polynomials in message and key blocks (elements of some {{underlying}} ring R). These are implemented by using multiplications (which dominates the computational time) and additions. Two such hashes are pseudo dotproduct (PDP) hash and Bernstein-Rabin-Winograd (BRW) hash which require n/ 2 multiplications for n message blocks. In this paper we observe that these are optimum in number of multiplications by showing that at least n/ 2 multiplications or <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations</b> are necessary. We also extend this lower bound for any multi-block hash construction, i. e., the hash output {{is an element of}} R d. We show that d block hash outputs requires at least (d − 1) + n/ 2 <b>non-linear</b> <b>operations.</b> The widely used Toeplitz construction for d block hash output requires nd/ 2 multiplications when it is applied for PDP. In this paper, we propose a d-block universal hash EHC requiring (d − 1) + n/ 2 multiplications and hence it is optimum and the bound is tight. Our construction is roughly d times faster than Toeplitz construction. Moreover, it has similar parllelizibility and key size as in Toeplitz construction...|$|R
