25|$|A cataclysmic {{event for}} Chikun {{happened}} {{at the beginning of}} 1986. At around lunch time on January 6, 1986, Cho was leaving in his car when a motorcyclist came around from his blind spot. He had avoided Cho's car, only to have slid and overturned on his motorcycle. Cho was helping the motorcyclist to stand up, and then he went to pick the bike up when a car hit him. His right thigh was broken and he suffered other injuries. He was sent into the emergency room and had an operation the day after. The injuries would take three months to heal. Cho was determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> affect him. Since his head and hand were fine, he went ahead and played {{the first game of the}} Kisei tournament. He played a good game, only to lose by 2.5 points. Cho recovered from the loss and took the next two games. Kobayashi then took 3 in a row and Cho was without a title for the first time in 8 years—something tremendous, considering he was only 29 years old. He went on to lose in a playoff for the Meijin, only to end the year with winning the Gosei title. This year ended better than last with a record of 35 wins and 17 losses.|$|E
500|$|In the sex scene, the then-pregnant Lena Headey was {{substituted}} by a body double; {{the production}} hid her pregnancy {{for the rest}} of the season. In the scene in which the Starks encounter a stag killed by a dire wolf as they return from the execution, an actual animal was used rather than a prop. As the stag had been dead for two days, it stank so much that the actors had to take much care <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> show on their faces. [...] Some scenes filmed were never aired, for example a flashback to the death of Eddard Stark's brother, and the death of Jon Arryn.|$|E
500|$|Veteran UPI {{reporter}} Helen Thomas {{suggested that}} in public, the Nixons [...] "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were [...] "very close". In private, Richard Nixon {{was described as}} being [...] "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt {{that her husband was}} vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that [...] "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> bother him. That's the way my husband is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> darken my fun," [...] said Dick. [...] "Don't worry {{but what}} some day we'll {{get the best}} of Dan Baxter. That stolen stuff will never do him much good." ...|$|R
2500|$|US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, {{who last}} met Mr Kadirgamar in June, {{condemned}} {{the assassination of}} Sri Lanka's foreign minister as a [...] "senseless murder and vicious act of terror" [...] and urged Sri Lankans <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> lead to resumed civil war. She praised Kadirgamar {{as a man of}} [...] "dignity, honor and integrity, who devoted his life to bringing peace to Sri Lanka".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{over the}} same period, Caragiale {{ridiculed}} several socialist militants, referring {{to one of their}} leaders with the derisive nickname Edgard Spanachidi (itself a derivative of [...] "spinach"). Instead, his loose association with George Panu signified a return to radicalism, and saw him campaigning in favor of universal suffrage and a complete land reform—this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> seem that he had returned to the [...] "Red" [...] liberalism of his youth.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before {{transferring}} to Tokyo in August 1968, Prince William was examined by a Royal Air Force doctor, Henry Bellringer, {{at the request}} of the prince's mother. William told the doctor that he had suffered from fever and cutaneous hepatic symptoms, beginning in December 1965 and lasting several months. He had subsequently noticed that his skin was prone to a blistering rash, particularly on exposure to sunshine. Bellringer tentatively diagnosed porphyria, prescribed sunblock cream and gave him a medical warning card regarding the need to avoid certain medications. Although he was aware of the theory of the royal family's history of porphyria then being proposed by Professor Ida Macalpine and Dr Richard Hunter, he stated he [...] "tried <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> influence him...with all the symptoms, I was left with little option but to diagnose the Prince's condition as porphyria." [...] William was later examined by haematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and also by a Professor Ishihara in Tokyo, both of whom also concluded he was suffering from variegate porphyria, by then in remission.|$|E
25|$|Schwantz {{got around}} Lawson for 1st, but Lawson looked like he’s <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> go. Gardner {{caught up to}} make it a trio, while Lawson retook the lead. Randy Mamola was hot-dogging, {{deliberately}} sliding the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Dykes was <b>not</b> invited <b>to</b> the 2008 NFL Combine however, {{and said}} of it, [...] "I was shocked...I believe {{they made a}} mistake. But I'm <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> get me down. I still have my pro day." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was argued}} that Sorge's biggest coup {{led to his}} undoing, because Stalin could <b>not</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> become known that he had {{rejected}} Sorge's warning about the German attack in June 1941. However, nations seldom officially recognize their own undercover agents.|$|R
2500|$|Solicitors {{were more}} scared by the {{proposal}} that banks {{would be allowed}} to offer conveyancing services, but this suggestion eventually came to nothing. The government introduced a consultation paper on the subject in April 1984, but in December 1985 announced that it [...] "was not satisfied that lending institutions could safely be permitted to offer both conveyancing and a loan in the same transaction. It is therefore proposed to prohibit the institutions from providing conveyancing, either directly or through a subsidiary company in which they hold a majority stake, to those who are also borrowing from them". This essentially killed the proposal (a framework which would allow banks to undertake conveyancing work was included in the Building Societies Act 1986 but never implemented) because the banks had no interest in lending only to people who were not also engaged in a loan agreement with them. It was well known at the time that many members of the cabinet were happy with the initial proposal, but that Lord Hailsham was determined <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> pass and forced the government to go against its earlier suggestion.|$|E

6000|$|Arthur and Susan both {{secretly}} {{hoped that}} the subject was now disposed of, for there seemed to them something unpleasant in this discussion. But Evelyn was <b>not</b> ready <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drop. Why would people never talk {{about the things that}} mattered? ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{there was}} a secret between the true Maid and Charles VII. The King, of course, could <b>not</b> afford <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known that he had {{secretly}} doubted whether he were legitimate. Boisy alone, at some later date, was admitted to his confidence.|$|R
5000|$|Deng’s {{offer was}} {{to remain a}} secret as the CCP did <b>not</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be known {{that they had been}} {{actively}} supporting Southeast Asia’s communist movements. The so-called Second Emergency would begin in 1970 with little to no success despite being provided with US$100,000 in financial support.|$|R

60|$|No {{matter where}} you put anything, they are <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> stay there. They will take it and move it the first chance they get. It is their nature.

5000|$|... "Today's the Day" [...] is a pop rock song {{written by}} Pink and Greg Kurstin with {{inspirational}} lyrics about seizing {{the day and}} <b>not</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> end. The song has been praised for combining Pink's signature sound with the show's [...] "feel-good vibe", but has also been noted as overly-familiar thematic territory for the singer.|$|R

60|$|Before breakfast, Jack was up, {{and went}} out to inspect the place. He found that his orders, about {{repairing}} the roof of the out-house and the clearing up, had <b>not</b> been attended <b>to.</b> He said nothing at first, but, from the quiet settled expression of his face, the men felt convinced that he did <b>not</b> mean <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> pass.|$|R
