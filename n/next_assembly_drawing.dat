40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the time of {{mechanical}} product design and ensure the high quality of their assembly drawings, this paper develops an intelligent approach for generating assembly drawings automatically from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer assembly models of mechanical products by simulating the experienced human designer's thinking mode with the aid of computer graphics and knowledge-based expert system. The key issues include the strategies and methods for selecting the necessary views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> determining necessary sectional views in each view, eliminating the unreasonable projective overlap of the components in each view, and minimizing the numbers of both the views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and the sectional views in each view. Based on the approach, corresponding software prototype was developed. Finally, it is demonstrated, from an example of the fixture in a modularized drilling machine, that its <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> was generated successfully using this intelligent software prototype. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|During {{the fall}} of 2013, a study was {{conducted}} where students completed the PSVT:R and the MCT and then {{were asked to complete}} three different modeling tasks. These tasks included modeling a part when given the object {{in the context of an}} <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> modeling a part when given an isometric pictorial of the object, and finally modeling a part when given a detail drawing of the object. Research questions for this study include the following: Does a simpler rubric provide similar scores as the previous rubric? Is there a relationship between a student’s spatial visualization ability and their ability to model a part from a pictorial, <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> or detail drawing? Is the MCT still a better predictor of a student’s modeling success than the PSVT:R? Scores evaluated based on the simplified rubric were significantly higher than the scores evaluated based on the original rubric for the part modeled from the <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing.</b> This study revealed significant positive correlations between each modeling task and the two spatial visualization tests...|$|R

40|$|During the Fall 2012 {{semester}} a {{study was}} conducted in a junior-level constraint-based modeling course to determine the relationship between students' ability to create solid models when given an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and their spatial visualization ability. Students were administered the PSVT:R and the MCT and were then given an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and asked to model as many of the seven parts as possible during a 110 minute class period. The parts in the assembly ranged in complexity from a ball to a valve body. Students were given a ruler to measure parts on the Bsize drawing and determine sizes of features based on the given scale (2 : 1). Relationships were examined between the PSVT:R, MCT, modeling activity, final project and the final exam.
