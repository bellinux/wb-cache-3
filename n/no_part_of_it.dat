He {{mentions}} this {{in the introduction to}} Cligès, a romance that many see as a kind of anti-Tristan with a happy ending. Some scholars speculate his Tristan was ill-received, prompting Chretien to write Cligès - a story with no Celtic antecedent - to make amends.|$|E
25|$|The name {{given in}} the act of Congress, taken in {{connection}} with its context, would assuredly apply to a rapid in the Des Moines River, if a notorious one existed, as the Mississippi River is not mentioned in the call, and the Des Moines is; nor was the Mississippi River to be reached by that line. Then, again, the rapid is fourteen miles long, and <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is called for as an opposite point to found the line upon.|$|E

A second, incomplete edition was produced (1924–1980) in 28 parts by Duncker und Humblot Verlag, Berlin). Some volumes have been re-issued in English. The second edition was hard to use for many years because <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was indexed until 1984, when an index was published in the Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden.|$|E
25|$|As every individual, therefore, {{endeavours}} {{as much as}} he {{can both}} to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Jackie Gleason in How Do I Love Thee?. During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she wanted <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} well {{received}} by critics. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone magazine noted [...] "Lost!" [...] as [...] "probably" [...] the [...] "album's most sublime pop moment". NMEs critic Mark Beaumont had the same view of Hermes, complimenting, [...] "It's not until [...] – all church organ funkiness, stomporific handclap rhythms and Chris pouting like a preacher in a jacuzzi full of strippers – that [...] really hits its stride." [...] Chris Jones of BBC writes, [...] "...'Lost!' seems to sport bongos in its mix, yet it's the plaintive voice with its vague sense of regret, the lifts from minor key piano forays into vast, pumping rock and also a strident optimism {{that people are going}} to come here for." [...] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork had the same sentiment: [...] "Thanks to a bubbling bit of exotic percussion that wouldn't sound out of place on Peter Gabriel's latter-day LPs, 'Lost!' is transformed from Just Another Coldplay Song into a uniquely alluring smash and live staple for years to come." [...] An article in The Guardian lambasted [...] "Lost!": [...] "This song is a deflated balloon, or, put another way, a used empty condom. He has, I think, merged visual, audio and textual into a kind of polysensory jam; <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> works without the other two." ...|$|E

Its tomb, portico and yard date back to Safavid time and there are some relics in them from the famous kings like Abbas I, Safi and Sultan Husayn. The portal of Emamzadeh Esmaeil's yard is under an interesting dome from the Turkmen age. There are two gravestones in the Imamzadeh.

A very large proportion of the property of civilized men exists in the form of contracts. These contracts almost invariably stipulate for the payment of money.

2500|$|There {{is indeed}} a law, right reason, which is in {{accordance}} with nature existing in all, unchangeable, eternal.

2500|$|The {{settlement}} of 'Newport' is first mentioned as novo burgus established by Robert, Earl of Gloucester in 1126.

The original Welsh language name for the city, Casnewydd-ar-Wysg (pronounced [...] ) means 'New castle-on-Usk' (this is a shortened version of Castell Newydd ar Wysg) and this refers to the twelfth-century castle ruins near Newport city centre. The original Newport Castle was a small motte-and-bailey castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral.

In response to the King's request for his views (the King had also written to the Prime Minister), French wrote (25 September 1913) that the army would obey [...] "the absolute commands of the King", but he warned that some might think [...] "that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks" [...] although he stressed {{that he wanted to}} act firmly against dissidents within the army.

By means of this he shows in Book 1 that, in units of which the radius of the earth is one, the least distance of the moon is 71, and the greatest 83. Hence the mean is 77...
