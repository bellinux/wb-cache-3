In addition to Svalbard, tracking and telemetry stations were built on the Falkland Islands, in Fairbanks, Alaska and in Redu, Belgium. France actively opposed the Svalbard location, as Norway was {{not a member of}} ESRO. The ESRO secretariat wanted to quicken the location decision, as it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all four in operation before the launch of the ESRO-1 and ESRO-2 satellites.|$|E

Tests were carried out at Sandia Base with the OV-1 Mohawk, A-1 Skyraider, A-4 Skyhawk, A-6 Intruder, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, B-52 and B-58 Hustler aircraft.|$|E

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E
5|$|Until 1881, voting was {{mandatory}} {{and elections}} occurred in two stages. In {{the first phase}} voters chose electors who then selected a slate of senatorial candidates. The Emperor would choose a new senator (member of the Senate, the upper house in the General Assembly) {{from a list of}} the three candidates who had received the highest number of votes. The Electors also chose the General Deputies (members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house), provincial deputies (members of the Provincial Assemblies) and councilmen (members of the town councils) without the involvement of the Emperor in making a final selection. All men over the age of 25 with an annual income of at least Rs100$000 (or 100,000 réis; the equivalent in 1824 to $98 U.S.) were eligible to vote in the first phase. The voting age was lowered to 21 for married men. To become an elector it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an annual income of at least Rs200$000.|$|E

5|$|The first {{railway station}} {{to be built}} in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem–Støren Line railway that was {{completed}} in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden. Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts—the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.|$|E
