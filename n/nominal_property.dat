6000|$|The present {{situation}} will not last. Although the newspaper I read at breakfast this morning before writing these words contains a calculation that {{no less than}} twenty-three wars are at present being waged to confirm the peace, England {{is no longer in}} khaki; and a violent reaction is setting in against the crude theatrical fare of the four terrible years. Soon the rents of theatres will once more be fixed on the assumption that they cannot always be full, nor even on the average half full week in and week out. Prices will change. The higher drama will be at no greater disadvantage than it was before the war; and it may benefit, first, by {{the fact that many of}} us have been torn from the fools' paradise in which the theatre formerly traded, and thrust upon the sternest realities and necessities until we have lost both faith in and patience with the theatrical pretences that had no root either in reality or necessity; second, by the startling change made by the war in the distribution of income. It seems only the other day that a millionaire was a man with £50,000 a year. To-day, when he has paid his income tax and super tax, and insured his life for the amount of his death duties, he is lucky if his net income is 10,000 pounds though his <b>nominal</b> <b>property</b> remains the same. And this is the result of a Budget which is called [...] "a respite for the rich." [...] At the other end of the scale millions of persons have had regular incomes for the first time in their lives; and their men have been regularly clothed, fed, lodged, and taught to make up their minds that certain things have to be done, also for the first time in their lives. Hundreds of thousands of women have been taken out of their domestic cages and tasted both discipline and independence. The thoughtless and snobbish middle classes have been pulled up short by the very unpleasant experience of being ruined to an unprecedented extent. We have all had a tremendous jolt; and although the widespread notion that the shock of the war would automatically make a new heaven and a new earth, and that the dog would never go back to his vomit nor the sow to her wallowing in the mire, is already seen to be a delusion, yet we are far more conscious of our condition than we were, and far less disposed to submit to it. Revolution, lately only a sensational chapter in history or a demagogic claptrap, is now a possibility so imminent that hardly by trying to suppress it in other countries by arms and defamation, and calling the process anti-Bolshevism, can our Government stave it off at home.|$|E
5000|$|On 9 September 2009, Philip Lane of Trinity College, Dublin {{published}} {{a paper on}} Estimating Long Term Economic Value. Using economic theory and formulae, Lane describes the long-term economic value being a function of both nominal price levels and the real (inflation-adjusted) economic value of property. The real economic value of property is further defined {{as a function of}} numerous factors including, but not limited to: real disposable income per capita; the level of long-term interest rates; the size of the population, and; the demographic structure of the population. On implementation of long-term economic value, Lane highlights the concerns over price levels. In particular, given the debate on domestic competitiveness versus other countries, Ireland may experience real-exchange rate depreciation, which could have a drag effect of <b>nominal</b> <b>property</b> value. He said, [...] "it is important that the NAMA process to recognise the inevitability of such uncertainty in the determining of long-term economic values". As a result, he favours a two-part payment system.|$|E

Contact states are modeled by constraint equations parametrized by timedependent sensor data and time-independent object properties.

The assessment is performed by a hidden Markov model, which combines a measure of how well each set of constraint equations fits the sensor data with the probability of specific contact state transitions. The latter is embodied in a task-based contact state network. The approach is illustrated for a three-dimensional peg-in-hole insertion using a tabletop manipulator robot. Using only position sensing, the contact state sequence is successfully estimated without knowledge of <b>nominal</b> <b>property</b> values.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} syntax and {{semantics}} of the clausal comparatives in Japanese. It {{is argued that}} the apparent clausal comparatives in Japanese must be (re-) analyzed as a phrasal comparative which is derived via relativization. We observe, however, that the clausal standard of comparison in Japanese does not always involve a variable of type e. Thus, I propose a hidden relative clause structure of the clausal comparatives in Japanese with a covert semi-lexical nominal Head. The gap of the raised semi-lexical nominal Head within the clausal standard is not interpreted as the variable of the type e because, despite its <b>nominal</b> <b>property,</b> it only denotes a quantity or a degree. On {{the basis of the}} syntax and semantics of numeral quantifiers, I claim the (covert) semi-lexical Heads are restricted to the two types: (i) kazu ‘number’ or ryoo ‘amount’ for the comparison of quantity, and (ii) teido ‘degree’ for the comparison of deviation...|$|E
30|$|Not all ‘one’-phrases as minimizers have {{undergone}} the same changes. These diachronic changes only {{occurred in the}} fixed ‘one’-phrases, not in the non-fixed ones, even though both types appear in the same environments. The asymmetry {{has to do with}} the flexibility of replacing the unit word. The unit word diǎn ‘dot’ has formed a strong association with the concept of a small quantity. It can be used to refer to a minimal amount for various categories of nouns. In this sense, it is more general than typical individual classifiers and unit words. General classifiers tend to undergo constructionalization because they lack a distinctive image and thus are weaker in identifying an object. In other words, they are more likely to shift to the modifying function. In non-fixed ‘one’-phrases, on the contrary, the numeral-classifier combination has maintained a salient <b>nominal</b> <b>property</b> because individual classifiers are inherently used to describe the gestalt characteristics of their associated nouns. Since the referencing function is strong, this function prevents the combination of the numeral ‘one’ and an individual classifier from shifting to another category.|$|E

Preferably, the damage detection is performed directly on vibration data, hereby avoiding modal {{identification of the}} structure. The practical aspect of using only the output measurements cause difficulties because of variations in ambient excitation due to variability in the environmental conditions, like sea, wind, and temperature. In this paper, a new Mahalanobis distance-based damage detection method is studied and compared to the well-known subspace-based damage detection algorithm {{in the context of}} two large case studies. Both methods are implemented in the modal analysis and structural health monitoring software ARTeMIS, in which the joint features of the methods are concluded in a control chart in an attempt to enhance the resolution of the damage detection. The damage indicators from both methods are evaluated based on the ambient vibration signals from numerical simulations on a novel offshore support structure and experimental example of a full scale bridge. The results reveal that the performance of the two damage detection methods is similar, hereby implying merit of the new Mahalanobis distance-based approach, as it is less computational complex.

30|$|For theorists of libertarian individualism, such as Nozick (1974), every {{distributional}} {{outcome is}} just that {{which is consistent with}} the two rules of self-ownership and freedom of contract. The libertarian message is that people do not owe each other any redistributive transfers, and that therefore the limited amount of taxation that cannot be avoided should not be used for redistributive purposes. The only thing that needs to be equalized is (property) rights. Thus, the most moderate definition is the equation of equality with a universalist and non-discriminatory regime of individual rights, such as property rights – regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} the resources that are needed in order to actually make use of those rights. Yet it is obvious that people need resources in order to make use of those rights – otherwise rights remain empty shells and purely <b>nominal.</b> <b>Property</b> rights are the rights of the owners of property; labor rights apply only to those who actually have a job; and even educational rights of youths presuppose that parents permit, support, and encourage attendance of secondary schools (which sometimes is not the case with girls coming from migrant families). The Achilles heel of the libertarian argument is its failure to take into account the presence of unequal conditions that determine the use people can make of nominally equal rights. Even if the non-discrimination criterion of access to rights were strictly observed, this would not neutralize the positive discrimination favoring those who happen to be endowed with the material resources needed to make use of those rights.|$|E
40|$|Stevens’ {{theory of}} {{admissible}} statistics [Stevens, S. S. (1946). On {{the theory of}} scales of measurement. Science, 103, 677680] states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord [Lord, F. M. (1953). On the statistical treatment of football numbers. American Psychologist, 8, 750 - 751] challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a parametric test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an apparently illegal test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. In the ensuing measurement-statistics debate Lord’s contribution has been influential, but has also led to much confusion. The present aim {{is to show that}} the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First it is shown that the implicit assumption that the numbers are nominal is false. This disqualifies Lord’s argument as a valid counterexample to Stevens’ dictum. Second, it is argued that the football numbers do not represent just the <b>nominal</b> <b>property</b> of non-identity of the players; they also represent the amount of bias in the machine. It is a question about this property-not a property that relates to the identity of the football players-that the statistical test is concerned with. Therefore, only this property is relevant to Lord’s argument. We argue that the level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord’s thought experiment-interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens’ theory of admissible statistics-conforms perfectly to Stevens’ dictum...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of repeated measures or longitudinal data always requires the accommodation of the covariance structure of the repeated measurements at some stage in the analysis. The general linear mixed model is often used for such analyses, and allows for the specification of both a mean model and a covariance structure. Often the covariance structure itself is not of direct interest, but only a means to producing valid inferences about the response. This thesis considers methods {{for the analysis of}} repeated measurements which arise from very small samples. In Part 1, existing methods of analysis are shown to be inadequate for very small samples. More precisely, statistical measures of goodness of fit are not necessarily the right measure of the appropriateness of a covariance structure and inferences based on conventional Wald type procedures (with small sample adjustments) do not approximate sufficiently well their <b>nominal</b> <b>properties</b> when data are unbalanced or incomplete. In Part 2, adaptive-estimation techniques are considered for the sample covariance matrix which smooth between unstructured and structured forms; 'direct' smoothing, a weighted average of the unstructured and structured estimates, and an estimate chosen via penalised likelihood. Whilst attractive in principle, these approaches are shown to have little success in practice, being critically dependent on the 'correct' choice of smoothing structure. Part 3 considers methods which are less dependent on the covariance structure. A generalisation of a small sample adjustment to the empirical sandwich estimator is developed which accounts for its inherent bias and increased variance. This has <b>nominal</b> <b>properties</b> but lacks power. Also, a modification to Box's correction, an ANOVA F-statistic which accounts for departures from independence, is given which has both <b>nominal</b> <b>properties</b> and acceptable power. Finally, Part 4 recommends the adoption of the modified Box statistic for repeated measurements data where the sample size is very small.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{appropriate}} methods for the analysis of very small samples of continuous repeated measurements. A key feature of such analyses is the role played by the covariance matrix of the repeated observations. When subjects are few {{it can be difficult to}} assess the fit of parsimonious structures for this matrix, while the use of an unstructured form may lead to a serious lack of power. The Kenward-Roger adjustment is now widely adopted as a means of providing an appropriate inferences in small samples, but does not perform adequately in very small samples. Adjusted tests based on the empirical sandwich estimator can be constructed that have good <b>nominal</b> <b>properties,</b> but are seriously underpowered. Further, when such data are incomplete, or unbalanced, or non-saturated mean models are used, exact distributional results do not exist that justify analyses with any sample size. In this paper, a modification of Box's correction applied to a linear model based $F$-statistic is developed for such small sample settings and is shown to have both the required <b>nominal</b> <b>properties</b> and acceptable power across a range of settings for repeated measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to present}} a syntactic analysis of seemingly problematic, but intriguing properties of the subjunctive complements in Japanese concerning Tense (T), Case for subjects, and the locality of A-scrambling, under the Minimalist Program pursued by Chomsky (1995, 1998, 1999). ^ Chapter 2 provides basic descriptions concerning the categorial status {{and the distribution of}} subjunctive clauses. I establish that the two forms, -yoo(ni-(to)) and - koto, are the subjunctive complementizers introducing finite clauses. ^ Chapter 3 discusses the Case properties of complement subjects and their control property. It is indicated that subject-to-subject raising takes place out of a certain type of subjunctive complement. It is also demonstrated that while only nominative Case is licensed for subjects in some other types of subjunctive complement, both nominative Case and null Case are actually available in the rest. I also discuss how the control property of empty subjects is related to interaction between the semantics of the governing verbs and the aspectual property of complement predicates. ^ The tense property of subjunctive complements is deeply investigated in Chapter 4. It is observed that T in a certain group of subjunctive complements is defective with respect to tense morphology, licensing of temporal adverbs, and tense interpretations of nonpast stative predicates. I point out that nominative Case and null Case are correlated with [+ tense] feature and defective [− past] feature, respectively. ^ Chapter 5 presents two analyses of the fact that long-distance A-scrambling is allowed out of subjunctive CP complements, but not out of non-subjunctive CP complements. One analysis accounts for the case in which defective T occurs in the complement. Based on Chomsky 2 ̆ 7 s (1998, 1999) hypothesis concerning strong phases, I propose that CP of which head selects defective T does not count as a strong phase. The other analysis explains the case of the complement headed by -koto, in which complete T appears. Based on - koto 2 ̆ 7 s rich <b>nominal</b> <b>property,</b> I assume that the Spec of - koto is an A-/L-related position. Furthermore, it is suggested that V-to-T movement is not a necessary condition on A-scrambling and that A-scrambling is movement of a different kind from A′-scrambling. ...|$|E
