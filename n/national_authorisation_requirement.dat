40|$|Thanks {{to the use}} of {{satellite}} technology, mobile personal telecommunications systems are able to provide communications simultaneously anywhere on the Earth's surface. The implementation of such systems raises several regulatory issues: after a brief explanation of the technical characteristics of different satellite systems in the first chapter, the second chapter will introduce the principles of space law relevant to satellite communications, with particular attention to the provisions which the development of global satellite telecommunication system could infringe. In the third chapter, there will be place for further analysis of international regulations established in the framework of the International Telecommunication Union and the World Trade Organisation, dealing more specifically with satellite telecommunications. The discipline established by the former organisation aims to the optimal management of the orbit and spectrum resources, particularly controversial because of the divergence of interests and exigencies of the member countries, whereas the latter intervened in the liberalisation of the telecommunication services, with the purpose to create an open environment for their diffusion. Furthermore, telecommunication activities are subjected to national regulation. The domestic discipline pertaining to global mobile satellite telecommunication services will be analysed in the fourth chapter, with particular attention to the U. S. Federal Communication Commission regulations and to the developments of Italian legislation {{in the light of the}} recent European initiatives in the field. <b>National</b> <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> conditions, in spite of the international effort toward regulatory harmonisation and liberalisation, are the key elements in the deployment of global mobile telecommunications services. National authorities should not continue to function solely on the basis of their national considerations, but be more flexible and open to cooperation,...|$|E

50|$|The REACH {{proposal}} sets up {{a system}} under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their {{placing on the market}} can be made subject to an <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement.</b>|$|R
50|$|This <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> {{ensures that}} risks {{from the use}} of such {{substances}} are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.|$|R
30|$|The <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> applies with {{effect of}} the sunset date stipulated in the {{specific}} Annex XIV entry, while {{in the case of}} the restriction according to Article  69 (2) REACH ECHA starts to consider action only after such date.|$|R
30|$|The {{necessity}} test {{includes the}} assessment of possible alternative measures. A measure might be preferable compared to the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement,</b> if it represents a less intrusive trade-restriction, reaches an equal or higher contribution to the legitimate objective and is reasonably available [21].|$|R
30|$|Both {{instruments}} {{are dealing with}} different kinds of risks. The restriction procedure addresses unacceptable risks that regulatory bodies are aware of and able to substantiate. In contrast, the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is triggered by a hazard potential, including situations where these are to some extent uncertain.|$|R
30|$|The {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> {{constitutes a}} ban {{and at the}} same time puts economic operators in a position to apply for authorisation (preventive ban with permit reservation). In terms of world trade law, the prohibition and the lifting of the ban as a result of the authorisation decision constitute one single measure [16]. Accordingly, this measure is subject to the assessment of conformity with WTO rules. The measure is a non-tariff trade barrier with regard to the international trade of goods. As the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> features all characteristics of a technical regulation set out in No. 1 of Annex 1 to the agreement on technical barriers to trade (TBT) the scheme is subject to the legal assessment criteria provided in TBT [15].|$|R
30|$|REACH {{introduced}} {{the first time}} an <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> for common chemicals into the chemicals legislation of the EU. Authorisation is intended as an instrument to appropriately control the risks arising from manufacturing and use of SVHC. The properties defining a SVHC are described in Art. 57.|$|R
30|$|The {{technical}} regulation {{of an extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would violate Art.  2.1 TBT, if (1) the products imported from third countries are ‘like’ products from the EEA or products imported from other third countries, and, additionally, if (2) the products imported from third countries enjoy less favourable treatment than ‘like’ domestic products or other imported products.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} the {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is compatible with Art. 2.1 TBT. Even in individual cases where articles with or without SVHC {{might be seen as}} ‘like’ products there is no disadvantageous treatment of imported articles compared to the domestic ones. 2 Next, the scheme is to be tested whether it constitutes an unnecessary obstacle to international trade under Art.  2.2 TBT.|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} this regulatory gap which, {{given the high}} numbers of imported articles, affects most consumers in the EEA one possible option would be to adjust the regulation text by expressly extending the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> to SVHC in imported articles. For this purpose Art. 56 REACH could be modified {{to the extent that}} paragraph 1 also covers the import of an Annex XIV-substance when incorporated into articles, e.g. in a certain concentration (hereinafter: extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> or scheme). However, such an enhanced authorisation scheme affects aspects of international trade in goods and, as it happens, the legal omission de lege lata is no accidental slip but reflects that until the final adoption of REACH the provisions relating to articles were highly controversial—not least in view of the already then virulent debate on the WTO-compatibility [14]. Based on the findings of a legal appraisal on behalf of the UBA [15] the following sections assess whether such option would be in accordance with the legal specifications of the WTO.|$|R
50|$|Curtailing {{the ability}} to protest can be done within the {{legislative}} framework, when the norms in placed unduly restricted the right to assembly by imposing prior <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements,</b> time and place restrictions, among others. In practice, this right can be restricted when security forces use excessive force to disperse protesters, arbitrary arrest them and even charge protesters with provisions of the criminal code and even anti terrorism legislation.|$|R
30|$|The {{technical}} regulation {{of an extended}} authorisation scheme aims to prevent the risks posed by SVHC in imported articles. For all SVHC ‘scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment’ 6 is available and every authorisation process includes, among other aspects such as socio-economic considerations, a comprehensive risk assessment. The {{technical regulation}} restricts international trade by imposing an <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> for SVHC listed in Annex XIV REACH and {{that are used in}} imported articles. However, article producers may lift the ban by proving that the risks posed by the substance use are adequately controlled or that the socio-economic benefits outweigh the risks. This instrumental design attenuates the measure’s intrusiveness. Moreover, the technical regulation is likely to make a significant contribution to its purposes while these purposes are legitimate objectives under Article 2.2 TBT. As no equally effective alternative means are available, the overall view of these facts leads {{to the conclusion that the}} extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is not more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Article  2.2 TBT.|$|R

30|$|To {{the extent}} that {{products}} can be deemed alike, the Art.  2.1 TBT test next asks whether the extended authorisation scheme discriminates imported articles because it de jure or de facto treats them less favourably than like domestic articles or like imported articles of other origin [18, 20]. An extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would by design and structure treat imported articles the same as domestic articles. Thus, {{there would be no}} de jure discrimination of imported SVHC-articles vis-à-vis domestic SVHC-free articles.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the REACH Regulation is to ensure {{a high level of}} {{protection}} of {{human health and the environment}} as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To this end, REACH introduces, among other instruments, the authorisation regime for substances of very high concern (SVHC) that are listed on Annex XIV of the regulation. After expiration of the transitional period for each Annex XIV-SVHC, articles, such as most products of daily use, produced in the European Economic Area (EEA) may not contain such substances unless an authorisation was granted for the specific use or this use falls within the scope of an exemption from the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement.</b> The <b>authorisation</b> scheme does, however, only apply to SVHC used in the EEA. As a consequence, REACH does not regulate SVHC entering the European market as part of imported articles which burden human health and the environment. Moreover, from an economic perspective, domestic articles are subject to stricter requirements than those which are produced abroad, putting actors from within the EEA at competitive disadvantage and thus impeding the intention of REACH to enhance competitiveness and innovation. One option to close this regulatory gap could be to extend the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> to SVHC present in imported articles. A legal appraisal on behalf of the German Environment Agency (UBA) assesses whether such option would be in accordance with the specifications of WTO world trade law. It concludes that, measured by the standards of the WTO dispute settlement practice, such an extended authorisation scheme would neither violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment. Also, such regulation would not constitute an unnecessary obstacle to trade, since the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would pursue a legitimate objective covered by the regulatory autonomy of the EU and, furthermore, the regulation would not be more trade-restrictive than necessary. The contribution at hand summarises the main findings while taking into account first reactions to the legal appraisal.|$|R

A Harvard University study finds these to be some of the causes of corruption and underground economy in India.|$|R
30|$|Companies {{that take}} their {{responsibility}} seriously, comply with their information duty and eliminate SVHCs {{in all their}} articles are better prepared for upcoming restrictions and <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirements</b> can build trust in consumers and thus can profit from the resulting competitive advantage. However, the REACH regulatory fitness and performance programme evaluation (REACH REFIT) revealed that some retailers perceive their efforts to be well prepared for SVHC consumer requests as superfluous, as the interest by consumers for such information remains low [28]. Several results of our survey make it understandable, why many suppliers are reluctant to inform about SVHCs in their articles [5 – 8]: {{only a minority of}} all consumers would buy SVHC-containing articles with no strings attached (Question 25) and there were even consumers who regard the presence of an SVHC in an article as reason to return it to the retailer (Question 26). However, as long as only 4 % of the highly motivated and interested participants make the SVHC inquiries (Question 18, 19), the pressure applied by the consumers’ request to suppliers remains probably lower than other stimuli to substitute SVHCs in articles, such as the sun set date and the <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> according to REACH Art. 56, 58.|$|R

These formulate independent requirements.

Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution) places a duty on government to, amongst others adopt legislative measures to protect the environment, prevent pollution and degradation, and secure sustainable development, while promoting justifiable economic and social development.

30|$|The {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> prevents SVHC {{from entering}} the EEA market as part of imported articles except where this is justified. The regulation reduces thus the exposure of {{human health and the}} environment to ‘very high concern’ substances. At the same time REACH enforcement in 18 EEA countries shows very low numbers regarding non-compliance in reference to the authorisation regime de lege lata (three cases of non-compliances in 421 inspections) [25]. The extended scheme is, therefore, ‘as written and applied’ [20, 21] appropriate to fulfil its legitimate objective [15]; provided that resources of enforcement agencies will be adjusted with a view to the new task area of controlling imported articles.|$|R
30|$|In summary, the {{regulatory}} option {{of an extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would not violate the principles of national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment according to Art. 2.1 TBT, nor would it constitute an unnecessary trade restriction {{within the meaning of}} Article  2.2 TBT. These results are also consistent with the key objectives of the WTO, which foresee free international commodity trading contributing to the improvement of living standards and quality of life and the protection of the environment [43]. At the same time, the analysis shows that the option of an extended authorisation regime could become meaningful with regard to the next comprehensive review of the REACH Regulation.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, the {{extended}} <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement’s</b> legitimate objective {{has to be}} taken into account [16, 21] which is to ensure a high level of protection for human health and the environment by reducing the risks of SVHC. The SVHC criteria are an expression of this level of protection, the adoption of which—according to an evolutionary interpretation of Art.  2.2 TBT in the light of the requirements of the precautionary principle—is covered by the regulatory autonomy of the Member States of the Agreement. A non-fulfilment of the normative goals would, therefore, cause unacceptable risks, irrespective of the specific SVHC category. This again underscores the necessity of the scheme [15].|$|R

30|$|Art. 2.2 TBT bars {{technical}} regulations {{that are more}} trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective. Since the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> is trade-restrictive (non-tariff barrier) {{the question is whether}} the regulation is also more trade-restrictive than necessary (necessity test). This includes an examination of (1) whether the regulation pursues a legitimate objective, (2) whether it is appropriate to fulfil such objective and (3) whether it is more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the objective, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. Additionally, the necessity test also includes (4) a comparison with possible alternative measures. A relational analysis of all four aspects and the regulation’s actual intrusiveness allows determining whether the extended authorisation scheme is more trade-restrictive than necessary in terms of Art. 2.2 TBT [21].|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. That the {{requirement}} of a prior authorisation, as a precondition for the exercise of any economic activity, may restrict the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services is a truism. If an authorisation is required in the Member State where establishment is to take place or the service is to be offered (host Member State), then operators who lack such authorisation are in no right to proceed to the projected activity. Therefore, {{as soon as it}} is being accepted that the EU internal market rules are not only about discriminatory measures, but also cover mere restrictions, {{it comes as no surprise}} that <b>national</b> <b>authorisation</b> systems come to be scrutinized under the Internal Market rules...|$|R
30|$|Besides, {{it has to}} {{be checked}} whether the scheme {{constitutes}} a de facto discrimination against foreign products. In this respect, all detrimental impacts on the competitive opportunities of imported products caused by the regulation at hand might potentially be relevant for the examination [21]. However, even if detrimental effects exist, this impairment could be due to a legitimate regulatory distinction and for this reason be altogether justified [18, 20]. This is also the case with respect to the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement.</b> For instance, under REACH, a company needs to be established within the community to place substances, mixtures or articles on the market. The same requirement would apply to obtaining the authorisation for use of certain SVHC in an imported article. Companies without establishment in the community would thus need an importer or an only representative according to Art.  8 REACH with establishment in the community to apply for authorisation, affecting the compliance costs of the company. At the same time, companies are not forced to contract one of the mentioned actors, unless they refuse establishment of an office in the community. It could be argued that the competitive opportunities of foreign companies without establishment in the community are detrimentally impacted [22]. However, the legislator’s intention to require establishment in the community needs to be appreciated. Generally, legal acts issued by an administrative body may not be served to actors from outside EU; the same applies for favourable legal acts. Moreover, the objectives of the authorisation scheme can only be achieved if the provisions are linked with appropriate and effective enforcement mechanisms. To this end, the European intermediary is a prerequisite that the REACH requirements can be fully applied or, where appropriate, enforcing measures (e.g. criminal sanctions) can be taken. Hence, the putative impairment of competitive opportunities of imported products would be justified by legitimate regulatory distinctions in terms of Art. 2.1 TBT. As a result, the extended <b>authorisation</b> <b>requirement</b> would not cause a de facto discrimination.|$|R
40|$|In Germany, {{pesticides}} {{pass through}} a <b>national</b> <b>authorisation</b> procedure. They must be effective and may not harm either the user or the environment when applied properly. Furthermore pesticide residues in foods and especially in drinking water may not cause harm to consumer health. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) {{is responsible for the}} health assessment of pesticides. The Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) is responsible for the authorisation of pesticides. Since the 1990 s, active substances in pesticides have been assessed in the European Union (EU) by a community procedure according to Council Directive 91 / 414 /EEC and, more re-cently, also on the basis of EU Regulation 1107 / 2009. The BfR is involved in this community procedure. Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) values are determined as part of the health as-sessment of this procedure. The BfR incorporates these in regard to <b>national</b> <b>authorisation</b> procedures of pesticides. ADI values, the so-called acceptable daily intake, identify, {{on the basis of the}} body mass or body weight, the maximum amount of an active substance that consumers could take in daily over the course of a lifetime without assuming damage to their health. Based on these val-ues, the BfR also determines a drinking water guide value (Trinkwasser-Leitwert – LWTW) for different active substances. The LWTW indicates the highest concentration of a substance in drinking water that that could be consumed in a lifetime without causing health concerns. The Federal Environment Agency (UBA) uses these drinking water guide values as a refer-ence when defining its typically much lower Action Values (AV) for drinking water (Trink-wasser-Maßnahmewerte MWTW, previously TWMW) ...|$|R
