The main idea is to use commonality-variability analysis to divide the type into the fixed implementation and interface, the policy-based class, and the different policies. The trick is to know what goes into the main class, and what policies should one create. The article mentioned above gives the following answer: wherever {{we would need to}} make a possible limiting design decision, we should postpone that decision, we should delegate it to an appropriately <b>named</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in randomized motion planners {{has led to}} the development of a new class of sampling-based algorithms that provide asymptotic optimality guarantees, notably the RRT* and the PRM* algorithms. Careful analysis reveals that the so-called "rewiring" step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a local policy iteration (PI) step (i. e., a local policy evaluation step followed by a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of samples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost surely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI) are common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this observation, recently, the RRT^# algorithm has been proposed, which performs, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka "backups") on those vertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path (i. e., the "promising" vertices). The RRT^# algorithm thus utilizes dynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly generated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on this key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming algorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by iterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration instead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive parallelization. Contrary to the RRT* algorithm, the policy improvement during the rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices that are classified as "promising" during the current iteration. This tends to speed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly <b>named</b> <b>Policy</b> Iteration-RRT^# (PI-RRT^#) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired algorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods...|$|E

40|$|A {{domain name}} is a unique {{alphanumeric}} designation that facilitates reference to sets of numbers which actually locate a particular computer on the Internet. Domain names are a fundamental part of the Internet&# 039;s user interface. Improving the usability of the Internet depends upon effective domain <b>name</b> <b>policy.</b> This study is intended to contribute to improvement in Internet usability for the end users of domain names. Benefits of more usable domain names include: higher sales, customer satisfaction and productivity, and reduced support costs. Domain <b>name</b> <b>policies</b> worldwide vary considerably. Consequently, end users are inconvenienced by contradictory domain <b>name</b> <b>policies,</b> diminishing the predictability of an entity&# 039;s domain name, and thus decreasing usability for end users. The study objective was to develop criteria with which policy makers can evaluate their domain <b>name</b> <b>policies,</b> {{in order to improve}} the usability of domain names for end users. The main research question posed was: What are the criteria for an effective domain <b>name</b> <b>policy?</b> The research methodology included a literature review, domain <b>name</b> <b>policy</b> examination and an ethnographic narrative. The literature review found existing research examining either domain names or usability in isolation. However, research examining the intersection of the two is scarce. The existing research describes domain names as part of the web user interface. In practical terms, this is about how people use domain names to access web sites, email addresses and other Internet resources. It was established that the predictability (and thus usability) of domain names relies on effective domain <b>name</b> <b>policy.</b> The non-standardised and widely delegated process of domain <b>name</b> <b>policy</b> development leads to unpredictable and inconsistent domain names. The narrative recollection presented the researcher&# 039;s inside perspective on the domain name industry, with a focus on domain name usability. The researcher provided first-hand insights into the evolution of the industry and policy development process, from Australian and international perspectives. To address the problem of poor domain name usability, a framework for domain <b>name</b> <b>policy</b> evaluation is proposed. The framework extends the current research that treats domain names as a user interface by proposing criteria which address usability concerns. The framework allows policy makers to critically assess domain <b>name</b> <b>policies</b> with end users in mind. Examples of the criteria include: understanding who are its intended and untended users, and whether it&# 039;s consistent with other domain names. The framework has the potential to set an international standard for the critical evaluation of domain <b>name</b> <b>policy,</b> and become the basis for further research. This study was developed from the researcher&# 039;s perspective as a participant in the domain name industry. A secondary lens regarding the usability of domain names was then applied. This study has only scraped the surface in terms of how the research fields of domain names and usability may be considered together. The research methodology for this study was primarily qualitative and interpretive. A quantitative study of domain <b>name</b> <b>policies</b> globally could provide further insight into areas including: the differences in second level country code domain names, and language implications of domain names...|$|R

40|$|M. Ed. The {{dawn of a}} {{democratic}} political dispensation in South Afiica brought along many challenges of which education was the most distinctive. The Limpopo Province just as the other provinces also implemented {{a democratic}} school governing system in public schools. The main idea or intention was that such a governing system should systematically improve the culture {{of teaching and learning}} in schools and that schools could gradually be transformed. Even though democratic elected governing bodies are in tact, there is however a great lack of managerial competence, especially amongst the parent component of the school governing body. The Department of Education however did not take cognisance of the important role of effective and sufficient training of members serving on school governing bodies. It stands to reason that, if undivided attention is not being given to this aspect of management competence, which requires effective training, that effective education will not prevail. There is a great concern about the school governing bodies that does not fulfil their roles and functions effectively as prescribed by the South Afiican Schools Act of 1996. The emphasis of this study is on the management competence of parents serving on school governing bodies. The aim of this study is thus to investigate the management competence of parent members serving on school governing bodies as determined by the law. The quantitative research method was used to determine the perceptions of certain parents with regard to management competence and management competence development. A structured questionnaire consisting of 30 items were distributed to 200 parent members serving on school governing bodies in the Limpopo Province and 90 % of the respondents completed the questionnaires. The nature of the target group was thus comfortable, polygenetic and representative of parents in the Limpopo Province. The 30 items were designed to test the perceptions of parents from various groups as to determine the level of their management competence within the perimeters of parent members serving on school governing bodies. Successive first and second order factor analytic procedures were used to determine the construct validity of the questionnaire. The procedure used resulted in the 30 items being reduced to three factors namely: • Factor 1, consisting of 11 items that was <b>named</b> <b>policy</b> implementation competence with a Cronbach-alpha-reliability coefficient of 0, 920. • Factor 2, consisting of 10 items that was called learning support involvement with a Cronbach-alpha-reliability coefficient of 0. 920. • Factor 3, consisting of 9 items that was dubbed effective financial management with a Cronbach-alpha-reliability-coefficient of 0, 919. The reliability coefficient was exceptionally high in all three instances, which confirms the validity of the data. A literature study was undertaken on various aspects with regard to management competence. The following management competencies were investigated: management of educational policy, management of organisational cultures, management of educators, management of physical and financial resources, motivational strategies and school climate. The empirical findings resulted in the fact that effective schools in the Limpopo Province are dependent on effective policy implementation, effective learning support involvement and effective financial management. In addition, another finding resulting from the research was the fact that management competence is a prerequisite for an effective school. The implication is however that, all stakeholders in education have a moral obligation to create a participative environment in order to assure effective education. One of the recommendations resulting from the study is that effective training of parent members serving on school governing bodies should be regarded as an imperative prerequisite for the management of quality education. The research was concluded with a chapter on findings, results and recommendations...|$|E
40|$|There {{appears to}} be a {{constantly}} incontrovertible, yet delicately inseparable cord, between land resource as an all-time invaluable asset, and meaningful socio-economic growth and development. Much as this assertion holds, what enigmatically remains almost unsolvable is the seeming unending mystery that surrounds ‘wilful’ prevention of access to this very non-substitutable resource, in spite of its tangentiality to virtually all endeavours, around which the survival of all human beings revolves. Thence, it is compellingly tempting to reason that, some ‘unseen’ factors are decidedly making the delivery and accessibility of land, especially within urban milieu, extremely difficult, so much that, enviable growth and development might be so perennially elusive, particularly to the poor segment of the populace, which unfortunately forms the largest proportion of any country’s citizenry, Nigeria inclusive. Although, the trend facades itself to be solely caused by economic and other attendant pecuniary factors, but as all the economically-defined strategies seem not too effective over the years, to finally nail several challenges associated with formal land delivery and accessibility; it behoves upon researchers and policy-makers alike, to look beyond the ordinary. Hence, the demystification exercise such as this, which is geared towards unravelling this mystery, reveals more factors that are indeed non-pecuniary, this is the crux of this study. Therefore, this study, which is part of a doctoral research, pre-empirically via literature reviews and two pilot surveys, generated those not-so-suspected non-pecuniary factors that are considered as retardants to the formal delivery and accessibility of urban lands in Nigeria. These retardants are then catalogued and coined into one major determinant variable, which is called policy development and compliance engineering (PDCE) for ease of empirical exercise that was to follow later, {{as well as for the}} understanding by all would-be stakeholders. This major determinant variable is then being measured by other three latent constructs, which are calibrated to encompass some integral items of questions as their evaluative components; these constructs are <b>named</b> <b>policy</b> relevance and appropriateness (PRA), contents and context of policies (CCP) and role mediation regime (RMR). Hence, out of the total of 2408 respondents as total sample space, 850 respondents were qualified as the sample frame, from where a total of 450 respondents were considered for the sample size, upon which well structure questionnaires of 5 point Likert scale type were administered among career land officers and tenured land regulators in the MDAs, independent land consultants and NGOs with shelter mandate, as well as various categories of land users and developers. After through normality and reliability tests on the 427 retrieved questionnaires, only 11 were considered invalid and thus rejected. Therefore, the remaining 416 questionnaires that were valid went through AMOS’ version 18 software for Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) analyses. The results showed amongst other things that among the three major constituting retardants of formal land delivery and accessibility, contents and context of policies has the highest regression via its estimate of 0. 26 with critical ratio of 4. 86, which thus makes it to be the greatest among the policy development and compliance engineering constructs, as contributor of retardation upon the propensity of formal lands’ regulo-administrative machineries to efficiently deliver lands for optimum accessibility by the land users and developers. Among other recommendations to address this pathetic scenario, are that the government should strive and ‘nigerianise’ all or very many important provisions of all the relevant land policy instruments, etc...|$|E
