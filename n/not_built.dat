5|$|Andy's and Red's {{relationship}} {{has been described as}} a non-sexual love story between two men, that few other films offer, where the friendship is <b>not</b> <b>built</b> on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major fire}} {{occurred}} on May 11, 1969 in building 776/777 (the Plutonium Processing Facility), again starting due to spontaneous combustion of plutonium shavings in a glove box. Fire fighters again resorted to fighting {{the fire with}} water after dry extinguishers proved ineffective. Despite recommendations after the 1957 fire, suppression systems were <b>not</b> <b>built</b> into the glove boxes.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were <b>not</b> <b>built</b> to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Mahmudiye {{was built}} by the Thames Iron Works {{shipyard}} in Blackwall, London; {{she was the only}} member of her class <b>not</b> <b>built</b> at Robert Napier and Sons. The ship's keel was laid down in 1863 and she was launched on 13 December 1864. She was completed for sea trials in 1865 and commissioned into the Ottoman fleet the following year.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{north of}} Aylesbury the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme {{consisted}} of a line running southwest to northeast from Oxford to Bletchley and a second southeast from Brackley via Buckingham to join the Oxford–Bletchley line halfway along its length. The first section opened on 1May1850, and the whole on 20May1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line south to the station at Aylesbury but the extension was <b>not</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, to {{the north}} of Aylesbury, the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme {{consisted}} of a line running roughly south-west to north-east from Oxford to Bletchley, and a line running south-east from Brackley via Buckingham, joining roughly halfway along the Oxford–Bletchley line. The first section opened on 1May1850, and the rest opened on 20May1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line southwards to connect to its station at Aylesbury, but this extension was <b>not</b> <b>built.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some lines {{proposed}} {{under the}} Contracts were <b>not</b> <b>built,</b> most notably an IRT line to Marine Park, Brooklyn (at {{what is now}} Kings Plaza) under either Utica Avenue, using a brand-new line, or Nostrand Avenue and Flatbush Avenue, using the then-new IRT Nostrand Avenue Line. There were also alternate plans for the Nostrand Avenue Line to continue down Nostrand Avenue to Sheepshead Bay.|$|E
5|$|The Duke and Jones {{intended}} to run {{no more than}} one train on each section of the line so the line was <b>not</b> <b>built</b> with passing loops or signalling. When more than one horse-drawn train or locomotive was in operation, the Tramway operated a token system using colour-coded staffs to ensure only one train could be on a section. Drivers between Quainton Road and Wotton carried a blue staff, those on west of Wotton and the Kingswood siding a red staff.|$|E

5|$|The Grand Junction Canal {{opened in}} 1794, linking Uxbridge with Birmingham. By 1800 Uxbridge {{had become one}} of the most {{important}} market towns in Middlesex, helped by its status as the first stopping point for stagecoaches travelling from London to Oxford. The development of Uxbridge declined after the opening of the Great Western Railway in 1838, which passed through West Drayton. A branch line to Uxbridge was <b>not</b> <b>built</b> until 1904.|$|E
5|$|The Meander {{volunteer}} fire brigade {{was formed in}} 1972, though a station was <b>not</b> <b>built</b> until some years after. They received their first fire truck in 1973, {{which had to be}} kept at member's houses for the first few years. In 1991 the brigade had approximately 15 members. This brigade was formed in consequence of the Rural Fires Act 1950; an act aimed at combating bushfires.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a fortified city on the Sciberras Peninsula was first proposed in 1524, when the Order of St. John sent a commission to inspect the Maltese Islands. Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the Aragonese in 1488. The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was <b>not</b> <b>built</b> since the Order focused on building the fortifications of Birgu, which had become their base.|$|E
