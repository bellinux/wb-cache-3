25|$|Polypropylene {{is a major}} polymer used in <b>nonwovens,</b> {{with over}} 50% used for diapers or {{sanitary}} products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene <b>nonwovens</b> are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.|$|E

A distinctive feature of the <b>nonwoven</b> composite separator is its porous structure, i. e. well-connected interstitial voids formed between close-packed SiO 2 nanoparticles interconnected by PVdF-HFP binders. More notably, this unusual porous structure of the <b>nonwoven</b> composite separator can be tuned by controlling the SiO 2 particle size (herein, 40 nm and 530 nm SiO 2 powders are exploited). Such morphological variation of the <b>nonwoven</b> composite separator has a crucial influence on separator properties such as porosity, electrolyte wettability, and ionic conductivity.
