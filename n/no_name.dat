The Annals of the Four Masters call Mac Ragnaill a jarl, but the Annals of Ulster call him a king. The Annals of the Four Masters also suggests he and his fellow plunderers came from an island.|$|E

5|$|Clint Eastwood {{is dressed}} as the Man with <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> from the Dollars Trilogy films. The film Paint Your Wagon is {{referenced}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode. The film does star Eastwood and Lee Marvin and was directed by Joshua Logan, but the writers did not base their parody or the song on the film at all. The man in the film that confronts Clint Eastwood is modelled after Lee Van Cleef.|$|E
5|$|Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor, filmmaker, musician, and {{political}} figure. After achieving {{success in the}} Western TV series Rawhide, he rose to international fame with {{his role as the}} Man with <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s, and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Vaballathus, Zenobia had other children; {{the image of}} a child named Hairan (II) appears on a seal impression with that of his brother Vaballathus; <b>no</b> <b>name</b> of a mother was engraved and the seal is undated. Odaenathus' son Herodianus is identified by Udo Hartmann with Hairan I, a son of Odaenahtus who appears in Palmyrene inscriptions as early as 251. David S. Potter, on the other hand, suggested that Hairan II is the son of Zenobia and that he is Herodianus instead of Hairan I.|$|E

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam. He {{explained}} that their faith says {{that there can be}} only one God which has <b>no</b> <b>name</b> or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s decade {{ended with}} Murphy doing three westerns. He co-starred with 14-year-old Sandra Dee in the 1959 film The Wild and the Innocent. The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} talent {{of the era}} in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch on {{the black and white}} Cast a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecast}} anticipated more tropical activity {{than what}} ultimately occurred. During the season, 14tropical depressions formed from May 25 to November 5.

5|$|Ged spends {{many months}} healing before {{resuming}} his studies.

He sails to Pendor, and uses {{his knowledge of the}} dragon's true name to threaten him. The dragon offers to tell Ged the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon will never threaten the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|In late April, the Chinese {{launched}} a major counterattack. 486,000 Chinese troops assaulted I Corps and IX Corps' {{sector of the}} lines. Most of the UN forces were able to hold their ground, but the Chinese broke through at Kapyong, where the South Korean 6th Division was destroyed by the 13th CPV Army Corps, which penetrated the line and threatened to encircle the American divisions to the west. The 1st Marine Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade were able to drive the 13th Army Corps back while the 24th and 25th Divisions withdrew on 25 April. The line was pushed back to Seoul but managed to hold. A second offensive the next month was similarly unsuccessful, as Chinese and North Korean forces suffered heavy casualties but were unable to push back the Eighth Army forces. The I and IX Corps had blunted the offensive at the <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> Line, just north of Seoul.|$|E

5|$|Knights Hill {{starts in}} the north at West Norwood in the Norwood Triangle one-way system, and runs through a council ward also named as Knight's Hill. It ends in the south at a {{junction}} with the A214 at Crown Lane and Crown Dale. Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill here at Crown Point. To the north, south of Knight's Hill {{is the part of}} the Crystal Palace area with <b>no</b> <b>name</b> home to a large parade of competing large super markets along the A215 Norwood Road including Tesco, Cooperative, Iceland and (by Summer 2009) Sainsbury (ex Woolworth's site). West Norwood railway station is on this road. Knights Hill contains the Knights Hill Nature Reserve, one of the last remaining vestiges of the Great North Wood which once covered the area.|$|E
5|$|The Driver {{has been}} {{compared}} to the Man With <b>No</b> <b>Name,</b> a character Clint Eastwood portrayed in the Sergio Leone western, because he almost never speaks, communicating mostly non-verbally. The Driver's meager dialogue is not designed to present him as tough, but to soften him. Refn chose to give The Driver very little dialogue and instead have him drive around listening to synth-pop music, taking control when it counts. Peter Debruge of Variety opined that what The Driver lacks in psychology, he makes up through action and stylish costuming. The Driver's wardrobe, in particular the satin jacket with the logo of a golden scorpion on the back, was inspired by the band KISS, and Kenneth Anger's 1964 experimental film Scorpio Rising. Refn sees the former as the character's armor, and the logo as a sign of protection. According to reviewer Peter Canavese, the jacket is a reference to the fable of the scorpion and the frog, mentioned in the film, which in turn evokes its use in the Orson Welles film Mr. Arkadin.|$|E
5|$|The Monteverdi scholar Ellen Rosand has {{identified}} 12 {{versions of the}} published libretto that have been discovered {{in the years since}} the first performance. Most of these appear to be 18th-century copies, possibly from a single source; some are literary versions, unrelated to any theatrical performances. All but one of the 12 identify Badoaro as the author, while the other gives <b>no</b> <b>name.</b> Only two refer to Monteverdi as the composer, though this is not significant—composers' names were rarely given on printed librettos. The texts are all generally the same in each case, and all differ from the one surviving copy of Monteverdi's musical score, which has three acts instead of five, a different prologue, a different ending, and many scenes and passages either omitted or rearranged. Some of the libretto copies locate the opera's first performance at Teatro San Cassiano, although Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo is now generally accepted as the opening venue.|$|E

5|$|Audie Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was {{a highly}} {{decorated}} American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient who turned actor. He portrayed himself in the film To Hell and Back, the account of his World War II experiences. During the 1950s and 1960s he was cast primarily in westerns. While often the hero, he proved his ability to portray a cold-blooded hired gun in <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> on the Bullet. A notable exception to the westerns was The Quiet American in which he co-starred with Michael Redgrave. Murphy made over 40 feature films and often worked with directors more than once. Jesse Hibbs who directed To Hell and Back worked with the star on six films, only half of which were westerns. When promoting his 1949 book To Hell and Back he appeared on the radio version of This Is Your Life. To promote the 1955 film of the same name, he appeared on Ed Sullivan's Toast of the Town. He was a celebrity guest on television shows such as What's My Line? and appeared {{in a handful of}} television dramas. Murphy's only television series Whispering Smith had a brief run in 1961. For his cooperation in appearing in the United States Army's Broken Bridge episode of The Big Picture television series he was awarded the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 2003, Benfica {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Brazilian midfielder Geovanni, on a loan deal from Barcelona {{until the end of}} the season. On 11 January, the team played Vitória Guimarães away. The 1–1 draw after 90 minutes was a consequence of the constant interruptions for a large number of fouls signalled by the referee. In the stands, the problematic behaviour of the Benfica supporters group <b>No</b> <b>Name</b> Boys caused the governing body of the Portuguese league to punish both clubs by closing their stadiums for one game each. On the following Sunday, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros for a game against Marítimo, which Benfica won 2–1 after an individual effort from Nuno Gomes in the 74th minute. It was the first win there since 1994–95. After selecting the Estádio Municipal Dr. Alves Vieira in Torres Novas to replace Estádio da Luz, Benfica hosted Beira-Mar on 26 January, winning 1–0 with a goal from Geovanni. Three days later, the team played the second friendly of the month after a 1–1 draw against Ajax a week before. During the game, intended to bring people to Da Luz, Benfica lost 0–1 to Barcelona.|$|E
