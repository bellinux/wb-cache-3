One common distinction is by <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> It describes the maximum pore size distribution and gives only vague information about the retention capacity of a membrane.The exclusion limit or [...] "cut-off" [...] of the membrane is usually specified {{in the form of}} NMWC (nominal molecular weight cut-off, or MWCO, molecular weight cut off, with units in Dalton). It is defined as the minimum molecular weight of a globular molecule that is retained to 90% by the membrane. The cut-off, depending on the method, can by converted to so-called D90, which is then expressed in a metric unit. In practice the MWCO of the membrane should be at least 20% lower than the molecular weight of the molecule that is to be separated.|$|E

The grafting of PNIPAAm on the template was obtained by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) leading to a reproducible and uniform brush film (15 nm thick) on the textured surface. According to the authors, the macroscopic wettability is not due only to the change of the polymer hydrophobicity, {{but also to the}} nanoscopic topography of the surface associated with expansion and contraction of the grafted polymer. Nonetheless, these surfaces led to a maximum contact angle of 158 ° at 40 °C (for 200 nm <b>pore</b> <b>size)</b> starting from a CA of 38 ° at 25 °C, comparable to the contact angles reported by Sun et al.

Below the melting point, multi-component relaxation times indicated a mixed phase system, with evidence for the coexistence of an ordered nanocrystal and a highly disordered region.

We investigated the feasibility of defining a quantitative bone structural similarity score based on differences in the structural properties of synthetic grafts and bone tissue. Methods: Two biocompatible hydroxyapatite porous scaffolds with different <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> were compared with trabecular bone tissues from equine humerus and femur. Images of samples' structures were acquired by high-resolution micro-computed tomography and analyzed to estimate porosity, <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distribution and interconnectivity, specific surface area, connectivity density and degree of anisotropy. Young's modulus and stress at break were measured by compression tests. Structural similarity distances between sample pairs were defined based on scaled and weighted differences of the measured properties.

Results: Manhattan distances and Quadrance generally showed sound and consistent similarities between sample pairs, more clearly than simple statistical comparison and with discriminating capacity similar to image-based scores to assess progression of pathologies affecting bone structure.

Formation of broad maxima in the excess sorption was observed at fluid densities below the bulk critical density. Positive values of excess sorption were measured at bulk densities below 0. 7 g cm 3, i. e., the interfacial fluid is denser than the bulk fluid at low pressures. Zero and negative values were obtained at higher densities, i. e., the adsorbed fluid becomes equal to and eventually less dense than the corresponding bulk fluid. Pronounced confinement effects on sorption behavior have been found and further analyzed by normalizing the excess sorption to the adsorbent surface area and pore volume, yielding new insight into supercritical fluid adsorption in this range of <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> and P, T conditions. If normalized to the specific surface area, the excess sorption is higher for the 35 nm <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> material, but the pore volume normalized excess sorption is higher for the 7. 5 nm <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> material. With increasing pore width, the excess sorption peak position shifts to higher pressure.

However, at the one end, the pores are separated into several smaller pores having pore size of about 20 nm to approximately 40 nm.

This (or any) filtering method does {{not result in}} perfect size fractionation, and it can induce stress, mortality, and loss of organisms that, in turn, may underestimate the concentration of organisms within samples. To address this loss, the retention efficiency (RE) was determined for six filtration approaches using laboratory cultures of microalgae and ambient marine organisms. The approaches employed a membrane filter or mesh nettings of different compositions (nylon, stainless steel, polyester, and polycarbonate), <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> (5, 7, and 10 μm), and filtering sequences (e. g., pre-filtering water through a coarse filter).

In addition, variable fluorescence fluorometry was used to gauge the relative photochemical yield of phytoplankton—a proximal measurement of the physiological status of phytoplankton—in the size fractions.

Fouling induced by these proteins was observed in flat-sheet membrane filtration cells operating in a laminar cross-flow regime.

40|$|Dielectric {{spectroscopy}} {{in combination}} with temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry and quasielastic/inelastic neutron scattering are employed to investigate the molecular (glassy) dynamics of poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) and poly(methyl phenyl siloxane) (PMPS) confined to random nanoporous glasses with <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> <b>sizes</b> between 2. 5 nm and 20 nm. Inside the pores PDMS and PMPS have faster molecular dynamics than in the bulk state. Down to a <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of 7. 5 nm the temperature dependence of the relaxation times (or rates) obeys the Vogel/Fulcher/Tammann (VFT) equation where the data obtained from dielectric and thermal spectroscopy agree quantitatively. At a <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> of 5 nm this VFT-like temperature dependence changes to an Arrhenius behavior. At the same confining length scale the increment of the specific heat capacity at T-g normalized to {{the weight of the}} confined polymer vanishes. The results indicate that a minimal length scale seems to be relevant for glassy dynamics in both polymers although the estimated length scale of about 5 nm seems to a bit too large in comparison to other experimental results and theoretical approaches. Neutron scattering is employed to investigate methyl group reorientation and the fast segmental dynamics of both polymers in confinement. Although the methyl group rotation is a localized process these experiments show that a part of the methyl groups is immobilized by the confinement whereas the effects for PDMS are much more pronounced than for PMPS. With regard to the segmental dynamics, neutron scattering reveals a big difference in the behavior of both polymers. Whereas the data obtained for PMPS are in accord with a boundary layer formed at the surfaces of the nanopores, for PDMS a considerable amount of elastic scattering is observed. To explain this result it is assumed that some structure formation of PDMS takes place in the nanopores, although the thermal data show no crystallization or melting effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

There was high discrepancy between the measured <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> and manufacturer data. Our study also examined the effect of asymmetry in <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> distribution of the membranes as compared to symmetric membranes. The asymmetric membranes were found to give smaller <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> compared to symmetric membranes. The orientation of asymmetric membranes provided different results for the mean <b>pore</b> <b>size.</b> A comparison between the classical approach and modified approach to analyze the data and thus in the estimation of transport parameter was made. Better correlation of measured and estimated transport parameter was found for modified approach as compared to classical approach. In addition modified approach determines the tortuosity for each <b>pore</b> <b>size</b> range during the estimation of transport parameters. The average tortuosity of the membranes under study varied from 0. 707 to 6. 48 with larger <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> membranes having higher values compared to smaller ones. This research also studied the transport of particles through the symmetric membranes. Theoretical model based on sieving was examined. The actual rejection increased for more tortuous membranes in comparison to theoretical rejection prediction with the difference being greater for the highest tortuosity. With this study, we hope to further elucidate the characterization of membranes via porometry and hope to provide useful information regarding the development and end use of these membranes...|$|R
40|$|Anodic alumina {{materials}} exhibiting regular pore structure, microporosity, {{and extensive}} surface areas were prepared and characterized. The effects of current density, (J = 12 - 35 mA/cm 2), anodization time (t = 30 - 150 min), and hydrothermal treatment on pore structure were investigated. Nitrogen sorption hysteresis was simulated using the corrugated pore structure model (CPSM). <b>Pore</b> <b>size</b> distributions, relative specific surface area (SCPSM/Sext = 870 - 8645), microporosity (max ∼ 33. 0 %), pore tortuosity (TCPSM = 3. 1 - 5. 7), pore connectivity (c = 3. 02 - 4. 85, Seaton's model), and <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> length values (i. e., Ns = 3 - 10, from CPSM, and L = 0. 91 - 1. 20, Seaton) were evaluated. <b>Pore</b> <b>sizes</b> dpore > 13 nm deduced via CPSM simulation of gas sorption data were also detected by SEM imaging. A minimum external surface pore density of ∼ 7. 5 × 1010 pores/cm 2 was evaluated from the SEM micrograph. Anodization {{conditions and the}} following treatment caused a severe pore structure change. Pore tortuosity (TCPSM) changes inversely proportionally to pore connectivity (c), while the <b>nominal</b> <b>pore</b> length (Ns) varies proportionally {{to the number of}} pore length (L). It is concluded that materials possessing microporosity, regular pore architectures, and high surface areas can become potential candidate membranes for gas separation and catalytic reaction applications. They can also be used as templates in electrochemical applications (e. g., solar and fuel cells) ...|$|R
