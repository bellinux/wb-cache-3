[...] David Clayman, writer for IGN, gave Saw a 7.5 {{out of a possible}} ten, earning it a rating of [...] "Good". Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw is a welcome entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills. Depending on your tolerance for repetition, it's a good way to test your nerves and scare yourself silly during a dark and stormy night.|$|E
500|$|Williams's role in AC/DC was {{to provide}} steady but basic bass lines which {{followed}} the rhythm guitar of Malcolm Young, consisting mostly of eighth notes. His basslines were sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, {{and at other times}} Williams developed them based on the other instrumental tracks. Williams said he plays [...] "the same thing in every song, for the most part. In AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it." [...] He added that [...] "complex [...] lines wouldn't add anything to a guitar-oriented band like ours, so I try to create a bottom layer that drives what our guys are doing on top." [...] Williams had no difficulty keeping his low profile within the band, declaring that [...] "I don't have any problem doing this, because I enjoy playing simply. I <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> angry or prisoner." [...] His playing technique was mostly centred around downpicking, with occasional use of plucking to mute the strings, which he says [...] "adds more definition and tightens up the notes, and it gives the sound less sustain".|$|E

Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons".

500|$|Māori {{academic}} Rawiri Taonui {{agreed that}} the film portrays indigenous people as being simplistic and unable to defend themselves without the help from [...] "the white guys and the neo-liberals." [...] Another author remarked that while the white man will fix the destruction, he will <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> guilty, {{even though he is}} directly responsible for the destruction." [...] Likewise, Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Die Zeit in Germany, said the film perpetuates the myth of the [...] "noble savage" [...] and has [...] "a condescending, yes, even racist message. Cameron bows to the noble savages. [...] However, he reduces them to dependents." [...] Slavoj Žižek argued that [...] "the film enables us to practise a typical ideological division: sympathising with the idealised aborigines while rejecting their actual struggle." [...] The Irish Times carried the comment that [...] "despite all the thematic elements from Hinduism, one thing truly original is the good old American ego. Given its Hollywood origins, the script has remained faithful to the inherent superiority complex, and has predictably bestowed the honor of the 'avatar' not on the movie’s native Na’vis, but on a white American marine." [...] Similarly, positing that [...] "the only good humans [...] are dead—or rather, resurrected as 'good Navi'", a writer in The Jerusalem Post thought that the film was inadvertently promoting supremacy of one race over another.|$|E

Quoting that its attack on the Muñiz Air base had been cited as [...] "causing more damage [...] in one day than a month in Vietnam", the EBP urged the masses to mimic the actions of Lares, the attack at Sabana Seca and the FALN attack on Fraunces bar in order to [...] "shake up the government" [...] and [...] "awake the people". In their opinion, this would force a move away from a political environment that [...] "forced [...] to live in fear of losing what little they have", expressing a lack of concern as being [...] "labeled as radicals" [...] and excluded by other pro-independence organizations, summarizing its posture by stating that [...] " [...] <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> excluded due to a la of fear to losing [...] being [...] identity", [...] "not fearing sanctions, persecution, jail or death". Claiming to be ready for a [...] "prolonged struggle" [...] independent of [...] "a desire for adventure" [...] or influenced by [...] "anarchy [...] sectarism", the EBP closed this intervention by requesting the left create an unified thesis that enables it to [...] "move from theory to practice", by using armed resistance [...] "to break with dependency and immovilism".|$|E

500|$|Before {{the end of}} 1971, the Kinks {{signed a}} five-album deal with RCA Records and {{received}} a million-dollar advance, which helped fund the construction of their own recording studio, Konk. Their debut for RCA, Muswell Hillbillies, was replete with the influence of music hall and traditional American musical styles, including country and bluegrass. It is often hailed as their last great record, {{though it was not}} as successful as its predecessors. It was named after Muswell Hill, where the Davies brothers were brought up, and contained songs focusing on working-class life and, again, the Davies' childhood. Muswell Hillbillies, despite positive reviews and high expectations, peaked at number 48 on the Record World chart and number 100 on the Billboard chart. It was followed in 1972 by a double album, Everybody's in Show-Biz, which consisted of both studio tracks and live numbers recorded during a two-night stand at Carnegie Hall. The record featured the ballad [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] and the Caribbean-themed [...] "Supersonic Rocket Ship", their last UK Top 20 hit for more than a decade. [...] "Celluloid Heroes" [...] is a bitter-sweet rumination on dead and fading Hollywood stars (Mickey Rooney was still alive), in which the narrator declares that he wishes his life were like a movie, [...] "because celluloid heroes <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> any pain ... and celluloid heroes never really die." [...] The album was moderately successful in the United States, peaking at number 47 in Record World and number 70 in Billboard. It marks the transition between the band's early 1970s rock material and the theatrical incarnation in which they immersed themselves for the next four years.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} was not void of criticism. Although Richard Corliss of Time thoroughly enjoyed the film, {{he felt that}} too much {{emphasis was placed on}} Flynn Rider and not enough on Rapunzel. Corliss questioned the future of Disney's animated heroines, writing, [...] "For 60 years ... girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age, triumph over adversity and, in general, man up," [...] and accused various film studios of [...] "abolish female-centered stories." [...] Variety's Justin Chang described Rapunzel as a [...] "bland, plastic" [...] heroine, likening her to a Barbie doll. Similarly, Tom Huddleston of Time Out described Rapunzel as [...] "bland". James Berardinelli of ReelViews was fairly mixed in his review, writing, [...] "although likeable and energetic, [...] is not as memorable as Snow White, Ariel, or Belle." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the character as [...] "synthetic". He wrote, [...] "you <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> like you're watching a girl on the empowering cusp of adulthood so much as a selection of attitudes compiled through demographic study." [...] The Independents Anthony Quinn panned the character, describing her as [...] "bland and Valley Girlish". Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined, [...] "when the big-eyed heroine tries to tug at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming, the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas." [...] Similarly, the SouthtownStars Jake Coyle wrote, [...] "Both Rapunzel and Flynn too much resemble Barbie and Ken, lacking both superficial and emotional individuality." [...] Jen Yamato of Movies.com criticized Disney for [...] "failing to give Rapunzel a backbone and retreading ground so familiar you can fall asleep for ten minutes and still know exactly what happened".|$|E
500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't feel my legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Cameron Urquhart scored it 4 out of 5. He praised how {{the game}} used factual {{historical}} information in its fictional narrative, {{and was also}} impressed with the graphics, sound and voice acting.

2500|$|With {{a murder}} rate of 1.8/per 100.000 people (...) Sofia is a quite safe capital city. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, crimes, {{including}} Bulgarian mafia killings, caused {{problems in the}} city, where authorities had difficulties convicting the actors, which had caused the European Commission to warn the Bulgarian government that the country {{would not be able}} to join the EU unless it curbed crime (Bulgaria eventually joined in 2007). Many of the most severe crimes are contract killings connected to the organised crime, but these had dropped in recent years after several arrests of gang members. Corruption in Bulgaria also affects Sofia's authorities. According to the director of Sofia District Police Directorate the largest share of the crimes are thefts, making up 62.4% of all crimes in the capital city. Increasing are frauds, drug-related crimes, petty theft and vandalism. According to a survey, almost a third of Sofia's residents say that they <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> safe in the Bulgarian capital, while 20% always feel safe. [...] the consumer-reported perceived crime risk on the Numbeo database was [...] "high" [...] for theft and vandalism and [...] "low" [...] for violent crimes; safety while walking during daylight was rated [...] "very high", and [...] "moderate" [...] during the night.

2500|$|A {{critical}} {{evaluation of}} Sămănătorism {{and its impact}} was still {{an important factor in}} cultural and political developments after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 succeeded in toppling communism. During the cultural debates of the early 1990s, literary historian and social critic Adrian Marino argued that the European integration of post-Revolution Romania was being held back by issues relating to its [...] "fundamental social structure" [...] and [...] "the psychology specific to all shut-in traditional communities", since: [...] "A rural and inescapably ethnicist, conservative, isolationist, traditionalist, Sămănătorist, populist Romania will <b>never</b> <b>feel</b> the need for 'Europe'. On the contrary, it will perceive in it a grave danger for the preservation of the 'national being'." [...] In contrast to this situation, he placed his hopes for change with the young, educated and urban middle class familiarizing itself directly with Western culture or pre-communist cultural alternatives to Sămănătorism. Similarly, writer and critic Gheorghe Crăciun negatively assessed that Sămănătorul, alongside other defunct traditionalist publications, continued to dominate the standard reception of Romanian culture, particularly in matters of the Romanian curriculum after the year 2000. State-sponsored education, he assessed, rated Coșbuc and Goga higher than their modernist counterparts Ion Barbu and George Bacovia, and, overall, favored the [...] "parochial, peasant, epic, ethnographic and dazed-metaphysical" [...] elements in Romanian literature. In contrast, Valeriu Râpeanu listed Sămănătorul and Gândirea among the magazines with [...] "essential contributions to asserting Romanian thought", and argued: [...] "Speaking disparagingly about Sămănătorism, and in particular by deeming Sămănătorism an obsolete, backward vision lacking any literary value, has even become an act by means of which one invokes one's own aesthetic high ground." ...|$|E
