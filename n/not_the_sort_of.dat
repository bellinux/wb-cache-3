This attack appears to be calling me a Nazi, nothing less. I demand that Mr. Storr refer me to the original sources to which we assume he has referred.

25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E

At one point it ranked seventh {{at the box office}} in France, while in the United States it proceeded to enter the Los Angeles Times list of top ten films. American director Roger Corman congratulated Warren on the film and considered commissioning him for further productions. However, a private screening had failed to impress members of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, who dismissed Inseminoid as [...] "'Commercial rubbish! ... <b>Not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing the Academy should be showing ...

[...] Richard Roeper awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, [...] "When Ferreira finally appears and we learn the truth about where he's been all this time, it further serves Scorsese's central theme about the conflict between adhering to one's sacred vows and traditional beliefs and doing the right thing, the prudent thing, the moral thing, on a very pragmatic level." ...|$|E

The song [...] "talks about adults who act like children and children who think they're adults". Siouxsie explained: [...] "It's about the cruelty of children and that whole aspect of being thrown out into the playground in the winter in howling gales and left to fend for yourself. It's <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing you're supposed to write pop songs about". It was the band's third single {{in less than a}} year and [...] "probably the best", according to the music historian Clinton Heylin. The single did not sound catchy, but it nevertheless entered the top 30. Severin later recalled the head of A at Polydor telling him he expected a commercial failure.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Eick {{opined that}} [...] "33" [...] was the [...] "silver bullet" [...] that ultimately tipped the scales {{in their favor}} and convinced the Sci Fi Channel {{to pick up the}} series. [...] The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (Star Trek, Andromeda, Stargate). [...] Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] First, [...] "33" [...] went into Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) mind and visited his house on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia); being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> imagery expected of space opera-type shows.

There is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> revelry one would expect in a tale about a miniature household but rather a [...] "desperate sense" [...] of wanting to keep that household free of invaders and unwanted outsiders. The Tale of Two Bad Mice is another tale about a miniature household, but there Potter {{is on the side of}} the invading two bad mice. Mrs. Tittlemouse is concerned as much about middle class proprieties as the dolls Lucinda and Jane in The Tale of Two Bad Mice but, in Mrs. Tittlemouse, Potter is on the side of the invaded rather than the invaders, who are purely animals with no human characteristics.|$|E

500|$|Terence Stamp as Colonel General Ludwig Beck: Singer met Stamp {{to discuss}} playing {{a part in}} X-Men, having admired him for portraying General Zod in Superman II. Stamp endured the Blitz {{as a child and}} aided Singer in staging a scene where the von Stauffenbergs hide from the Allied bombings. The actor {{described}} his approach to acting: he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> actor who puts on a mask; rather, he tries to find the place within himself that resonates with the characters he portrays saying that [...] "here has {{to be a kind of}} non-judgmental discernment, so when I'm playing villains, they don't think they're particularly villains." [...] Singer said of his direction of Stamp as the heroic and selfless Beck that he sought to find [...] "the part of Terence that would be prepared to fall on his sword for certain ideals" [...] just as Beck had in fact done after being arrested with his co-conspirators for treason.|$|E
500|$|Grissom {{announced}} his retirement just as evidence comes to light that The Dick and Jane Killer, a serial killer from the 1990s currently serving two life sentences, did not act alone, and that his accomplice had begun killing again. Rather than leave {{in the middle of}} a case, Grissom stayed on to help solve it, and ultimately proved instrumental in saving the life of a woman who would have been the killer's latest victim. The case closed, Grissom, having already had a series of one-on-one farewells with his co-workers, silently left the crime lab and departed for Costa Rica for a reunion with fiancée Sara Sidle, an allusion perhaps to his comments in a [...] episode that when he left, people would not throw a party for him because he was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> person who people would get deeply involved with. He also says to Warrick in season two ("Ellie") that when he left there would not be a cake in the break room—he would just pick up and leave.|$|E
500|$|Button, Barrichello, Kubica, Sutil, Buemi, de la Rosa, Petrov, Liuzzi, and Hülkenberg {{were all}} issued with five second-time {{penalties}} by the stewards for exceeding the safety car-in lap time. The finishing positions of Button, Barrichello, Kubica, Sutil and Liuzzi were unchanged, but the penalty issued to Buemi moved him from seventh to ninth, allowing Alonso to finish eighth. Rosberg inherited tenth position as de la Rosa moved to twelfth {{in the final}} race classification. Glock was awarded a 20-second time penalty for failing to observe blue flags. Ninth-place finisher Alonso criticised the race stewards, and felt the race had been fixed after they took longer than expected to issue Hamilton's penalty. The Vice-President of Ferrari, Piero Ferrari stated that he was [...] "incredulous and bitter, not just for Ferrari, but for the sport as a whole, as this is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing one expects from professionals." [...] Other teams – including Red Bull, Lotus and McLaren – rejected Alonso's accusations, with Lotus' technical director Mike Gascoyne stating [...] "changing the safety car regulations had opened up a set of scenarios {{that had never been}} anticipated before. Hamilton passing the safety car is the only recorded example of a driver doing so in the modern era of Formula One." [...] Ferrari subsequently argued for a change of safety car rules to prevent a similar situation reoccurring.|$|E
