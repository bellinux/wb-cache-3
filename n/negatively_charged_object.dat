50|$|Charge is {{the measure}} of the {{electric}} current flowing through an object. A charge can be positive or negative — objects with a positive charge repel other positively charged objects, thereby causing them to push away from each other, while a positively charged object would attract to a <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object,</b> thereby causing the two to draw together. Electrostatic charges are the charges associated with static electricity. Generally, electrostatic charges can build up by friction and can be observed when a balloon attracts a person's hair after the balloon is rubbed against the person's head.|$|E
50|$|Franklin’s theory {{stated that}} {{electricity}} should {{be thought of}} as the movement of a single liquid, as opposed to the interaction between two liquids. A body would show signs of electricity when it held either too much, or too little of this liquid. A neutral object was therefore thought to contain a “normal” amount of this fluid. Franklin also outlined two possible states of electrification, positive and negative. He argued that a positively charged object would contain too much fluid, while a <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> would contain too little fluid. Franklin was able to apply this thinking by explaining unexplained phenomena of the time, such as the Leyden jar, a basic charge storing device similar to a battery. He argued that the wire and inner surface became positively charged, while the outer surface became negatively charged. This caused an imbalance in fluid, and a person touching both portions of the jar allowed the fluid to flow normally.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{possible}} influence analogy making may have upon emotions experienced in everyday life. More specifically we address the question of whether emotions inherently associated with one domain tend to be transferred to another domain via analogical mapping connections. In an experiment we demonstrate that emotional appraisal is indeed a subject to analogical transfer. We also find a substantive difference between the situation in which the two domains are meaningfully mapped and the situation in which these are simply associated because of being encountered simultaneously. We also demonstrate that at least in cases when there is no clear distinction between the two domains in terms of which domain is the base and which domain is the target there is a bidirectional emotional transfer which affects emotional attitudes towards objects from both the domains. Thus whenever a positively charged object is mapped onto a <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> the positively charged object receives negative valence from the <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> and vice versa...|$|E

Therefore, the conventional current in a wire or resistor always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage.

This is the case within any electric power source. For example, inside a battery, chemical reactions provide the energy needed for ion current to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} of microscopic particles such as growth factors, proteins, or drugs through the extracellular matrix (ECM) {{is based on}} diffusion, a ubiquitous mechanism in nature. The ECM shapes the local distribution of the transported macromolecules {{and at the same}} time constitutes an important barrier toward infectious agents. To fulfill these competing tasks, the hydrogels have to employ highly selective filtering mechanisms. Yet, the underlying microscopic principles are still an enigma in cell biology and drug delivery. Here, we show that the extracellular matrix presents an effective electrostatic bandpass, suppressing the diffusive motion of both positively and <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> <b>objects.</b> This mechanism allows uncharged particles to easily diffuse through the matrix, while charged particles are effectively trapped. However, by tuning the strength of this physical interaction of the particles with the biopolymer matrix, the microscopic mobility of formerly trapped particles can be rescued on demand. Moreover, we identify heparan sulfate chains to be one important key factor for the barrier function of the extracellular matrix. We propose that localized charge patches in the ECM are responsible for its highly unspecific but strongly selective filtering effect. Such localized interactions could also account for the observed tunability and selectivity of many other important permeability barriers that are established by biopolymer-based hydrogels, e. g., the mucus layer of endothelial cells or the hydrogel in the nuclear core complex...|$|R

They may exhibit exceptional properties: bound neutral (e. g., 4 M 2 &# 923; 2 n, 10 M 2 &# 923; 8 n, pure &# 923; droplets, 8 &# 923;) and even <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> composites <b>objects</b> with positive baryon number (e. g., 4 M 2 &# 931;- 2 n, 6 M 2 &# 923; 2 &# 926;- 2 n) could be formed in rare events. Such negative nuclei can easily be identified in a magnetic spectrometer. They could be considerably more abundant than antinuclei of the same A. We use the relativistic meson-baryon field theory—which gives an excellent description of normal nuclear and single-&# 923; hypernuclear properties—to calculate the rich spectrum of such exotic objects, their stability, and their structure. We also find solutions for a large variety of bound short-lived nuclei (e. g., 8 M 2 &# 923;, 2 &# 931;- 2 p 2 n), which may decay strongly via formation of cascade (&# 926;) particles. Multi-&# 926; hypernuclei are also evaluated. A variety of potential candidates for such metastable exotic nuclei is presented. It turns out that the properties of such exotic multihypernuclear objects reveal quite similar features as the strangelet proposed as a unique signature for quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy ion collisions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a planar stiff model membrane consisting of mobile surface groups whose {{state of charge}} depends on the pH and the ionic composition of the adjacent electrolyte solution. To calculate the mean-field interaction potential between a <b>charged</b> <b>object</b> and such a model membrane, one needs to solve a Poisson–Boltzmann boundary value problem. We here derive and discuss the boundary condition at the membrane surface, a condition that is generally appropriate for biological membranes where two charge-regulating mechanisms are present at the same time: the pH-dependent chemical charge regulation and a regulation through the in-plane mobility of the surface groups. As an application of this general formalism, we consider the specific example of a single DNA molecule, approximated by a cylinder with smeared-out surface charges, interacting with such a model membrane. We study {{the effect that the}} two competing charge-regulating mechanisms have on the DNA/membrane interaction and the distribution of surface ions in the plane of the membrane. We find that, at short DNA–membrane distances, membrane fluidity can have a considerable impact on the DNA adsorption behavior and can lead to such counterintuitive phenomena as the adsorption of a <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> DNA onto a (on average) <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> membrane...|$|R

The positively charged islet amyloid polypeptide partially inserts into these membranes and subsequently forms amyloid fibrils. The amyloid fibril formation of insulin is also accelerated {{by the presence}} of <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> lipids, although insulin has a negative net charge at neutral pH-values. We used water-polymer model interfaces to differentiate between the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that can drive these peptides to adsorb at an interface. By applying neutron reflectometry, the scattering-length density profiles of IAPP and insulin, as adsorbed at three different water-polymer interfaces, were determined. The islet amyloid polypeptide most strongly adsorbed at a hydrophobic poly-(styrene) surface, whereas at a hydrophilic, <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> poly-(styrene sulfonate) interface, the degree of adsorption was reduced by 50 %. Almost no IAPP adsorption was evident at this <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> interface when we added 100 mM NaCl. On the other hand, <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> insulin was most strongly attracted to a hydrophilic, <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> interface. Our results suggest that IAPP is strongly attracted to a hydrophobic surface, whereas the few positive charges of IAPP cannot warrant a permanent immobilization of IAPP at a hydrophilic, <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> surface at an ionic strength of 100 mM. Furthermore, the interfacial accumulation of insulin at a hydrophilic, <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> surface may represent a favorable precondition for nucleus formation and fibril formation...|$|R

30|$|Another {{critical}} factor which influences cellular uptake of NPs is surface charge. In the recent decade, nano surface modification has been employed to engineer the surface charge of NPs {{to be either}} cationic or anionic [92]. The <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> CM enhances the uptake of positively charged NPs. In particular, positively charged NPs have higher internalization than neutral and <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs [47, 120]. However, the uptake of positively charged NPs may disrupt the integrity of CM and {{lead to an increase}} in toxicity [121, 122]. In general, positively charged NPs induce cell death [123, 124]. Interestingly, neutrally charged NPs will lower the cellular uptake as compared to <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs [110, 125 – 127]. Moreover, the internalization of <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> NPs leads to gelation of membranes, while positively charged NPs cause fluidity in the CM [128, 129]. In addition to the uptake rate of NP, surface charges also affect the uptake mechanisms. More specifically, positively charged NPs are mainly internalized by the cell via macropinocytosis whereas clathrin-/caveolae-independent endocytosis is the mechanism for the uptake of <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> NP [130]. Cellular uptake pathways vary when the surface of the AuNPs is coated by organic molecules. For instance, plain AuNPs which are positively charged, are internalized via macropinocytosis and clathrin and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, while <b>negatively</b> <b>charged</b> polyethylene glycol (PEG) coated AuNPs are mainly internalized via caveolin- and/or clathrin-mediated endocytosis [131].|$|R
