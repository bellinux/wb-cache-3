5|$|Rivalry between Brooks and Clayton predated the 1868 election. Clayton saw Brooks as {{his strongest}} {{competitor}} for preference and distinction and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become too entrenched {{with the party}} leadership. Brooks felt that his ability and service to the party were not being recognized or appreciated, and he grew bitter and resentful of the other Republicans, including Clayton.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Selena's {{brother and}} former {{principal}} record producer A.B. Quintanilla III, known as A.B., {{was planning to}} quit music and leave the Kumbia All-Starz, the successor of Kumbia Kings. Their father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., told A.B. that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> quit music, saying that his dream was that his children would continue {{in the music industry}} and never give up. In 2009, after performing to an enthusiastic crowd in Bolivia, A.B. decided to continue recording music.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, via flashbacks, we {{find out}} that Nicky (Fionnula Flanagan) is not a human but an Indogene {{disguised}} as a human. Hunter Bell had witnessed one of her meetings with Doc Yewll (Trenna Keating) and Nicky, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> expose her, she killed him. Jered witnessed the murder and now that the dead body was found, Nicky killed her too so she will not talk.|$|R

5|$|He {{joined his}} {{hometown}} football club, AIK Bačka Topola, as a youngster, and graduated {{to the senior}} side in 1998–99. He began as a centre back, but soon realised he preferred scoring goals to defending. Žigić's parents did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take football seriously until he completed his education, and he remained with AIK Bačka Topola until 2001, scoring 68 goals in 76 matches in the Serbian League Vojvodina, the third level of Yugoslav football. When military service took him to Bar, {{he was able to}} play for the local club, Mornar, for whom he scored 15 goals from 23 appearances in the 2001–02 Second League of FR Yugoslavia. After trials in France with Saint-Étienne and Créteil came to nothing, Žigić returned home where he played 8 matches for third-tier club Kolubara, scoring 3 goals.|$|E
5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s. As a result, Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4100m medley relay.|$|E
50|$|The {{photos of}} the couple add to Ruth's sense of isolation, and she decides {{to work in the}} tunnel as a nurse. There she is {{affected}} by an unknown gas afflicting the workers and loses her eyesight. Worried that her husband no longer loves her and <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay with her out of pity, Ruth leaves McAllan, taking their son with her. Heartbroken at her unexplained departure, McAllan throws himself into the project, alienating Robbins in the process.|$|R
60|$|But {{the worst}} of her ways was about powder, and her <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have it, or <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have it where there was fire. She would never let him come near the stove with it, {{after one of the}} fellows had tried to dry his powder on the stove when it had got wet from being pumped on in his jacket-pocket while he was {{drinking}} at the pump, and the fellow forgot to take it off the stove quick enough, and it almost blew his mother up, and did pretty nearly scare her to death; and she would not let him keep it in a bottle, or anything, but just loose in a paper, because another of the fellows had begun to pour powder once from a bottle onto a coal of fire, and the fire ran up the powder, and blew the bottle to pieces, and filled the fellow's face so full of broken glass that the doctor was nearly the whole of that Fourth of July night getting it out. So, although she was a good mother in some things, she was a bad mother in others, and these were the great things; and they were what gave <b>him</b> the right <b>to</b> run off.|$|R
50|$|Fielding was a {{standout}} sprinter for Metuchen High School in Metuchen, New Jersey. Fielding's speed {{was such that}} the Metuchen athletic director steered <b>him</b> toward track, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get hurt playing football. He soon became a statewide success and {{was followed by the}} state's largest newspaper, the Newark Star Ledger. Fielding ran the 40 yard dash in 4.2 seconds, a United States schoolboy record at the time, the 100 yard dash in a wind-assisted 9.2 seconds, and the 220 yard sprint in under 21 seconds.|$|R
25|$|Ruggiero {{is taken}} captive by the sorceress Alcina {{and has to}} be freed from her magic island.

Finally, Ruggiero {{converts}} to Christianity and marries Bradamante.|$|E
25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later {{admitted}} that, in reality, he was unsure of whether he had taught evolution (another reason the defense did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> testify), but the point was not contested at the trial.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{moved his}} family to Hartford, Connecticut, where he {{arranged}} {{the building of a}} home starting in 1873. In the 1870s and 1880s, the family summered at Quarry Farm in Elmira, the home of Olivia's sister, Susan Crane. In 1874, Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that Twain would have a quiet place in which to write. Also, he smoked cigars constantly, and Susan did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do so in her house.|$|E
5000|$|Smurthwaite {{invested}} £500,000 {{into the}} playing budget {{in order to}} help Micky Adams strengthen the squad. Despite <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign, once Adams left the club Smurthwaite initiated a policy of experimenting with young players in the hope of turning a profit from player sales in the future. Smurthwaite did cause controversy however by telling a reporter that supporters who only attended away matches (due partly to Vale Park's high ticket costs) [...] "disgusted" [...] him and that they should [...] "go and support another club".|$|R
25|$|Following this defeat McCarthy's two-year {{contract}} {{came to an}} end and it was expected that he would be replaced as manager, however, he was later re-appointed for a further two-year term by the Cork County Board, in spite {{of the majority of the}} players <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay on. The players on the 2008 panel led by Donal Óg Cusack then refused to play or train under McCarthy. (see 2008-2009 Cork players strike). McCarthy accordingly began the 2009 league campaign with a new squad, none of whom had been able to make the previous year's panel.|$|R

25|$|There {{were many}} suspicions that corrupt figures in {{authority}} had helped Leggio avoid justice, {{with plenty of}} suspicion falling on the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo. Pentiti Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno later said Leggio personally shot Scaglione dead because he either did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help deliver an acquittal {{for one of the}} Corleonesi boss's rivals or {{he did not want to}} leave someone who knew a lot of his secrets alive. Leggio would later be tried twice for killing Scaglione but was acquitted for insufficient evidence.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{up to the}} fight, Sonny Liston was {{the major}} betting-line favorite, though Sports Illustrated {{predicted}} that Patterson would win in 15 rounds. Jim Braddock, Jersey Joe Walcott, Ezzard Charles, Rocky Marciano and Ingemar Johansson picked Patterson to win. The fight also carried a number of social implications. Liston's connections with the mob were well known and the NAACP was concerned about {{having to deal with}} Liston's visibility as World Champion and had encouraged Patterson not to fight Liston, fearing that a Liston victory would tarnish the civil rights movement. Patterson also claimed that John F. Kennedy did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fight Liston either.|$|E
25|$|Eddie {{is first}} seen reading a {{newspaper}} mentioning his second cousin Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) {{and decides to}} visit as he has not seen him for 15 years and wants to see Alfie's son, Tommy, but is hit by Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) car outside The Queen Victoria public house. When he comes to, he argues with Carol and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) asks who he is. At that point, Alfie enters and recognises Eddie. Kat does not want Eddie to stay as she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> know that Michael is Tommy's birth father. Michael sees Eddie in the pub but leaves immediately as {{he does not want}} to speak to him. Alfie later tells Eddie that Tommy is his grandson.|$|E

As Paakhi prepares to leave Rathod Mansion, her brother-in-law convinces her Anshuman is in love with her and not Tanya. Paakhi returns to Rathod mansion and asks for a week's challenge in exchange for the divorce. The challenge is that Tanya has to manage the household on a weekly budget.|$|R
25|$|She invites {{one of the}} detectives, Kenji Mamiya (真宮 賢治 Mamiya Kenji, Satoshi Nikaido), back to the {{high-rise}} apartment {{she shares}} with her father. Wrongly supposing that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off the balcony and that she witnessed this herself. It turns out the detectives are investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him. He resists her approaches but comforts her as she bursts into tears. Before he leaves, Chieko writes him a note, indicating that she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> read it until he is gone.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 2008, Robin catches Patrick and Epiphany (Sonya Eddy) in {{some sort}} of cahoots against her. She thinks that they are conspiring to {{convince}} her to start her maternity leave early. She then goes to meet with a patient, when Patrick gets on the PA system and declares his love for Robin. Robin rushes to the nurses' station. Patrick proposes in front of all of their friends and other loved ones. While everyone is looking at Robin, she becomes so overwhelmed and leaves, leaving Patrick devastated. Patrick follows her to the park, where she is crying.

She tells him that she loves him, but that she cannot marry him, and walks away, leaving Patrick heartbroken.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener and Asquith were {{agreed that}} Robertson should become CIGS, but Robertson {{refused to do}} this if Kitchener “continued to be his own CIGS”, {{although}} given Kitchener’s great prestige he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> resign; he wanted the Secretary of State to be sidelined to an advisory role like the Prussian War Minister. Asquith asked them to negotiate an agreement, which they did over the exchange of several draft documents at the Hotel de Crillon in Paris. Kitchener agreed that Robertson alone should present strategic advice to the Cabinet, with Kitchener responsible for recruiting and supplying the Army, although he refused to agree that military orders should go out over Robertson’s signature alone – {{it was agreed that}} the Secretary of State should continue to sign orders jointly with the CIGS. The agreement was formalised in a Royal Order in Council in January 1916. Robertson was suspicious of efforts in the Balkans and Near East, and was instead committed to major British offensives against Germany on the Western Front— the first of these was to be the Somme in 1916.|$|E

Around then is when Carrington convinces himself that it's his duty to {{continue}} fighting and he leaves Marlene's estate, not realizing he's now in a peacetime country. The only problem is, {{no one can tell}} him the war is over because no one around him speaks English including the Baroness' maid Eva who accompanies him.|$|R
