5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> cervix. It comprises a pair of lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma (NB) {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most {{frequently}} starts from one of the adrenal glands, but can also develop in the neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> head.|$|E

5|$|The {{brown bear}} and both species of black bears {{sometimes}} take large ungulates, such as deer and bovids, mostly {{the young and}} weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of dissection of the arteries in the neck. The other type, carotid artery dissection, involves the carotid arteries. Vertebral artery dissection is further classified as being either traumatic (caused by mechanical trauma to the <b>neck)</b> <b>or</b> spontaneous, and it may also be classified by the part of the artery involved: extracranial (the part outside the skull) and intracranial (the part inside the skull).|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after the rendering of animal fat). As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army {{awarded a}} variety of {{individual}} decorations (dona) for valour to its legionaries. Hasta pura was a miniature spear; phalerae were large medal-like bronze or silver discs worn on the cuirass; armillae were bracelets worn on the wrist; and torques were worn round the <b>neck,</b> <b>or</b> on the cuirass. The highest awards were the coronae ("crowns"), of which the most prestigious was the corona civica, a crown made of oak-leaves awarded for saving {{the life of a}} Roman citizen in battle. The most valuable award was the corona muralis, a crown made of gold awarded to the first man to scale an enemy rampart. This was awarded rarely, as such a man hardly ever survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, {{but it does}} not explain why he was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|E

5|$|The plane's {{landing gear}} {{mired in the}} water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the {{aircraft}} survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a broken <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer USS Williamson.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} {{behavioural}} {{theory is that}} the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal, and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size.|$|E

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{a common}} type of deep {{foundations}} used to support {{a wide array of}} infrastructure facilities such as bridges, high mast lighting, tanks and communication towers. The deep inaccessible subterranean nature and the construction procedures of drilled shafts result in various types of anomalies; most critical of which being necking and voids. This <b>necking</b> <b>or</b> voids translates to loss of concrete cover around the longitudinal bars and its subsequent exposure to the surrounding soil, leading to corrosion. An experimental study using large-scale drilled shaft samples is presented that evaluates the effect of different percentages of rebar corrosion on the axial load capacity of drilled shaft foundations. Results show that the presence of corrosion in the longitudinal bars affects both the strength and buckling capacity of a shaft, and that a 25 % <b>necking</b> <b>or</b> void area will result in more than 60 % of axial capacity loss of the shaft over a time period of 20 years.

5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the <b>neck</b> <b>or</b> spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E
