40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} superimposing certain types of 5 x 5 latin squares on a wheat uniformity trial. The purpose {{was to investigate the}} bias in the estimate of error when certain systematic squares (knight's move and diagonal) are chosen and to compare the results under conditions in Brazil with those obtained by Tedin in a similar investigation. The following conclusions are drawn : a) when latin squares are chosen by a random process, as recommended by Fisher, the observed distribution of the variance ratio of "treatments" compared with error is i <b>n</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> that given by theory; b) the estimation of error variance is biased when systematic squares are employed. In agreement with Tedin, we find that the knight's move square furnishes an overestimate, and the diagonal square an underestimate of error variance. The results show that, under the conditions of our trial, the systematic squares suffer from the same disadvantages which have been noted elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The Casimir {{energy for}} the {{transverse}} oscillations of a piecewise uniform closed string is calculated. The string consists of 2 N pieces of equal length, of alternating type I and type II material, and is taken to be relativistic {{in the sense that}} the velocity of sound always equals the velocity of light. By means of a new recursion formula we manage to calculate the Casimir energy for arbitrary integers <b>N.</b> <b>Agreement</b> <b>with</b> results obtained in earlier works on the string is found in all special cases. As basic regularization method we use the contour integration method. As a check, agreement is found with results obtained from the i function method (the Hurwitz function) in the case of low N (N = 1 - 4). The Casimir energy is generally negative, and the more so the larger is the value of N. We illustrate the results graphically in some cases.

40|$|A heat loop {{suitable}} {{for the study of}} thermal fouling and its relationship to corrosion processes was designed, constructed and tested. The design adopted was an improvement over those used by such investigators as Hopkins and the Heat Transfer Research Institute in that very low levels of fouling could be detected accurately, the heat transfer surface could be readily removed for examination and the chemistry of the environment could be carefully monitored and controlled. In addition, an indirect method of electrical heating of the heat transfer surface was employed to eliminate magnetic and electric effects which result when direct resistance heating is employed to a test section. The testing of the loop was done using a 316 stainless steel test section and a suspension of ferric oxide and water in an attempt to duplicate the results obtained by Hopkins. Two types of thermal ·fouling resistance versus time curves were obtained. (i) Asymptotic type fouling curve, similar to the fouling behaviour described by Kern and Seaton and other investigators, was the most frequent type of fouling curve obtained. Thermal fouling occurred at a steadily decreasing rate before reaching a final asymptotic value. (ii) If an asymptotically fouled tube was cooled with rapid cir- ·culation for periods up to eight hours at zero heat flux, and heating restarted, fouling recommenced at a high linear rate. The fouling results obtained were observed to be similar and 1 <b>n</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> the fouling behaviour reported previously by Hopkins and it was possible to duplicate quite closely the previous results. This supports the contention of Hopkins that the fouling results obtained were due to a crevice corrosion process and not an artifact of that heat loop which might have caused electrical and magnetic effects influencing the fouling. The effects of Reynolds number and heat flux on the asymptotic fouling resistance have been determined. A single experiment to study the effect of oxygen concentration has been carried out. The ferric oxide concentration for most of the fouling trials was standardized at 2400 ppM and the range of Reynolds number and heat flux for the study was 11000 - 29500 and 89 - 121 KW/M², respectively...|$|E
