5000|$|In his 2002 roman-à-clef Death of a Critic, Martin Walser attacks violently {{the most}} {{powerful}} literary critic in Germany, Marcel Reich-Ranicki, a Jew who had escaped the Warsaw ghetto. Walser criticised his person {{as much as his}} role as a symbol of a corrupted cultural milieu. This started a scandal where accusations of anti-Semitism, a war between newspapers and a power contest between personalities all played a role. Does a writer, especially one who {{had been a member of}} the Nazi party, have the right to attack the most well-known critic in Germany, former head of the arts and culture section of the country's most prestigious newspaper and host of a popular literary television show, a German national for more than fifty years? As soon as the novel came out, this question became the hot topic of debate in Germany. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>went</b> by without <b>a</b> newspaper article taking a stance for or against the book. And this with hardly anybody even having read it, because at the time, only a few advance copies were in circulation. Had Martin Walser allowed himself to employ anti-Semitic clichés when he chose to present to his readers Marcel Reich-Ranicki, thinly disguised behind the name of André Ehrl-König? Yes, said Frank Schirrmacher, head of the arts and culture section of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ), without hesitation. His was the first volley in the public debate. On 29 May, months before the book was to be officially released in August, Frank Schirrmacher wrote an open letter to Martin Walser to inform him that contrary to tradition, an excerpt from his book would not be published in the feuilleton of the FAZ because of the anti-Semitic clichés: [...] "This book is an execution, a settlement of accounts, a document of hate", he wrote. The FAZ continued to publish expressions of support for Marcel Reich-Ranicki, who was Schirrmacher's predecessor at the FAZ. Its arch-rival daily paper, the Süddeutsche Zeitung from Munich, closed ranks behind Walser. Writers for this liberal paper claimed to not find any anti-Semitic traits in Death of a Critic, but their stance may have had more prosaic reasons, too. Many of them had recently left the FAZ for the Süddeutsche and were engaged in ferocious competition.|$|R
40|$|<b>Not</b> <b>a</b> single <b>day</b> <b>goes</b> by {{in which}} {{academics}} receive {{one or more}} emails inviting them to attend a congress, meeting or symposium (CMS). Increasingly, most of these invitations are for attending CMSs that lie {{beyond the scope of}} their fields of research, and are usually characterized by images of grandeur and finesse, enticing the invitee with claims of international status, the pompous nature of the steering committee, or the meeting’s sheer size and dimension, including a list of famed participants. In other cases, emphasis is placed instead on the exotic nature of the location, and the invitation often sounds more like a travel brochure than an invitation to join a professional CMS. In several cases, a promise to publish the CMS proceedings in an indexed database is made. It is difficult to judge the veracity and significance of such meetings at a distance, even more so through an email. However, when the balance sheet is drawn up, and the costs are assessed, including of travel, accommodation and meals, it is clear to see that most CMSs are simply traps to make money, and that true academic discovery is a secondary, or more distant, objective.

Nefarious was Nolot's film debut. Filming started in 2007. Nolot travelled to 19 different countries to collect the film's content.

Nolot attested to having found producing the film difficult because of the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> that <b>goes</b> by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered". He further said that he did not make the film in order to make money or gain fame, but rather, to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue he finds both personal and important. Dan Preston of Godculture Magazine praised Nolot's writing and directing of the film. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing... to take a stand against this injustice".

[...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through it". But he also {{said that there}}'s {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|R
500|$|Filming of Nefarious {{was started}} in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan {{was to create a}} short film, but the project was {{expanded}} when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in Mike Bickle's International House of Prayer, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> that <b>goes</b> by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." [...] He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's cinematographers. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and editor, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included Bill Oberst Jr., Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the film score for Nefarious after having worked on such other projects as 16 Blocks, Constantine, The Book of Eli, and Lost. As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to Nefarious.|$|R
