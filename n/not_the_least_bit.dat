500|$|A {{correspondent}} from The Daily Telegraph visited Ellen about 22months {{after she}} fell ill. He wrote:The girl's face {{is by no}} means cadaverous. There is flesh on the cheeks, which have a pinkish tint, and there is some colour in the thin lips. The eyes are calmly closed, as though in healthy sleep. I ventured to raise one of the lids and touch the eye beneath... but there was not even a quivering of the eyelash.... The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> stiffened... It is not a skeleton hand, neither are any of the girl's limbs so emaciated as, under the extraordinary circumstances alleged, might be expected.... The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E

[...] The next afternoon, Cameron’s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart’s house [...] "…with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera...

Stuart wrote, [...] "I was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> nervous.

2500|$|The {{series has}} also {{received}} some strong criticism. Some reviewers {{argued that the}} earlier games were overly simplistic, that they developed mostly point and click skills, and they would provide {{only a few hours}} of entertainment. One set of reviewers took issue with the series' lack of replayability due to the games' simplicity. Conversely, other critics argued that the games were too challenging for the target audience and that the hardest games were excessively hard and that the games moved at a relatively slow pace. There were also technical criticisms of the games. These included slight technical glitches, and inferior graphics. The transitions between graphics and pictures were considered slow by some critics and the voice recordings seemed to have static contamination. Reviewers from Newsday said that in Madeline Thinking Games [...] "the music is dull (and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> French), the drawings are homogenized, the animation is about as basic as it gets." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{reads the}} {{pantomime}} scenario; {{what follows is}} Gautier's review of the piece:... the sight of this pantomime has filled our soul with melancholy. [...] What! [...] Pierrot, from whom of old one borrowed a pen—"to write a word"—and who loaned it so willingly, having <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>bit</b> of interest in it himself, has been reduced by the misery of the times to making it run from morning to night over musty old documents! ... Pierrot! no longer daring to wear his white blouse and his wide trousers! [...] Pierrot in a black suit! [...] And what a black suit! threadbare, tight, curled at the cuffs with age, its seams blackened with ink: a perfect poem of respectable misery! [...] —When he sits down, what pitiful angles his knees make! [...] How pointed his elbows are! [...] What a black gaze is in that pale and flour-covered face! [...] This is what has become of the joyous Pierrot of the pantomime. [...] Pierrot has a profession; Pierrot is employed. [...] He {{has been made to}} realize that a century as serious as our own will not suffer the idle!Gautier's remark about Legrand's black suit says something else about the mime: that he was as comfortable in character costume (Deburau initiated the practice) as he was in the garb of Pierrot. [...] About this Gautier was ambivalent: the [...] "truthfulness" [...] of Legrand's acting was unprecedented, but how welcome it was for the spectator still enchanted by the fantasy of Deburau's stage was a valid question: [...] "By virtue of the verisimilitude of his acting," [...] writes Gautier, [...] " [...] turns the fantastic type into a human character whose white face comes as a surprise. [...] He often even abandons the linen blouse and trousers, retaining only the plaster mask, in order to represent beings that are more real." [...] The [...] "realism" [...] of Legrand's pantomime marked a dramatic—and, for some, a disturbing—turn in the fortunes of Pierrot.|$|E
