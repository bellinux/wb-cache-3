5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his {{interest}} in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on Mona Lisa when he received payment for starting The Battle of Anghiari, which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February of 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, {{and he may have}} completed Mona Lisa many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.|$|E
5|$|In October 1975, the Opposition, led by Malcolm Fraser, {{determined}} to withhold supply by deferring consideration of appropriation bills. With Field on leave (his Senate appointment having been challenged), the Coalition had an effective majority of 30–29 in the Senate. The Coalition {{believed that if}} Whitlam could <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> supply, and would not advise new elections, Kerr would have to dismiss him. Supply would run out on 30November.|$|E
5|$|Operation Gisela did {{not achieve}} its {{intended}} outcome. It did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for {{and it did}} not disrupt British bombing operations. The very next night, a small-scale repeat-operation was attempted but had made no impact. The size of the German force was {{less than a quarter of}} what Schmid had originally hoped could be mustered. One source referred to Gisela as the swansong of the German night fighter force. During the course of the operation, the last German aircraft to be brought down over British soil crashed.|$|E

5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top of the skull, and the inability of the skull to survive rapid head blows.|$|E
5|$|Tekno Team 2000 was a {{professional}} wrestling tag team that competed in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1995 to 1996, composed of Travis and Troy (son of WWF writer Bill Watts). They started off with strong hype, but did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> on it, faltering after winning a few early matches. They {{were sent to the}} WWF's farm territory, United States Wrestling Association (USWA), for practice. After returning, they continued to lose matches and were soon released.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu {{into taking}} a {{container}} supposedly containing the Stone, {{and gives the}} real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, {{now known as the}} Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot.|$|E

5|$|Financial aid and {{incentives}} did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> {{the expected results}} for the hajduks, as they {{did not wish to}} settle in the assigned lands. Conflicts ensued between the hajduks and local people in Puljština, with kidnappings, hajduk attacks on fishermen and boats, and also revenge killings. The hajduks were enraged, and could not cope with the Istrian climate. Many of them moved to Senj, where the Uskoks were still active. During this time, Pivljanin and Njegošević were the most active in moving hajduks into the Habsburg Monarchy, and they travelled to Karlovac to negotiate. Some hajduks independently returned to the Bay of Kotor, where the provveditore of Kotor put some on galleys, imprisoned some at Klis, and exiled some, after killing others using old convictions as a pretext. When harambaša Njegošević was persecuted, the hajduks again sent Pivljanin to Venice as their envoy. In his plea to the Doge of Venice, dated 27March 1673, Pivljanin asked that the persecution of hajduks cease, stating that they had all been pardoned by an amnesty issued by Barbaro. The request was partly met, and some hajduks were freed.|$|E

25|$|Much {{speculation}} {{occurred over}} the date chosen for their attack. The original intended date of the attack may have been April 19; Harris required more ammunition from Mark Manes, who did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> it until the evening of April 19.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his father, Itzikl was a reticent sort, and did <b>not</b> <b>deliver</b> public discourses, as {{was common}} among other Hasidic rebbes. His successors {{generally}} did the same.

25|$|Dogs {{were often}} used to carry {{messages}} in battle. They would be turned loose to move silently to a second handler.
