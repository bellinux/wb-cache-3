50|$|It was {{constructed}} in 1979. In 1994 a pilot program was started to drain some water back into the floodplain. The outcome of the dam diverting vast amounts of water has negatively impacted communities downstream. Maga Dam {{is the subject of}} ongoing environmental studies which implicate the diversion of water, which served as <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> to downstream regions, as the primary cause of Lake Chad shrinkage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} lake has a shoreline {{of approximately}} 27 km and contains [...] of water. The Jachen {{is the natural}} outflow of the lake, eastwards through the valley of Jachenau to the Isar. Obernach is the largest <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> to the lake, which flows in from the southwest. Together with the artificial inflow (see [...] "Peculiarities"), the lake has a catchment basin of 780 km2.|$|E
30|$|To {{study the}} impact of {{uncertainty}} of natural flow on the MTHS, stochastic models are proposed in the literature. In [7], a stochastic optimization problem with Markov decision process models was developed allowing for the constraints of governmental regulations. In [8], a novel stochastic risk-constrained model was discussed. To consider the seasonal character and uncertainty of reservoir inflow, a composite optimization model was presented in [9]. A stochastic model with consideration of random water inflow and price errors was described by scenarios in [10]. And an energy equivalent reservoir model [11] {{was applied to the}} stochastic optimization of hydropower production decisions in the Brazilian power system. For cascaded hydropower systems, there are correlations among stations due to their dependence on a common river basin [12]. Typically, <b>natural</b> <b>inflows</b> of stations in the same river basin will increase or decrease synchronously under the influence of geographic factors. However, most reported literature focuses on the relationship between upstream and downstream reservoirs [13, 14], and considerations of correlation among <b>natural</b> <b>inflows</b> are limited. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the correlation of random <b>natural</b> <b>inflows</b> in MTHS problems.|$|R
50|$|Onkivesi is {{a rather}} large lake of Finland. It belongs to the Vuoksi main {{catchment}} area. It {{is located in the}} Northern Savonia region and mostly in Lapinlahti municipality.

25|$|At {{times of}} low {{electrical}} demand, excess generation capacity {{is used to}} pump water into the upper reservoir. When there is higher demand, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine, generating electricity. Reversible turbine/generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit (usually a Francis turbine design). In open-loop systems, pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no <b>natural</b> <b>inflows,</b> while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by <b>natural</b> <b>inflows</b> from a stream or river. Plants that do not use pumped-storage {{are referred to as}} conventional hydroelectric plants; conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed.|$|R

50|$|The {{power station}} uses the {{hydraulic}} head of about 200 m between the Walchensee (acting as the upper reservoir, at 802 m above sea level) and the Kochelsee (599 m a.s.l.) to generate electricity. Through six, 450 m ducts connecting the two natural lakes, the water flows to the hydro-electric plant's four Pelton water turbines with single-phase generators, and four Francis water turbines with three-phase generators, and then exits into the Kochelsee. Because {{the water level}} constantly changes, neither lake fully freezes in the winter; what does freeze on the lakes is potentially hazardous thin ice. The natural outflow of the Walchensee at Niedernach — over the Jachen to the River Isar — is blocked by a weir, but the <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> to the lake is still insufficient to provide enough water to the reservoir for {{the operation of the}} power station, so the waters of the Rißbach river are also used.|$|E

50|$|Lake Tazawa has {{a surface}} {{elevation}} of 249 meters, and its deepest point is 174.4 meters below sea level. Due to this depth, {{there is no}} possibility that the lake is frozen {{in the dead of}} winter. At 425 m, it is slightly deeper than Lake Shikotsu in Hokkaidō (423.4 meters), and is the 17th deepest lake in the world. Lake Tazawa has no <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> or outflow, and in 1931, had a measured transparency of 31 meters, comparable with Lake Mashu, but with abundant aquatic organisms. However, due to the construction of hydroelectric power plant facilities and agricultural runoff, coupled with an influx of highly acid water from Tamagawa Hot Spring, transparency has be reduced to less than 4 meters, and by the late 1940s the lake had become so acidic (pH 4.3) that it could no longer support irrigated agriculture. Starting in 1972, the Japanese government has been attempting to rectify the acidity problem through introduction of lime, with a new facility completed in 1991. However, in the year 2000, the lake still had an acidity of 5.14 at the 200 meter depth, and 4.91 at the 400 meter depth, indicating that full recovery has not yet been achieved.|$|E

Due to uncertainty and probability distribution factors (e.g., <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> [3]), it is intractable to formulate and solve MTHS problems without approximation or simplification. Historically, the mean of annual <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> is formulated as input and the problem is described by deterministic models [4, 5, 6].

They soon realized, however, that the aquifer's water supply was finite and CVWD was voted into existence by Coachella Valley residents and established by the state Legislature on January 9, 1918 with the primary responsibility to protect local water resources. One of the first actions taken by the District was to claim {{the rights to the}} Whitewater River (the valley's only source of natural replenishment) to ensure that <b>natural</b> <b>inflows</b> of water to the valley would stay in the valley and benefit the groundwater basin. To better manage the groundwater basin (the only source of water that was then being used for agricultural irrigation) and minimize groundwater pumping, the District looked for alternate sources of water to irrigate agriculturally productive land.|$|R

40|$|A reservoir's {{function}} is to regulate <b>natural</b> <b>inflows,</b> which vary irregularly, to provide outflows at a more regular rate that is determined by water demand for one or more uses (water supply, irrigation, hydropower), temporarily storing the surplus, when inflows exceed outflows. Reservoir reliability {{is defined as the}} probability that the reservoir will perform the required function, i. e. provide the outflow required to satisfy the water demand, at a specified period of time under stated conditions. The traditional reservoir design procedures are more commonly based on empirical approaches. It is shown, however, that the reliability concept is a more rational basis, and provides easy and accurate computational procedures, for reservoir design and operation. Under some simplified assumptions, a simple explicit expression relating reservoir size, yield and reliability is extracted. This expression can be used for preliminary stages of a reservoir design.

40|$|In {{order to}} reach a 80 % GHG {{emission}} reduction by 2050 (based on 1990 levels), a decarbonisation of 95 % to 100 % of the power supply sector will be necessary. Intermittent renewable energy sources (iRES) such as wind and solar {{are likely to become}} important components of such low-carbon power systems, but they require operational flexibility from non-iRES generators in the power system. From the few flexible and dispatchable renewable energy sources which are currently commercialized, hydro power has the largest installed capacity in Europe at the moment and could therefore be a significant provider of operational flexibility in future low-carbon power systems. However, hydro power is vulnerable to periods of drought, which may decrease the reliability of hydro power generation. In this research, the effects of different <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenarios on a potential low-carbon European power system are investigated. This is done by including a detailed representation of hydro capacity (including details on hydro storages, <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> and complex configurations) in a European low-carbon power system model. In addition, the detailed representation of hydro plants is compared to a more simplistic method of modelling hydro capacity in order to investigate the added value of a detailed approach. By including 68 detailed hydro power plants in the model, 32 % of the total currently installed hydro capacity in Western Europe has been covered. The hydro power plants modelled in detail are clearly influenced by different <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenarios. Storage (STO) and Run-of-River (RoR) plants generate 79 % and 72 % more electricity on an annual basis in the maximum <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenario compared to the minimum <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenario. For PHS plants, this difference is 8 %. These differences are mainly compensated for by gas turbines (GT) and natural gas combined cycle plants (NGCC). In the more simplistic hydro modelling method, these effects of alterations in <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> can not be accounted for. In weeks with high iRES generation, all types of hydro plants (STO, RoR and PHS) provide for generation during hours without sun, both in the detailed and the lumped scenarios. Based on this study, the main added value of detailed hydro modelling is the sensitivity of hydro plant dispatch to different <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenarios. If a higher share of the hydro capacity is included in the detailed hydro plant database, the effect of different <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> scenarios on total generation profiles is expected to be significant...|$|E

Furthermore, the observed conflict with electricity storage and the storage of <b>natural</b> <b>inflow</b> gave rise to higher surpluses remaining in the electricity system of Germany.|$|E
