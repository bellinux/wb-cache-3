2500|$|GluDHs are {{ubiquitous}} {{enzymes that}} occupy an important branch-point between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Both {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) EC 1.4.1.2] and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) dependent GluDH [...] enzymes are present in Plasmodia; the NAD-dependent GluDH is relatively unstable and not useful for diagnostic purposes. Glutamate dehydrogenase provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the production of energy as well as a reduced electron carrier, NADH. Glutamate is a principal amino donor to other amino acids in subsequent transamination reactions. The multiple roles of glutamate in <b>nitrogen</b> <b>balance</b> make it a gateway between free ammonia and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH. It is well known that enzymes with a high molecular weight (like GluDH) have many isozymes, which allows strain differentiations (given the right monoclonal antibody). The host produces antibodies against the parasitic enzyme indicating a low sequence identity.|$|E

Recommended Actions: • 	Accurate measurement of soil carbon and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>balances</b> is exceptionally difficult, but can be accomplished with sufficient investment and long‐term planning. • 	The ideal approach will include a combination of measurements from farms and experimental networks that manipulate nutrient inputs. • 	With proper planning and cooperation, Iowa State University and the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship can address the concerns raised in this report regarding the future of Iowa’s soil resource and agricultural productivity...|$|R

40|$|A <b>nitrogen</b> <b>balancing</b> {{scheme for}} ocean color data {{assimilation}} in general circulation models is described {{and its potential}} for improving air-seaCO 2 flux estimates is demonstrated. Given increments for phytoplankton, obtainable from a univariate surface chlorophyll analysis, the scheme determines mixed layer concentration increments for the other nitrogen pools: zooplankton, detritus and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The fraction of the phytoplankton increment to be balanced by changing DIN varies dynamically with the likely contributions of phytoplankton growth and loss errors to the error in the background state. Further increments are applied below the mixed layer wherever positive DIN increments in shallower layers would otherwise cause the creation of unrealistic sub-surface minima. Total nitrogen at each grid point is conserved where possible. The scheme is evaluated by 1 -D twin experiments for two contrasting locations in the North Atlantic, in which synthetic chlorophyll observations are assimilated {{in an attempt to}} recover known system trajectories generated by perturbing model parameters. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity tracers, controlled by the nitrogen dynamics, determine the biological modification of sea-water pCO 2 at the ocean surface. Assimilation affects DIC and alkalinity directly, the increments being inferred from the nitrogen increments, as well as having a post-analysis effect via the dynamics. It gives major improvements in surface pCO 2 at 50 N but less improvement at 30 N where errors in the phytoplankton nitrogen:chlorophyll ratio cause it to have a detrimental effect in summer. Beneficial effects of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>balancing</b> are demonstrated by comparison with experiments in which only phytoplankton and DIC are updated in the analysis...|$|R
