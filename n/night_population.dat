40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{leveling}} off in new HIV infections {{among men}} who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco, new evidence suggests that many recent HIV infections are linked with the use of Methamphetamine (MA). Among anonymous HIV testers in San Francisco, HIV incidence among MA users was 6. 3 % compared to 2. 1 % among non-MA users. Of particular concern for prevention programs are frequent users and HIV positive men who use MA. These MSM pose a particular challenge to HIV prevention efforts due to the need to reach them during very late night hours. Methods The purpose of the Late Night Breakfast Buffet (LNBB) was to determine the feasibility and uptake of harm reduction services by a late <b>night</b> <b>population</b> of MSM. The "buffet" of services included: needle exchange, harm reduction information, oral HIV testing, and urine based sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing accompanied by counseling and consent procedures. The study had two components: harm reduction outreach and a behavioral survey. For 4 months during 2004, we provided van-based harm reduction services in three neighborhoods in San Francisco from 1 – 5 a. m. for anyone out late at night. We also administered a behavioral risk and service utilization survey among MSM. Results We exchanged 2000 needles in 233 needle exchange visits, distributed 4500 condoms/lubricants and provided 21 HIV tests and 12 STI tests. Fifty-five MSM enrolled in the study component. The study population of MSM was characterized by low levels of income and education whose ages ranged from 18 – 55. Seventy-eight percent used MA in the last 3 months; almost 25 % used MA every day in the same time frame. Of the 65 % who ever injected, 97 % injected MA and 13 % injected it several times a day. MA and alcohol were strong influences in the majority of unprotected sexual encounters among both HIV negative and HIV positive MSM. Conclusion We reached a disenfranchised population of MA-using MSM who are at risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection through multiple high risk behaviors, and we established the feasibility and acceptability of late night harm reduction for MSM and MSM who inject drugs. </p...|$|E

We developed a model to estimate hourly dynamic changes in population at the community level based on subway smart card data. The hourly population of each community in six central districts of Beijing was calculated, followed by {{a study of the}} spatiotemporal patterns and diurnal dynamic changes of population and an exploration of the main sources and sinks of the observed human mobility. The maximum daytime population of the six central districts of Beijing was approximately 0. 7 million larger than the night-time population. The administrative and commercial districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng had high values of population ratio of day to night of 1. 35 and 1. 22, respectively, whereas Shijingshan, a residential district, had the lowest value of 0. 84. Areas with a high population ratio were mainly concentrated in Dongcheng, Xicheng, West Chaoyang, and Southeast Haidian. The daytime population distribution showed a hierarchical spatial pattern of planar centers and second scattered centers as opposed to multiple scattered centers during the night-time. This was because most people moved inward from the areas with a low–high to high–low population ratio of day to night from night-time to daytime, which {{can be explained by the}} process of commuting between residential areas and workplaces. Several distinctive phenomena (e. g., the distribution of new industrial parks, the so-called old residential areas, and colleges and universities) in the development of China are reflected by the spatiotemporal pattern of the distribution of population. The general consistency of the population ratios of day to <b>night,</b> <b>population</b> distribution, population variation of typical communities, and population mobility pattern with previous research suggests that the subway smart card data has potential in analyzing dynamic diurnal variations of urban population. This method can be easily duplicated to calculate hourly dynamic changes in population at the community level.

40|$|Abstract. — We {{evaluated}} the diel habitat use and movement of subadult bull trout Salvelinus confluentus {{by use of}} radiotelemetry during winter in the upper Flathead River, Montana. Of the 13 monitored bull trout, 12 (92 %) made at least one diel movement to other habitat locations during their respective day–night tracking surveys and moved an average of 73 % of the time. The median distance moved from day to night locations by the mobile fish was 86 m (range, 27 – 594 m). Diel shifts in habitat use by nine of the tagged fish were related to light intensity; nocturnal emergence generally commenced immediately after the onset of night, and daytime concealment occurred at daybreak. When diel shifts in microhabitat use occurred, subadult bull trout moved from deep, midchannel areas during the day to shallow, low-velocity areas along the channel margins without overhead cover at night.

40|$|Many {{species of}} birds migrate nocturnally. In nocturnally {{migrating}} birds, endogenous circadian and circannual rhythms serve as biological pacemakers (clocks). They are responsible for an individual?s migratory behavioral pattern (Zugunruhe). Circannual rhythms provide the major basis for the initiation of migratory restlessness both in autumn and spring. Circadian rhythms on the other hand, {{play an important role}} in regulating the increase of nocturnal activity that is necessary for flying long distances. The significance of these endogenous factors is evident in migrating birds in the sense that, zugunruhe keeps happening even in the absence of external inputs. Plasma melatonin concentration is crucial to this phenomenon. Melatonin concentrations in most migratory birds increase at night regardless of whether individuals are day or night active. In the course of migratory seasons, many birds show restlessness and excessive activity during <b>night.</b> In migratory <b>populations,</b> <b>night</b> level of melatonin is lower during the migratory period, when birds show nocturnal restlessness, than before and after this period, when birds do not show nocturnal activity. The operation of this endocrine system of oscillators is far too complex to understand by intuition so we unavoidably have to resort to abstractions. Mathematical models are therefore essential in understanding the mechanism of the components of this system and to further determine the dynamics of these periodic oscillators. Scheper model is a set of delay differential equations which describes the circadian clock. This model is based on the total duration of the chain reactions and the nonlinearity between input and delayed output of the protein synthesis negative feedback loop. In this study, two systems of scheper equations were coupled to produced circannual oscillation depicting the seasonal change in the melatonin level of nocturnally migratory birds.

We found no evidence for top-down control of A. pisum in this system, but did find evidence for bottom-up effects mediated through the impact of light on flower head density in a leguminous food plant. These results suggest that physiological effects of light on a plant species within a diverse plant community can have detectable demographic effects on a specialist herbivore.

40|$|Some 630 {{million people}} {{representing}} {{two-thirds of all}} Africans {{have no access to}} electricity, which is identified as a key barrier towards further development. Three main electrification options are considered within our work: grid extensions, mini-grids and solar home systems (SHS). A methodology is applied to all sub-Saharan African countries to identify in high geospatial resolution which electrification option is appropriate taking into account datasets for <b>night</b> light imagery, <b>population</b> distribution and grid infrastructure. Four different scenarios are considered reflecting grid development and electrification constraints due to low population density. The results clearly indicate a dominating role of SHS for achieving a fast electrification of the not supplied people. The share of supplied people by mini-grids is found to be rather low while grid extension serves a large share of the population. The decisive factors for these distinctions are population density and distance to grid. We applied several scenarios and sensitivities to understand the influence of these key parameters. The highest trade-off happens between SHS and grid extension depending on the selected thresholds. Mini-grid deployments remain in the range of 8 to 21 %...|$|R
