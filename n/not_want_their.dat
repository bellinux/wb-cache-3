5|$|On August 15, 2011, {{there was}} more {{disruption}} in service at BART stations in downtown San Francisco. The San Francisco Examiner reported that the protests were {{a result of the}} shootings, including that of Oscar Grant. Demonstrations were announced by several activists, which eventually resulted in disruptions to service. The protesters have stated that they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> protests to results in closures, and accused the BART police of using the protests as an excuse for disruption. Protesters vowed to continue their protests every Monday until their demands were met.|$|E
5|$|Ulrich {{provided}} {{a statement to}} the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site to place a filter on the program within 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement between Metallica and Napster was reached when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann BMG showed interest in purchasing the rights to Napster for $94million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> music shared. On June 3, 2002, Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale of Napster to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.|$|E

50|$|The Legion of Doom is an {{electronic}} production team consisting of Chad Blinman and Trever Keith.

25|$|In France, quite {{early in}} the Nineteenth Century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of usury, in Alsace, {{as well as of}} abusing other rights, which were given to them in their {{emancipation}} in 1791 under Louis XVI.

Most have not caught on. Current clothes fashions, such as panty hose and slacks, inhibit women from using them because they do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> garments to touch the urinal or the floor.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it was noted}} that some power users were {{interested}} in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin board system and were not publicly accessible. A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.|$|E
25|$|This {{is further}} {{explored}} in other novels, and is notably covered in some depth in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, where Albus Dumbledore writes notes after each story which often concerns itself with Wizard-Muggle relationships. Part of these 'observations' note how The Tales were modified {{in the face}} of anti-muggle sentiment in order to remove any pro-muggle messages for wizards who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> children exposed to those messages (including Lucius Malfoy who demanded that the Tales be removed from the Hogwarts).|$|E

The Psi Corps acts as the teacher, protector, provider, and family for the telepaths. They are taught that the Psi Corps is the only organization they can trust—arguably quite true considering the fear normal humans have of their abilities.|$|R

25|$|The two {{researchers}} (both chief physicians at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, {{one of them}} {{married to}} Gillberg), defended their decision to shred the files by referring to the promises of confidentiality that had been issued to the subjects {{of the study and}} the letters of objection that had been received from the families that they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> personal data used or shared with the private individuals. They argued that turning the files over would have exposed the researchers and the university to potential lawsuits from the subjects for failing to honor a written agreement. They were convicted and fined for destruction of government property.|$|E
25|$|A fight {{broke out}} {{over whether to}} make the report public. Thompson made the report {{available}} to Ullico's board of directors, and required board members to sign statements promising to keep the findings confidential. Without a board vote to release the report, it would have remained secret. A number of board members did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> role in the stock scandal made public. Board member John J. Sweeney, then president of the AFL-CIO {{and one of the}} board members who did not participate in the stock trading scheme, demanded the release of the report. Georgine and Sweeney engaged in numerous heated arguments for several weeks, debating whether to release the Thompson report. Finally, on December 1, 2002, Sweeney resigned from the Ullico board in protest. Four other members of the board followed suit over the next month.|$|E
25|$|An {{ideology}} of preserving family honor is deeply rooted is society {{and is not}} affected by high levels of education. Many women in Turkey are well educated but still {{are expected to be}} modest and sexually pure in order to preserve the honor of their families. If a family's honor is breached, it brings shame to the entire family. In such cases, traditionally the family would decide the fate of the female that brought shame. This might involve forcing the young woman into a shotgun wedding, while in extreme cases a young male in the family was given the duty to cleanse the family name through an honor killing. With recent changes to criminal law that removed reduced sentences for honor killings, females that brought shame to the family are sometimes forced to commit honor suicides by their families, especially in the predominantly Kurdish South-East regions, a region that greatly values traditions. Families who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> sons to face possible incrimination have encouraged their daughters to commit suicide. The number of female suicides over the years has increased greatly. Stories have surfaced revealing girls who are given tools with which to kill themselves such as rope to hang themselves, poisons to drink, or a gun to shoot themselves. Some murders have also been disguised as suicides in order to protect family members. Female family members {{are not the only ones}} that may be punished to preserve family honor. It is proposed that the death of a male homosexual physics student, Ahmet Yildiz, was an honor killing.|$|E

The deaths leave both Tsukasa and Ryuji orphans, with Ryuji succeeding the group as their third generation boss, known as the Sandaime, and Tsukasa on the streets with her three brothers.|$|R

50|$|In 2008, the Baltimore School District {{failed to}} {{intervene}} {{in an act of}} violence committed against a teacher. A student had taken a video of a peer beating her art teacher. School officials ignored the problem until the video was posted on MySpace. Some cases of school violence have not been {{brought to the attention of}} the authorities because school administrators have <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> schools labeled unsafe under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act.

500|$|The United States {{passed laws}} to keep Haitian merchants away from US soil because slaveholders there did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> slaves getting ideas about revolt from the Haitians.

500|$|Most airmen doubted {{they would}} ever get out of Buchenwald because their {{documents}} were stamped with the acronym [...] "DIKAL" [...] (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or [...] "not {{to be transferred to}} another camp". At great risk, Lamason and Burney secretly smuggled a note through a trusted Russian prisoner, who worked at the nearby Nohra airfield, to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp. The message requested in part, that an officer pass the information to Berlin, and for the Luftwaffe to intercede on behalf of the airmen. Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> captured men treated in the same way; he also knew that the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.|$|E

I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is.

Abrams stated that many of the women who attended did so in secret, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>their</b> husbands to know, and that the term [...] "women's liberation" [...] was considered a [...] "dirty word" [...] at the time.|$|R
500|$|Alternative {{rock band}} R.E.M. guest-starred as {{themselves}} in the episode. [...] "We {{had been told that}} R.E.M. were big fans of the show", says executive producer and showrunner for the episode, Mike Scully, adding that their appearance in the episode was a [...] "fairly last-minute addition". Unlike The Who, who made an appearance in the episode [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields", R.E.M. did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> former drummer Bill Berry to be animated in the episode. The drummer seen in the episode was instead drawn to resemble one of their session drummers at the time. Moe's professor at Swigmore University was voiced by the series' regular voice actor Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer among many others. Formico, who renovated Moe's tavern, was portrayed by Hank Azaria, who also voices Moe as well as several other characters in the show.|$|E
500|$|Who TISM are {{beneath the}} masks {{has been the}} cause of much {{speculation}} by fans, with one theory contending that TISM is composed of members of other bands who do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> fans to find out: popular targets of this theory include Painters and Dockers, Machine Gun Fellatio and even The Wiggles. A theory based on the band's tour schedule's roughly coinciding with school holidays, {{and the fact that}} the Ringwood Secondary College Choir and Orchestra feature in the filmclip to Thunderbirds Are Coming Out, proposes that TISM are school teachers. Another common theory, based on the high incidence of football references in their lyrics, is that they are Australian rules football players in the AFL, however Humphrey B. Flaubert has stated that [...] "We're actually not AFL, we're more violent and crappy... so you're looking at the VFL there." ...|$|E

An armed man—later identified as Philippe LaRoche—bursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>their</b> spouses to learn of the affair, agree not to report the crime. Shortly after, LaRoche contacts Charles, threatens to kill his family, and blackmails him into paying him $20,000. A month later, LaRoche calls again, this time demanding $100,000.|$|R
