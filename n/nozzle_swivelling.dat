40|$|Several {{proposed}} configurations for supersonic short takeoff, {{vertical landing}} aircraft will require {{one or more}} ventral nozzles for lift and pitch control. The <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> is one possible ventral <b>nozzle</b> configuration. A <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> (approximately one-third scale) was built and tested on a generic model tailpipe. This nozzle was capable of vectoring the flow up to + or - 23 deg from the vertical position. Steady-state performance data were obtained at pressure ratios to 4. 5, and pitot-pressure surveys of the nozzle exit plane were made. Two configurations were tested: the <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> with a square contour of {{the leading edge of}} the ventral duct inlet, and the same nozzle with a round leading edge contour. The <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> showed good performance overall, and the round-leading edge configuration showed an improvement in performance over the square-leading edge configuration...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{incidence}} {{can affect}} microsprinkler water distribution. Evaluations of those conditions can be facilitated using simulations by computational models. The present work evaluates {{the performance of}} a ballistic model on simulating the wind effect on microsprinkler water distribution. Experimental tests were carried out using self-compensating microsprinklers, nozzle sizes 1. 00 mm (gray), 1. 10 mm (brown), 1. 48 mm (orange), and 1. 75 mm (yellow). The gray and brown <b>nozzles</b> used black <b>swivels</b> and the orange and yellow <b>nozzles</b> used blue <b>swivels.</b> The wind effect was artificially caused by fourteen 200 W fans. Computational simulations were realized using SIRIAS software, based on a ballistic model originally developed for sprinkler systems. The correlation coefficients (r) varied from 0. 619 to 0. 880, while the exactness coefficients (d) varied from 0. 842 to 0. 944. Swivels internal geometry influenced results. Tested models presented performances classified as very good for the black <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzles</b> and regular for the blue <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance degradation}} of a <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust deflector system obtained during increased vectoring angles of a large-scale test program was investigated and improved. Small-scale models {{were used to}} generate performance data for analyzing selected <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> configurations. A single-swivel nozzle design model with five different nozzle configurations and a twin-swivel nozzle design model, scaled to 0. 15 size of the large-scale test hardware, were statically tested at low exhaust pressure ratios of 1. 4, 1. 3, 1. 2, and 1. 1 and vectored at four nozzle positions from 0 deg cruise through 90 deg vertical used for the VTOL mode...|$|R
2500|$|The Three-Bearing Swivel Module has to both {{support the}} final hot thrust {{vectoring}} nozzle and transmit its thrust loads {{back to the}} engine mounts. The [...] "fueldraulic" [...] actuators for the 3BSM use fuel pressurised to 3,500lbf/in2, rather than hydraulic fluid, to reduce weight and complexity. One actuator travels with the <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle,</b> moving through 95degrees while subject to intense heat and vibration.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} showers have a <b>swivelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> aiming {{down on the}} user, {{while more}} complex showers have a showerhead connected to a hose that has a mounting bracket. This allows the showerer to spray the water at different parts of their body. A shower can be installed in a small shower stall or bathtub with a plastic shower curtain or door.|$|R

50|$|The Rolls-Royce Pegasus, {{formerly}} the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus, is a turbofan engine originally designed by Bristol Siddeley. It was manufactured by Rolls-Royce plc. The engine {{is not only}} able to power a jet aircraft forward, but also to direct thrust downwards via <b>swivelling</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Lightly loaded aircraft equipped with this engine can manoeuvre like a helicopter. In particular, they can perform vertical takeoffs and landings. In US service, the engine is designated F402.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results from}} a <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust {{deflector}} test program are presented. The deflector was installed behind a 36 -inch fan with a tip turbine hot gas drive. The maximum nozzle pressure ratio was 1. 2. Nozzle thrust and flow coefficients are presented {{for a range of}} vectoring angles. The results are also compared to small scale cold flow test results. The comparison suggests a need for accurate simulation of nozzle entry pressure and temperature profiles on model tests...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other variants, the F-35B has no landing hook. The [...] "STOVL/HOOK" [...] control instead engages {{conversion}} between {{normal and}} vertical flight. Jet thrust is sent directly downwards during vertical flight; the nozzle is being redesigned {{to spread the}} output across an oval rather than circular shape in order to limit damage to asphalt and ship decks. The variant's three-bearing <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> that directs the full thrust of the engine is moved by a [...] "fueldraulic" [...] actuator using pressurized fuel as the working fluid.|$|R
50|$|In March 1960 the Curtiss-Wright Corporation {{developed}} the X-100, a prototype for a new, vertical takeoff transport aircraft. The X-100 {{had a single}} turboshaft engine, which propelled two tilting-propellers, while at the tail <b>swivelling</b> <b>nozzles</b> used the engine's exhaust gases to give additional control for hovering or slow flight. Although sometimes classified as a tiltrotor aircraft, the design differed from the Bell VTOL XV tiltrotor designs. The X-19 utilized specially designed radial lift propellers, rather than helicopter like rotors, for vertical takeoff and augmenting the lift provided by the wing structures.|$|R
50|$|Prior to launch, {{the missile}} was {{referenced}} in azimuth by its gyrocompass inertial platform. After launch, the missile followed an inertially guided trajectory until RV separation. Attitude and guidance commands during powered flight (except for roll attitude) were executed via the <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{in the two}} propulsion sections. Roll control was provided by two movable air vanes on the first stage during first stage flight and by the RV air vanes during second stage flight. The first stage also had two fixed air vanes for stability during first stage powered flight.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{development}} of the P.1127 Hawker and Bristol had also undertaken considerable development work on a supersonic version, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, to meet a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) requirement issued for such an aircraft. The design used a single Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine with four <b>swivelling</b> <b>nozzles,</b> in a fashion similar to the P.1127, and required the use of plenum chamber burning (PCB) to achieve supersonic speeds. The P.1154 won the competition to meet the requirement against strong competition from other aircraft manufacturers such as Dassault Aviation's Mirage IIIV. The French government did not accept the decision and withdrew; the NATO requirement was cancelled shortly after in 1965.|$|R
50|$|The Start-1 {{launch vehicle}} {{is derived from}} the RT-2PM Topol ICBM. The first three stages of the Topol missile are used as the first three stages of the Start-1 rocket and are {{essentially}} unmodified for their new purpose. A fourth stage, specially developed by the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology, and the payload shroud take the place of the nuclear warhead and are the main differences between the Topol ICBM and the Start-1 rocket. Additionally, a Post-Boost Propulsion System (PBPS) may be added between the fourth stage and the payload to circularize the orbit of the payload if necessary. The PBPS provides propulsion using a solid-propellant nitrogen gas generator. The gas goes through three pairs of <b>nozzles</b> that can <b>swivel</b> to maneuver the payload.|$|R
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the <b>nozzle,</b> hose, <b>swivels</b> and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} two technology programs sponsored by NASA to investigate the characteristics of two thrust vectoring schemes for V/STOL aircraft. The operational capability of the VTOL aircraft is dependent on maximum utilization of the installed thrust in both the cruise and powered lift modes of flight. An effective thrust vectoring system on the cruise propulsion unit is therefore essential to provide maximum payload in hover and STOL plus minimum specific fuel consumption in loiter and cruise. Introducing a high by-pass ratio fan system, augmenting the gas generator thrust, as the propulsion system for VTOL aircraft places increased significance {{on the performance of}} the relatively short coupled thrust vectoring systems. The two programs discussed herein include both large-scale and small-scale tests of a vectoring hood system with a vented, internal-lip and <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> systems. These tests indicated that a satisfactory thrust vectoring system can be developed...|$|R
40|$|A lift/cruise exhaust {{deflector}} {{system for the}} LF 336 /A tip turbine lift fan was designed, built, and tested to determine the design and performance characteristics of a large-scale, single <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> thrust vectoring system. The {{exhaust deflector}} static testing was performed at the Ames Research Center outside static test stand facilities. The test hardware was installed on a hydraulic lift platform to permit {{both in and out}} of ground effect testing. The exhaust flow of the LF 336 /A lift fan was vectored from 0 degrees through 130 degrees during selected fan speeds to obtain performance at different operating conditions. The system was operated with and without flow vanes installed in the small radius bends to evaluate the system performance based on a proposed method of improving the internal flow losses. The program also included testing at different ground heights, to the nozzle exhaust plane, to obtain ground effect data, and the testing of two methods of thrust spoiling using a duct bypass door system and nozzle flap system...|$|R
50|$|Bevilaqua {{was working}} for Lockheed Skunk Works in 1986, when DARPA and the similar British agency {{launched}} a program called ASTOVL and issued a 9-month contract to develop concepts for a stealthy supersonic STOVL plane, in accordance with USMC wishes, but without the usual strict technical requirements. The challenge in combining supersonic flight and STOVL is that an engine powerful enough to lift an aircraft would be too wide to be supersonic, {{as shown by the}} Harrier. A smaller engine with higher air flow was needed, but seemed impossible. Inspired by the General Electric CJ805-23 aft-turbofan and the Rolls-Royce tandem-fan, an appropriate system seemed to be a dual thrust system with a lift vector at the front and a <b>swivel</b> <b>nozzle</b> at the back for the jet engine, counterbalancing each other.To leave no stone unturned, all kinds of options were investigated, some even bordering on the ludicrous (using a cannon for lift, transferring power with a laser beam) - Skunk Works employees are no strangers to cartoon antics.|$|R
