40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of oral vancomycin in the prophylaxis of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> in preterm, very low birthweight infants.  METHODS—A prospective, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study in a tertiary referral centre of a university teaching hospital was conducted on 140 very low birthweight infants consecutively admitted to the neonatal unit. The babies were randomly allocated to receive oral vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 8 hours for 7 days) or an equivalent volume of placebo solution. Prophylaxis was started 24 hours before the start of oral feeds. All suspected cases of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> were investigated with a full sepsis screen and serial abdominal radiographs. <b>Necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> was diagnosed and staged according to modified Bell's criteria.  RESULTS—Nine of 71 infants receiving oral vancomycin and 19 of 69 infants receiving the placebo solution developed <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (p= 0. 035). Infants with <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> were associated with a significant increase in mortality (p= 0. 026) and longer duration of hospital stay (p = 0. 002).  CONCLUSIONS—Prophylactic oral vancomycin conferred protection against <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> in preterm, very low birthweight infants and was associated with a 50 % reduction in the incidence. However, widespread implementation of this preventive measure is not recommended, as it would only be effective in <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> caused by Gram positive organisms and could increase the danger of the emergence of vancomycin resistant or dependent organisms. Its use should be restricted to a high prevalence nursery for a short and well defined period in a selected group of high risk patients. ...|$|R

Although feeding with expressed breast milk and other good nursery practices are partly protective, preventive measures are needed. Treating neonates enterally {{with a mixture}} of human IgA and IgG, prepared from donated blood, has been claimed to protect against <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> However, no IgA preparation is available in Australia. Our aim, therefore, was to identify whether or not enteral IgG could prevent the disorder. METHODS: We did a multicentre, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial. We randomly assigned 768 infants to receive human IgG 1200 mg/kg daily, and 761 to receive placebo, for up to 28 days. Treatment began {{at the same time as}} enteral feeding. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of infants who developed definite <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> during the trial, and any deaths that resulted from the disorder in the treatment and placebo groups. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. FINDINGS: 43 infants developed definite <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> in the IgG group, ten of whom died. In the placebo group, 41 infants contracted the disorder and six died (p= 0. 47). 25 infants on IgG and 36 on placebo had suspect <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (p= 0. 14).

40|$|Background <b>Necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> is a {{neonatal}} gastrointestinal {{inflammatory disease}} with high mortality and severe morbidity. This disorder {{is growing in}} global relevance as birth rates and survival of babies with low gestational age improve. Population data are scant and pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but enteral feed exposures are believed to affect risk. We aimed to quantify the national incidence of severe <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> describe variation across neonatal networks, and investigate enteral feeding-related antecedents of severe <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> Methods We undertook a 2 -year national surveillance study (the UK Neonatal Collaborative <b>Necrotising</b> <b>Enterocolitis</b> [UKNC-NEC] Study) of babies born in England to quantify the burden of severe or fatal <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> confirmed by laparotomy, leading to death, or both. Data on all liveborn babies admitted to neonatal units between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2013, {{were obtained from the}} National Neonatal Research Database. In the subgroup of babies born before a gestational age of 32 weeks, we did a propensity score analysis of the effect of feeding in the first 14 postnatal days with own mother’s milk, with or without human donor milk and avoidance of bovine-origin formula, or milk fortifier, on the risk of developing <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> Findings During the study period, 118   073 babies were admitted to 163 neonatal units across 23 networks, of whom 14   678 were born before a gestational age of 32 weeks. Overall, 531 (0 · 4 %) babies developed severe <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> of whom 247 (46 · 5 %) died (139 after laparotomy). 462 (3 · 2 %) of 14   678 babies born before a gestational age of 32 weeks developed severe <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> of whom 222 (48 · 1 %) died. Among babies born before a gestational age of 32 weeks, the adjusted network incidence of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> ranged from 2 · 51 % (95 % CI 1 · 13 – 3 · 60) to 3 · 85 % (2 · 37 – 5 · 33), with no unusual variation from the adjusted national incidence of 3 · 13 % (2 · 85 – 3 · 42), despite variation in feeding practices. The absolute risk difference for babies born before a gestational age of 32 weeks who received their own mother’s milk within 7 days of birth was − 0 · 88 % (95 % CI − 1 · 15 to − 0 · 61; relative risk 0 · 69, 95 % CI 0 · 60 to 0 · 78; number needed to treat to prevent one case of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> 114, 95 % CI 87 to 136). For babies who received no compared with any bovine-origin products within 14 days of birth, the absolute risk difference was − 0 · 65 % (− 1 · 01 to − 0 · 29; relative risk 0 · 61, 0 · 39 to 0 · 83; number needed to treat 154, 99 to 345). We were unable to assess the effect of human donor milk as use was low. Interpretation Early feeding of babies with their own mother’s milk and avoidance of bovine-origin products might reduce the risk of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> but the absolute reduction is small. Owing to the rarity of severe <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> international collaborations are needed for adequately powered preventive trials...|$|R

ResultsDeceased patients had significantly lower platelet counts compared to survivors (p= 0. 022) and the prognostic factors associated with mortality were anaemia (p= 0. 006, OR= 15. 62), stage III of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (p< 0. 001, OR= 47. 5), to require surgical treatment (p< 0. 001, OR= 47. 5), to have intestinal necrosis (p= 0. 001, OR= 48. 5) or perforation (p= 0. 016, OR= 24. 25), to have medical complications, specifically intravascular disseminated coagulation (p< 0. 001, RR= 98), and multi-organ failure (p< 0. 001, RR= 2).

One {{of the most}} serious gastrointestinal disorders occurring in neonates is <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (NEC). It is recognised as the most common intra-abdominal emergency and {{is the leading cause of}} short bowel syndrome. With extremely high mortality and morbidity, this enigmatic disease remains a challenge for neonatologists around the world as its definite aetiology has yet to be determined. As current medical knowledge stands, there is no single well-defined cause of NEC. Instead, there are nearly 20 risk factors that are proposed to increase the likelihood of developing NEC. Aims and Objectives. The aim of this project was to conduct a comprehensive literature review around the 20 or so well-documented and less well-documented risk factors for <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> Materials and Methods. Searches of the Medline, Embase, and Science direct databases were conducted using the words “necrotising enterocolitis + the risk factor in question ” for example, “necrotising enterocolitis + dehydration. ” Search results were ordered by relevance with bias given to more recent publications. Conclusion. This literature review has demonstrated the complexity of <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> and emphasised the likely multifactorial aetiology. Further research is needed to investigate the extent to which each risk factor is implicated in <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis.</b> 1.

SMA velocity was significantly higher in the infants with confirmed <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (36. 5 cm/s) than in unfed controls (20. 4 cm/s) or infants with unconfirmed enterocolitis (19. 6 cm/s). Three infants with confirmed disease had data from before the onset of symptoms. One had low SMA velocity {{on the first day of}} life, and one showed no increase in SMA velocity after enteral feeds were started.

Neonatal <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (NNE) is a serious and often fatal disorder of unknown aetiology most commonly affecting premature infants who have undergone a form of stress such as hypoxia (Hopkins et al., 1970). The disease is characterised clinically by gastric retention, bile-stained vomiting, abdominal distension, and usually diarrhea with blood in the stools within a few days of birth. Radiographic examination of the abdomen reveals gas within the bowel wall or inside the peritoneal cavity (Santulli et al., 1975).

40|$|Background Probiotics {{may reduce}} <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> and late-onset sepsis after preterm birth. However, {{there has been}} concern about the rigour and {{generalisability}} of some trials {{and there is no}} agreement about whether or not they should be used routinely. We aimed to test the eff ectiveness of the probiotic Bifidobacterium breveBBG- 001 to reduce <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis,</b> late-onset sepsis, and death in preterm infants. Methods In this multicentre, randomised controlled phase 3 study (the PiPS trial), we recruited infants born between 23 and 30 weeks’ gestational age within 48 h of birth from 24 hospitals in southeast England. Infants were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to probiotic or placebo via a minimisation algorithm randomisation programme. The probiotic intervention was B breveBBG- 001 suspended in dilute elemental infant formula given enterally in a daily dose of 8 · 2 to 9 · 2 log 10 CFU; the placebo was dilute infant formula alone. Clinicians and families were masked to allocation. The primary outcomes were <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> (Bell stage 2 or 3), blood culture positive sepsis more than 72 h after birth; and death before discharge from hospital. All primary analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 05511098 and EudraCT, number 2006 - 003445 - 17. Findings Between July 1, 2010, and July 31, 2013, 1315 infants were recruited; of whom 654 were allocated to probiotic and 661 to placebo. Five infants had consent withdrawn after randomisation, thus 650 were analysed in the probiotic group and 660 in the placebo group. Rates of the primary outcomes did not differ significantly between the probiotic and placebo groups. 61 infants (9 %) in the probiotic group had <b>necrotising</b> <b>enterocolitis</b> compared with 66 (10 %) in the placebo group (adjusted risk ratio 0 · 93 (95 % CI 0 · 68 – 1 · 27); 73 (11 %) infants in the probiotics group had sepsis compared with 77 (12 %) in the placebo group (0 · 97 (0 · 73 – 1 · 29); and 54 (8 %) deaths occurred before discharge home in the probiotic group compared with 56 (9 %) in the placebo group (0 · 93 [0 · 67 – 1 · 30]). No probiotic-associated adverse events were reported.
