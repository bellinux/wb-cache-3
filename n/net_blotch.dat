40|$|Australian barley {{crops are}} {{affected}} by a range of leaf and root diseases. Diseases constitute a significant limitation to sustainable barley production. Reducing impacts from diseases is important for reliable production of high quality barley. Some diseases are prevalent around Australia whereas others are of regional significance (Table 1). The lack of resistance in major varieties grown in Australia to diseases like scald, <b>net</b> <b>blotches,</b> leaf rust and powdery mildew (Table 2) can impact on yield and grain quality mainly through a reduction in grain size. Reduced grain yields and low malting quality reduce returns to growers and affect domestic and export marketability. Improvements are sought {{through the development of}} varieties with adequate levels of resistance to the range of important biotic stresses. A major objective in barley breeding programs around Australia is to develop varieties with improved combinations of disease resistances while maintaining or improving yield, quality and other agronomic traits.

40|$|The net form of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> {{caused by}} the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophora teres f. teres is a major disease of barley, causing high yield losses and reduced malting and feed quality. Exploiting the allelic {{richness}} of wild barley {{proved to be a}} valuable tool to broaden the genetic base of resistance of modern elite cultivars. In this study, a SNP-based nested association mapping (NAM) study was conducted to map QTL for P. teres resistance in the barley population HEB- 25 comprising 1, 420 lines derived from BC 1 S 3 generation. By scoring the percentage of infected leaf area followed by calculation of the average ordinate (AO) and scoring of the reaction type (RT) in two-year field trials a large variability of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> resistance across and within families of HEB- 25 was observed. Genotype response to <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> infection showed a range of 48. 2 % for AO (0. 9 - 49. 1 %) and 6. 4 for RT (2. 2 - 8. 6).

40|$|Seed born <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> is {{a threat}} to the organic barley seed {{production}} in Denmark because it often exceeds the legal 15 % infestation threshold in organically produced barley seed lots.

Highly significant positive correlations among initial seed infestation, primary infection of seedlings and disease severity during the growing season as well as among disease severity at flowering and infestation of the harvested grains were found. The seed infestation level was much less than proportionally related to the primary infection of seedlings and to the disease severity later in the season. All these variables were negatively correlated with single grain weight, fraction of large grains and total yield.

40|$|Recent {{surveys in}} Saskatchewan {{have shown that}} the {{prevalence}} of Pyrenophora teres Drechs., the causal agent of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), has increased. Severe epidemics have been observed in several commercial fields. The major objectives of this study were the investigation of the epidemiology of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> and the determination of the effect of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> on barley production. Conidium germination and time to infection were compared for two spot-type isolates (P. teres f. maculata) and one net-type isolate (P. teres f. teres) in a growth cabinet. Spot-type isolates germinated sooner than the net-type isolate between 10 and 20 °c. Time to infection was shorter for the spot-type isolates than for the net-type isolate at all temperatures. The relationships among local weather conditions, incidence of airborne conidia, barley development and sporulation were investigated in field experiments with the susceptible cultivar Elrose at Shellbrook, Saskatchewan in 1986 and 1987. Airborne conidia were observed daily throughout the growing season. Their incidence showed a diurnal pattern with a peak between 12 : 00 and 16 : 00 h. At night, frequent dew formation favoured infection. Infection of lower leaves was due to infection by primary inoculum produced on crop debris. Infection of upper leaves was due to primary inoculum and to secondary inoculum produced on the lower leaves. The effect of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> on barley production was investigated in an experiment using Tilt (propiconazole) on Elrose in 1985 and 1986 and on the moderately resistant cultivar Argyle in 1986 at Saskatoon, Shellbrook and Medstead, Saskatchewan. Repeated application of Tilt reduced the rate of disease progress on Elrose, but not on Argyle, where resistance reduced the rate of disease progress. Resistance slowed disease progress more than repeated application of Tilt. On Elrose, Tilt increased grain yield and kernel weight, but had no effect on number of tillers and number of kernels per spike. On Argyle, Tilt had no effect on any trait. The potential yield loss caused by <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> was estimated at 50 %. Infection of <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> lowered grain grade through kernel discolouration and low test weight. Using the components of variance and covariance, strong correlations were obtained between treatment effects of grain yield and disease severity. However, no satisfactory critical point mode·l could be developed to predict percentage yield loss from disease severity. In Saskatchewan, infected crop debris is the most important source of primary inoculum of P. teres. Under favourable conditions with sufficient primary inoculum, severe epidemics can be expected on susceptible cultivars. Foliar fungicide application is not cost effective at current grain prices, therefore extended rotations or the use of resistant cultivars are the only practical means to control <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> in barley...|$|E

40|$|Spot type <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> {{caused by}} Pyrenophora teres f. maculata (Ptm) {{has become a}} {{prominent}} disease in Western Australia, as has also occurred elsewhere. The disease has {{a negative impact on}} both grain yield and quality resulting from reduced grain size. Lack of resistance and stubble retention are the likely factors in the increased severity of the disease in barley growing areas of Western Australia. Because of the increasing importance of spot type <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> and the need to improve barley resistance, understanding pathogen virulence is a high priority as this has direct impact on the identification and utilization of resistance genes in breeding programs. Ninety nine isolates of Ptm were collected from geographically dispersed barley fields of Western Australia during 2001 and 2002. Forty nine sporulating isolates of Ptm were classified into seven isolate groups (IGs) {{on the basis of their}} infection responses on 26 differential barley lines. The 26 lines were likewise classified into four line groups (LGs) based on their distinguishing response to the spot type <b>net</b> <b>blotch</b> isolates. The varied infection responses among the differential barley lines demonstrated a wide geographic dispersal of IGs as well as previously undetected virulence in Ptm in Western Australia. The commercially grown barley cultivars Baudin and Gairdner are regarded as susceptible to spot type <b>net</b> <b>blotch,</b> but showed a range of reactions to the various Ptm isolates as seedling plants.
