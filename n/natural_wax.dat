5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from <b>natural</b> <b>wax,</b> oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
25|$|Using beeswax to make dreads {{can cause}} {{problems}} {{because it does}} not wash out, due to the high melting point of <b>natural</b> <b>wax.</b> Because wax is a hydrocarbon, water alone, no matter how hot, {{will not be able to}} remove wax.|$|E
25|$|Scouring, is a {{chemical}} washing process {{carried out on}} cotton fabric to remove <b>natural</b> <b>wax</b> and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called kiers. The fabric is boiled in an alkali, which forms a soap with free fatty acids (saponification). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of sodium hydroxide can be boiled under pressure, excluding oxygen which would degrade the cellulose in the fibre. If the appropriate reagents are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and {{is considered to be}} a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of low-oxygen and hydroxyl-poor hydrocarbons in natural living media {{is supported by}} the {{presence of}} <b>natural</b> <b>waxes</b> (n=30+), oils (n=20+) and lipids in both plant matter and animal matter, for instance fats in phytoplankton, zooplankton and so on. These oils and waxes, however, occur in quantities too small to significantly affect the overall hydrogen/carbon ratio of biological materials.|$|R
50|$|Waxes are {{a diverse}} class of organic {{compounds}} that are hydrophobic, malleable solids near ambient temperatures. They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40 °C (104 °F), melting to give low viscosity liquids.

5000|$|Beeswax (cera alba) is a <b>natural</b> <b>wax</b> {{produced}} by honey bees {{of the genus}} Apis. The wax is formed into [...] "scales" [...] by eight wax-producing glands in the abdominal segments of worker bees, who discard it in or at the hive. The hive workers collect {{and use it to}} form cells for honey-storage and larval and pupal protection within the beehive. Chemically, beeswax consists mainly of esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{made from}} polyurethanes, acrylics, or <b>natural</b> <b>wax.</b> These sealers may be {{effective}} at stopping stains but, being exposed {{on the surface}} of the material, they tend to wear out relatively quickly, especially on high-traffic areas of flooring. This type of sealer will significantly change the look and slip resistance of the surface, especially when it is wet. These sealers are not breathable i.e. do not allow the escape of water vapour and other gases, and are not effective against salt attack, such as efflorescence and spalling.|$|E
40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>waxes</b> such as Beeswax, Carnauba wax and Candelilla wax {{are widely}} used in the Cosmetic and Food industries. Thanks to their composition, and besides a {{compulsory}} high safety, they provide desirable properties such as strength, gloss, emolliency, barrier effect, making them essential in numerous applications. For example, lots of candies are coated with either one or a mix of these 3 waxes, while for Cosmetics, the waxy part of lipsticks contains various combinations of such waxes. Within the cosmetic industry, the “green wave” – natural products – which is developing {{to the detriment of}} synthetic or mineral raw materials, has generated know-hows to enlighten new values to natural resources. Several types of developments have occurred: managing to substitute materials facing bad press (ex: petrolatum, lanolin), mimicking trendy “butter-like” textures either by adequate mixture or by chemical reaction to offer alternatives to overused Shea or Cupuaçu Butter, or as a result of more recent research programs, identifying <b>natural</b> <b>waxes</b> acting more like active ingredients than “just” like excipients (Mimosa Flower wax, Lemon Peel or Orange Peel waxes, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|Muntries (Kunzea pomifera) - {{also known}} as emu apples, native cranberries, munthari, muntaberry or monterry - are low-growing plants found along the {{southern}} coast of Australia. The berries produced by these plants are about 1 cm in diameter, green with a tinge of red at maturity and have a flavour of a spicy apple. Crunchy in texture, muntries contain up to four times more antioxidants than blueberries and provide <b>natural</b> <b>waxes</b> that are good for skin nourishment.|$|R
50|$|The waxing {{materials}} used depend {{to some extent}} on regulations {{in the country of}} production and/or export; both <b>natural</b> <b>waxes</b> (sugar-cane, carnauba, shellac, or resin) or petroleum-based waxes (usually proprietary formulae) are used. Wax may be applied in a volatile petroleum-based solvent but is now more commonly applied via a water-based emulsion. Blended paraffin waxes applied as an oil or paste are often used on vegetables. Brand names for waxes include Tal-Prolong, Semper-fresh, Frutox, Waxol, Fruit, vegetable kleen, Nipro Fresh and Decco Luster.|$|R
50|$|Shellac, edible, {{is used as}} a {{glazing agent}} on pills (see excipient) and sweets, in the form of {{pharmaceutical}} glaze (or, confectioner's glaze). Because of its acidic properties (resisting stomach acids), shellac-coated pills may be used for a timed enteric or colonic release. Shellac {{is used as a}} 'wax' coating on citrus fruit to prolong its shelf/storage life. It is also used to replace the <b>natural</b> <b>wax</b> of the apple, which is removed during the cleaning process. When used for this purpose, it has the food additive E number E904.|$|E
50|$|The top-bar hive is {{so named}} because the bees draw their comb from a top bar, {{suspended}} {{across the top of}} a cavity, and not inside a full rectangular frame with sides and a bottom bar. The beekeeper does not provide foundation wax (or provides only a small starter piece of foundation) for the bees to build from. The bees build the comb so it hangs down from the top bar. This is in keeping with the way bees build wax in a natural cavity. There is some belief that the use of <b>natural</b> <b>wax</b> in a top-bar hive supports the bees' natural systems in ways that improve their health.|$|E
5000|$|Natural {{glazing agents}} have been found, usually in plants or insects. In nature, the agents {{are used to}} keep the {{moisture}} in the organism, but science has harnessed this characteristic by {{turning it into a}} glazing agent that acts as a coating. The glazing agent is made up of a substance that is classified as a wax. A <b>natural</b> <b>wax</b> is chemically defined as an ester with a very long hydrocarbon chain that also includes a long chain alcohol. However, in a wax there have been many different chemical structures that can be included in a definition of a wax, such as: wax esters, sterol esters, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, hydrocarbons, and sterols.|$|E

50|$|Although many <b>natural</b> <b>waxes</b> contain esters, {{paraffin}} waxes are hydrocarbons, mixtures of alkanes {{usually in a}} homologous series of chain lengths. These materials represent a significant fraction of petroleum. They are refined by vacuum distillation. Paraffin waxes are mixtures of saturated n- and iso- alkanes, naphthenes, and alkyl- and naphthene-substituted aromatic compounds. A typical alkane paraffin wax chemical composition comprises hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2, such as Hentriacontane, C31H64. The degree of branching has an important influence on the properties. Microcrystalline wax is a lesser produced petroleum based wax that contains higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons.|$|R

5000|$|Bulk fruit (such as apples, oranges, pears, and the like) is {{delivered}} to the plant via trucks or wagons, where it is dumped into receiving bins and sorted for quality and size. In the case of citrus, ripe fruit with a greenish tint is placed in special storage rooms where ethylene gas is used {{to bring out the}} color. Obvious [...] "culls" [...] (fruit that is not suitable to sell for eating due to cosmetic defects) is removed and sold for juice or other uses. Fruit that is ready to be packed into crates or flats is run through a washer and then air-dried.

5000|$|The {{practice}} of oiling parchment or paper {{in order to}} make it semi-translucent or moisture-proof goes back at least to the middle ages. Paper impregnated or coated with purified beeswax was widely used throughout the 19th century to retain or exclude moisture, or to wrap odorous products. Gustave Le Gray introduced the use of waxed paper for photographic negatives in 1851. [...] <b>Natural</b> <b>wax</b> was largely replaced for the making of wax paper (or paraffine paper) after Herman Frasch developed ways of purifying paraffin and coating paper with it in 1876. Wax paper is commonly used in cooking for its non-stick properties, and wrapping food for storage, such as cookies, as it keeps water out or in. It is also used in arts and crafts.|$|E

The samples are subjected to an ammonia extraction, to separate proteins from lipids and resins. Proteins are then determined after hydrolysis assisted by microwaves, derivatisation with a silylating agent and GC/MS of the amino acids. Lipids and resins are then subjected to a saponification step assisted by microwaves followed by GC/MS analyses of neutral and acidic compounds obtained after solvent extraction and derivatisation with a silylating agent.|$|R
