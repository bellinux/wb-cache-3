5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Ramcharitmanas, there is a section devoted to the veneration of the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. As per Tulsidas, repeating the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is the only means to attain God in the Kali age where the means suited for other ages like meditation, Karma, and Puja are ineffective. He says in Kavitavali that his own redemption is because of the power, glory and majesty of the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama. In a couplet in the Gitavali, Tulsidas says that wishing for liberation without refuge in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is like wishing to climb to the sky by holding on to the falling rain. In his view, the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama is greater than both Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God – it controls both of them and is illuminates both like a bilingual interpreter. In a verse in the Dohavali, Tulsidas says that the Nirguna Brahman resides in his heart, the Saguna Brahman resides in his eyes and the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Rama resides on his tongue, as if a radiant gemstone is kept between the lower and upper halves of a golden casket. He holds that Rama is superior to all other names of God, and argues that ra and ma being are the only two consonants that are written above all other consonants in the conjunct form in Sanskrit because they are the two sounds in the word Rama.|$|E

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on {{archbishop}} Stefan Yavorsky’s works which reflect the transitional character of late 17 th — early 18 th centuries Russian sermons. Before that time the genre had been loyal to the canonical principles of scholasticism, and beginning with Stefan Yavorsky the sermon was enriched with new ways of material presentation and new content. The use of numerous biblical personal <b>names,</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> saints, Fathers of the Church and theologians represents a trait inherent in the sermon as a genre, a wide use <b>of</b> non-biblical <b>names</b> being chiefly a distinctive feature of scholastic works. Among those names the author points out: 1) <b>names</b> <b>of</b> saints, Fathers of the Church, church hierarchs; 2) <b>names</b> <b>of</b> gods and heroes <b>of</b> Antiquity; 3) <b>names</b> <b>of</b> ancient philosophers, historians and rulers; 4) <b>names</b> <b>of</b> foreign rulers, historians and public figures of the modern period; 5) <b>names</b> <b>of</b> Russian rulers. Thereby, the anthroponyms of non-biblical origin could be attributes <b>of</b> both “informational” (<b>names</b> <b>of</b> ancient gods and historical figures) and “spiritual” (<b>names</b> <b>of</b> saints, Fathers of the Church, church hierarchs) parts of a sermon.
