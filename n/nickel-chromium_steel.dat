40|$|Controlled radical polymerizations (CRPs) {{are among}} the most {{powerful}} methods to obtain polymers with well-defined properties and high value. Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is the most used technique in both academia and industry in the field of CRP, thanks to its versatility and simple setup. In ATRP, a metal complex in a low oxidation state, MtzLm (typically a copper-amine system, [Cu(I) L]+) reacts with a dormant polymeric chain Pn-X (where X = Cl, Br) to produce radicals Pn-*. Such radicals can propagate the polymeric chain by addition to a monomer in the bulk of the solution. In this process, the copper complex is oxidized and binds to X-, generating the deactivating species [X-Cu(II) L]+, which can trap the propagating radicals. ATRP equilibrium is well shifted towards the dormant species Pn-X, so that Pn-* concentration is very low and the probability of bimolecular radical-radical termination is minimized. Macromolecular growth begins essentially at once for all chains thanks to the utilization of very efficient alkyl halides (RX) as polymerization initiators. In such conditions, chain growth is homogenous and it is possible to obtain polymers with predetermined molecular weight, narrow molecular-weight distribution, and high C-X chain end fidelity. ATRP allows constructing macromolecules with specific composition, architecture and position of functional groups. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to both the understanding and development of ATRP catalyzed by copper complexes, using electrochemical methods as both analytical tools and instruments to carry out and control the polymerization. The work focused on both thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ATRP catalytic systems, and the use of such systems to efficiently control macromolecular growth. The investigated ATRP systems can be considered "green" for several reasons: (i) most of the work regarded the study and development of the reaction in water, a solvent generally characterized by high catalytic activity but poor polymerization control; (ii) electrochemical methods for catalyst regeneration (electrochemically mediated ATRP, eATRP) allowed carrying out the polymerization with low amounts of copper complexes; (iii) ionic liquids, a new class of non-flammable and easily recyclable solvents, were explored as potential media for eATRP; (iv) the mechanism of ATRP mediated by organic catalysts (metal-free ATRP) was investigated and defined. A fundamental characteristic of Cu(I) catalysts is their reactivity towards the Pn-X (or initiator RX) bond cleavage, with generation of propagating radicals Pn-*. Any detailed investigation of catalyst reactivity in water was impossible up to now, because of their extremely high reactivity in this solvent. For this purpose, it was necessary to develop a set of electrochemical transient methods, which involve active [Cu(I) L]+ complex generation, and analysis, in the proximity of the electrode surface. Such techniques allowed measuring kact (ATRP activation rate constant) values spanning a broad interval covering 5 orders of magnitude. This permitted the study of the most active and latest developed catalysts and initiators, in common polar and active solvents such as water and DMSO. kact correlates linearly with both ATRP equilibrium constant (KATRP) and RX bond dissociation free energy. Such correlations help to predict the reactivity of new catalyst/initiators and to select rationally polymerization conditions. ATRP catalysts were investigated in the ionic liquid 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium triflate. Both Cu/L speciation and reactivity were found to be suitable with a well-controlled polymerization process. Overall, thermodynamic and kinetics aspects of ATRP catalysts in ionic liquids appear to be similar to that observed in common organic solvents (e. g. CH 3 CN, DMF). In water, copper catalysts are not only characterized by an extreme reactivity, but also by their involvement in side reactions that can undermine efficiency of ATRP equilibrium (e. g. complex decomposition in both acid and basic environment and dissociation of the halide ion from the deactivating complex [X-Cu(II) L]+). Quantification of such reactions allowed defining stability intervals of most used ATRP catalysts in water. Defined limits of control were tested by carrying out an extensive series of polymerizations of the monomer oligo(ethyleneoxide) methylether methacrylate (OEOMA). Polymerizations were conducted with electrochemical (re) generation of the active [Cu(I) L]+ complex (eATRP). Exceptionally active catalysts such as Cu/Me 6 TREN (Me 6 TREN = tris[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl]amine) provided fast and controlled polymerizations with slow Cu(I) regeneration; inexpensive systems such as Cu/PMDETA (PMDETA = N,N,N-,N [...] ,N [...] -pentamethyl diethylenetetramine) needed a large X- excess in order to prevent [X-Cu(II) L]+ dissociation. Pyridinic complexes, such as Cu/TPMA (TPMA = tris(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine), were stable down to extremely acidic pH (ca. 1). Overall, these results allowed unprecedented control over conditions of macromolecular growth in water. In addition, they opened a new avenue for the polymerization of acidic monomers, a class of building blocks currently considered to be problematic, or even impossible, to be polymerized by ATRP. The main reason preventing ATRP of methacrylic acid was a cyclization reaction involving the chain end, with the terminal halogen as leaving group. Simple strategies, described in chapter 4, allowed dramatically improving conversion and control over MAA polymerization. Such conditions allowed synthesis of well-controlled high molecular weight poly(methacrylic acid), PMAA, with degree of polymerization > 1000. Simple (poly) halogenated organic initiators such as 2 -bromoisobutyric acid, 2, 2 -dichloropropionic acid, and trichloroacetic acid were used to produce linear, telechelic, and three-arm star PMAA, respectively. An electrochemical switch, used to repeatedly stop and reactivate the growing chains, confirmed the "livingness" of the process. Electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization allowed exceptional control over Cu(I) (re) generation. Its main limitations are the relatively complicated reaction setup and the requirement of both working and counter electrodes made of platinum, an expensive and rare metal. To overcome these limits, first several alternative noble and non-noble metals were tested as cathode materials. Carbon materials (e. g. glassy carbon), noble metals (Au, Ag) and non-noble metals and alloys (stainless <b>steel,</b> <b>nickel-chromium,</b> titanium) could efficiently control aqueous eATRP of OEOMA. The system setup was simplified by switching from potentiostatic conditions (three-electrode setup under fixed potential) to galvanostatic conditions (two-electrode setup with fixed current). Moreover, reaction setup was further simplified {{with the use of a}} sacrificial counter electrode directly immersed in the polymerization media. This solution allowed avoiding separation of anodic and cathodic compartments. These results can allow easier implementation and scale-up of electrochemically mediated ATRP. Catalysis in the absence of transition metals is important in fine electronics and biomedical applications. It has recently been shown that some derivatives of phenothiazine (PTZ) could mediate well-controlled metal-free ATRP of methacrylates, with generation of controlled polymers with living characteristics. In this case, a phenothiazine derivative in the excited state (PTZ*, obtained through UV light absorption) can activate the Pn-X bond generating the propagating radicals (Pn-*) and the radical cation PTZ-*+. Experimental rate constant of Pn-X activation by PTZ* (7 x 109 M- 1 s- 1) was compared to the value calculated using Marcus theory for electron transfer and its successive developments (2 x 1010 M- 1 s- 1). The good agreement between the two values proved that the reaction between PTZ* and Pn-X involves an outer sphere electron transfer with simultaneous C-X bond breaking. This system is radically different from traditional Cu-mediated ATRP, which involves an inner sphere electron transfer. In addition, reactivity in metal-free ATRP is regulated by completely different parameters (excitation wavelength, lifetime and quantum efficiency of excited states). In particular, in metal-free ATRP fast activation of the C-X bond is hindered by low lifetime of PTZ* excited state. Regarding deactivation of propagating radicals, cyclic voltammetry evidenced excellent correlation between stability of the radical cation PTZ-*+ and efficiency of deactivation. The favored pathway for radical deactivation is the termolecular encounter of Pn-*, PTZ-*+ and X-, which is severely hampered by the low likelihood of three-center reactions. As a result, metal-free ATRP is mediated by a slow activation-deactivation process, which currently limits control over macromolecular growth. Such results are fundamental for the design of optimal reaction conditions and for the development of more effective catalyst...|$|R
