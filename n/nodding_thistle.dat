Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity.

40|$|A <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans L.) {{population}} {{had been reported}} from Argyll in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, which had poor susceptibility to MCPA and 2, 4 -D. Plants from the Argyll population were grown beside another Hawkes Bay <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> population in a glasshouse and their dose response curves for MCPA were compared in three separate experiments. The Argyll population was significantly less susceptible to MCPA in all experiments, though the magnitude of resistance varied between experiments from 5 -fold to 14 -fold. When grown beside {{each other in the}} field, the Argyll population was 7 times more resistant to MCPA than the other population. A range of other herbicides was applied to the Argyll <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> population. Cross-resistance was detected for 2, 4 -D and MCPB, but no significant decreases in susceptibility were detected with mecoprop, clopyralid, picloram, dicamba, paraquat/diquat or glyphosate. A significant reduction in susceptibility to tribenuron-methyl was measured in a field experiment, but this difference was not apparent when the experiment was repeated in a glasshouse. The cross-resistance to MCPA, MCPB and 2, 4 -D meant selective control of <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> at Argyll in clover-based pastures was now very difficult to achieve. <b>Nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> populations from 20 Hawkes Bay and 7 Waikato properties were tested for resistance to MCPA, and significant levels of resistance were detected in 14 of these populations. Interviews of property owners indicated that resistance had developed where 2, 4 -D or MCPA had been applied annually for many years, whereas properties without resistance had been sprayed less regularly. Resistant and susceptible <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> seedlings were grown together at a 1 : 1 ratio under conditions of nutrient stress to determine whether herbicide-resistant <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> plants are less competitive than normal. No difference was detected between the resistant and susceptible biotypes used. Under some conditions, susceptible plants {{were more likely to have}} high trichome densities on their leaves, but this trait was found to be too variable and not correlated closely enough with herbicide susceptibility to be useful in distinguishing between resistant and susceptible biotypes. Significant differences in susceptibility to MCPA were maintained between resistant and susceptible biotypes even when leaf surfaces were damaged to allow better foliar penetration of the herbicide, or when herbicide was applied to plants via the root system. Thus the mode of resistance did not appear to involve difficulties with foliar uptake. Studies with radiolabelled 2, 4 -D confirmed that resistance did not relate to poor leaf penetration. These experiments indicated that 2, 4 -D was broken down more rapidly in resistant plants. Other findings were that 2, 4 -D or its metabolites were released in greater quantities from the root systems of susceptible plants, and that herbicide molecules were more difficult to extract from the interior of susceptible plants, possibly due to increased binding. Reasons why resistance to phenoxy herbicides has developed in <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> are discussed, and techniques for controlling resistant populations selectively in pastures and preventing further resistance from developing are also analysed...|$|E

Between 31 October and 15 December 2003, the phenology of both R. conicus and U. solstitialis was studied at a dryland site in Canterbury. Adult R. conicus were more numerous than U. solstitialis on capitula throughout the experiment.

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine whether the}} weed control benefits of high sowing rates of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) continued into the second year after sowing. Seeds of Scotch thistle (Cirsium vulgare), <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans), ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) and hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale) were sown into established perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens) swards both in trays and in the field, in late autumn. The emerging weed seedlings were mapped at intervals to enable their fate to be followed. In the trays, seedlings were mapped at four week intervals, and the experiment continued for four or five months, depending on the species. In the field, weed seedlings were mapped both before and after each grazing and the experiment continued for seven months. The trays with low ryegrass sowing rates had a higher density of white clover than those trays with high ryegrass sowing rates. In the field plots with low sowing rates, both the broad-leaved weed population and volunteer grasses were more abundant than in the high ryegrass sowing rate plots. This resulted in the different treatments having a similar competitive ability against the sown weed seeds, one year after the swards were sown. Both <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> and Scotch thistle emergence was extremely low in the bare ground trays, probably relating to seed predation of these large seeds off bare soil. Scotch thistle and hedge mustard emergence were both reduced by high sowing rates of perennial ryegrass when compared to trays and field plots sown with white clover only. <b>Nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> and ragwort however provided some unusual results. Both of these species experienced an increase in total emergence as ryegrass sowing rate increased. With <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle,</b> this occurred in the field and with ragwort, in the trays. This obviously was unexpected but in reality the increases in emergence, although significant, were small and of little practical importance. The increases probably related to the similar competitive ability of the swards one year after pasture sowing. Emergence of ragwort in the field and <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> in the trays was not affected by ryegrass sowing rate. For all species, in both the field and the trays, emergence was delayed as the sowing rate increased. There was very low mortality in the tray experiment. Mortality was much higher in the field due to the effects of grazing animals and also the longer time frame of the field experiment. All hedge mustard seedlings that emerged in the field were killed, and only one <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> seedling survived {{to the end of the}} experiment. With both Scotch thistle and ragwort, seedlings seemed to have a higher chance of surviving in the high density ryegrass treatments, probably due to the physical protection from grazing animals provided by ryegrass. High mortality in the field experiment rendered seedling size data meaningless. In the trays, for all species, the heaviest seedlings were found in the treatments with either bare ground or where only clover was sown, indicating that competition from ryegrass had a serious negative effect on weed size. Weed size did not vary significantly as ryegrass sowing rate increased. In conclusion it would appear that most of the weed control advantages from higher sowing rates of perennial ryegrass are obtained in the first year after sowing, as all swards that contain perennial ryegrass appear to have a similar competitive ability against invading weeds in the second year after sowing...|$|E

40|$|Musk, or <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> is an aggressive, {{biennial}} herb with showy red-purple {{flowers and}} painful spiny stems and leaves. Mature plants range in height from 1 to 6 feet tall, and have multi-branched stems. Leaves are dark green, coarsely lobed, {{with a smooth}} waxy surface and a yellowish to white spine at the tip. The large disk-shaped flower heads, containing hundreds of tiny individual flowers, are 1 to 3 inches in length and occur at the tips of stems. Flower heads will droop to a 90 -degree angle from the stem when mature, hence its alternate name, <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle.</b> Each plant may produce thousands of straw-colored seeds adorned with plume-like bristles. ECOLOGICAL THREAT Because musk thistle is unpalatable to wildlife and livestock, selective grazing leads to severe degradation of native meadows and grasslands as wildlife focus their foraging on native plants, giving musk thistle a competitive advantage. Although musk thistle is infrequently found in dense forests, it can colonize areas subjected to natural disturbances such as landslides or frequent flooding.

40|$|Within {{recent years}} the <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> or musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.) has be-come {{naturalized}} and abundant in northwestern Ohio {{in at least two}} areas, the Castalia-Bellevue-Sandusky area and the Carey area. In the summers of 1967 and 1968, the total detailed distribution of Carduus nutans in these two areas was mapped by noting its occur-rence and abundance in relation to the general geologic conditions, topographic features, and habitats. The thistle was most abundant in moderately grazed pasture fields, hay fields, and along grassy roadsides on high, dry ridges and hillsides where the limestone or dolomite bedrock was less than six feet below the surface. Plants were rare or infre-quent where the bedrock was deeper, in flatter terrain, in cultivated fields, and along railroad tracks.

40|$|Biological {{control has}} become a major focus for {{managing}} a variety of agricultural and conservation weeds in New Zealand. For nearly 2 decades Landcare Research (formerly DSIR) has operated successful technology transfer programs with most organizations that manage weeds in New Zealand. Program success is based on strong relationships built up between Landcare Research and participating organizations over this time, and their evolution in response to changing times and the unique needs of each participating organization. As well as providing nucleus populations of biological control agents (insects, mites, and fungi), Landcare Research now offers strategies for managing and enhancing the impact of the agents, more efficient and relevant monitoring and assessment techniques, advice about new projects, and most importantly, comprehensive training in biological control theory and practice. As a result, a network of well-trained people now manage biological control programs for 14 weed species nationwide. Biological control agents have been released faster and more widely than was previously possible. Establishment success is high (95 %), and at least 3 weeds: alligator weed (Alternanthera philoxeroides), <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans), and ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) are reported to be under control at many sites.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the mineral content in ten New Zealand monofloral honeys, in order to distinguish whether New Zealand monofloral honeys are a good source of minerals compared to honeys from other parts of the world. The ten monofloral honeys were collected from a local honey factory (Airborne Honey Ltd, Leeston), Clover, Honeydew, Kamahi, Manuka, <b>Nodding</b> <b>Thistle,</b> Rata, Rewarewa, Tawari, Thyme and Vipers Bugloss honeys were been investigated. The water content, water activity, pH, conductivity, colour and mineral content were evaluated. The water activity was averaged for all the ten New Zealand monofloral honeys and set to 0. 59 aw, which indicates a high stability and long shelf life as a food stuff. A strong correlation between total mineral content, pH, conductivity and colour was obtained. Higher mineral content gives a higher pH, lower conductivity and a darker colour of the honeys. Alltogether 18 different minerals were found in the New Zealand monofloral honeys, Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Zn.

40|$|Grass weeds such as Panicum miliaceum L. (broom corn millet) are a {{persistent}} problem for agriculture, causing significant crop losses. A weedy biotype of broom corn millet {{is already a}} troublesome weed on North American arable farms, and has recently emerged {{as a threat to}} New Zealand corn and maize crops. This thesis describes aspects of the biology of broom corn millet under New Zealand conditions. Experiments were designed to understand under what conditions broom corn millet is mostly likely to affect crop growth. Experiments were conducted in a glass house and a laboratory to observe the effect of temperature on germination and early growth of broom corn millet. The pot-based glasshouse experiment compared germination and growth between a range of controlled substrate temperatures. The response of broom corn millet to temperature was typical of that expected for a Câ‚„ plant. At 10 Â°C seeds germinated later and in lower proportions compared to 15 Â°C, 20 Â°C and 25 Â°C. Growth and above ground dry biomass accumulation also increased with increasing substrate temperature, with the highest dry biomass accumulated at 25 Â°C, primarily because of increases in germination rate. In a laboratory experiment conducted at temperatures ranging from 5 Â°C and 34 Â°C, temperatures {{greater than or equal to}} 20 Â°C were more favourable for germination of broom corn millet seeds. The optimum temperatures for germination were 27 Â°C to 34 Â°C. The threshold germination temperature for the seed lot used was 7. 4 Â°C. Broom corn millet seeds were tested for their ability to germinate and emerge from a range of planting depths when planted in pots containing 16 soil types from around New Zealand. Seedlings emerged from 120 mm depth in all soil types. In six soil types seeds of broom corn millet were able to emerge from the greatest depth tested of 170 mm, very deep compared to most herbaceous weeds. In general, seedling emergence reduced with increasing depth, whereas suicidal germination increased. Step-wise binomial regression of emergence against various soil physical properties did not reveal any significant relationship between soil physical properties and seedling emergence. To observe the affect of competition on both the weed (broom corn millet) and the crop (sweet corn), plants of both species were grown together in pots at a range of planting ratios. Plants were also grown in monoculture to observe growth without competition. In the competition trial broom corn millet emerged after sweet corn and affected sweet corn above ground biomass during the first four weeks. However, this effect did not persist as sweet corn biomass increased irrespective of the level of competition from broom corn millet plants. The monoculture experiment indicated that sweet corn grew better without competition whereas growth of broom corn millet was stimulated while growing in competition. The poor competition by broom corn millet plants was assumed to be the result of unseasonal low temperatures during the period immediately after sewing and demonstrated that broom corn millet plants emerging after the crop may not affect crop growth. The likely persistence of New Zealand broom corn millet seeds in soil is unknown. A laboratory based Controlled Ageing Test (CAT) was therefore evaluated for its ability to predict the persistence of seeds. The test was conducted using seeds of <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> (Carduus nutans), for which real time persistence data is available. In two additional experiments, the CAT was used to estimate the potential persistence of New Zealand sourced broom corn millet seeds. The CAT derived half life time (Pâ‚…â‚€) of <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> seeds did not compare well with the field derived Pâ‚…â‚€ for <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> seeds, with the CAT results suggesting less persistence compared to actual persistence. Examination of the CAT results for broom corn millet showed a decline in seed viability from 30 to 50 days, followed by a sharp decline at 75 days. The midpoint of the initial decline (40 days) was taken as the P 50 for broom corn millet. This value is similar to existing information for broom corn millet in North America, and indicates that broom corn millet will form a moderately persistent seed bank in New Zealand. In conclusion, results suggest that higher temperatures favour the growth of broom corn millet. Planting of crops earlier in the season may reduce competition by this weed. However, increasing temperatures as a result of global climate change will enhance conditions for broom corn millet and may increase future crop losses caused by this weed. The ability of broom corn milletâ€™s relatively large seeds to germinate and emerge from depth will limit the efficiency of conventional weed control practices, such as ploughing and stale seed beds. The ability to form a moderately persistent seed bank suggests that once introduced, broom corn millet will be challenging to eradicate because of its prolific seed production. Significant changes in weed control practices will therefore be required to manage broom corn millet in the future...|$|E
40|$|Multispecies grazing {{research}} was conducted using meat-type goats (Capra hircus L.) and Jersey heifers (Bos taurus L.) to determine the relationships between multiple grazing treatments and pasture utilization. The study was conducted for 60 days on the Western Kentucky University Farm in Bowling Green, KY. Cattle and goats have shown to differ in grazing preferences and to be economically important to the area. Grazing treatments included goats and cattle grazing simultaneously, sequentially, and goats grazing alone. A typical established Kentucky pasture was utilized with no weed management practices employed. Predominant forage species included tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), and white clover (Trifolium repens L.). Exclosures were utilized as controls. Data included forage quality, composition, availability, height, visual weed cover and live ground cover, and thistle consumption, collected every 15 days. Results indicated {{a significant difference in}} sample dry weights between grazing treatments and ungrazed controls in every treatment except when goats followed cattle. At day 60, grazed areas had significantly lower forage heights than the control when goats grazed with and before cattle. Instances where goats followed cattle resulted in significantly higher NDF compared to the control. All treatments containing goats had significantly lower leaf numbers per thistle plant (Carduus nutans L.) than cattle only treatment. Based on this study, sequential and simultaneous grazing of cattle and goats may be an effective <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> control strategy, but future experimentation is needed for determination of forage utilization and quality relationships...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that NIR might {{be capable of}} discriminating one floral source from another was explored. No prior analysis of NIR for New Zealand honeys has been reported. A visual inspection of the NIR spectra of ten New Zealand honey types indicates that beech honeydew honey is significantly different from nectar honeys. Rata honey is the most unique nectar honey with very little variability seen in the NIR spectra compared to other honey types. Both beech honeydew and rata honey can be distinguished from other floral types using Linear Discriminant analysis (LDA) on selected wavelengths. A degree of clustering within other honey types is achieved, however none of these are fully resolved. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) model successfully classified all main New Zealand unifloral honeys with an average correct classification of 93 %. 100 % of all beech honeydew honeys were correctly classified with close to 100 % achieved for rata, kamahi, manuka, rewarewa and clover honeys. Honeys with a clover contribution: tawari, thyme, <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> and vipersâ€Ÿ bugloss displayed reduced performance in this model with a proportion of samples misclassified as clover honey. These {{results indicate that the}} NIR spectra evaluated using a PLS model would be an effective industry classification method for the identification of New Zealand unifloral honeys with the exception of <b>nodding</b> <b>thistle</b> and vipersâ€Ÿ bugloss honeys. A multi-technique classification model incorporating NIR classification results with conductivity, colour and sugar analysis has been proposed. A series of compounds in manuka honey were examined in respect to UMF activity. The carbohydrate profiles of 38 manuka honeys of varying UMF activity were determined using a combination of HPLC, GC-FID and GC-MS. A method was developed to determine the proportion of nigerose, turanose, maltose and maltulose in reduced and silylated honey using the ratio of m/z 307 to m/z 308 ion responses as determined by GC-MS-SIM. An examination of the glucose and fructose concentrations in manuka honey revealed a moderate correlation between the glucose/fructose ratio and UMF activity. Due to an improvement in chromatographic resolution, the peak assignment of three disaccharides (cellobiose, laminaribiose and gentibiose) differed from that of a previous investigation. Despite the retention time of palatinose being identical to the corresponding peak in honey, an examination of the mass spectra provided strong evidence to suggest that the corresponding honey disaccharide is Î±- 1 â†’ 2 linked as opposed to Î²- 1 â†’ 6 linked and that it was therefore unlikely that this peak arose from palatinose. The mono and disaccharide composition of manuka honey was evaluated with respect to the level of UMF activity. Linear Discriminant analysis successfully distinguished between high, moderate and low UMF activity honeys. Glucose was identified as the single most important compound in the discriminant model. The connection between glucose concentration and UMF activity was not unexpected as a significant proportion of UMF activity has been attributed to the presence of methyl glyoxal, a degradation product of glucose. The existences of indicator compounds in honeys from various floral origins were examined. The extractable organic substances of five New Zealand honeys: beech honeydew honey, kamahi, pohutukawa, rata and tawari were determined by GC-MS of methylated extracts. This survey confirmed the results of a previous investigation and established ranges for marker compounds. Due to difficulties in obtaining sufficient certified unifloral honeys, previous studies on these honey types were exploratory only and not published. Statistical analysis of the extractable organic substances showed that each honey contains a unique fingerprint of compounds. Agglomerative clustering successfully separated all honeys into the correct floral group with the exception of two samples. Well separated clusters were produced in the score plot of the first and second Linear Discriminants. 4 -Hydroxyphenylacetic acid, salicylic acid, indole- 3 -acetic acid and an unknown compound (identified by characteristic ions in the mass spectra) were identified as being the most important discriminants, all of which were present in a single floral source...|$|E
