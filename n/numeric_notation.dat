50|$|In casual settings, {{alphanumeric}} date formats {{are usually}} written with a middle-endian order (month-day-year) {{in a way}} {{similar to that of}} the United States. Another format, the little-endian order (day-month-year) is widely applied in more formal transactions and written communications especially in businesses, the government and academe, also in the military and usually the police, although the middle-endian format is still prevalent in daily use (except the armed forces). Since there is no law mandating the date order, minimum or maximum length, or format (i.e. alphanumeric or <b>numeric),</b> <b>notations</b> sometimes vary from office to office, in private and public sectors. Such can be observed in passports issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which particularly notate the date numerically as MM-DD-YY, and in house bills or executive orders dated alphanumerically with a MMMM-DD-YYYY format.|$|R
5000|$|Juggling {{notation}} is {{the written}} depiction of concepts {{and practices in}} juggling. Toss juggling patterns {{have a reputation for}} being [...] "easier done than said" [...] - while it might be easy to learn a given maneuver and demonstrate it for others, it is often much harder to communicate the idea accurately using speech or plain text. To circumvent this problem, various <b>numeric</b> or diagram-based <b>notation</b> systems have been developed to facilitate communication of patterns or tricks between jugglers, as well the investigation and discovery of new patterns.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{reflection}} on activities designed for computer-enhanced in-service training of high school mathematics teachers. The goal of these activities is two-fold: to promote advanced mathematical thinking, and to introduce new uses of existing technology tools. The authors suggest using jointly a computer-based graphing calculator, a dynamic geometry program, and a spreadsheet program in exploring linear algebraic equations to bridge finite and infinite mathematicsstructures. A linear algebraic equation may be introduced {{in the context of}} mathematically modeling a uniform movement. In turn, in the technology-rich environment, solving a linear algebraic equation can be introduced through the method of iterations that ultimately leads to the discussion of infinite processes. This opens a window on the complexity of infinite structures, which includes the convergent, divergent and cyclic behavior of iterative sequences. Computerenhanced representations of infinite processes include bisector-bounded staircases and cobweb diagrams, animated pencils of straight lines, and iterations of sequences both in <b>numeric</b> and graphic <b>notations.</b> Finally, by exploring a piece-wise linear recursion, one can arrive at the frontiers of mathematical knowledge, and, in developing mature concepts of convergence, divergence and cycles, experience how chaos—aremarkable phenomena of modern mathematics—can arise in dynamic systems of a surprisingly simple form...|$|R

50|$|Diagram-based notations are {{the clearest}} {{way to show}} juggling {{patterns}} on paper, but as {{they are based on}} images, their use is limited in text-based communication.

50|$|Curwen {{felt the}} need for a simple way of {{teaching}} how to sing by note through his experiences among Sunday school teachers. Stemming from his religious and social beliefs, Curwen thought that music should be easily accessible to all classes and ages of people. Apart from Glover, similar ideas had been elaborated in France by Pierre Galin (1786-1821), Aimé Paris (1798-1866) and Emile Chevé (1804-1864), whose method of teaching how to read at sight also depended on the principle of tonic relationship being taught by the reference of every sound to its tonic, and by the use of a <b>numeric</b> <b>notation.</b> Curwen adapted French time names from Paris' Langue de durées.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-level scansion is {{generally}} {{a sign of}} a more linguistically oriented prosodist at work. Otto Jespersen introduced his <b>numeric</b> <b>notation</b> in 1900 (in Danish; English translation in 1933). He occasionally added a 5th level, indicating a fully stressed syllable further emphasized by phrasal stress. In 1951 Trager & Smith posited 4 phonemic levels of stress in English. This was in a broad linguistic context, not specifically pertaining to verse; nevertheless, in the 1950s and 1960s linguistically oriented prosodists (such as John Thompson, Harold Whitehall, and Seymour Chatman) attempted to use these 4 levels of stress to formulate a fuller explanation of meter. Chomsky & Halle's work did not specifically address verse, but their notation of stress (effectively, Jespersen's turned upside-down) was also influential; Chomsky & Halle posited more than 4 levels of stress, but typically only 4 are used in scansion.|$|E
5000|$|Muisca numerals {{were the}} <b>numeric</b> <b>notation</b> system {{used by the}} Muisca, {{one of the four}} {{advanced}} civilizations of the Americas before the Spanish conquest of the Muisca. Just like the Mayas, the Muisca had a vigesimal numerical system, based on multiples of twenty (Chibcha: gueta). The Muisca numerals were based on counting with fingers and toes. They had specific numbers from one to ten, yet for the numbers between eleven and nineteen they used [...] "foot one" [...] (11) to [...] "foot nine" [...] (19). The number 20 was the 'perfect' number for the Muisca which is visible in their calendar. To calculate higher numbers than 20 they used multiples of their 'perfect' number; gue-muyhica would be [...] "20 times 4", so 80. To describe [...] "50" [...] they used [...] "20 times 2 plus 10"; gue-bosa asaqui ubchihica, transcripted from guêboʒhas aſaqɣ hubchìhicâ. In their calendar, which was lunisolar, they only counted from one to ten and twenty. Each number had a special meaning, related to their deities and certain animals, especially the abundant toads.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{much of its}} history, {{the shape}} of digamma/stigma has often been {{very similar to that}} of other symbols, with which it can easily be confused. In ancient papyri, the cursive C-shaped form of numeric digamma is often indistinguishable from the C-shaped ("lunate") form that was then the common form of sigma. The {{similarity}} is still found today, since both the modern stigma (ϛ) and modern final sigma (ς) look identical or almost identical in most fonts; both are historically continuations of their ancient C-shaped forms with the addition of the same downward flourish. If the two characters are distinguished in print, the top loop of stigma tends to be somewhat larger and to extend farther to the right than that of final sigma. The two characters are, however, always distinguishable from the context in modern usage, both in <b>numeric</b> <b>notation</b> and in text: the final form of sigma never occurs in numerals (the number 200 being always written with the medial sigma, σ), and in normal Greek text the sequence [...] "στ" [...] can never occur word-finally.|$|E
5000|$|Descriptive {{notation}} is a notation {{for recording}} chess games, {{and at one}} time {{was the most popular}} notation in English- and Spanish-speaking countries [...] It was used in Europe until it was superseded by algebraic notation, introduced by Philipp Stamma in 1737. Algebraic notation is more concise and requires less effort to avoid ambiguity, but much older literature uses descriptive notation. Descriptive notation exists in many language-based variants, the most prevalent being English descriptive notation and Spanish descriptive notation. Natural language was generally used to describe moves in early chess literature and is the ultimate source of all forms of descriptive notation. Over time, abbreviations became common, and a system of notation gradually evolved. By the time of Howard Staunton's The Chess-Player's Handbook (1847), a common first move for White was recorded as [...] "P. to K's 4th.", which was later reduced to [...] "P-K4". Notably, {{in the back of the}} book, Staunton offers brief descriptions of long algebraic notation, noting its adoption by [...] "Alexandre, Jaenisch, the 'Handbuch,' and in Germany generally" [...] , and of [...] "Koch's Notation" [...] , now generally known as ICCF <b>numeric</b> <b>notation.</b>|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1993 Micheal John GiddensTwentieth-century music education has been considerably enhanced by the respective-pedagogies devised by Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, Zoltan Kodály, and Carl Orff. Originality, even genius, aside, these educationalists drew upon past ideals {{in order to create}} music-learning strategies appropriate to individual needs and circumstances. This eclecticism embraced ideas as disparate as the Greek Choral Trinity, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's <b>numeric</b> <b>notation,</b> Galin-Paris-Chevé's music education method, Sarah Glover's and John Curwen's sol-fa, Mathis Lussy's theories concerning rhythm, Adolphe Appia's prophetic theories on stage-craft, Edouard Claparède's psychological research, Eugene Ysaÿe's thoughts on violin practice, and the "new wave" dance inaugurated by such artists as Isadora Duncan and Mary Wigman. Collectively, Dalcroze's Eurhythmics, Kodály's Choral Method, and Orff’s Schulwerk provide wide ranging principles and strategies for teaching music appropriate to young children and the training of professional singers and instrumentalists. The question remains, should the Dalcroze, Kodály and Orff systems be taught as mutually exclusive methodologies, a course of action strenuously advocated by some educationalists, or should each music teacher adopt a holistic approach, turning to the example set by these celebrated Swiss, Hungarian and German pedagogues, {{in order to create a}} music program tailored to the student's needs as judged by the professional teacher? The search for an answer gives rise to deep-seated methodological conflicts, at least one of which - the notorious 'fixed' versus 'movable' doh - has generated dissension amongst music educators for more than a century. At the same time, this investigation provides an opportunity to rectify the neglect which Anglo-Saxon educators have afforded Dalcroze's solfège studies and, no less, their neglect of his influence upon both Kodály and Orff.
