5|$|Orangutans {{are thought}} to be the sole fruit {{disperser}} for some plant species including the climber species Strychnos ignatii which contains the toxic alkaloid strychnine.

5|$|Rybka does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{planned for}} any {{significant}} contingencies such as {{errors in the}} intelligence on the location of Tito's headquarters. His only contingency plan {{was that he would}} fire a red signal flare to order all available forces to converge on his position for subsequent tasks.|$|E

5|$|Starfish do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> any {{mechanisms}} for osmoregulation, {{and keep their}} body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, {{the lack of an}} osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.|$|E
5|$|Stela 2 {{was found}} in centre of the West Plaza. The butt of this stela {{was found in}} its {{original}} location, although the shaft has broken and fallen backwards. Stela 2 does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had any sculpted designs or text. It was associated with Altar 1.|$|E
5|$|The Synod of Whitby, which {{debated whether}} the Northumbrian church should follow the Roman or the Celtic method of dating Easter, {{was held in}} 664. Deusdedit does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been present, perhaps because of an {{outbreak}} of the plague prevalent in England at the time.|$|E

In general, there does <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been any great phonological difference between OKY and the modern dialects of Kalau Lagau Ya (apart from the retention of ř).|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} did <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{any significant}} impact on German plans and was not reported high up the chain of command. It was executed some time before D-Day, {{and in the midst}} of several other Allied deceptions. German intelligence might have suspected a trick, or not attributed much importance to the visit.|$|E
5|$|W. W. Norton does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{released}} {{sales figures}} for the book. As of January 2009, Amazon.com lists the book at #997,726 in sales out of all books offered by the bookseller, and at No. 85 in books related {{to the state of}} Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} season {{started in}} the summer of 1918, results for this period are very scarce, but Runcorn do <b>not</b> <b>appeared</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> joined the league system. In late 1918, the First World War ended, and the Rugby League decided to hold a limited “Victory” competition starting early in 1919 and lasting only into the Spring, in which Runcorn did not take part. It is thought that the club folded {{after the end of the}} 1917-18 season.|$|R

5|$|Bupropion {{is known}} to affect several {{different}} biological targets. It often {{is described as a}} norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is also a nicotinic antagonist. However, bupropion does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances. Chemically, bupropion belongs to the class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and amfepramone, and to phenethylamines in general.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{effectively}} barred Victoria {{from anyone}} other than the Duchess or his relatives and the princess was prevented from becoming close to her extended family. The enforced isolation meant the only companions of her own age whom she frequently {{came into contact with}} were Conroy's daughters, who included Victoire, a girl a few months older than Victoria. Victoria does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been fond of either Conroy sister as there is little positive comment in her personal journals.|$|E

50|$|In the introduction, Davies {{describes}} {{the difficulties of}} even defining what is being described by the words people use {{for the history of}} the area, and even their definition today. This includes the term 'British'; the idea that 'Britain is an island'; the position of Ireland in the picture; the problem of the United Kingdom <b>not</b> <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a history where everything is treated as 'Great Britain'. In {{the title of the book}} he wanted to avoid the term British Isles but also the various clumsy alternatives that had arisen in recent years (see also British Isles naming dispute).|$|R
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a significant impact on long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{had anything to do}} with the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, {{although}} the 1901 census shows {{that she was still}} living with her parents. The marriage does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, {{there is no evidence of}} a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.|$|E

Flying Officer Ritchie and Sergeant Roediger were lost but Bär did not receive credit. Bär claimed two B-25 Mitchell bombers and three P-40s on 14 January which do <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been credited. Two claims for P-40s destroyed on the 18 January were also not granted.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1345, he {{was granted}} a canonry in the diocese of Dunkeld with {{expectation}} of a prebend, but does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> obtained this in practice, although he did obtain a different Dunkeld canonry with prebend on 12 May 1352. This he retained until his consecration as Bishop of Dunblane in 1361. Walter also obtained a fourth prebend in this period. He had been pursuing a benefice in the diocese of St Andrews, {{and while he was}} granted this on 28 March 1351, the grant was still not effective by 16 April 1353, when he {{was granted a}} prebend in the diocese of Moray instead. This was not effective either, but Walter did eventually obtain a St Andrews diocese benefice, namely the church of Inverarity in Angus, which had become vacant on the death of its incumbent, William de Coventre, probably Walter's older brother. On 7 December 1345, Walter was appointed (provided) as Archdeacon of Dunblane, his most substantial benefice to date, but the appointment does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been carried through.|$|E
5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it does <b>not</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been extant in 1902.|$|E
