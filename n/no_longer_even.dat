5|$|Hygeberht had {{resigned}} his see before Lichfield was demoted {{back to a}} bishopric. He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests {{that he no longer}} controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot. Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Offa {{succeeded in}} having Lichfield {{elevated}} to an archbishopric, but {{the rise in}} Lichfield's status was unpopular with Canterbury, the other southern English archbishopric. Offa was probably motivated {{by a desire to}} increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom's archbishopric, and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa's successor, which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed. After Offa's death his distant relative Coenwulf became king, and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric. The pope agreed to do so in 803, by which time Hygeberht was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> considered a bishop: he is listed as an abbot at the council that oversaw the demotion of Lichfield in 803. The date of his death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{nighttime}} version initially drew {{in up to}} 30 {{million viewers}} a day three times a week, an unheard-of number in modern network television. In the 1999–2000 season, it averaged No. 1 in the ratings against all other television shows, with 28,848,000 viewers. In the next season (2000–01), three nights out of the five weekly episodes placed in the top 10. However, the show's ratings began to fall during the 2000–01 season, so that {{at the start of}} the 2001–02 season, the ratings were only a fraction of what they had been one year before, and by season's end, the show was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> ranked among the top 20. ABC's reliance on the show's popularity led the network to fall quickly from its former spot as the nation's most watched network.|$|E

5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of {{time away from the}} capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, a virus {{known as}} the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV), with many variant strains, {{has been known to}} cause further change, far beyond that of {{traditional}} vampirism, frequently resulting in fierce abominations that are no longer human and sometimes <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> sentient: bandersnatches, banshees, dzoo-noo-quas, goblins, ghouls, nosferatus, vampires, wendigos, wild fomorians, and others. Most of these species do not consider human/metahuman types as more than victims, and are generally treated as dangerous subjects by society. They are not normally available as player characters. Dragons are also present in the awakened world, though not as player characters. Dragons are very powerful physically, magically, and in some situations, financially; some dragons found the riches they hoarded and hid during the last Awakening. Their great intelligence allowed them to gain a great deal of influence and power quickly and a few have risen to high political and economical posts, running entire corporations or even as heads of state.|$|E

500|$|The {{tropical}} storm moved west-northwest for 48hours after being named, reaching hurricane intensity on August 29, with satellite pictures showing an eye. Until September 1, all ships {{kept out of}} range of the hurricane, leaving satellite imagery as the only method for obtaining information. The August 30 ESSA-6 satellite image of the hurricane showed a circular eye embedded in a nearly circular central dense overcast (CDO) spanning 5° of latitude in diameter. Inflow was apparent in feeder bands from the south, but a large area of dry air and clear skies spanned to the north and west of the hurricane. It was estimated that the hurricane was at its peak intensity at this time. On August 31, the CDO had shrunk, but the cyclone still maintained intensity until September 1, when the hurricane had moved over cooler water and began to weaken due to cold inflow. Around this time, an unnamed ship passing north of the center going eastward reported winds of [...] and [...] to [...] high seas. The weakening of the hurricane accelerated, becoming uncoupled from the warm waters and losing its cirrus cap, exposing the center. An Air Force reconnaissance plane sent to investigate the storm on September 2 showed that the hurricane had weakened into a {{tropical storm}}. However, the cyclone was so disorganized at this time that the observer remarked that there was a possibility that Liza was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> a tropical storm. The storm continued to evaporate and was downgraded to a depression on September 4 and drifted southwestward until it dissipated on September 6.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today was {{critical}} of the episode, writing [...] "It is possible [...] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [...] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments {{that will make you}} smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> trying to be real parodies of the original stories." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that [...] "There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [...] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. Fortunately, the last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best [...] "Treehouse" [...] ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there." ...|$|E

In the early days of mixed martial arts, it was tough to find anybody who inspired more fear than Shamrock.

With the aid of Marcel Duchamp, she was able to arrange for the Renou et Colle Gallery to host the exhibition. Further problems arose when the gallery refused to show all but two of Kahlo's paintings, considering them too shocking for audiences, and Breton insisted that they be shown alongside photographs by Manuel Alvarez Bravo, pre-Columbian sculptures, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Mexican portraits, and what she considered [...] "junk": sugar skulls, toys, and other items he had bought from Mexican markets.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{source of}} allophonic {{variation}} is borrowed words, especially proper names, when non-Esperantized {{remnants of the}} source-language orthography remain, or when novel sequences are created {{in order to avoid}} duplicating existing roots. For example, it is doubtful that many people fully pronounce the g in Vaŝingtono ('Washington') as either [...] or , or pronounce the [...] in Budho ('Buddha'). Such situations are unstable, and in many cases dictionaries recognize that certain spellings (and therefore pronunciations) are inadvisable. For example, the physical unit [...] "Watt" [...] was first borrowed as ŭato, to distinguish it from vato ('cotton-wool'), and this is the only form found in dictionaries in 1930. However, initial [...] violates Esperanto phonotactics, and by 1970 there was an alternate spelling, vatto. This was also unsatisfactory, however, because of the geminate , and by 2000 the effort had been given up, with [...] now the advised spelling for both [...] "Watt" [...] and [...] "cotton-wool". Some recent dictionaries, such as the , <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>even</b> list initial [...] in their index. Likewise, several dictionaries now list a newer spelling [...] for Washington.|$|E

2500|$|Marriage in this film, {{as well as}} many of Ozu’s late films, is {{strongly}} associated with death. Prof. Onodera's daughter, for example, refers to marriage as [...] "life’s graveyard." [...] Geist writes: [...] "Ozu connects marriage and death in obvious and subtle ways in most of his late films… The comparison between weddings and funerals is not merely a clever device on Ozu’s part, but is so fundamental a concept in Japanese culture that these ceremonies as well as those surrounding births have built-in similarities… The elegiac melancholy Ozu evokes at the end of Late Spring, Late Autumn, and An Autumn Afternoon arises only partly because the parents have been left alone… The sadness arises because the marriage of the younger generation inevitably reflects on the mortality of the older generation." [...] Robin Wood stresses the marriage-death connection in commenting on the scene that takes place in the Somiya home just before the wedding ceremony. [...] "After everyone has left the room… [...] ends the sequence with a shot of the empty mirror.
