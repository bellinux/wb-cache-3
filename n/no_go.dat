In 2006, Shinkūkan {{animated}} the OVA that was directed by Makoto Sokuza. Each episode of the OVA is presented in five distinct chapters except for the special. In 2008, the manga was readapted into an anime that was animated by Xebec, produced by Starchild Records, directed by Tsuyoshi Nagasawa, and written by Takamitsu Kouno. Each episode of the anime is presented in four distinct chapters except for the thirteenth episode. In April 2009, Kodansha announced that Xebec will produce an OVA adaptation of Kyō <b>no</b> <b>Go</b> no Ni, directed again by Tsuyoshi Nagasawa and written by Takamitsu Kouno. The plot focuses around everyday life of students of class 5-2 and more specifically around Ryōta and his group of friends {{over the course of}} their fifth grade.|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} dinosaurs, Spielberg at first thought of hiring Bob Gurr, who {{designed}} a giant mechanical King Kong for Universal Studios Hollywood's King Kong Encounter. Upon {{considering that the}} life-sized dinosaurs would be too expensive and not all convincing, Spielberg instead sought the best effects supervisors in Hollywood. Brought in were Stan Winston to create the animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create go motion dinosaurs for long shots credited as Dinosaur Supervisor, Michael Lantieri to supervise the on-set effects, and Dennis Muren of Industrial Light & Magic to do the digital compositing. Paleontologist Jack Horner supervised the designs, to help fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray the dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters. This led to the entry of certain concepts about dinosaurs, such as the theory that dinosaurs evolved into birds and had very {{little in common with}} lizards. One of the first consequences was the removal of the raptors' flicking tongues in Tippett's early animatics, as Horner complained it was implausible. Winston's department created fully detailed models of the dinosaurs before molding latex skins, which were fitted over complex robotics. Tippett created stop-motion animatics of both the raptors in the kitchen and the Tyrannosaurus attacking the car. But despite go motion's attempts at motion blurs, Spielberg still found the end results unsatisfactory in terms of working in a live-action feature film. Muren declared to Spielberg that he thought the dinosaurs could be built through computer-generated imagery, and the director asked him to prove it. ILM animators Mark Dippé and Steve Williams developed a computer-generated walk cycle for the T. rex skeleton, and were approved to do more. When Spielberg and Tippett saw an animatic of the T. rex chasing a herd of Gallimimus, Spielberg said, [...] "You're out of a job," [...] to which Tippett replied, [...] "Don't you mean extinct?" [...] Spielberg later injected this exchange into the script, as a conversation between Malcolm and Grant. Although <b>no</b> <b>go</b> motion was used, Tippett and his animators were still used by the production to supervise dinosaur movement. Tippett acted as a consultant regarding dinosaur anatomy, and his stop motion animators were re-trained as computer animators. The animatics made by Tippett's team were also used along with the storyboards as a reference for what would be shot during the action sequences. ILM's artists were sent to private tours to the local animal park so they could study large animals — rhinos, elephants, alligators, and giraffes — up close, and also received mime classes for understanding movements.|$|E

2500|$|One bizarre {{incident}} {{came about}} when a formation of aircraft {{flew over the}} film set {{at a time when}} all the cameras were being reloaded. Curtiz reacted immediately by standing up and waving them off when he realized that the camera crews were not in position. The pilots, who were setting out on a daily exercise, simply ignored the gesticulating and screaming Curtiz below. The film crews were mightily amused by Curtiz's declarations of [...] "No, <b>no.</b> <b>Go</b> back!" [...] as if the flight crews could actually hear him. The incident was symptomatic of the many outbursts and exchanges on the set when the autocratic Curtiz helmed a film.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{campaign}} did <b>no</b> <b>go</b> as expected, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State {{did not support}} the notion that the Commonwealth could be an [...] "inalterable pact" [...] that could only be modified by mutual consent, recognizing the fact that Congress -as the holder of Puerto Rico's sovereignty- was capable of doing so unilaterally. This development triggered a sharp turn in Muñoz's ideology and strategy, which would lead to efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth's development was to be through its full sovereignty. This placed him in the same line of Fernós {{for the first time in}} years. The strategy of both leaders would now be focused on acquiring concrete changes, instead of pushing partial measures. On February 10, 1961, Fernós noted that the Commonwealth, as it stood, had an absence of democracy and shortly afterwards created another plan in line with the Fernós-Murray Project. Despite all if the failed efforts, he still believed that the Commonwealth should mirror the relation of Canada and the United Kingdom and this was the right time to launch a pro-sovereignty campaign. The new plan became known as the Aspinall Project and its main key difference to the Fernós-Murray Project was that in order to be implemented, the Senate was to renounce to all of the Commonwealth's sovereignty, resulting in the momentary creation of a Republic of Puerto Rico, which would then negotiate with Congress directly. This concept, known then as the [...] "culminated" [...] or [...] "perfected Estado Libre Asociado" [...] was consistent with the definition of free association approved by the United Nations on December 14, 1960, through [...] UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV). However, the inclusion of statehood as an option in the referendum contemplated in the project did not sit well with Fernós.|$|E
