50|$|The former Scoville Powerhouse {{is located}} in a rural-residential cluster in northeastern Salisbury, at the {{northwest}} corner of Twin Lakes Road and Beaver Dam Road. It is set on the south bank of Schenob Brook, near the outlet of the Twin Lakes. It is 1-1/2 stories in height, built out of stone, brick, and concrete and covered by a steeply pitched hip roof. The front facade faces east toward Taconic Road, and is dominated by two steep gables, each rising above now-glassed openings that resemble the openings for carriages in carriage houses. The gable edges are decorated with Gothic style bargeboard. The building has rustic stone corner quoins.

Through the evolution of the density matrix of the qubit under either hard-shaped pulse or Gaussian-shaped pulse to carry out quantum <b>NOT</b> <b>operation,</b> we show that the leakage effect is not a serious problem for a flux qubit.

One example of such nonlocal reflections is the unconditional <b>NOT</b> <b>operation</b> on a multiparty density, i. e., an operation yelding another density and such that the sum of the two is the identity operator.
