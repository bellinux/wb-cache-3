50|$|Ehrlich's {{laboratory}} {{developed a}} more soluble (but slightly less effective) arsenical compound, Neosalvarsan (<b>neoarsphenamine),</b> which {{was easier to}} prepare, and it became available in 1912. Less severe side-effects such as nausea and vomiting were still common. An additional problem was that both Salvarsan and Neosalvarsan had to be stored in sealed vials under a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation. These arsenical compounds were supplanted as treatments for syphilis in the 1940s by penicillin.|$|E
40|$|In this {{laboratory}} tests for toxicity of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> have continuously given inconsistent results. The method used was identical with that {{recommended by the}} National Institute of Health (Hygienic Laboratory) at Washington (1). In this method are three important sources of error; namely, the neglect of individual variation in the test animals, {{the lack of a}} standard of comparison, and the instability of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> solutions when exposed to air. The first two factors have already been discussed by Durham, Gaddum, and Marchal (2) following the work of Trevan (3) on the error of the determination of toxicity. in the present paper are reported the results of an investigation of the rate of increase in toxicity of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> solutions on standing in contact with air, and a method is suggested for preventing this increase in toxicity. The work presented here was derived from results obtained during the determination of a “characteristic ” dose-mortality curve for <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> using rats. The curve obtained will be published in part II of this paper (4). Previous observers have noted that the toxicity of neoarsphen-amine solutions does increase on exposure to the air. Roth (5) reported that shaking a 4 per cent solution for ten minutes in contact with air increased the toxicity four fold, while Scham-berg, Kolmer and Raiziss (6) have obtained similar results with different lots of <b>neoarsphenamine.</b> Schamberg and Kolmer (7) found that <b>neoarsphenamine</b> solutions could be kept standin...|$|E
40|$|Immunologic unresponsiveness {{to simple}} {{chemicals}} was first induced by Sulzberger with <b>neoarsphenamine</b> as antigen (1). Herein, intravenous administration of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> into guinea pigs before inoculation of a sensitizing {{dose of the}} same antigen produced {{a decrease in the}} amount of hypersensitivity. Because this unresponsiveness was not readily reproduced, tolerance to simple chemicals was not investigated intensively until unresponsiveness was reported in guinea pigs after "gastric feeding " of contact haptens (2 - 8). Feeding of a contact hapten such as picryl chloride (PiC 1) 1 or dinitrochlorobenzene (DCB) to adult guinea pigs resulted in resistance to development of contact hypersensitivity or of circulating antibodies when the animals were subsequently inoculated with the contact hapten. The unresponsiveness was specific and long lasting. When guinea pigs, rendered unresponsive after having been fed 50 mg of PiC 1 in 3 nag doses, were inoculated with the picryl complex, picryl-guinea pig serum (Pi. GPS), presumably a weak antigen, the animals were resistant to the formation of circulating antibodies as measured by systemic anaphylaxis (3) When, however, the unresponsive guinea pigs were inoculated wit...|$|E
40|$|The {{intramuscular}} {{administration of}} arsphenamine was used exclusively when this drug {{was first introduced}} into therapeu-tics. It was soon found, however, that this procedure leads to a severe reaction {{at the site of}} injection, involving great pain and resulting in necrotic changes of a persistent nature. To overcome this difficulty the intravenous injection of the sodium salt was initiated. This method has met with universal use, except in {{a relatively small number of}} cases in which difficulties are encountered in introducing a needle into the veins, as in infants and patients with excessive adipose tissue. It was hoped that the introduction of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> would overcome the difficulties of intramuscular injection, for unlike arsphenamine, <b>neoarsphenamine</b> is regarded as a neutral compound which might dissolve directly in the body fluids without the necessity of chemi-cal change. But it was found that even this compound causes a fair degree of irritation, though this irritation may be dimin-ished as in the case of arsphenamine, by the use of an oil sus-pension instead of an aqueous solution.

40|$|The natural form of blackhead, {{although}} very {{fatal to}} young turkeys, is favorably influenced by treatment with {{certain of the}} newer arsenical compounds. <b>Neoarsphenamine</b> injected intravenously in toxic doses has a somewhat favorable effect on {{the course of the}} spontaneous disease and evidently lowers the mortality. Its instability, its pronounced toxicity for young turkeys, as well as the difficulty of obtaining amounts suitable for the cases to be treated on any one occasion, serve to make its employment impracticable. Less favorable results were obtained with atoxyl. Arsenious acid fed daily in small doses failed to prevent blackhead and possibly increased the incidence of infection. In larger doses it failed to cure spontaneous blackhead. Tryparsamide may be injected in cases of spontaneous blackhead in doses as high as 1 gm. per kilo of body weight either intravenously or subcutaneously without serious toxic effect. Prompt clinical improvement usually follows and the mortality is undoubtedly greatly lowered. With inoculated blackhead recovery is more difficult to obtain. Birds treated by injections of either <b>neoarsphenamine</b> or atoxyl failed to recover. There were two recoveries among three tryparsamidetreated cases. An attempt to cure inoculated blackhead at an advanced stage by the injection of tryparsamide failed. The study of the lesions of treated turkeys shows that tryparsamide, and to some extent <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> have a more pronounced effect on the liver lesions than on the disease in the lung, which accounts for the discrepancy in the results of the treatment of spontaneous and inoculated blackhead. There is histological evidence of prompt absorption of necrotic liver parenchyma; moreover, the protozoa are destroyed more rapidly in the liver than in the lung. Tryparsamide has the most pronounced curative action on blackhead infection of any of the drugs thus far tested. Either intravenous or subcutaneous injection of appropriate doses of this drug at the first appearance of symptoms should serve to cure the majority of cases of blackhead...|$|E
40|$|When guinea-pigs {{showing a}} high degree of contact {{sensitivity}} to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were injected intravenously with a related hapten, dinitrobenzene sulphonic acid sodium salt (DNBSO 3), the animals became totally unresponsive for 1 to 4 days and remained thereafter in a state of diminished sensitivity, lasting for 8 weeks. No lasting total unresponsiveness was achieved by an additional intradermal injection of DNCB (or various variations thereof) performed 6 hr after the intravenous injection (`double shot' procedure), in contrast to what had been observed in the <b>Neoarsphenamine</b> and potassium dichromate system. The effect of the intravenous injection of DNBSO 3 is attributed to a temporary disappearance of the sensitized lymphoid cells from the circulation, whereas the induction of a permanent unresponsiveness certainly requires some additional mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Not a few {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out on the sensitization of animals to simple compounds known to produce hypersensitiveness in man, but the progress of this subject has been hindered to a certain extent by difficulties encountered in reproducing the experiments. Sensitization with salvarsan has been reported by Swift (1), and with <b>neoarsphenamine</b> by Frei (2), and Sulzberger (3). Swift recorded general symptoms, 1 whereas in the experiments of the latter two authors the effects consisted in the development of skin lesions in the treated animals. Similarly, cutaneous hypersensitiveness was induced with phenylhydrazine by Jadassolm (4) and with p-phenylenediamine by Mayer (5) and Dienes (6). In the case of p-phenylenediamine the mechanism of sensitization can be more easily understood than in other instances because this compound, after oxidation, is apt to enter into a firm chemical union with proteins, and, in fact, p-phenylenedlamine is used extensively as a fur dye. This interpretation is evident for the experiments of Klopstock and Selter (7) with diazonium solutions and actually their treatment produces a state of typical anaphylaxis which would seem to set this case apart from the common instances of drug and occupational allergy. Apparently the most striking and consistent results have been obtained by Bloch and Steiner-Wourlisch (8) with primulin, in animals as well as human beings, and more recently by Rackemann and Simon (9) with poison ivy in guinea pigs. The latter experiments were performed with extracts, whereas in the former a pure substance of simple composition (Cld-I~sOa or C~-I,O 20 H) was used which, however, has the drawback of not being easily accessible. On attempting to reproduce, in New York, the results he had obtained in Europe with <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> Sulzberger (10) found that the experiments were * The experiments have in part been briefly reported in Proc.

40|$|A non-splenectomized dog, on a vitamin-adequate basal diet, in {{the course}} of a plasmapheresis experiment, {{developed}} an uncontrollable anemia associated with the presence of bodies in or on the erythrocytes, indistinguishable from the descriptions of Bartonella canis.

The Bartonella infection was transferred to a splenectomized dog by an intravenous injection of whole blood. Each animal was apparently sterilized by one injection of <b>neoarsphenamine</b> equivalent to 15 mg. per kilo weight. It is possible that the spleen liberates some substance into the blood stream which has an inhibitory effect upon a latent Bartonella infection and that this protective substance was diminished by the many bleedings associated with the lowering of plasma proteins in the non-splenectomized dog and was lacking in the inoculated splenectomized dog...|$|E
40|$|SEVERAL {{articles}} and case reports have recently {{appeared in the}} literature con-cerning this disease which was first described in 1919, 5 and was given the name tropical eosinophilia by Weingartenl who in 1943 reported 81 cases. Since then all reported cases have been successfully treated with organic arsenical drugs. The disease is characterized by lassitude, fever, anorexia, weight loss, and cough. The latter occurs characteristically {{in the early morning}} hours between 1 and 5 a. m. and is accompanied by asthmatic wheezing. Later dyspnea and orthopnea develop. A marked eosinophilia is present, sometimes reaching as high as 70 to 80 per cent, together with a leukocytosis. There is a relative as well as absolute increase in eosinophiles, all of which appear to be normal mature forms. If the disease remains untreated, it becomes chronic. Weingarten's series of cases was observed in the coastal regions of India around Bombay. One of them fortuitously contracted syphilis and was given specific treatment with <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> following which his hypereosinophilia subsided to normal. As a result of this observation, Weingarten treated simila...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) {{a new technique}} was described for investigating the penetration of an arsenical compound into the cerebrospinal fluid. The compound was administered to a pa-tient and after a suitable interval {{a sample of the}} cerebrospinal fluid was withdrawn; the trypanocidal power of this in vitro was measured as an indication of the probable therapeutic efficacy and a chemical estimation was made to shew the total amount of arsenic present. By this means it was found that after the in-travenous administration of tryparsamide or orsanine, the cere-brospinal fluid possessed considerable trypanocidal activity, while after the administration of other pentavalent compounds, or of trivalent compounds, such as <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> the activity was small or absent; there was no relationship between the extent of the trypanocidal activity and the total arsenic content of the fluid. The present paper describes investigations of further arsenic compounds by the same method; a series of cases was also examined after administration of the antimonial compound neostibosan. The technique was the same as that described in the previ-ous paper. Except where otherwise stated all compounds were given intravenously.

40|$|Children's Fund, a {{campaign}} against yaws was initiated in Malaysia {{with the formation of}} a yaws elimination unit in the Ministry of Health. Between 1954 and 1975, the reported annual incidence of yaws fell from 140. 85 to 1. 25 per 100, 000 population. When rates dropped to less than two per 100, 000, the program was merged with the general health services. Currently when cases are reported, contacts are traced, school and village sur-veys are carried out, and appropriate treatment is given. The major problems facing the control program today are a loss of interest in control activities; a smaller number of health workers experienced in the diagnosis, management, and control of the disease; and a growing reluctance to treat asymptomatic contacts with penicillin for fear of anaphylactoid reactions. Despite these problems, it is not an unreasonable expectation that, with continued stimulation from the individuals responsible for infectious disease control, yaws will eventually be eliminated. Yaws has been an endemic, rural disease of impor-tance to public health in Malaysia for many de-cades. The number of reported cases of yaws has tended to vary with {{the nature and extent of}} the health services rendered and the efficiency of the reporting system, both of which have varied over time.

40|$|The {{coagulation}} time {{of blood}} is lengthened, or blood may be rendered incoagulable, by addition to it, in vitro or in vivo, {{of one of}} the arsphenamines (1, 2, 3). The effect is due to a change in the fibrinogen (1, 3). The effect in v’ivo passes off rapidly (1, 4). In the course of a general experimental inquiry into the factors concerned with the production of clinical reactions by the arsenicals many determinations of coagulation time were made on the tail blood of rats after intravenous injection of various samples of <b>neoarsphenamine.</b> The method used was that of Van Allen (5), in which coagulation is evidenced by a sudden change in the appearance of a drop of blood when kept below the surface of liquid petrolatum. It was observed that an increase in coagulation time after an injection of neoarsphen-amine resulted in a clot that was much more friable than one of normal blood. The possibility that a study of clot strength might prove of value in the analysis of clinical reactions to the arsenicals {{led to the development of}} a method for the measure-ment of the elastic limits of various gels.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of arsenical compounds into therapeutics {{has resulted in}} a marked improvement of the treatment of syphilitic diseases of the eye in contrast to the older forms of therapy. Coulter (1) believed that the intravenous use of arsenical com-pounds shortened the acute stage of the disease, left the eyes in a better condition and improved the general condition of the patient. Rea (2) judged that the time required to effect a cure has been reduced from twelve to six months by the use of arsenical compounds. In the course of treatment with arsenicals the application of medication to the diseased eye is a common practice in ocular therapy. A search through the literature reveals that little has been done in the quantitative study of the arsenic content of the aqueous humor in relation to arsenicals. Neame and Bury (3) detected no arsenic in the aqueous humor of the eyes of rabbits after injection of novarsenobenzol. Neame and Webster (4) believed that the paracentesis of the anterior chamber shortly after the intravenous injection of an arsenical might prove of value in the treatment of interstitial keratitis. Yudkin, Krause and Morton (5) reported the optimum time for para’centesis was between one and two hours after the injection of <b>neoarsphenamine.</b> The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of various common drugs employed in the ophthalmological treatment upon the transmission of arsenic into the anterior chamber of the eye.

40|$|In 1919, {{we began}} {{a study of}} the {{chemotherapy}} of neurosyphilis. Our reasons for undertaking this problem were that previous investigators had focused their attention principally on the acute phases of syphilis, and neurosyphilis had not been studied systematically from this viewpoint. Although syphilitic infec-tion of the central nervous system of the rabbit (1) and of the llama (2) has been reported, the manifestations of neurosyphilis so characteristic of man do not occur in animals; hence whenever the term neurosyphilis is used in this paper, it refers to the human, and particularly to paresis. The disappointment of clinicians in the therapeutic response in paresis and tabes dorsalis to Ehrlich’s compounds, arsphenamine and <b>neoarsphenamine,</b> had caused them to take a very pessimistic view of late syphilitic involvement of the central nervous system. The disappointing results with the arsphenamines led us to the view that syphilis of the central nervous system {{is quite different from the}} disease in other parts of the body. We started with the view that a different type of therapeutic agent might be needed in syphilis of the central nervous system. It was decided, therefore, to study new compounds regardless of their therapeutic activity in the acute stages of the disease. Through Dr. W. F. Lorenz and his staff, who have been associated with this effort since its inception, there was available a wealth of clinical material. The objects of the research were: (a) to find new therapeutic 1 The work here presented is a part of an extended effort to improve the treat-ment of neurosyphilis and represents a cooperative effort between the Depart...|$|E
40|$|Reference {{has been}} made in a {{previous}} paper (1) to the work of several authors (Swift, Frei, Sulzberger, Mu) on sensitization to arsphenamine and <b>neoarsphenamine.</b> In most of the communications skin lesions or "flare ups " at the site of old injections were described. Of 19 animals given intraperitoneal or intravenous injections of neutralized arsphenamine mixed with guinea pig serum Swift (2) observed, on reinjection of a similar mixture, "symptoms like those seen in anaphylaxis; " one animal succumbed in 10 minutes, and two others after some hours. Arsphenamine alone, without serum, did not seem to sensitize. Kone and Rothermund (3) after unsuccessful attempts obtained positive results by sensitizing with very small quantities of neosalvarsan and observed acute death with symptoms which had ' % certain similarity to anaphylactic shock " (translated). These experiments, briefly mentioned in a discussion on allergy, have not, to our knowledge, been published in detail. Lauf (4) injected neosalvarsan solutions without serum subcutaneously and upon intravenous reinjection observed severe anaphylactic symptoms in perhaps 15 per cent of the animals and in others slight symptoms, but in no instance did death occur in anaphylactic shock. The most striking results were obtained after a rest period of 6 months. Working with the guinea pig uterus (Schulz-Dale method) Kall 6 s and Kall 6 s-Definer (5) found that reactions occurred in 7 of 11 cases after previous subcutaneous treatment with horse serum-arsphenamine mixtures. For the tests, also, serum mixtures were used. Anaphylactic experiments other than those with the Schulz-Dale method are not mentioned. According to the authors, sensitization could be transferred passively. Birnbaum (1934), who gives a comprehensive review of the literature (6), concludes that there is no proof for the assumption that skin manifestations in human beings following administration of arsphenamine are true allergic effects, and casts doubt on the reports concerning passive transfer of arsphenamine hypersensitiveness. With regard to animal experiments he remarks that "it has neve...|$|E
