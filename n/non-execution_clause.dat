40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{of human rights}} clauses in EU international agreements {{has long been a}} traditional feature of human rights protection in EU external relations. In current practice, EU agreements containing human rights clauses follow a standard model. First, there is a reference in the preamble of the agreement to the ‘strong attachment’ of the contracting parties to non-trade values, such as democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law. Second, {{in the first part of}} the agreement there is a provision that defines the respect for human rights and other non-trade values as ‘essential element’ of the agreement. Third, a <b>non-execution</b> <b>clause</b> is included in the final part of most EU agreements, which stipulates how the EU is supposed react if an essential element of the agreement is violated. It is often observed that the violations of the values mentioned in the essential element clause have only triggered the application of the clause in a limited number of cases, all involving very serious violations of democratic principles and human rights. This infrequent application might thus call into question the real impact of the clause on the human rights situations of EU partner countries. However, the usefulness of the clause as a tool for the protection of human rights in EU external relations cannot be judged with exclusive reference to its enforcement record. On the one hand, the essential element clause and the <b>non-execution</b> <b>clause</b> establish a ‘self-contained regime’ allowing for the adoption of ‘appropriate measures’ to compel compliance. On the other hand, the essential element clause should also be evaluated per se, that is as an autonomous rule which can play a constructive role as a basis for political dialogue and for the adoption of positive measures. This paper examines the added value of the clause following this interpretative approach and contributes to the discussion of some problematic issues related to the clauses and to their enforcement...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{briefing}} by the European Research Office {{reviews the}} outcome of the Phase 1 negotiations in the six priority areas identified by the ACP: market-access issues; agriculture and fisheries issues; development issues; trade in services; trade-related areas; legal issues. It considers the areas discussed, the areas of convergence and the areas of divergence. It then reviews the overall outcome of Phase 1 and the Commission's proposals for the conduct of Phase 2 negotiations. On market-access issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for a non-punitive alternative for non-LDC ACP members, so that no ACP state is worse off 'whether or not ACP countries participate in EPAs'; the need for a five-year moratorium on the commencement of tariff dismantling by ACP countries; the linking of the implementation of tariff dismantlement to the attainment of certain development indicators by ACP countries; revision of the rules of origin. On agriculture and fisheries issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: on the need for effective programmes of support for processing, marketing, distribution and transport prior to the implementation of EPAs; the need for a standstill on EU SPS measures for five to ten years and the establishment of a detailed dialogue on how genuine EU health concerns can be addressed; the need to comprehensively address CAP distortions linked to the new systems of farm support that the EU is creating; addressing the impact of CAP reform on the value of existing preferences; the need for an ACP-EU framework for fisheries agreements. On development issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional resources to support necessary economic restructuring; the need to improve the deployment and effectiveness of EU aid instruments. the sequencing of regional integration and market opening towards the EU; issues in EU assistance to fiscal and economic restructuring. On trade in services it identifies the following areas of divergence: the need for additional funds to support service-sector development in ACP countries; the opening up of the free movement of persons within any agreement on trade in services; the scope of trade in services negotiations. On trade-related areas it identifies the following areas of divergence: the scope of negotiations on trade-related areas; the centrality of capacity building in ACP countries around these issues prior to the launch of any negotiations. On legal issues it identifies the following areas of divergence: {{the outcome of}} Phase 1; the need for additional resources; the need for a modification of WTO rules on free-trade areas; dispute settlement; the need for a <b>non-execution</b> <b>clause</b> in a trade agreement. Comment: The paper gives a useful review of the areas of divergence in tabular form and provides some insights into the underlying causes of divergence. A recent briefing by the European Research Office reviews the outcome [...] ...|$|E
