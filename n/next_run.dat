25|$|Sunline fans regard her <b>next</b> <b>run</b> {{as one of}} her greatest. On {{the last}} Saturday of October, Sunline took control in the rain-affected going to win the Cox Plate by seven lengths from Caulfield Cup winner Diatribe, with Referral in third place. Perhaps unsuited in the conditions, fancied runners Tie the Knot (2nd in 1999), Sky Heights (3rd in 1999), and Shogun Lodge (conqueror of Sunline in the George Main Stakes) were beaten a {{combined}} margin of more than 100 lengths. In winning, Sunline became the first Australasian horse to pass $6 million in career earnings.|$|E
25|$|Driving {{the tractor}} with the furrow-side wheels in the furrow bottom {{provides}} the most efficient line of draft between tractor and plough. It is also easier to steer the tractor and driving with the front wheel against the furrow wall will keep the front furrow at the correct width. This is less satisfactory when using a tractor with very wide front tyres, for although they make better use of the tractor power, the tyres may compact part of the last furrow slice turned on the previous run. The use of furrow widener or a longer mouldboard on the rear body will overcome the problem. The latter moves the soil further towards the ploughed land leaving more room for the tractor wheels on the <b>next</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tech {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff {{to its own}} 42-yard line. Wilson carried the ball {{for the first three}} plays, gaining eleven, four, and six yards respectively. Thomas then threw a 3-yard pass to Wilson, and on the next play, Clark committed an offside penalty, making it second-and-two on the Michigan 31-yard line. Oglesby rushed two yards for a first down, and then Wilson ran the next two plays for five and two yards respectively. Thomas then completed a two-yard pass to Joey Phillips, but Phillips was stopped short of a first down, forcing Tech to kick a 36-yard field goal. Myer converted the kick, cutting Michigan's lead to eight points. Odoms {{returned the}} kickoff for Michigan to the Michigan 23-yard line, but the Wolverines had little success on its drive. After a Toussaint run for five yards, Toussaint gained zero yards on his <b>next</b> <b>run</b> and Robinson's pass to Hemingway was incomplete. Michigan was forced to punt and Tech received the ball at its own 39-yard line. Jake Ryan sacked Thomas for a loss of three yards on Tech's first play, and Thomas completed a pass for a gain of one-yard to Boykin on the next play; however, Thomas converted a third-and-twelve into a first down with a 13-yard run. After Wilson and Oglesby both had one-yard runs, the third quarter ended.|$|E

500|$|Abelson erected eleven columns at the Bureau of Standards, all {{approximately}} [...] in diameter, but {{ranging from}} [...] high. Test runs {{were carried out}} with potassium salts, and then, in April 1941, with uranium hexafluoride. On 1 June 1941, Abelson became {{an employee of the}} NRL, and he moved to the Anacostia Naval Air Station. In September 1941, he was joined by John I. Hoover, who became his deputy. They constructed an experimental plant there with [...] columns. Steam was provided by a [...] gas-fired boiler. They were able to separate isotopes of chlorine, but the apparatus was ruined in November by the decomposition products of the carbon tetrachloride. The <b>next</b> <b>run</b> indicated 2.5% separation, and {{it was found that the}} optimal spacing of the columns was between [...] Abelson regarded a run on 22 June with a 9.6% result as the first successful test of liquid thermal diffusion with uranium hexafluoride. In July, he was able to achieve 21%.|$|E
500|$|Rotary {{drilling}} is {{the main}} method of drilling for minerals and {{it has also been}} used for ice drilling. It uses a string of drill pipe rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. [...] The cuttings are removed from the fluid {{at the top of the}} hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. [...] This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. [...] Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. [...] In contrast, wireline drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. [...] The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. [...] Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the drill string is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. [...] This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. [...] These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as leaf-springs that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. [...] The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. [...] When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the <b>next</b> <b>run.</b> [...] Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. [...] Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.|$|E

2500|$|The {{railroad}} {{became famous}} for its gravity cars, four-wheel coasters that {{took advantage of the}} steep, relentless grade, were first introduced in 1902. Gravity cars had an operator known as a gravityman who sat in the front right seat (on most cars) and operated two brake levers that pressed heavy duty brake shoes against the car's wheels. Gravitymen had strict orders to obey a 12 mile-per-hour speed limit as they glided down Mt. Tamalpais to either Muir Woods or into Mill Valley. [...] "Gravities" [...] ran at scheduled times, like all trains on the line, essential to safe operation on a single track railroad. Gravity cars were towed back to the summit by the steam engines, where they were stored in the yard for the <b>next</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Neither {{team made}} it into their opponent's {{territory}} nor made a first down {{until late in the}} first quarter, when Davis fumbled the snap on a punt and Ole Miss recovered at the LSU 40-yard line. The Rebels, led by fullback Charlie Flowers, drove to the 12 as the quarter ended. To begin the second quarter Ole Miss made it down to the 2-yard line. Quarterback Bobby Franklin then kept it on a quarterback sneak and was stopped by Fugler at the one-foot line. LSU was offside on the play, but Rebels captain Kent Lovelace declined the penalty, choosing to have the ball at the one-foot line with three downs rather than the one-yard line with four. [...] "I didn't think any team in the country could keep us from scoring from the one-foot line in three downs," [...] Lovelace later explained. On the <b>next</b> <b>run,</b> Fugler again stopped the Rebels short of the goal-line, and Rabb made the next tackle on third down. On fourth down, Cannon and Fugler broke through the line to stop Lovelace three yards short of the end zone, where the Tigers took over on downs. The teams exchanged punts three times before a twenty-yard run by Purvis put LSU at the Ole Miss 25, where Davis attempted a field goal that fell short. The Tigers then recovered a fumble on the Rebels' 21-yard line, and from there drove into the end zone with a scramble by Rabb. The half ended with LSU leading 7–0.|$|E

60|$|The {{last time}} {{of these two}} had well near been fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me against {{a piece of a}} rock, and that with such force, as it left me senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my body; and had it {{returned}} again immediately, I must have been strangled in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the wave went back. Now as the waves were not so high as at first, being near land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another run, which brought me so near the shore, that the next wave, though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the <b>next</b> <b>run</b> I took I got to the main land, where, to my great comfort, I clambered up the clifts of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from danger, and quite {{out of the reach of}} the water.|$|E
