40|$|Neutrophils {{have a major}} {{function}} in innate immunity that involves phagocytosis and the killing of bacteria. Neutrophils also release pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in response to pathogens that attract and stimulate other immune cells. This provides neutrophils {{with the potential to}} orchestrate adaptive immune responses. Here, we propose that neutrophils regulate adaptive immunity through interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). <b>Neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> function as danger sensors that communicate the presence of infection to DCs and instruct them to tailor ensuing immune responses to the type of pathogen.

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} {{produced}} by phagocytosing neutrophils {{are essential for}} innate host defense against invading microbes. Previous observations revealed that antibody-catalyzed ozone formation by human neutrophils contributed to the killing of bacteria. In this study, we discovered that 4 amino acids themselves were able to catalyze the production of an oxidant with the chemical signature of ozone from singlet oxygen in the water-oxidation pathway, at comparable level to antibodies. The resultant oxidant with the chemical signature of ozone exhibited significant bactericidal activity in our distinct cell-free system and in human neutrophils. The results also suggest that an oxidant with the chemical signature of ozone produced by <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> potentiate a host defense system, when the host is challenged by high doses of infectious agents.

40|$|AbstractSecondary lymphoid organs {{provide a}} {{specialized}} microenvironment tailored to foster communication between {{cells of the}} innate and adaptive immune systems.

However, the discovery of neutrophils in lymph nodes has {{raised the question of}} whether <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> play a more extensive role not only in innate immunity per se, but also in coordinating the interactions between innate and adaptive immune responses. In this review we discuss the mechanisms and consequences of neutrophil recruitment to lymph nodes and how this recruitment influences subsequent immune responses both in situ and at distant sites...|$|R

40|$|AUTHORS’ REPLY We {{would like}} to thank Dr Tsang for his {{interesting}} comment. We appreciate his finding of a similar effect of inhaled corticosteroids both on cells and inflammatory mediators in a group of patients with bronchiectasis without any parallel changes in SaO 2 or lung function indices. We agree with Dr Tsang on the necessity of long term trials with a sufficient number of subjects to show any beneficial effect of inhaled corticosteroids on inflammatory airway diseases other than asthma. In fact, as mentioned in our paper, Stanescu et al 1 showed that airway obstruction as well as accelerated decline in lung function are associated with increased numbers of neutrophils in the sputum. This suggests that a reduction in airway inflammation (<b>neutrophils)</b> <b>might</b> influence the decline in lung function only {{over a long period of}} time. Further research on the effect of corticosteroids on airway inflammation could also clarify the similarities and differences in distinct airway diseases with fixed obstruction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{infiltration}} of neutrophils into injured tissue {{is known to}} protect wounds from invading pathogens. However, more recent studies suggest that <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> inhibit the wound repair process. To investigate the role of neutrophils in wounds, mice were neutrophil-depleted by injection with rabbit anti-mouse neutrophil serum. Remarkably, epidermal healing, measured by wound closure, proceeded significantly faster in neutropenic than control mice (77. 7 � 14. 2 % vs. 41. 2 � 0. 9 %, P< 0. 02 at day 2). Dermal healing was not affected by neutrophil depletion, as neither collagen deposition nor wound-breaking strength was significantly different between neutropenic and control mice. As the delayed repair of diabetic individuals exhibits robust inflammation, the effect of neutrophil depletion on diabetic wound healing was investigated. Similar to the observations in wild-type mice, wound closure was accelerated by nearly 50 % in neutropenic, diabetic mice. The results suggest that although neutrophils may provide protection against infection, they may retar...|$|R
40|$|It was {{previously}} reported by D’Eufemia et al. that neutrophil preparations {{from a patient}} with tyrosinemia type III, i. e. with inherited deficiency of 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD), exhibited a far higher NO release than controls, when NO was estimated in terms of nitrite content in the suspending media. It was hypothesized that HPPD might participate to NO sequestration in neutrophils and that excessive NO <b>release</b> <b>might</b> reflect the lack of the scavenging action in defective cells. In recent control experiments, we found that HPPD activity in neutrophils preparations from healthy subjects is below the detection limit of the enzymatic assay (less than 3 nmol product/h per mg protein). This indicates that HPPD concentration in neutrophils is very low, if any, confirming what was already suggested in literature, and rules {{out the possibility of}} a prominent role of HPPD as NO scavenger in these cells. Moreover, we found that 500 microM L-tyrosine increases nitrite release and accumulation in suspending media of U- 937 cells, a human monoblast-like lymphoma cell line which displays many characteristics of macrophages, including the expression of inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthases. We hypothesize that the increase of nitrite <b>release</b> by patient’s <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> be related to the presence of high L-tyrosine concentrations in the blood samples (426 micromol/L instead of 52. 1 +/- 10. 9 micromol/L as healthy subjects), rather than to HPPD deficiency of in these cells...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Secretory {{leukocyte}} {{proteinase inhibitor}} and elafin are two low-molecular-mass elastase inhibitors that are mainly synthesized locally at mucosal sites. It {{is thought that}} their physicochemical properties allow them to efficiently inhibit target enzymes, such as neutrophil elastase, released into the interstitium. Historically, in the lung, these inhibitors were first purified from secretions of patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} and cystic fibrosis. This suggested that they might be important in controlling excessive neutrophil elastase release in these pathologies. They are upregulated by 'alarm signals' such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and cytokines such as interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor and {{have been shown to be}} active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, so that they have joined the growing list of antimicrobial 'defensin-like' peptides produced by the lung. Their site of synthesis and presumed functions make them very attractive candidates as potential therapeutic agents under conditions in which the excessive release of elastase by <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> be detrimental.

40|$|Immunoallergological {{studies were}} carried out to clarify the {{differences}} between 24 patients with drug-induced asthma (DIA) and 240 with non-drug-induced asthma (non-DIA). The mean values of age, skin reaction to Candida albicans (C. albicans), serum IgE levels, specific IgE antibodies to house dust (HD) and C. albicans, bronchial sensitivity and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) synthesis from peripheral venous blood in patients with DIA were not significantly different from those in patients with non-DIA. In contrast, the frequency of positive skin reaction to HD and histamine release from peripheral basophils by anti-IgE were significantly lower in DIA than in non-DIA. These results agree with the reports that DIA was often observed in non-atopic asthma. But, the mean value of serum IgE was very high in DIA as well as in non-DIA. This result suggests that IgE mediated reaction in DIA is important. Furthermore, the proportion of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was significantly lower in DIA than in non-DIA. Our findings suggest that a decrease of intrapulmonary <b>neutrophils</b> <b>might</b> {{play an important role in}} the pathophysiology of DIA. </p...|$|R
40|$|To clarify whether {{thromboxane}} A(2) (TXA(2)) {{is involved}} in type III and IV allergy, so-called "cell-mediated allergy", {{the effects of a}} specific TXA(2) synthetase inhibitor, sodium ozagrel (OKY- 046) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils in adult intractable asthmatics were studied. Lymphocyte blastogenesis and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by PHA and Candida antigen in intractable asthmatics was significantly suppressed dose-dependently by OKY- 046. The neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) and eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) from peripheral blood nomonuclear cells stimulated by Candida antigen in intractable asthmatics tended to be suppressed by OKY- 046. Furthermore, leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) and superoxide (O(2) (-)) production from peripheral blood neutrophils in intractable asthmatics was significantly suppressed dose-dependently by OKY- 046.
