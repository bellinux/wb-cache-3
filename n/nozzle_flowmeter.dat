40|$|Rotary piston {{flowmeters}} (RPF) {{are widely}} used for accurate measurement of gas flow rates. We used it to calibrate a Koennecke-type quadrant <b>nozzle</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The evaluated discharge coefficient exhibited strange local maxima, even exceeding unity. The phenomenon was sensitive {{to the length of}} the tubes connecting the RPF with the calibrated quadrant nozzle. One possible explanation, discussed in the present paper, is the local maxima to be due to acoustic resonance in the system, excited by periodic character of the flow through the RPF. Another possibility is that the also the inertia of the pistons plays a role, the air providing the spring action...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an investigation into the use of critical flow venturi <b>nozzle</b> <b>flowmeters</b> with wet saturated steam. The real-gas flow coefficient has been calculated using the equations of state for steam, which show the steam behaviour to be far from ideal along the saturation line. The nozzle was calibrated using superheated steam and the mass flow rate measured using a condensate weightank was seen to agree with the flow rate measured by the nozzle to within Â± 2, although up to half of this uncertainty {{may be due to the}} uncertainty in the calibration rig and in the measured parameters used in the nozzle equation. The nozzle was then calibrated in saturated steam with dryness fractions down to 84. The nozzle can still be used by including a wet steam correction factor in the flow rate calculation, or a more practical approach might be to precede the nozzle by an efficient steam/water separator, assume the steam then to be dry saturated and accept an uncertainty in the mass flow of 3.
