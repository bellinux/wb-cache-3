5|$|After {{the poll}} closes, the {{presiding}} officer of each polling station seals the ballot boxes without opening them. Candidates or their polling agents may affix their own seals to the ballot boxes. The ballot boxes are then taken to counting centres {{to be opened}} and the ballots counted. A candidate or his or her counting agent may ask the returning officer for a recount of votes if {{the difference between the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> for the candidate with the most votes and any other candidate's <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> is 2% or less, excluding rejected and tendered votes. After all counts, and recounts if any, have been completed, the returning officer ascertains whether the total number of electors registered to vote overseas is less than the difference between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> for the two candidates with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes.</b> If so, the returning officer declares the candidate with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> to be elected as President. If not, the overseas votes may be decisive. The returning officer then states the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> cast for each candidate and the date and location where the overseas votes will be counted.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reader}} {{participation}} game running in Dengeki G's Magazine, voting polls were first posted in the January 2004 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, which were {{to determine who}} would be the subjects in the couplings between the characters of each respective school. The results were printed in the March 2004 issue, after about 1,979 votes had been cast. The three couples with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> were Nagisa/Tamao at 481 votes, Hikari/Amane at 343 votes, and Kizuna/Chikaru at 260 votes. The results from the second round of voting were published in the May 2004 issue of the magazine which included the figures for the sixty-four different combinations between the twelve girls. The three couples with the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> this time were Nagisa/Tamao again at 150 votes, Nagisa/Amane at 114 votes, and Hikari/Amane for a second time at 102 votes. In the third round of voting in the July 2004 issue, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> increased dramatically; the number one voted couple {{for the third time in}} a row was Nagisa/Tamao at 1,215 votes.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> cast; if the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E
5|$|Final {{results of}} the popular vote tally showed that Golkar, the former ruling party of the New Order era, {{received}} the largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes.</b> It had lost to the Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle in the 1999 legislative election. The Democratic Party and the Prosperous Justice Party, two of the newest parties to participate in the elections, received a combined 14.8 percent {{of the popular vote}}.|$|E
40|$|In {{the general}} case, {{complexity}} of the algorithm to calculate the power indices grows exponentially with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> agents. Yet the volume of calculations may be reduced dramatically if many coalitions have equal <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes.</b> The well-known algorithm for calculation of the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik indices was generalized, which enables fast calculation of the power indices where entry <b>of</b> the <b>voting</b> agent into a coalition depends on its preferences over {{the set of the}} rest of agents...|$|R

5|$|The Liberal {{government}} introduced five-member block voting constituencies in Edmonton and Calgary in 1921, {{and briefly}} made Medicine Hat a double-member district.

5|$|An equally {{important}} reform was {{the abolition of}} private tax farming, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era.

5|$|As was {{usual in}} California at the time, both Nixon and Voorhis cross-filed {{in the other}} party's primary, a {{practice}} Voorhis had long adopted.

Each candidate won his own party's primary, with Voorhis garnering a considerable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> in the Republican primary, and outpolling Nixon by 7,000votes overall. Nixon gained momentum, however, when the newspapers pointed out that Voorhis's total percentage of the vote had decreased from 60% in 1944 to 53.5%.|$|E

They appeared in sanitized form in the Bell Syndicate and were published in his only book, Walls and Bars, with several added chapters. It was published posthumously.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1808. In a four-man race, he {{received more than}} three times the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> as his nearest opponent.

Although the exact date is unknown, it is likely that the death of Slaughter's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor. On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) Rodes, a widow from Scott County.|$|E
