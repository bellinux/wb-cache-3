25|$|Many {{local people}} were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the outcome. Those {{entitled}} to common rights, {{mainly from the}} Isle of Axholme, claimed they had been allotted the worst land. There were complaints of flooding from those further down the Don in the villages of Fishlake, Sykehouse and Snaith. Recrimination against foreign settlers was encouraged by those who had lost their fishing and other livelihood.|$|E
25|$|After the cease-fire, the 3d BW {{returned}} to peacetime duty remaining at Kunsan AB, South Korea until October 1954, when it {{moved back to}} Johnson AB, Japan. Beginning in January 1956, the 3d Bombardment Group converted from the aging World War II era B-26 to the jet-powered Martin B-57B Canberra Night Intruder. However, the USAF was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the B-57B as it was initially produced. It was deemed to be inadequate to meet the night intruder and close support role for which it had originally been designed. The service life of the B-57B with USAF tactical bomb groups was planned to be brief. After three years of service with the B-57s in tactical bomb groups, {{the decision was made}} to phase out the B-57.|$|E

25|$|Kricfalusi left Bakshi's {{studio to}} work on The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil for ABC, where he teamed up {{with many of the}} people who would later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects. ABC had been {{negotiating}} for the production of the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampett's cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed in order to meet the September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the show's crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with the cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi. ABC cancelled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for children's programming.|$|E
25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing rookie mistakes in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was tripped in the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made no mistake in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made no mistake in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> for the visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the marching orders by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|E

The group were <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> about being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E

This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head {{did a good job of}} protecting me. For sure I am <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> about this, but I believe that the team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem." [...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly critic Michael Slezak wrote that [...] "while [...] "Happy" [...] is a solidly written, professionally produced song with a Velcro-ey hook, it has the emotional resonance of a so-so, big-budget romantic comedy. [...] In the hands of a singer who could achieve both technical perfection and emotional depth, 'Happy' might've been my early autumn jam. But delivered in Lewis's lovely-but-vacant style, I'm gonna have to rifle through my iPod for a more substantial diva anthem".|$|E
