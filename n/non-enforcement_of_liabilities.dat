40|$|The {{economic}} freedom index (EFI) {{is one of}} several cross-country yardsticks that incorporate dimensions of progress and well-being that go beyond what conventional economic indicators tell us. It is a composite of 21 indicators that include “personal choice, protection of private property, and freedom of exchange. ” It {{is one of the few}} measures where the Philippines ranks higher than most of its neighbors; the Philippines was in fact 29 th among 123 countries rated for 1999, while neighboring Taiwan was only 38 th, South Korea 43 rd, Thailand 53 rd, Malaysia 57 th, and Indonesia 72 nd. This paper begins with a review of the methodological considerations in index construction such as the use of value weights and linear versus nonlinear aggregation techniques. Outcomes for the Philippines in each of the EFI’s seven areas of concern (together with their respective components) are then closely examined in terms of the validity and timeliness of the data used and the relevance of the indicators themselves in measuring “{{economic freedom}}. ” It is found that the ranking of the Philippines would even improve if the raw data on some concerns were updated. The review ends with a brief discussion of the “more comprehensive” economic freedom index and notes that the most significant and perhaps most controversial among the new index components is that on labor market flexibility, where <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> minimum wage legislation is considered a plus, while <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> all other laws is considered a minus.

40|$|Florida law is {{currently}} unclear {{on the issue}} of whether a professional may rely upon a limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clause in a professional services contract. Limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses are common in business contracts, especially in construction, a field that includes many professionals such as engineers and architects. While Florida has historically enforced limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses in professional services contracts, recent cases have cast doubt on whether the clauses are enforceable. If the Florida Supreme Court establishes that professionals cannot rely upon these clauses, it will be taking a position contrary to the majority of states, including New York, California, and Texas, all of which enforce limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses with varying degrees of restriction. This Note argues that Florida should not prohibit professionals from using limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses. These clauses do not violate public policy when, as already required by Florida law, the clauses are stated clearly, ensuring that both parties to the contract are aware of their existence. Permitting professionals to continue to rely upon limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses honors the contracting parties’ freedom of contract. Additionally, limitation <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> clauses provide an efficient method for parties to allocate risk...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} judicial review and presidential <b>non-enforcement</b> <b>of</b> statutory law. Defenders <b>of</b> <b>non-enforcement</b> regularly argue that the justification for judicial review that prevailed {{at the time of}} the founding also justifies the president in declining to enforce unconstitutional laws. The argument is unsound. This Article shows that there is essentially no historical evidence, from ratification through the first decade under the Constitution, in support <b>of</b> a <b>non-enforcement</b> power. It also shows that the framers repeatedly made statements inconsistent with the supposition that the president could refuse to enforce laws he deemed unconstitutional. In contrast, during this same period the historical record contains hundreds of discussions of judicial review. The Article then advances an explanation of why there was considerable support for judicial review but none for non-enforcement. Judicial review followed from what that generation called “expounding” the law, which meant explaining it. A court was supposed to explain the law in the course of deciding a case. Explaining the law involved examining all potentially relevant legal rules and showing how they fit together to deductively justify the judgment reached. In that context, if a statute could not be reconciled with the constitution, it would not be given effect. Since the president neither decided cases nor expounded the law, he did not enjoy a power <b>of</b> <b>non-enforcement</b> parallel to the power of judicial review...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} how {{the absence of}} insurance in the past led to some special maritime liability law principles such as 'general average' (i. e., losses or expenses shared by all the parties to a maritime adventure) and the limitation <b>of</b> shipowners' <b>liability.</b> In the absence of insurance, these principles served the function of insurance mostly for shipowners. As commercial marine insurance is now widely available, these principles have lost their justification and may in fact interfere with the most important goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law i. e., deterrence from negligence. The thesis thus recommends their abolition. The thesis further argues that when insurance is easily available and affordable to the both parties to a liability claim, the main goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law should be deterrence as opposed to compensation. This is exactly {{the case with the}} maritime cargo liability claims where both cargo owners and shipowners are invariably insured. As a result, the sole focus <b>of</b> cargo <b>liability</b> law should be and, to a great extent, is deterrence. On the other hand, in the vessel-source oil pollution liability setting, pollution victims are not usually insured. Therefore, oil pollution liability law has to cater both for compensation and deterrence, the two traditional goals <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law. The final question the thesis addresses is whether the deterrent effect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law is affected by the availability <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance. Contrary the popular belief the thesis attempts to prove that the presence <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance is not necessarily a hindrance but can be a complementary force towards the realization of deterrent goal <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> law...|$|R
