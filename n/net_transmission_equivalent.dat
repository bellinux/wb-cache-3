40|$|The {{transmission}} of waves through two discontinuities in a one-dimensional waveguide system is considered. Attention {{is focused on}} transmission through a structural insert, which is defined here to be a waveguide segment which is inserted into an otherwise continuous structural member with different properties. A general expression for the <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> through the insert is found. It has bandpass/stop characteristics and its frequency average is somewhat greater than that normally assumed due to the coherent interaction of the waves in the insert. The particular case is thenconsidered where the insert comprises a three-layer composite beam inserted in a thin beam which vibrates in bending. The composite beam comprises two elastic faceplates and a core filled with a tunable electro- or magneto-rheological fluid. The <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> and the stop bands depend on {{the properties of the}} insert. Since these properties are tunable by adjusting the field to which the tunable fluid is exposed, then so too are the transmission characteristics of the insert...|$|R

The interference, however, is seen only when the surfaces are at distances comparable to or smaller than the light's coherence length, which for ordinary white light is few micrometers; it can be much larger for light from a laser.|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis can {{be studied}} at the {{population}} level by genotyping strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from patients. We use an approximate Bayesian computational method in combination with a stochastic model of tuberculosis transmission and mutation of a molecular marker to estimate the <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> rate, the doubling time, and the reproductive value of the pathogen. This method is applied to a published data set from San Francisco of tuberculosis genotypes based on the marker IS 6110. The mutation rate of this marker has previously been studied, and we use those estimates to form a prior distribution of mutation rates in the inference procedure. The posterior point estimates of the key parameters of interest for these data are as follows: <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> rate, 0. 69 /year [95 % credibility interval (C. I.) 0. 38, 1. 08]; doubling time, 1. 08 years (95 % C. I. 0. 64, 1. 82); and reproductive value 3. 4 (95 % C. I. 1. 4, 79. 7). These figures suggest a rapidly spreading epidemic, consistent with observations of the resurgence of tuberculosis in the United States in the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R

40|$|Pedal {{progression}} of the slug Limax maximus was studied to obtain relations between wave velocity on the sole of the foot, wave frequency, the advance due to a single wave, and the velocity of vertically upward creeping. Each {{of the first three}} quantities is directly proportional to the simultaneous velocity of progression. Under comparable conditions, that is when work is done at a constant rate, the frequency of pedal waves is influenced by the temperature according to the equation of Arrhenius, with µ = 10, 700 (Q 10 for 11 ° to 21 ° = 2. 1).

This {{is an example of a}} statistical pattern known as the 20 / 80 rule. The rule applies to a variety of disease systems, including vector-borne parasites and sexually transmitted pathogens.

40|$|It is {{currently}} accepted that Hot-Bottom-Burning (HBB) in intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars prevents {{the formation of}} C~stars. Nevertheless, we present in this paper the results of some detailed evolutionary calculations which show that even with HBB we obtain C~stars at the highest luminosities reached on the AGB. This is due to mass-loss reducing the envelope mass so that HBB ceases but dredge-up continues. The high mass-loss rate produces an optically thick wind before the star reaches C/O> 1. This {{is consistent with the}} recent results of van Loon et al. (1997 a,b) who find obscured C~stars in the Magellanic Clouds at luminosities up to M_{bol} = - 6. 8.

40|$|Break-out {{noise from}} the shell often puts a limit on the (<b>net)</b> <b>transmission</b> loss that can be {{obtained}} from an engine exhaust muffler. One of the best ways of reducing break-out noise is use of a sandwich plate shell. This short paper presents an analytical model for prediction of transverse transmission loss of sandwich plate shells. Four-pole parameters of the porous layer are used along with an impedance approach for relating radial velocity of the outer (exposed) metallic layer to acoustic pressure of a plane progressive wave inside the muffler shell. This is combined with radiation impedance for outgoing cylindrical waves to predict transverse transmission loss. Thus, a sandwich plate shell is compared with a single layer shell without and with wrapping of another metallic layer by means of a transverse insertion loss. Finally, results of a parametric study are reported to help the muffler designers...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown a {{considerable}} interest {{in the development of}} Medium Access and Control (MAC) protocols for multi-rate wireless networks. The approach of sending the packet to the farthest possible node along the route does not maximize the performance unlike in the case of single-rate wireless networks. The scheme of sending the packet always to the neighbor with best channel quality also does not give the best network throughput. This thesis proposes to exploit the diversity in channel qualities by presenting an Opportunistic Relaying Protocol (ORP) for stationary topologies. Given a route in the form of possible choices for next hops and given the knowledge of the corresponding link channel qualities, we propose to choose the path that minimizes the <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> delay of the packet.

40|$|There {{is a lot}} of {{pressure}} on all the developed and second world countries to produce low emission power and distributed generation (DG) is found to be one of the most viable ways to achieve this. DG generally makes use of renewable energy sources like wind, micro turbines, photovoltaic, etc., which produce power with minimum green house gas emissions. While installing a DG it is important to define its size and optimal location enabling minimum network expansion and line losses. In this paper, a methodology to locate the optimal site for a DG installation, with the objective to minimize the <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> losses, is presented. The methodology is based on the concept of relative electrical distance (RED) between the DG and the load points. This approach will help to identify the new DG location(s), without the necessity to conduct repeated power flows.

50|$|In {{the second}} version, the {{analogue}} of the bucket is a queue {{in the flow}} of traffic. This queue is used to directly control that flow: Packets are entered into the queue as they arrive, equivalent to the water being added to the bucket. These packets are then removed from the queue (first come, first served), usually at a fixed rate, e.g. for onward <b>transmission,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to water leaking from the bucket. As a result, {{the rate at which the}} queue is serviced directly controls the onward transmission rate of the traffic. Thus it imposes conformance rather than checking it, and where the queue is serviced at a fixed rate (and where the packets are all the same length), the resulting traffic stream is necessarily devoid of burstiness or jitter. So in this version, the traffic itself is the analogue of the water passing through the bucket. It is not clear how this version of applying the analogy might be used to the check the rates of discrete events. This version is referred to here as the leaky bucket as a queue.|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{epidemiological}} {{impact of}} public health interventions targeted at reducing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) during early or late-stage infection depends on the contribution of these disease stages to transmission within a particular epidemic. Methods. Transmission hazards and durations of periods of high infectivity during primary, asymptomatic, and late-stage infection were estimated for HIV- 1 –serodiscordant heterosexual couples in Rakai, Uganda, by use of a robust probabilistic framework. Results. Primary infection and late-stage infection were estimated to be 26 and 7 times, respectively, more infectious than asymptomatic infection. High infectiousness during primary infection was estimated to last for 3 months after seroconversion, whereas high infectiousness during late-stage infection {{was estimated to be}} concen-trated between 19 months and 10 months before death. Conclusions. Primary and late-stage HIV- 1 infection are more infectious than previously estimated, but for shorter periods. In a homogeneous population, the asymptomatic stage of infection will typically contribute more to the <b>net</b> <b>transmission</b> of HIV- 1 over the lifetime of an infected individual, because of its longer duration.
