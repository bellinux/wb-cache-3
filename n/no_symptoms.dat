5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E
5|$|Many people {{infected}} with HSV-2 display no physical symptoms—individuals with <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{are described as}} asymptomatic or as having subclinical herpes.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people with}} AML may {{experience}} {{swelling of the}} gums because of infiltration of leukemic cells into the gum tissue. Rarely, {{the first sign of}} leukemia may be the development of a solid leukemic mass or tumor outside of the bone marrow, called a chloroma. Occasionally, a person may show <b>no</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and the leukemia may be discovered incidentally during a routine blood test.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Common {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of DVT include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth, redness or discoloration, and distention of surface veins, although about half of those with the condition have <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Signs and symptoms alone are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to make a diagnosis, but when considered in conjunction with known risk factors, can help determine the likelihood of DVT. In most suspected cases, DVT is ruled out after evaluation, and symptoms are more often due to other causes, such as cellulitis, Baker's cyst, musculoskeletal injury, or lymphedema. Other differential diagnoses include hematoma, tumors, venous or arterial aneurysms, and connective tissue disorders.|$|E
5|$|Even mild or {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism {{leads to}} possible infertility and {{increased risk of}} miscarriage. Hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, even with limited or <b>no</b> <b>symptoms,</b> may {{increase the risk of}} pre-eclampsia, offspring with lower intelligence, and the risk of infant death around the time of birth. Women are affected by hypothyroidism in 0.3–0.5% of pregnancies. Subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy has also been associated with gestational diabetes and birth of the baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> for more than a year.|$|E

5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be <b>no</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E

5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the disease was lessening.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{of the most common}} form of pancreatic cancer may include yellow skin, abdominal or back pain, unexplained weight loss, light-colored stools, dark urine and loss of appetite. There are usually <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the disease's early stages, {{and symptoms}} that are specific enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often spread to other parts of the body.|$|E

30|$|Other methodological {{advantages}} of the Bayesian IRT approach include a pragmatic method to address missing observations. In the current PRO-CTCAE design, patients are not prompted to report symptom severity and/or interference if they first report <b>no</b> <b>symptom</b> frequency. Despite the skip pattern, the Bayesian approach can still estimate a patient-clinician difference, conditional on a latent model-based symptom distribution.|$|R
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or <b>no</b> <b>symptoms</b> at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
