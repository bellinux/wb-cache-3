5|$|Diagnosis {{is based}} on a person's {{symptoms}} and history of medication use. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms such as <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, and meningitis should be ruled out. No laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the clearest}} risk {{factors in the}} {{development}} of NMS is the course of drug therapy chosen to treat a condition. Use of high-potency <b>neuroleptics,</b> a rapid increase in the dosage of <b>neuroleptics,</b> and use of long-acting forms of <b>neuroleptics</b> are all known to increase the risk of developing NMS.|$|R

25|$|Overdoses, drug interactions, and {{dangerous}} reactions from psychiatric medications, especially antipsychotics, are considered psychiatric emergencies. <b>Neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome is a potentially lethal complication of {{first or second}} generation antipsychotics. If untreated, <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome can result in fever, muscle rigidity, confusion, unstable vital signs, or even death. Serotonin syndrome can result when selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or monoamine oxidase inhibitors mix with buspirone. Severe symptoms of serotonin syndrome include hyperthermia, delirium, and tachycardia {{that may lead to}} shock. Often patients with severe general medical symptoms, such as unstable vital signs, will be transferred to a general medical emergency room or medicine service for increased monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthermia is {{an example}} of a high {{temperature}} that is not a fever.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} <b>neuroleptics</b> on Ca-activated K channels from dog airway smooth muscle cells. Because these agents inhibit {{a variety of other}} Ca-mediated processes, it seemed possible that they might also inhibit Ca-activated K channels. In excised, inside-out patches, several <b>neuroleptics</b> potently and reversibly inhibited the K channel from the internal but not the external surface of the patch. Measurements of the effect on open probability and open- and closed-state durations support a simple kinetic model in which <b>neuroleptics</b> bind to and block the open channel. Inhibition by <b>neuroleptics</b> was moderately voltage dependent, with blockers less potent at hyperpolarizing voltages. The relationship between voltage and the dissociation constant for the blocker suggests that the binding site is one-third of the way across the channel's electrical field.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of classic and atypical <b>neuroleptics</b> on the activity of cytochrome P 450 2 C 11 (CYP 2 C 11), measured as a rate of testosterone 2 �- and 16 �-hydroxylation. The reaction was studied in control liver microsomes in the presence of <b>neuroleptics,</b> as well as in the microsomes of rats treated intraperitoneally (ip) with pharmacological doses of the drugs (promazine, levomepromazine, thioridazine and perazine 10 mg/kg; chlorpromazine 3 mg/kg; haloperidol 0. 3 mg/kg; risperidone 0. 1 mg/kg; sertindole 0. 05 mg/kg) for one day or two weeks (twice a day), in the absence of the <b>neuroleptics</b> in vitro.

25|$|Due to {{hypersensitivity}} to neuroleptics, preventing DLB {{patients from}} taking these medications is important. People with DLB {{are at risk}} for <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome, a life-threatening illness, because of their sensitivity to these medications, especially the older typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol. Other medications, including medications for urinary incontinence and the antihistamine medication diphenhydramine (Benadryl), also may worsen confusion.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes classed {{with the}} tetracyclic antidepressants. Has {{atypical}} antipsychotic actions too. Not available in Australia, Canada or the UK but {{available in the}} US. May be faster acting. Antidopaminergic, which means that it can cause extrapyramidal side effects, tardive dyskinesia and <b>neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome. Causes kidney failure and seizures in overdose, although it usually does not cause cardiotoxic effects in overdose.|$|E
25|$|Haloperidol {{may result}} in a {{movement}} disorder known as tardive dyskinesia which may be permanent. <b>Neuroleptic</b> malignant syndrome and QT interval prolongation may occur.

25|$|The {{antidepressant}} {{effect of}} a tricyclic, a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by Roland Kuhn in a Swiss psychiatric hospital. Antihistamine derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as <b>neuroleptics.</b> Although in 1955 reserpine was shown {{to be more effective}} than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, <b>neuroleptics</b> were being developed as sedatives and antipsychotics.|$|R
25|$|Levomepromazine (INN, BAN, USAN), {{also known}} as methotrimeprazine, is a {{phenothiazine}} <b>neuroleptic</b> drug. It is sold in many countries under the generic name (levomepromazine) or under brand names such as Nozinan, Levoprome, Detenler, Hirnamin, Levotomin, Neurocil and many more. It is a low-potency antipsychotic (approximately half as potent as chlorpromazine) with strong analgesic, hypnotic and antiemetic properties that is primarily used in palliative care.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{critical}} and distinctive clinical features of the disease is hypersensitivity to <b>neuroleptic</b> and antiemetic medications that affect dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. In the worst cases, a patient treated with these medications could become catatonic, lose cognitive function, or develop life-threatening muscle rigidity. Some commonly used medications that should be used with great caution, if at all, for people with DLB, are chlorpromazine, haloperidol, or thioridazine.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{shock therapy}} or insulin coma therapy (ICT) {{was a form}} of {{psychiatric}} treatment in which patients were repeatedly injected with large doses of insulin in order to produce daily comas over several weeks.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{efficacy}} of atypical <b>neuroleptics</b> for decreasing craving and drug relapses during protracted withdrawal in individuals dually diagnosed with schizophrenia and cocaine dependence. METHOD: We conducted a 6 -week, open-label pilot study comparing risperidone with typical <b>neuroleptics</b> {{in a sample of}} withdrawn cocaine-dependent schizophrenia patients. RESULTS: Preliminary results suggest that individuals treated with risperidone had significantly less cue-elicited craving and substance abuse relapses at study completion. Further, they showed a trend toward a greater reduction in negative and global symptoms of schizophrenia. CONCLUSION: Atypical <b>neuroleptics</b> may help reduce craving and relapses in this population.
