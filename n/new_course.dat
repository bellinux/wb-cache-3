5|$|Historically the Barnard Run was a seven-mile course {{which began}} at Towler Hill Farm, ran to Cotherstone {{suspension}} bridge, with an undetermined route {{back to the}} school. In 1898 a 4-mile junior Barnard Run was created for 11- to 14-year-olds. In 1904 {{it was decided that}} it would be easier for training purposes if the run began at the school, and a <b>new</b> <b>course</b> was developed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin in March 1953, the new {{collective}} Soviet leadership started to advocate a <b>New</b> <b>Course.</b> Moscow favored replacing East Germany's Stalinist party leader Walter Ulbricht and made inquiries about Rau as a potential candidate. In response, the leading SED party ideologist, Rudolf Herrnstadt, a candidate member of the Poliburo, with assistance from Rau drew up a concept for just such a <b>New</b> <b>Course</b> in East Germany. However, the workers' uprising, which was suppressed by the Soviet army on 17June led to a backlash. Three weeks later, during a session of the then eight person Politburo (plus six candidate members) on 8July 1953, Rau made a recommendation that Ulbricht be replaced, while Rau's Spanish Civil War comrade, Stasi chief Wilhelm Zaisser, who in Spain had been known as 'General Gómez', accused Ulbricht of having perverted the party. The majority was against Ulbricht. His only supporters were Hermann Matern and Erich Honecker. At that moment however there was no viable candidate who could replace Ulbricht immediately. Suggested were first Rudolf Herrnstadt and then Heinrich Rau, but both were hesitant, thus a decision was postponed. The very next day after the meeting Ulbricht went by plane to Moscow and the Soviet leadership, who in part also feared that deposing Ulbricht might be construed {{as a sign of}} weakness, now secured Ulbricht's position. Subsequently, five members and candidate members of the Politburo lost their positions.|$|E

Their <b>new</b> <b>course</b> takes the ship close to that of E.C.S. Horizon, the cargo vessel where Ensign Mayweather grew up. He then requests permission for a further detour to re-join his family on Horizon as his father is ill and he hasn't been able to visit him in four years. Captain Archer readily agrees, but bad news arrives when Mayweather learns that his father died some six weeks earlier.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The <b>new</b> <b>course,</b> like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the <b>new</b> <b>course</b> caused more {{pollution}} to flow into the bay near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was drained and filled to create industrial land, using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E
5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the <b>new</b> <b>course</b> of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing {{over the top of}} the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The next year, M-37 was realigned, {{which created}} a {{concurrency}} with M-43 in the Hasting area.

All of the highway was completely paved in 1956 when a new routing opened northeast of Hastings, bypassing Coats Grove. The fourth change in the Barry County routing {{was made by the}} next year. the highway was rerouted due northward out of Hastings along Broadway Street.|$|E

5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its <b>new</b> <b>course</b> toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.|$|E
5|$|As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and {{his staff}} helped Japan rebuild itself, {{eradicate}} militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a <b>new</b> <b>course</b> that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new constitution that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a parliamentary system of government, under which the Emperor acted only {{on the advice of}} his ministers. It included the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency as an instrument of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of August 30, after Elena's sharp turn to the east, {{hurricane}} warnings along most of the northern Gulf Coast were discontinued. In accordance, evacuees between Louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the Florida Panhandle returned home as shelters closed. With the storm's <b>new</b> <b>course,</b> the area of highest threat translated east to {{the remainder of the}} Panhandle and the western Florida Peninsula. As such, Governor Graham recommended evacuations south to the Tampa area late on August 30. A mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties, encompassing 573,000 affected individuals. On August 31, Governor Graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground. In response to the heightening danger, most of the National Guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas, and an additional 3,000 were placed on standby.|$|E

5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a <b>new</b> <b>course</b> was built a few hundred yards away at Kersal Vale.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the <b>new</b> <b>course</b> following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E
5|$|The next day, in {{her third}} run, Williams again set a <b>new</b> <b>course</b> record, 53.68 seconds, {{and won the}} final run as well to secure the gold medal. Williams became the first British sportsperson to win an {{individual}} Winter Olympic gold medal in thirty years. Prior to this win, Williams had never won a World Cup or World Championship event. German athletes, Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber, won the silver and bronze medals, the first Olympic medals for Germany in the sport. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman fought {{her way into the}} lead briefly after a fast final run, but was overtaken by a five other athletes and finished sixth. Canada's Hollingsworth dropped from third place after the first two runs to fifth after the final run. American Noelle Pikus-Pace, who was in sixth place after the third run, finished fourth in the overall standings.|$|E

Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of whom had been expected to be in medal contention, were disappointed.|$|E
5|$|The exit of Finland {{from the}} war on 3 September {{provided}} the political impetus for abandoning Estonia. The next day, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested {{that it would not}} be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation, codenamed Königsberg, to be drawn up. Hitler, however, declared that Ostland must not be given up at any cost, since doing so would provide support to those Finns that did not favour the <b>new</b> <b>course</b> of the government, and would influence Sweden to maintain its current foreign policy. After lunch, Guderian ordered that the Königsberg plan nevertheless be secretly initiated. On the next day, Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation. On 11 September, the evacuation of Estonia was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length. On 15 September, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner, requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of Estonia, codenamed Operation Aster. Schörner emphasised that although the front was still holding, delaying the order would mean the units in Estonia would be trapped. Hitler agreed on 16 September.|$|E
