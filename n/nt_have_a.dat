He written numerous books and articles, including five volumes in the New Testament Exegetical Summary series. Participles in the Greek <b>NT</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great variety of meanings or functions. One important meaning is to express a circumstance: the aorist tense expressing a circumstance prior to the action of the leading verb; the present tense, a circumstance concurrent to or occasionally subsequent to that of the leading verb. Unfortunately, various grammars fail to distinguish the circumstantial function from other functions. English versions of the NT likewise often render participles incorrectly. The present article seeks to clarify these distinctions and to enable the reader of the Greek NT to determine the function of the participles he encounters. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{translational}} enhancer domain (TED) {{of satellite}} tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA stimulates translation of uncapped RNAs autonomously. Here {{we set out}} to identify the 5 ' and 3 ' extremities of TED and features of these sequences with respect to translation. We found that both in wheat germ extract and in tobacco protoplasts, the 5 ' border is confined to 3 nt. Mutational analysis revealed that the autonomous function of TED is sensitive to 5 ' flanking sequences. At the 3 ' end of TED, 23 <b>nt</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cumulative, quantitative effect on translation in wheat germ extract, whereas in tobacco protoplasts, the most 3 ' 14 nt of these 23 nt do not enhance translation.

In this model, TED folds into a phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure in which the essential 5 ' nucleotides base-pair with the 3 ' nucleotides that stimulate translation both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, the 14 3 ' nucleotides in TED that stimulate translation in the wheat germ extract only do not require the predicted base-pairing in order to function. The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo sequence requirements thus correlates with potential base-pairing requirements, opening the possibility that TED contains two functional domains...|$|E

40|$|In a first {{analysis}} of the low-frequency fluctuations observed by Cluster during acrossing of the plasma sheet [Louarn et al., 2004], we identify oscillations that likelycorrespond to MHD eigenmodes. They are intense (10 <b>nT),</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rather short period(20 – 25 s), have a wavelength of 5 Re, and are observed during an active period thatfollows a substorm onset. We show here that they combine both sausage and kinkmodes propagating in the x direction with a common spectral peak at 0. 04 Hz, thesausage oscillations presenting also a secondary peak at 0. 13 Hz. Using a completetheory of the linear MHD response of the plasma sheet, we reconstruct the sheetoscillations starting from given external perturbations. This method leads to quantitativepredictions concerning the magnetic and pressure fluctuations. The existence of naturalresonant frequencies of the sheet can indeed be foreseen and the relative weight ofthe kink-like and sausage-like modes can also be estimated. We show that the kinkmode (0. 04 Hz) and the high-frequency sausage mode (0. 14 Hz) are perfectlycompatible with the MHD model of Harris sheet oscillations, with wavelength of 6 Reand 3 Re, respectively. The corresponding amplitude of the pressure and magneticfluctuations {{also appears to be}} remarkably consistent with the theoretical predictions. Conversely, the low-frequency sausage mode (0. 04 Hz) is hardly explained by the MHDmodel. We propose that it could be a nonideal MHD or a kinetic mode, as the tearingmode...|$|E

Pseudomonas putida PRS 2000, a strain that grows on benzoate and 4 -hydroxybenzoate by using the β-ketoadipate pathway, has a well-characterized β-ketoadipate-inducible chemotactic response to aromatic acids. PRS 2000 was chemotactic to 3 - and 4 -nitrobenzoate and all three isomers of aminobenzoate when grown under conditions that induce the benzoate chemotactic response. P. putida TW 3 and Pseudomonas sp. strain 4 NT grow on 4 -nitrotoluene and 4 -nitrobenzoate by using the ortho (β-ketoadipate) and meta pathways, respectively, to complete the degradation of protocatechuate derived from 4 -nitrotoluene and 4 -nitrobenzoate. However, based on results of catechol 1, 2 -dioxygenase and catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase assays, both strains were found to use the β-ketoadipate pathway for the degradation of benzoate. Both strains were chemotactic to benzoate, 3 - and 4 -nitrobenzoate, and all three aminobenzoate isomers after growth with benzoate but not succinate. Strain TW 3 was chemotactic to the same set of aromatic compounds after growth with 4 -nitrotoluene or 4 -nitrobenzoate. In contrast, strain 4 NT did not respond to any aromatic acids when grown with 4 -nitrotoluene or 4 -nitrobenzoate, apparently because these substrates are not metabolized to the inducer (β-ketoadipate) of the chemotaxis system. The results suggest that strains TW 3 and 4 <b>NT</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> β-ketoadipate-inducible chemotaxis system that responds {{to a wide range of}} aromatic acids and is quite similar to that present in PRS 2000.

40|$|This {{research}} is about West Malaysians perceptions of holidaying, {{their knowledge of}} Australian and Northern Territory 2 ̆ 7 s tourism product, their interest in visiting Australia generally and the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia particularly. The research commenced in September 1998 {{and had to be}} undertaken on a part time basis. As is endemic in an industry like tourism, the period from initiation to completion of the thesis was dynamic and complex. For example, as an outcome of significant changes in Australian airspace – Malaysian Airline flight from Kuala Lumpur to Darwin route was suspended in February 2002. There were organisational changes within Australian Tourist Organisations and therefore some of the initial marketing purposes established 4 – 5 years ago are no longer valid. Events like the terrorists attack in Bali in October 2002 and reduction of international airline flights from Darwin have impacted the circumstances to travel into or out of Darwin. This could well be a temporary slump in the local travel and tourism industry. However, the core of the thesis - an examination of socio-demographic variables like gender and marital status, ethnicity, education and age, and income as determinants of market demand, still remains. The results from the analysis of West Malaysian 2 ̆ 7 s general attitudes towards holidaying and expectations from a holiday still hold substantial convincing information. The research using a survey technique through administration of a structured questionnaire and face to face interviews, held in Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya, Kelang, and Seremban, accumulates information from six hundred and seventy five respondents. The respondents were residents of Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Perak, Johor, Terengganu, Kedah, Pulau Pinang, Negeri Sembilan, etc. An attempt has been made in the study to assess why West Malaysians were not coming to Northern Territory (NT) for a holiday, despite direct international flights for several years and short travelling time. Why is it that world renowned tourist icons of the NT (i. e. Uluru, Kakadu, Katherine Gorge) were failing to attract holidaymakers from West Malaysia? What particular West Malaysian attitude/s may aid the promotion of the NT tourism product? To what degree does the <b>NT</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tourism product suited to the West Malaysian market? Did West Malaysian average income groups represent a suitable market for the NT tourism product? To what extent factors such as – knowledge of their language, Halal food, places for religious worships, suitable visa fee and accommodation important determinants of holiday destination for West Malaysian travellers? What segment/s of the West Malaysian population possesses positive attitude towards Australia xv and the NT and what implications might this have in the promotion of the NT to the West Malaysian market? The statistical analysis of the data using SPSS conveys that there is keen interest generally amongst the respondents to travel to Australia and the NT. The interest did not vary with gender, however, unmarried young people were found to have a greater zest to visit the NT and Australia. Although all three major ethnic groups namely Chinese, Malays and Indians are eager to visit the NT, the enthusiasm is greater amongst the Chinese followed with Indians then the Malays. The findings also reveal that West Malaysians in the age group of 20 – 29 years show greater enthusiasm to visit the NT followed by the 30 – 39 years age group. The older age groups above 40 years are not so eager to visit the NT. The assumption that the NT may not be attractive for the ‘high income’ group of West Malaysians has been supported by the findings of the study. The ‘average’ and ‘above average’ income groups in West Malaysians have shown to be very interested to visit the NT followed by the ‘below average’ income group. The ‘high income’ earners did not show any interest to visit the NT comparatively. Finally, the research has covered multiple aspects of attitudes of West Malaysians towards holidaying and features of the NT 2 ̆ 7 s tourism and holiday product to find the compatibility, however, like Alice in Wonderland the question arises of which way …to go from here...|$|E

Methods The pregnancy outcome of women who underwent an NT measurement between January 2000 and November 2008 was reviewed. All orofacial clefts detected prenatally and postnatally in karyotypically normal fetuses/infants were reviewed and a distinction was made between isolated defects and clefts as part of multiple congenital anomalies (associated). Results The cohort included 8638 fetuses. The NT was enlarged in 746 (8. 6 %). The karyotype was normal in 8347 fetuses, including 513 of the fetuses with an enlarged NT. Isolated or associated cleft lip, with or without cleft palate (CL/P), or cleft palate (CP) were diagnosed in 18 chromosomal!) : normal fetuses (an incidence of 2. 2 per 1000). In eight of these cases the NT was normal (8 / 7834; an incidence of 1. 0 per 1000) and in the remaining 10 it was enlarged (101513; an incidence of 19. 5 per 1000). CL/P and CP were isolated or associated in three and seven of the chromosomally normal fetuses with an enlarged NT, respectively.
