Standard Series models include the F-30, F-30R, F-50, D-40, D-50, and the return of the F-212XL 12-string model.All Standard Series models feature red spruce bracing, satin mahogany necks, and bone saddles, <b>nuts,</b> and bridge <b>pins,</b> but have lower-grade wood [...] and different ornamentation than their Traditional Series counterparts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{is a big}} {{variety of}} {{machines}} and equipment – internal combustion engines, aviation parts, building frames- joined by threaded joints, realized as bolt, <b>nut</b> and <b>pin</b> ones. For successful and safe exploitation of such equipment, it is required to check the tightening degree of threaded joints. There are few known methods of such control and one is presented in this paper. The proposed method is based on contact stiffness and friction change from thread tightening degree. At the same time, tightening changes with sufficient significance the dynamical properties of such a system- natural and resonance frequencies, amplitude – frequency and amplitude-phase characteristics, so, {{that it is possible}} to evaluate the tightening degree of the investigated joint. Dynamic properties are defined by exciting transient process between bolt head and tightened by this bolt detail using as short as possible force impact. Sensors register analogical signal of transient process and transmit it to a special computer card. The computer card converts analogical signal to code. Code is saved in the computer file for further processing. Processing data is saved in this file, and we find desired dynamical characteristics. Using special experimental bench proved that dynamic characteristics are sensitive enough to threaded joint tightening degree and the method is applicable to practice...|$|R
50|$|The RC30 front {{suspension}} {{was made}} by Showa and had wheel and brake pads that had quick-release mountings. The rear wheel carried a brake disc to the inside and a chain sprocket {{to the outside of}} a single-sided swingarm (originally patented by ELF of France), and attached with a single castellated <b>nut</b> and cotter <b>pin.</b> It was also equipped with fully adjustable Showa suspension which, as it only had a single seat thus focusing suspension performance, gave superior ride and handling characteristics. The engine and low storage position of the fuel in the fuel tank combined to give a low centre of gravity which aided its handling prowess. Further statements of its hand-built quality were shown in a full stainless steel 4-2-1 exhaust system, alloy fuel tank and hand laid fibreglass bodywork.|$|R
40|$|The Toggle Deployment Mechanism (TDM) is a two fault tolerant, single point, low shock pyro/mechanical {{releasing}} device. Many {{forms of}} releasing are single fault tolerant and involve breaking of primary structure. Other releasing mechanisms, {{that do not}} break primary structure, are only pyrotechnically redundant and not mechanically redundant. The TDM contains 3 independent pyro actuators, and {{only one of the}} 3 is required for release. The 2 separating members in the TDM are held together by a toggle that is a cylindrical stem with a larger diameter spherical shape on the top and flares out in a conical shape at the bottom. The spherical end of the toggle sits in a socket with the top assembly and the bottom is held down by 3 pins or hooks equally spaced around the conical shaped end. Each of the TDM's 3 independent actuators shares a third of the separating load and does not require as much pyrotechnic energy as many single fault tolerant actuators. Other single separating actuators, i. e., separating <b>nuts</b> or <b>pin</b> pullers, have the pyrotechnic energy releasing the entire preload holding the separating members together. Two types of TDM's,described in this paper, release the toggle with pin pullers, and the third TDM releases the toggle with hooks. Each design has different advantages and disadvantages. This paper describes the TDM's construction and testing up to the summer of 1993...|$|R
50|$|Most recently, 817 Squadron has {{provided}} aircraft for Operation Sumatra Assist and Operation Sumatra Assist II, which were Australia's {{contribution to the}} humanitarian effort in Indonesia {{as a result of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent 2005 Nias-Simeulue earthquake. During the latter operation, one of the two Seakings (Shark 02) embarked on HMAS Kanimbla, crashed on the Island of Nias with the loss of nine personnel. The accident occurred as a result of a series of maintenance errors, specifically the incorrect re-fitting of a <b>nut</b> and split <b>pin</b> during maintenance performed on the aircraft some two months before the crash. Deficiencies in maintenance practices, training, support and logistics operations within the Navy were also identified as contributing factors. Following the accident, several major changes were made to maintenance and safety management practices at 817 Squadron.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the park's {{operating}} schedule, {{the general}} timetable for departing trains begin {{an hour and}} a half after opening, and the final run one hour before the park closes. The fireman will report to work about three hours before departure, and will begin inspections. The track is inspected each morning, and the locomotive is serviced by removing the stack gag, opening all operating valves to appliances to test their operation, as well as blowing down the sight glasses, cleaning the banked fire, cleaning the smokebox cinder bonnet, refilling lubricators, cleaning the ashpit, coaling the tender, and a scrubbing down of locomotive and tender with soap and water. Once the engine has been serviced, the engineer or fireman will perform a hammer test on all <b>pins,</b> <b>nuts,</b> and wedges on the running gear and replace brake shoes and tighten up driving box wedges as necessary. The whole process usually takes 1½ hours to make the engine operational for the day, and the rest of the time is used to clean and make adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|On 21 May 2009 a T-38 Talon {{from the}} test pilot school on a {{training}} flight crashed 12 {{miles north of}} Edwards AFB, killing the student pilot Major Mark Paul Graziano and severely injuring the student navigator Major Lee Vincent Jones. An accident investigation determined that the crash was caused when the aircraft's rudder operating mechanism disconnected the flight controls from the rudder actuators and caused the rudder to deflect 30 degrees to the left. This induced an uncontrollable yaw and a resulting roll, causing the aircraft to depart controlled flight, a condition that is unrecoverable in the T-38. The report stated that contributing factors to the crash were a structural fatigue failure or structural break in a critical component or bolt, and a maintenance error in which a <b>nut</b> or cotter <b>pin</b> did not properly secure a bolt connecting two critical components. Citing two historical cases of rudder failure, the report concluded that maintenance error was the more likely cause. The investigation concluded that [...] "insufficient supervisory oversight {{and a lack of}} discipline of the training process" [...] in the Maintenance unit existed in relation to the mishap aircraft.|$|R
