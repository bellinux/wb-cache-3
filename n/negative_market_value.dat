40|$|This article {{analyzes}} spread ladder swaps traded by Deutsche Bank {{to several}} medium-size companies and municipalities. The {{value of these}} contracts is highly sensitive to correlations between forward rates. For a contract that was challenged by the medium-size company Ille at the Federal Court of Germany, {{it turns out that}} the derivative was originated at a <b>negative</b> <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of − 90, 000 to − 115, 000 euros (depending on the number of factors used in the model). Moreover, the model correctly predicts the range for the terminal payment after an adverse development of the term structure of approximately 567, 000 euros. We also investigate a product feature that limits the upside potential from the viewpoint of the customer and show that it has a substantial impact on market values. According to the judgment handed down by the court, the bank should have informed the customer about the market value of the product in light of special circumstances. This raises questions as to which products must meet this requirement. Moreover, especially for exotic contracts, market prices are mostly model prices: for spread ladder swaps, substantially different prices are obtained even when investors agree on the variance/covariance matrix but disagree on the number of factors to apply in an implementation of a model...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. The {{economic}} rules, or {{put more}} ambitiously, the economic {{constitution of the}} Treaty, 1 only apply to economic activities. This general principle remains valid, even if some authors strive to demonstrate that certain Treaty rules also apply {{in the absence of}} an economic activity, 2 and despite the fact that non-economic (horizontal) Treaty provisions (e. g. principle of nondiscrimination, rules on citizenship) are also applicable {{in the absence of an}}y economic activity. 3 Indeed, the exercise of some economic activity transcends the concepts of ‘goods’ (having positive or <b>negative</b> <b>market</b> <b>value),</b> 4 workers (even if admitted in an extensive manner), 5 and services (offered for remuneration). 6 It is also economic activity or ‘the activity of offering goods and services into the market’ 7 that characterises an ‘undertaking’ thus making the competition rules applicable. Further, it is for regulating economic activity that Article 115 TFEU, Article 106 (3) TFEU and most other legal bases in the TFEU provide harmonisation powers in favour of the EU. Last but not least, Article 14 TFEU on the distinction between services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and non-economic services of general interest (NESGIs), as well as Protocol n. 26 on Services of General Interest (SGIs) confirm the constitutional significance of the distinction between economic and non-economic: a means of dividing competences between the EU and the member states. The distinction between economic and non-economic activities is fraught with legal and technical intricacies – the latter being generated by dynamic technological advances and regulatory experimentation. More importantly, however, the distinction is overcharged with political and ideological significations and misunderstandings and, even, terminological confusions. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the capital market impact of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions disclosures. The effect of assurance of these disclosures, {{the type of}} assurance provider and GHG management performance is also examined. The sample consists of 2, 734 firm-year observations covering the period 2006 - 2010 across 33 countries. A modified Ohlson (1995) model is applied to capture the effect on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> while the cost of equity capital analysis uses an average of measures used in prior literature (Hail and Leuz, 2006). After controlling for selection bias, this thesis finds a <b>negative</b> effect on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> for GHG emissions disclosures and that this effect is moderated if the emissions are assured, particularly when this assurance {{is provided by the}} accounting profession. Moreover, the negative effect is also moderated for firms that manage their GHG emissions, although no effect is found for firms that attain higher GHG management performance. A positive relationship is observed for the cost of equity capital, with this adverse effect reduced for firms that attain higher GHG management performance. This suggests that although investors view GHG emissions disclosures to be value reducing, firms are able to minimise such effects through obtaining assurance, and specifically from the accounting profession, as well as through GHG emissions management. This thesis contributes to the scant literature on the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> and cost of equity capital impact of GHG emissions disclosures. It also contributes to the literature addressing the capital market impact of voluntary assurance and voluntary management of environmental risks. The findings of this thesis have implications for a number of stakeholders. Given that GHG emissions disclosures are informative to investors, analysts should consider such non-financial information when making stock recommendations. Further, firms have an opportunity to reduce the <b>negative</b> impact on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> that results from disclosing GHG emissions through managing and assuring these emissions, and also by hiring higher quality assurers. In addition, regulators or policy makers across the world may find these findings useful as they deliberately embrace the recent trend of regulatory requirements to disclose GHG emissions in countries such as Australia, U. K. and U. S...|$|R

Therefore, only those materials for which the holder has no further use and which he discards or intends to discard are waste. Lox (1994) also see waste as “either an output with (a <b>negative</b> <b>market)</b> no economic <b>value</b> from an industrial system or any substance or object that has been used for its intended purpose (or served its intended function) by the consumer and will not be reused”.

40|$|Research summary: We {{explore the}} effect of the interplay between a firm's {{external}} and internal actions on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> in the context of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Specifically, drawing from the neo-institutional theory, we distinguish between external and internal CSR actions and argue that they jointly contribute to the accumulation of intangible firm resources and are therefore associated with better <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> Importantly, though, we find that, on average, firms undertake more internal than external CSR actions, and we theorize that a wider gap between external and internal actions is negatively associated with <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> We confirm our hypotheses empirically, using the market-value equation and a sample comprising 1, 492 firms in 33 countries from 2002 to 2008. Finally, we discuss implications for future research and practice. Managerial summary: Companies often accumulate intangible assets by taking internally and externally oriented CSR actions. Contrary to popular beliefs, the data show that they undertake more internal than external ones: firms do more and communicate less. How does a potential gap (i. e., a misalignment) between internal and external CSR actions affect a firm's <b>market</b> <b>value?</b> We find that although together (the sum of) internal and external actions are positively associated with <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> a wider gap has negative implications. In other words, firms do not realize the full benefits of their internal actions when such actions are not externally communicated to key stakeholders, and to the investment community in particular. This <b>negative</b> association with <b>market</b> <b>value</b> is particularly salient in CSR-intensive and the natural resources and extractives industries...|$|R

In this study, it is suggested that loss are not homogenous across firms, and specifically explores the economics of two types of loss, which are (1) transitory loss and (2) recurring loss. Transitory loss is temporary and do not reflect the ongoing economic circumstances of the firm, whereas recurring loss is consecutive loss that. are due to ongoing poor operating performance. Recurring loss could lead to either an adaptation by the firm to return to profitability or abandonment of the firm. The sample comprises of loss companies, which are listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia from 1994 to 2003. An equity valuation model developed by Ohlson (1995) is employed to test the hypotheses. Additionally, logit analysis is also carried out to further examine the probability of the occurrence of the two independent variables. Two hypotheses are tested; (1) For transitory loss, earnings will have a non-negative association with <b>market</b> <b>value</b> (2) For recurring loss, earnings will have a <b>negative</b> association with <b>market</b> <b>value.</b> The empirical evidence for this study show mixed results over the six years analysis.

The initiative is expected to {{lead to an increase}} in the price of electricity in the RGGI region and beyond. The implications of these changes for the value of electricity-generating assets and the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of the firms that own them depends on the initial allocation of carbon dioxide allowances, the composition of generating assets owned by the firm, and the locations of those assets. Changes in asset values inside the RGGI region may be positive or negative, whereas changes outside of the RGGI region are almost always positive but nonetheless vary greatly. Viewing changes at the firm level aggregates and moderates both positive and <b>negative</b> effects on <b>market</b> <b>value</b> compared with what would be observed by looking at changes at individual facilities.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{literature}} has emerged with economists and managers seeking to understand how firms shall utilize their resources to ensure competitive advantage and satisfying performance. Scholars have been attempting to identify which resources are most valuable, and have argued for the vital role played by knowledge in producing innovation and enabling well-performing firms. This stance has been born through the theories of knowledge-based view and has grown to be acknowledged by academia and industry alike. However, the theory {{has been criticized for}} inadequately understanding the role of the individuals inhabiting the firms. This research seeks to quantitatively understand how variations in individual-level knowledge may impact the <b>market</b> <b>value</b> of firms. Forming an understanding regarding the depth and breadth of inventors' experience through analyzing the number of companies, industries, and technologies they have previously worked in. By collecting information derived from a vast amount of patents, firms receives an accumulated score based on all employed inventors' experiences and further used to understand its impact. Finally, the study employs several regression models on panel data to identify the relationship between individual-level knowledge and firm performance. The results show that individual-level company- and technology diversity have a <b>negative</b> effect on <b>market</b> <b>value,</b> whereas industry diversity has a positive effect.
