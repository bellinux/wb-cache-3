However, a tendency of policy reversal has been witnessed due to non-tariff barriers (NTBs) being imposed to control trade and recoup losses arising from reduced duties. To address {{the proliferation of}} NTBs, multilateral and regional organisations are implementing various forms of NTB notification, reporting, monitoring and eliminating mechanisms. The broad objectives {{of this study is}} to evaluate the performance of the tripartite NTBs reporting, monitoring and eliminating mechanism against best practice and establish its effectiveness to remove NTBs in the tripartite region. The main aim is to identify challenges and gaps in the design of the mechanism that are critical to the effective management of NTBs. Existing literature on mechanisms to address NTBs was reviewed. The focus of which was the main elements of reporting, monitoring and resolution of NTBs through the online mechanism. Policies dealing with NTBs were identified. The short comings of the tripartite online NTB mechanism (NTB-RMM) particularly with regards to data inadequacies, poor categorisation which impact negatively on NTB monitoring and policy improvements in the tripartite countries were also identified from literature. The online mechanism, hosted on the website www. tradebarriers. org was the primary source of the information and data utilised for analysis in this study. Supplementary information was obtained from the actual responses from a target group using questionnaires and interviews. Data analysis was done by aggregating and assessing results from the data extracted from the mechanism, responses from questionnaire, available literature, findings from the desk research and oral and telephonic interviews.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arthropod-borne virus (Arbovirus) {{infections are}} {{considered}} an emerging threat for Europe, {{with an increase}} in cases in recent decades. The increase in global travel and trade has contributed to the introduction of vectors and viruses into new geographical areas. Tropical arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya have re-emerged causing local, sporadic outbreaks ignited by travel-imported cases. The recent Zika virus outbreak in the Americas highlighted a need to strengthen preparedness to (re-) emerging arbovirus infections globally. AIMS: To strengthen preparedness for the early identification of (re-) emerging arbovirus outbreaks in Europe and highlight areas for research. SOURCES: An evidence review of published and grey literature together with consultations with European arbovirus experts. CONTENT: This paper presents an overview of endemic and travel-imported arboviruses of clinical significance in Europe. The overview includes syndromic presentation, risk factors for infection and risk of transmission. Moreover, an update on treatments and vaccinations <b>and</b> surveillance <b>notifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting.</b> The paper also presents predictive modelled risks of further geographical expansion of vectors and viruses. IMPLICATIONS: There are a range of arboviruses of clinical significance to Europe. There has been an increase in <b>notifications</b> of endemic <b>and</b> travel-imported arbovirus cases in recent years and an increased geographical range of vectors and viruses. The heterogeneity in surveillance reporting indicates a risk for the early identification of (re-) emerging outbreaks.

40|$|BACKGROUND The {{increasing}} frequency {{and intensity of}} dengue outbreaks in endemic and non-endemic countries requires a rational, evidence based response. To this end, we aimed to collate the experiences {{of a number of}} affected countries, identify strengths and limitations in dengue surveillance, outbreak preparedness, detection and response and contribute towards the development of a model contingency plan adaptable to country needs. METHODS The study was undertaken in five Latin American (Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru) and five in Asian countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Vietnam). A mixed-methods approach was used which included document analysis, key informant interviews, focus-group discussions, secondary data analysis and consensus building by an international dengue expert meeting organised by the World Health Organization, Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (WHO-TDR). RESULTS Country information on dengue is based on compulsory <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> ("passive surveillance"), with laboratory confirmation (in all participating Latin American countries and some Asian countries) or by using a clinical syndromic definition. Seven countries additionally had sentinel sites with active dengue reporting, some also had virological surveillance. Six had agreed a formal definition of a dengue outbreak separate to seasonal variation in case numbers. Countries collected data on a range of warning signs that may identify outbreaks early, but none had developed a systematic approach to identifying and responding to the early stages of an outbreak. Outbreak response plans varied in quality, particularly regarding the early response. The surge capacity of hospitals with recent dengue outbreaks varied; those that could mobilise additional staff, beds, laboratory support and resources coped best in comparison to those improvising a coping strategy during the outbreak. Hospital outbreak management plans were present in 9 / 22 participating hospitals in Latin-America and 8 / 20 participating hospitals in Asia. CONCLUSIONS Considerable variation between countries was observed with regard to surveillance, outbreak detection, and response. Through discussion at the expert meeting, suggestions were made {{for the development of a}} more standardised approach in the form of a model contingency plan, with agreed outbreak definitions and country-specific risk assessment schemes to initiate early response activities according to the outbreak phase. This would also allow greater cross-country sharing of ideas...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Congenital ocular {{anomalies}} {{contribute significantly}} to childhood visual morbidity, with congenital cataract being {{a major cause of}} visual impairment throughout the world. As in many other countries, a National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS) exists in England and Wales to monitor the frequency of ocular and other anomalies in order to identify new public health hazards and inform aetiological research. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess level of ascertainment by the NCAS of children with congenital cataract.  METHODS—Using independent ophthalmic and paediatric national active surveillance schemes, all infants (⩽ 1 year) newly diagnosed with congenital and infantile cataract in England and Wales in 1  year from September 1995  were identified. These notifications were compared with those made independently to the NCAS during the same period. The proportion of cases identified by the active surveillance schemes and also notified to the NCAS was determined.  RESULTS— 10 % (15 / 149) of eligible children with newly diagnosed congenital or infantile cataract were actually notified to the NCAS. A higher proportion of those diagnosed as neonates (16 %, 14 / 85) than in later infancy (2 %, 1 / 64) was ascertained through the NCAS. There is a need for better verification of <b>notifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>reported</b> information in the NCAS.  CONCLUSION—Currently, ascertainment of congenital cataract through the NCAS is low and the system is likely to be insensitive to small but important changes in risk factors for this disorder. This limits its use for monitoring secular and other trends in ocular anomalies. Strategies to improve its future use are discussed, including enhancing the awareness and participation of ophthalmic professionals involved in managing children with anomalies. ...|$|R

Based on MUN results during the summer of 2001, 50 farms with high MUN values and 30 with low values were randomly allocated to become either intervention or control farms. From January to November 2002 (the trial period), intervention included monthly notification of individual cow MUN results, interpretation of abnormal average MUN values in subgroups of cows based on parity and days-in-milk, and suggestion of possible nutritional reasons for the abnormal MUNs. Intervention farms responded to a survey regarding report utilization, subsequent feed changes and perceptions of MUN testing. Control farms received the individual cow MUN results, but no additional interpretation. No significant differences in average MUN or standardized milk production between intervention and control farms were seen during the last three months of the trial (the outcome period). However, in herds making a feed change in response to MUN <b>notification</b> <b>and</b> interpretation (71 % of intervention herds), milk production increased 2. 4 lb (1. 1 kg) /cow per day in the month after the feed change when compared to randomly selected herds not making a feed change during the same time period.
