25|$|The Morelands {{have spoken}} to journalists, {{including}} Edward R. Murrow, about family life in a lighthouse that was still, at the time, a half-mile from the nearest land. The Coast Guard supplied them with water, so they no longer needed {{to rely on the}} cistern, although it was still kept full. It was necessary {{to go back to the}} land at least every two days for milk, and they bought groceries every two weeks. The couple could <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> together as one of them had to remain at the lighthouse at all times. During one power outage, Richard Moreland hung an emergency kerosene lamp in the lantern house and rang the fog bell himself.|$|E
500|$|The rural {{setting in}} Marin County {{furnished}} {{the backdrop for}} the domestic bliss associated with the album, and the songs' lyrics contained harmonious references to the [...] "good life at home". In an interview given to New Spotlight magazine at the time, Morrison's wife, Janet Planet referred to Morrison's dislike of socializing at this time: [...] "Really he is a recluse. He is quiet. We never go anywhere. We don't go to parties. We <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> We have an incredibly quiet life and going on the road is the only excitement we have." [...] Although Morrison said that the songs on the album [...] "had been hanging around [...] " [...] and according to biographer Steve Turner they were written in Woodstock, musician Ronnie Montrose recalled that Morrison wrote one of the tunes, [...] "You're My Woman", [...] while sitting at the piano during the recording sessions in California.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that although it is [...] "inevitable" [...] that Homer's car will be a disaster, the [...] "joy of this episode is anticipating exactly what sort of disaster." [...] A member of the IGN staff wrote in a season two review that [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] {{is one of the}} [...] "real winners {{to be found in the}} second season." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the most memorable line of the episode was Homer's idea of the perfect car, [...] "You know that little ball you put on the aerial so you can find your car in a parking lot? That should be on every car! And some things are so snazzy they <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of style — like tail fins! And bubble domes! And shag carpeting!" ...|$|E

500|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the Petition by the House of Lords, Charles sent a message to the Commons [...] "forbidding them to meddle with affairs of state", something that produced a furious debate. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced that he had been commanded to interrupt any Member of Parliament who should insult or cast aspersion on a Minister of State, such as the Duke of Buckingham. This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared {{that he did not know}} whether he would be allowed to speak in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the cause of all our miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with honour, or sit with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the cause of all our disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, DeVille {{recorded}} Backstreets of Desire, {{the first}} of four albums he would record in Los Angeles with producer John Philip Shenale. [...] "I say it every time I record in L.A. — that I'll never do it again, and I keep doing it... It's crazy. I just record and go to the hotel, and <b>never</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> then back to the studio. I hate L.A. It's the worst. I think they eat their children there. I never saw any kids. It's a pity there aren't more studios in New Orleans." [...] Although DeVille complained about having to record in Los Angeles, recording in that city put him in touch with many talented Latino musicians who helped shape his distinctive Spanish-Americana sound.|$|E
