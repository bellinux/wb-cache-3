5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-48 {{like all}} {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the average traffic levels for a roadway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT figured that between 580 and 1,800vehicles a day used sections of M-48. In addition, the department has added the portion of M-48 between the northern M-129 junction and M-134 to the Lake Huron Circle Tour, a scenic drive that loops around the lake. <b>No</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway has been added to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

As part of this role, ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways.

In 2009, ADOT calculated that an average of only 450 vehicles used the road daily at both termini. <b>No</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
