5|$|Nativists {{said they}} were only {{responding}} to being attacked and were justified in their actions but were <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the riots after May 6.

5|$|Relations between NASA and North American {{deteriorated}} over {{assignment of}} blame.

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the storm, Congress appointed a bipartisan committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise {{been lost in the}} raging hurricane.|$|E

5|$|This led to {{proposals}} {{for a new}} radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately {{have to deal with}} the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{to ensure}} that an {{entertainment}} or exhibition is not detrimental to the public interest, the Minister can impose conditions relating to the holding of the event on its promoter, every person involved in its promotion, and the proprietor of the premises on which the event is to be held. Failure to comply with any of such conditions is an offence, unless the person involved is able to show {{he or she was}} <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the breach and exercised due care and caution. The authorities are empowered to close an entertainment or exhibition operated in breach of any condition, or kept open in contravention of an order by the Minister.|$|E
5|$|As {{the demonstrations}} continued, Ambassador Nolting managed to extract {{theoretical}} concessions from Diệm on 18 May. Diệm agreed a modest compensation package of USD $7000 {{for the families}} of the victims as a conciliatory gesture. Diệm also agreed to dismiss those responsible for the shootings. However, the publicly stated reason for this action was that the officials had failed to maintain order, rather than that they had been responsible for the deaths of the protesters. Despite these concessions, Diệm maintained that his government was <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the deaths, resolutely continuing to blame the Việt Cộng. It was enough to satisfy Nolting, who immediately departed for his vacation. His absence allowed the remaining American diplomatic staff led by William Trueheart, Nolting's deputy, to end Nolting's policy of appeasing Diệm.|$|E

5|$|Berger {{was acquitted}} under counts one, and two, and {{some parts of}} counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six. He was convicted under that part of count three {{relating}} {{to the murder of}} Mesny, and under those parts of count five relating to his involvement with the SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger, for being a conscious participant in the concentration camp program, and the conscription of nationals of other countries. He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the Heuaktion, and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the murder of Mesny.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Murder was {{the third}} Ska Studios game {{published}} by Microsoft Studios.

Ska Studios had complete creative control over the game itself. Charlie Murder was promoted as a free Xbox download with Microsoft's Games with Gold program {{during the month of}} June 2014.|$|E
5|$|In the typhoon's early stages, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} outer bands of the storm {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the Philippines, resulting in 16 fatalities. However, a meteorological analysis of the storm showed that Kirogi was <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the rain; instead, a monsoon depression that later became Typhoon Kai-tak caused the flooding rains. Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835km (520mi) from the Philippines. However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris left by the damaging waves.|$|E

5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was on-duty during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{function}} of NMDA receptors {{play a role}} in schizophrenia. This diminished {{function of}} NMDA receptor may be correlated with the reduced expression of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2b), which has also been linked to schizophrenia. TBR1, in complex with the protein, CINAP, is responsible for regulating transcription of the NR2b gene. It was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced TBR1 and CINAP expression may be responsible for the reduced expression of the NR2b subunit observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics. However, TBR1 and CINAP expression were not significantly reduced in the postmortem brains, suggesting that synthesis and processing of NR2b via TBR1 is <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> reduced NR2b expression in schizophrenics.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} {{to respond to}} the problem of evil. As such, it defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either <b>not</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing.

Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of}} their own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
