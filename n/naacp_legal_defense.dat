Amnesty International neither takes a position on the guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E

2500|$|By 1958 {{at least}} 55 [...] "movement churches" [...] {{were active in}} the ACMHR. Weekly mass meetings, filled with {{emotional}} testimony, music, and passionate preaching, raised {{an average of about}} $200–300 per week to fund the organization's lawsuits. Additional funds came from speaking engagements in other cities and from local supporters who did not join the group, including whites who were eager for change but could not risk certain retaliation for showing public support for the movement. In its first three years, the group spent over $40,000 of the $53,000 it raised on legal fees, much of it on black attorneys such as Arthur Shores, Orzell Billingsley, Jr, Oscar Adams, and Demetrius Newton of Birmingham and Ernest D. Jackson of Jacksonville, Florida. By 1965 the ACMHR had initiated more federal suits that reached the United States Supreme Court than any other petitioner. As the cases rose through the federal court system, they garnered assistance from the <b>NAACP's</b> <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> fund.|$|R
50|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} of the <b>NAACP</b> created the <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> Fund in 1939 specifically for tax purposes. It functioned as the <b>NAACP</b> <b>legal</b> department.

In November 1944, Marshall wrote an incendiary piece for The Crisis magazine, published by the NAACP. Pamphlets were printed and distributed, and editorials denouncing the trial appeared from African-American publishers in January 1945. Petitions began to circulate, collecting thousands of names of citizens who demanded a reversal of the mutiny verdict. Protest meetings were held and powerful people in sympathy to the cause were asked to bring pressure to bear. Eleanor Roosevelt sent Secretary Forrestal a copy of NAACP's [...] "Mutiny" [...] pamphlet in April 1945, asking him to take special care in this case.|$|E
500|$|The Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund {{was founded}} in 1972 as a {{non-profit}} organization by three lawyers, Jorge Batista, Victor Marrero, and Cesar A. Perales, with Perales the fund's first president. It was created as a privately funded, nonprofit and nonpartisan organization {{with the goal of}} changing discriminatory practices via advocacy and litigation. [...] It was inspired in form and purpose by the high-profile <b>NAACP</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> and Educational Fund, which Thurgood Marshall had established in 1957. [...] PRLDEF (pronounced [...] "pearl-deaf") had $300,000 of initial funding from foundations, government sources, and private corporations. [...] U.S. House of Representatives member Herman Badillo was on its first Board of Directors, and at the fund's initial press conference he said, [...] "There is plenty of room for change in our society, and much can be done through the medium of class actions." [...] The organization soon grew to have a Litigation Division, a Pro Bono Cooperating Counsel Division, and an Education Division. [...] A typical staffer was a young, idealistic attorney from a premier law school.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to her lobbying, organizing and fundraising efforts, Lampkin has also been credited with recruiting a young Baltimore attorney and future Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall {{to become a member}} of the <b>NAACP's</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> Committee in 1938. Marshall would go on to lead the organization in its successful litigation in Brown vs. the Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court. She was credited with having the most substantial gains in membership among any of the organization's executive leadership. During her last year as National Field Secretary she raised over $1 million for the organizations. So dedicated was she to the NAACP and community organizing that has been said she to have crossed the country conducting 40 NAACP chapter meetings in one month. Lampkin would eventually take on a renewed interest in black women's organizing; assisting the Delta Sigma Theta sorority with internal fundraising and the centralizing of its finances and records. She has been credited with advancing the organization's ability to have a presence in the policy-making center of the nation. She was inducted as an Honorary Member in 1947.|$|R
5000|$|Spade was {{an early}} {{advocate}} for {{the abolition of the}} so-called [...] "100:1 ratio" [...] which punished criminal defendants convicted of crack cocaine offenses much more harshly than those convicted of powder cocaine offenses. The disparate treatment effected by this law was particularly egregious because the result was to punish African-American defendants more harshly than white defendants. Spade's Arizona Law Review article advocating a decrease in the 100:1 ratio was cited in the testimony before the United States Sentencing Commission of Irwin H. Schwartz, President of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) in which Schwartz urged a reform of the cocaine sentencing laws. Eleven years later, Spade was proven correct when the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts were not constrained to impose the 100:1 ratio when sentencing defendants in crack cocaine cases if they found that the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing. Spade's article was cited in the Amicus Curiae Brief of the <b>NAACP's</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> & Educational Fund, Inc. filed with the Supreme Court in the Kimbrough case.|$|R

500|$|In March 1967, the United States Senate Committee on Labor's Subcommittee on Poverty held {{a series}} of hearings, as part of the ongoing [...] "War on Poverty." [...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the <b>NAACP's</b> <b>Legal</b> <b>Defense</b> Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and {{the number of people who}} are going around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>NAACP</b> {{provided}} <b>legal</b> <b>defense</b> of {{the black}} men convicted by the state for the riot and carried {{the case to the}} US Supreme Court. Its ruling overturned the Elaine convictions and established important precedent about the conduct of trials. The Supreme Court found that the original trial was held under conditions that adversely affected the defendants' rights. Some of the courtroom audience were armed, as was a mob outside, so there was intimidation of the court and jury. The 79 black defendants had been quickly tried and convicted by an all-white jury: 12 were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death; 67 were condemned to sentences from 20 years to life. No white man was prosecuted for any of the many black deaths.|$|R

Although LDF was originally meant to operate in accordance with NAACP policy, after 1961, serious disputes emerged between the two organizations. These disputes ultimately led the NAACP to create its own internal legal department while LDF continued to operate and score significant legal victories as an independent organization.|$|R
