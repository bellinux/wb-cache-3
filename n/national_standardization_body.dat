With the introduction of digital support and networking, the lifespan of dictionaries has been considerably extended. The dictionary manuscript has become a unique data-source that can be reused and manipulated many times by numerous in-house and external experts. The traditional relationship between author, publisher and user has now been extended to include other partners: data-providers – either other publishers or institutions or industry-partners-, software developers, language-tool providers etc. All these dictionary experts need a basic common language to optimize their work flow {{and to be able to}} co-operate in developing new products while avoiding time-consuming and expensive data manipulations.

The legal and technological arguments {{are taken into}} account with aim to illustrate crucial points of this aspect. The need to protect critical systems infrastructure is quite natural when we accept state security standpoint. In the recent years world leaders saw the need to protect such structures as gas, power, water and tele-communications networks. Protection is based on two pillars, the first is law and the second is technology. In both areas the development depends on the cooperation on the international level and it is the effect of the technological and legal experience. Security of energy critical infrastructure however is a challenge not only for institutions but also for legal and technological concepts. Firstly, state interest has to deal with private owners of CI. In fact, legal solutions has to be analyzed with much broader perspective within European legal experience. The paper will analyze how far and why the state should be responsible for the maintenance and protection of CI. Thus, the legal strategies towards CI are compared with the ideas of Elinor Ostrom’s governing the commons as way to find an effective solution. Secondly, on the technological level, the governing of CI is analyzed in the context of setting technical standards and recommendations. International and <b>national</b> <b>standardization</b> <b>bodies</b> are responsible for resolving safety and security problems. In that respect certain types of energy recommendations will be taken into account.
