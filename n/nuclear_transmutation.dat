To overcome the difficulties of the large Coulomb repulsion among nuclei a γ-ray electromagnetic field appears as a suitable agent.

25|$|Although {{in theory}} all 18F-FDG is metabolized as above with a {{radioactivity}} elimination half-life of 110 minutes (the {{same as that}} of fluorine-18), clinical {{studies have shown that the}} radioactivity of 18F-FDG partitions into two major fractions. About 75% of the fluorine-18 activity remains in tissues and is eliminated with a half-life of 110 minutes, presumably by decaying in place to O-18 to form 18O-glucose-6-phosphate, which is non-radioactive (this molecule can soon be metabolized to carbon dioxide and water, after <b>nuclear</b> <b>transmutation</b> of the fluorine to oxygen ceases to prevent metabolism). Another fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20% of the total fluorine-18 activity of an injection, is eliminated renally by two hours after a dose of 18F-FDG, with a rapid half-life of about 16 minutes (this portion makes the renal-collecting system and bladder prominent in a normal PET scan). This short biological half-life indicates that this 20% portion of the total fluorine-18 tracer activity is eliminated pharmacokinetically (through the renal system) much more quickly than the isotope itself can decay. The rapidity also suggests that some of this 18F is no longer attached to glucose, since low concentrations of glucose in the blood are retained by the normal kidney and not passed into the urine. Because of this rapidly excreted urine 18F, the urine of a patient undergoing a PET scan may therefore be especially radioactive for several hours after administration of the isotope.|$|E

It {{has been}} suggested {{that one of the most}} viable incineration concepts is a symbiotic nuclear-energy system, consisting of a transmuter and a number of co-operating light-water reactors (LWRs). Closing of the fuel cycle is not easily achievable, since the minor actinides (MAs), unavoidably then produced in significant quantities, show disadvantageous safety properties (positive void reactivity coefficients). Accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADSSs), distinct by their remoteness from super prompt criticality, have been attracting more and more attention. The superiority of subcritical ones is shown by comparing their behaviours in the case of a rapid reactivity insertion that brings no risk, in contrast to the fast critical ones. Finally, research problems and difficulties are mentioned. Any form of closed fuel cycle cannot avoid dealing with large quantities of radioactive materials. Yet, a definitive elimination of actinides, with the use of the enormous released energy, is worth this price.
