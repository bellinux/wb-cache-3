40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master´s Thesis is {{to analyse}} {{the way in which}} <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organizations</b> {{approach}} the use of the internet for fundraising. The Master´s Thesis explores attitudes of <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organizations</b> towards this medium as well as the factors that motivate these organizations to use the internet. In order to achieve the aim the author carried out qualitative research based on semi-structured interview attended by representatives of a total of ten selected <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organizations.</b> The results show that <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organizations</b> use the internet for fundraising, however there are considerable gaps in their effectiveness. Online fundraising does not entail a significant financial source. <b>Non-governmental</b> <b>organizations</b> use the internet mainly to build a relationship with their supporters. Online fundraising is therefore seen as a complement to classic fundraising methods that still dominate in case of Czech <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

5|$|People {{living in}} areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS face several {{psychological}} barriers when deciding whether to undergo testing for HIV. For example, people may prefer not {{to know if they}} are HIV-positive because, due to the obstacles they often face in gaining access to antiretroviral drugs, many view HIV/AIDS diagnoses as death sentences. Others may simply believe that they are HIV-negative, either because they practice strict monogamy and consistently use condoms during sexual intercourse or because they are in denial about the prevalence of the disease. However, despite these barriers, both mobile and static testing services have become more widely available in Malawi recently: 1,392 testing and counseling sites existed in 2011. Certain <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> such as the Malawi AIDS Counseling and Resource Organisation (MACRO) provide door-to-door counseling and testing services, which have drastically improved the accessibility of HIV testing.|$|E

5|$|The AFL–CIO's {{autonomous}} {{support of}} Solidarity {{was so successful}} that by 1984 both Democrats and Republicans agreed that it deserved public support. The AFL–CIO's example of open support was deemed to be appropriate for a democracy, and much more suitable than the clandestine funding through the CIA that had occurred before 1970. Both parties and President Ronald Reagan supported a <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization,</b> National Endowment for Democracy (NED), through which Congress would openly fund Solidarity through an allocation in the State Department's budget, beginning in 1984. The NED was designed with four core institutions, associated with {{the two major parties}} and with the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (representing business). The NED's first president was Carl Gershman, a former Director of Social Democrats, USA and former U.S. Representative to the United Nations committee on human rights. From 1984 until 1990, the NED and the AFL–CIO channeled equipment and support worth $4million to Solidarity.|$|E

In 2002, following wide ranging political reforms by the Bahraini government which allowed independent human rights groups to operate, Rajab worked with Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and others to found the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), a nonprofit <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organization</b> which works to promote human rights in Bahrain.
