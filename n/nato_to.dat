5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> {{develop a}} military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided {{for and against}} the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> hold areas seized from the Taliban in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, so there was no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> the East is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E

5|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} the United States caused <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> invoke Article5 of the NATO Charter {{for the first time}} in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be {{considered}} to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4October 2001.|$|E
5|$|The dwindling {{credibility}} of the massive retaliation strategy caused <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> shift to the flexible response strategy. This increased the importance of Banak, {{as it would be}} used to fly in reinforcements in a war situation. In 1962, both RNoAF and NATO proposed that Banak be expanded to full NATO standards. RNoAF planned that Banak should host a detachment of up to six fighters or fighter-bombers and act as a stopover for fighters, transports and helicopters. The airfield was to stockpile supplies, including fuel and ammunition, for one month of war efforts. NATO saw need, in case of a Soviet attack on Finnmark, to deploy two brigades consisting of 10,000 men {{in the course of a}} week and simultaneously host a squadron of tactical aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, while NATO was {{planning}} {{a new strategy}} in support of peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a ceasefire brokered by former US President Jimmy Carter between the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine; ARBiH) and the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske; VRS) expired and fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive around Sarajevo. In response, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot and began shelling targets around the city, prompting the UN commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Rupert Smith, to request NATO air strikes against the VRS. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump in the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. The mission {{was carried out by}} United States Air Force F-16s and Spanish Air Force EF-18A Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs. In response, the VRS seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as human shields for a variety of potential targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina, forcing <b>NATO</b> <b>to</b> end the air strikes.|$|E
