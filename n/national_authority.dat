5|$|On December 21, 1995, Israeli troops {{withdrew from}} Bethlehem, {{and three days}} later the city came under the {{complete}} administration and military control of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> in conformance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment {{consisted}} of nine companies—four from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state {{composition of the}} new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> as an Extra Continental regiment.|$|E

50|$|ASEAN <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> {{have also}} been {{traditionally}} reluctant to share or cede sovereignty to authorities from other ASEAN members (although ASEAN trade ministries routinely make cross-border visits to conduct on-site inspections in anti-dumping investigations). Unlike the EU or NAFTA, joint teams to ensure compliance and investigate non-compliance have not been widely used. Instead, ASEAN <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> must rely on the review and analysis of other ASEAN <b>national</b> <b>authorities</b> to determine if AFTA measures such as rule of origin are being followed. Disagreements may result between the <b>national</b> <b>authorities.</b> Again, the ASEAN Secretariat may help mediate a dispute but has no legal authority to resolve it.|$|R

5|$|The term Palestine is also {{sometimes}} {{used in a}} limited sense {{to refer to the}} parts of the Palestinian territories currently under the administrative control of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority,</b> a quasi-governmental entity which governs parts of the State of Palestine {{under the terms of the}} Oslo Accords.|$|E
5|$|According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), in 1997, 44,926 were {{enrolled}} in schools (41.2% in primary school, 36.2% in secondary school, and 22.6% in high school). About 19.8% {{of high school students}} received bachelor diplomas or higher diplomas. In 2006, there were 234 schools and 93,925 students in the Nablus Governorate; 196 schools are run by the Education Ministry of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority,</b> 14 by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and 24 are private schools.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{emphasized}} {{a careful}} {{approach to the}} conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> President Mahmoud Abbas. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords. Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing their elected leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, in {{the wake}} of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, {{administrative}} control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (PNA). On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA.|$|E

5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority</b> (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel {{captured}} the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian <b>National</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{retained}} {{control of}} the city until the Six-Day War in 1967, when Bethlehem was captured by Israel, {{along with the rest}} of the West Bank.

5|$|Since Tubas is {{the capital}} and largest city in the Tubas Governorate, it acts as the main {{provider}} of services to the towns and villages of the governorate.

There are 21 government institutions in Tubas, including a post office, the Palestinian Ministry of Labor office, the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture office, the Palestinian Ministry of Social Affairs office, the fire department and a police station.|$|E
