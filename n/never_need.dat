25|$|There {{has also}} been a lot of {{criticism}} of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will <b>never</b> <b>need</b> Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.|$|E
25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We <b>never</b> <b>need</b> four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

But the President has underestimated Van Ackerman's treachery and misjudged Anderson's reaction should the truth come out. After a series of circumstances involving Anderson's secret being revealed to his wife, the Washington press corps, and several senators, Anderson kills himself. Anderson's death turns {{the majority of the}} Senate against the President and the Majority Leader. Anderson's suicide and the exposure of the truth about Leffingwell's lies regarding his communist past set in motion a chain reaction that ends several careers and ultimately rejects Leffingwell as a nominee to become Secretary of State.|$|E

25|$|Under a pure {{flat tax}} without deductions, every tax period a company {{would make a}} single payment to the {{government}} covering the taxes on the employees and the taxes on the company profit. For example, suppose that in a given year, a company called ACME earns a profit of 3 million, spends 2 million in wages, and spends 1 million on other expenses that under the tax law is taxable income to recipients, such as the receipt of stock options, bonuses, and certain executive privileges. Given a flat rate of 15%, ACME would then owe the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (3M + 2M + 1M) × 0.15 = 900,000. This payment would, in one fell swoop, settle the tax liabilities of ACME's employees {{as well as the}} corporate taxes owed by ACME. Most employees throughout the economy would <b>never</b> <b>need</b> to interact with the IRS, as all tax owed on wages, interest, dividends, royalties, etc. would be withheld at the source. The main exceptions would be employees with incomes from personal ventures. The Economist claims that such a system would reduce the number of entities required to file returns from about 130 million individuals, households, and businesses, as at present, to a mere 8 million businesses and self-employed.|$|E

500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season.

Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E
