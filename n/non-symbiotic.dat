50|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{is essential}} for all forms of life because inorganic nitrogen compounds are required for the biosynthesis of the basic building blocks of plants, animals and other life forms, e.g., nucleotides for DNA and RNA, the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide for its role in metabolism (transferring electrons between molecules), and amino acids for proteins. Therefore, {{as part of the}} nitrogen cycle, it {{is essential for}} agriculture and the manufacture of fertilizer. It is also, indirectly, relevant to the manufacture of all chemical compounds that contain nitrogen, which includes explosives, most pharmaceuticals, dyes, etc. Nitrogen fixation is carried out naturally in the soil by nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Azotobacter. Some nitrogen-fixing bacteria have symbiotic relationships with some plant groups, especially legumes. Looser relationships between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants are often referred to as associative or <b>non-symbiotic,</b> as seen in nitrogen fixation occurring on rice roots. It also occurs naturally in the air by means of NOx production by lightning.|$|E
5000|$|Symbiotic Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium species, detect {{compounds}} like flavonoids secreted by {{the roots}} of leguminous plants and then produce nod factors which signal to the plant that they are present and {{will lead to the}} formation of root nodules.

40|$|Background {{and aims}} <b>Non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins {{have been an}} active {{research}} topic for over 30 years, during which time a considerable portfolio of knowledge has accumulated relative to their chemical and molecular properties, and their presence and mode of induction in plants. While {{progress has been made}} towards understanding their physiological role, there remain a number of unanswered questions with respect to their biological function. This review attempts to update recent progress in this area and to introduce a hypothesis as to how <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins might participate in regulating hormone signal transduction. Principal results Advances have been made towards understanding the structural nuances that explain some of the differences in ligand association characteristics of class 1 and class 2 <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins. <b>Non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins have been found to function in seed develop-ment and germination, flowering, root development and differentiation, abiotic stress responses, pathogen invasion and symbiotic bacterial associations. Microarray analyses under various stress conditions yield uneven results relative to <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobin expression. Increasing evidence of the role of nitric oxide (NO) in hormone responses and the known involvement of <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins in scavenging NO provide opportunities for fruitful research, particularly at the cellular level. Conclusions Circumstantial evidence suggests that <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins may have a critical function in the signal transduction pathways of auxin, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, cytokinin and abscisic acid. There is a strong need for research on haemoglobin gene expression at the cellular level relative to hormone signal transduction...|$|E
40|$|Haemoglobin genes {{have been}} found in a number of plant species, but the number of genes known has been too small to allow {{effective}} evolutionary inferences. We present nine new <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobin sequences from a range of plants, including class 1 haemoglobins from cotton, Citrus and tomato, class 2 haemoglobins from cotton, tomato, sugar beet and canola and two haemoglobins from the non-vascular plants, Marchantia polymorpha (a liverwort) and Physcomitrella patens (a moss). Our molecular phylogenetic analysis of all currently known <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobin genes and a selection of symbiotic haemoglobins have confirmed the existence of two distinct classes of haemoglobin genes in the dicots. It is likely that all dicots have both class 1 and class 2 <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobin genes whereas in monocots we have detected only class 1 genes. The symbiotic haemoglobins from legumes and Casuarina are related to the class 2 <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins, whilst the symbiotic haemoglobin from Parasponia groups with the class 1 <b>non-symbiotic</b> genes. Probably, there have been two independent recruitments of symbiotic haemoglobins.

We examined the expression in transgenic plants of the two <b>non-symbiotic</b> haemoglobins from Arabidopsis using promoter fusions to a GUS reporter gene. The Arabidopsis GLB 1 and GLB 2 genes are likely to be functionally distinct. The class 2 haemoglobin gene (GLB 2) is expressed in the roots, leaves and inflorescence and can be induced in young plants by cytokinin treatment in contrast to the class 1 gene (GLB 1) which is active in germinating seedlings and can be induced by hypoxia and increased sucrose supply, but not by cytokinin treatment...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{more than}} 40 years of {{research}} on free-living and endophytic bacteria associated with cereals and grasses, conclusive examples of impacts of <b>non-symbiotic</b> N 2 -fixation in agriculture are lacking. All available methods for measurement of N 2 -fixation associated with cereals and grasses have been employed, and N 2 -fixation has been demonstrated to occur under controlled conditions, but this is insufficient evidence to prove a significant role for N 2 -fixation by heterotrophic bacteria in the field. Recently attention has focused on endophytic N 2 -fixation with claims of major inputs of N from the atmosphere, particularly in sugar cane for which the largest body of information exists, although some methodological concerns remain unanswered. Here we analyse the evidence for N 2 -fixation in the rhizosphere and within graminaceous plants. We provide guidelines suggesting the type of information required to allow a critical analysis of the amounts of <b>non-symbiotic</b> N 2 -fixation contributed in agriculture. Given the substantial availability of C as a substrate for N 2 -fixation in sugar cane it remains the most likely candidate plant to benefit from <b>non-symbiotic</b> N 2 -fixation. Measurements of elevated respiration in zones of high bacterial colonization may give an indication of whether these really are focal points of the rapid metabolic activity required to support significant N 2 -fixation activity.

40|$|Two main {{mechanisms}} {{are thought to}} affect the prevalence of endophyte-grass symbiosis in host populations: the mode of endophyte transmission, and the fitness differential between symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> plants. These mechanisms have mostly been studied in synthetic grass populations. If we are to improve {{our understanding of the}} ecological and evolutionary dynamics of such symbioses, we now need to determine the combinations of mechanisms actually operating in the wild, in populations shaped by evolutionary history. We used a demographic population modeling approach to identify the mechanisms operating in a natural stand of an intermediate population (i. e. 50 % of plants symbiotic) of the native grass Festuca eskia. We recorded demographic data in the wild over a period of three years, with manipulation of the soil resources for half the population. We developed two stage-structured matrix population models. The first model concerned either symbiotic or <b>non-symbiotic</b> plants. The second model included both symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> plants and took endophyte transmission rates into account. According to our models, symbiotic had a significantly higher population growth rate than <b>non-symbiotic</b> plants, and endophyte prevalence was about 58 %. Endophyte transmission rates were about 0. 67 or 0. 87, depending on the growth stage considered. In the presence of nutrient supplementation, population growth rates were still significantly higher for symbiotic than for <b>non-symbiotic</b> plants, but endophyte prevalence fell to 0 %. At vertical transmission rates below 0. 10 – 0. 20, no symbiosis was observed. Our models showed that a positive benefit of the endophyte and vertical transmission rates of about 0. 6 could lead to the coexistence of symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> F. eskia plants. The positive effect of the symbiont on host is not systematically associated with high transmission rates of the symbiont over short time scales, in particular following an environmental change. 17 page(s...|$|E

A thorough sequence analysis of 26 plant Hb proteins, currently available in public domain, revealed a consensus motif of 29 amino acids. This motif is present in all the members of symbiotic class II Hbs including symCgHb and <b>non-symbiotic</b> Class II Hbs, but is totally absent in Class I symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> Hbs. Further, we constructed 3 D structures of Hb proteins from Alnus and Casuarina through homology modelling and peeped into their structural properties. Structure-based studies revealed that the Casuarina symbiotic haemoglobin protein shows distinct stereochemical properties from that of the other Casuarina and Alnus Hb proteins. It also showed considerable structural similarities with leghemoglobin structure from yellow lupin (pdb id 1 GDI). Therefore, sequence and structure analyses point to the fact that symCgHb protein shows significant resemblance to symbiotic haemoglobin found in legumes and may thus eventually play a similar role in shielding the nitrogenase from oxygen as seen in the case of leghemoglobin.

40|$|In the Hydra vulgaris group, only 2 of the 25 strains in the {{collection}} of the National Institute of Genetics in Japan currently show endosymbiosis with green algae. However, whether the other <b>non-symbiotic</b> strains also have the potential to harbor algae remains unknown. The endosymbiotic potential of <b>non-symbiotic</b> strains that can harbor algae may have been acquired before or during divergence of the strains. With the aim of understanding the evolutionary process of endosymbiosis in the H. vulgaris group, we examined the endosymbiotic potential of <b>non-symbiotic</b> strains of the H. vulgaris group by artificially introducing endosymbiotic algae. We found that 12 of the 23 <b>non-symbiotic</b> strains were able to harbor the algae until reaching the grand-offspring through the asexual reproduction by budding. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial genome sequences showed that all the strains with endosymbiotic potential grouped into a single cluster (cluster γ). This cluster contained two strains (J 7 and J 10) that currently harbor algae; however, these strains were not the closest relatives. These results suggest that evolution of endosymbiosis occurred in two steps; first, endosymbiotic potential was gained once in the ancestor of the cluster γ lineage; second, strains J 7 and J 10 obtained algae independently after the divergence of the strains. By demonstrating the evolution of the endosymbiotic potential in <b>non-symbiotic</b> H. vulgaris group strains, we have clearly distinguished two evolutionary steps.

40|$|Understanding {{the drivers}} of {{variation}} in symbiont quality is a fundamental objective {{in the study of}} mutualisms. Eukaryotic hosts express control traits that can selectively favor beneficial symbionts over ineffective genotypes, but bacterial symbionts range widely in beneficial quality. Evolutionary instability in symbiotic function and/or context dependency in the expression of symbiotic traits are predicted to contribute to this variation. 	The Acmispon-Bradyrhizobium mutualism is a model system for studying variation in symbiotic traits. Acmispon hosts sanction ineffective symbionts, yet Bradyrhizobium naturally vary in symbiotic function. However, the incidence, distribution, and evolution of symbiotic quality in Bradyrhizobium from natural habitats remains unclear. I investigated the evolution and spatial distribution of Bradyrhizobium symbiotic effectiveness across a metapopulation of A. strigosus hosts. Symbiotic quality was evolutionarily unstable, consistent with the repeated evolution of non-nitrogen fixing Bradyrhizobium, and suggests that the loss of nitrogen fixation may be a common process. 	To examine if symbiotic ineffectiveness was expressed as a maladapted, context dependent outcome, I quantified fitness and fitness-effects of divers Bradyrhizobium isolates on sympatric and allopatric Acmispon hosts. Several isolates were found to be symbiotically ineffective and rhizobial fitness proxies uncovered evidence of rhizobial exploitation. This data suggests that host exploitation also maintains ineffective rhizobia, and thus overall variation in symbiont quality in natural populations. 	Symbiotic quality can also vary due to biotic environment, and although rhizobia are best known for symbiotic function, the majority of rhizobia are <b>non-symbiotic.</b> To test if <b>non-symbiotic</b> conspecifics effect the Acmispon-Bradyrhizobium mutualism, I coinoculated hosts with mixtures of symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> Bradyrhizobium.

Comparative studies between symbiotic (Anemonia viridis) and <b>non-symbiotic</b> (Actinia schmidti) sea anemones show striking {{differences in their}} response to oxidative stress. First, the basal expression of SOD is very different. Symbiotic animal cells have a higher isoform diversity (number and classes) and a higher activity than the <b>non-symbiotic</b> cells. Second, the symbiotic animal cells of A. viridis also maintain unaltered basal values for cellular damage when exposed to experimental hyperoxia (100 % O(2)) or to experimental thermal stress (elevated temperature + 7 degrees C above ambient). Under such conditions, A. schmidti modifies its SOD activity significantly. Electrophoretic patterns diversify, global activities diminish and cell damage biomarkers increase. These data suggest symbiotic cells adapt to stress while <b>non-symbiotic</b> cells remain acutely sensitive. In addition to being toxic, high O(2) partial pressure (P(O(2))) may also constitute a preconditioning step for symbiotic animal cells, leading to an adaptation to the hyperoxic condition and, thus, to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in aposymbiotic animal cells of A. viridis, repression of some animal SOD isoforms is observed. Meanwhile, in cultured symbionts, new activity bands are induced, suggesting that the host might protect its zooxanthellae in hospite. Similar results have been observed in other symbiotic organisms, such as the sea anemone Aiptasia pulchella and the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} land plant hemoglobins within the broader context of eukaryote hemoglobins and the three families of bacterial globins. Most eukaryote hemoglobins, including metazoan globins and the symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> plant hemoglobins, are homologous to the bacterial 3 / 3 -fold flavohemoglobins. The remaining plant hemoglobins are homologous to the bacterial 2 / 2 -fold group 2 hemoglobins. We have proposed that all eukaryote globins were acquired via horizontal gene transfer concomitant with the endosymbiotic events responsible for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Although the 3 / 3 hemoglobins originated in the ancestor of green algae and plants prior {{to the emergence of}} embryophytes at about 450 mya, the 2 / 2 hemoglobins appear to have originated via horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium ancestral to present day Chloroflexi. Unlike the 2 / 2 hemoglobins, the evolution of the 3 / 3 hemoglobins was accompanied by duplication, diversification, and functional adaptations. Duplication of the ancestral plant nshb gene into the nshb- 1 and nshb- 2 lineages occurred prior to the monocot−dicot divergence at ca. 140 mya. It was followed by the emergence of symbiotic hemoglobins from a <b>non-symbiotic</b> hemoglobin precursor and further specialization, leading to leghemoglobins in N 2 -fixing legume nodules concomitant with the origin of nodulation at ca. 60 mya.

In contrast, in both symbiotic and <b>non-symbiotic</b> host coral cells, 15 min of CO 2 addition (0. 2 pH unit drop in pHe) led to cytoplasmic acidosis equivalent to 0. 4 pH units. Despite further seawater acidification over {{the duration of the}} experiment, the pHi of <b>non-symbiotic</b> coral cells did not change, though in host cells containing a symbiont cell the pHi recovered to control levels. This recovery was negated when cells were incubated with DCMU. Our results reveal that photosynthetic activity of the endosymbiont is tightly coupled with the ability of the host cell to recover from cellular acidosis after exposure to high CO 2 / low pH...|$|E
