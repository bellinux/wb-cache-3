5|$|Demographic {{research}} services <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not differentiate between {{various types of}} non-religious respondents, so agnostics are often classified {{in the same category}} as atheists or other non-religious people.|$|E
5|$|High {{cholesterol}} levels <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not cause any symptoms. Yellow deposits of cholesterol-rich fat {{may be seen}} in various places on the body such as around the eyelids (known as xanthelasma palpebrarum), the outer margin of the iris (known as arcus senilis corneae), and in the tendons of the hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the Achilles tendon (known as a tendon xanthoma).|$|E
50|$|Nearest {{earthquake}} faults {{are more}} than 600 km near Kutch Bhuj and big one more than 1400 km in Himalayan. Karchelia <b>normally</b> <b>does</b> not experience earthquake above 5 Richter scale. Karchelia is about 60 miles from Arabian Sea and <b>normally</b> <b>does</b> not have heavy hurricanes.|$|R

5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional setup time. Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E
5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|Bears of {{northern}} regions, including the American black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A fecal plug is {{formed in the}} colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.|$|E

5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation and experimentation, researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one they <b>normally</b> <b>do,</b> the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E
5|$|The turn-based ground combat uses a {{top-down}} 3D perspective. The player controls a {{squad of}} between one and six human soldiers or robotic units as they hunt the aliens on the map and attempt to complete other objectives dependent on the mission. Map layouts are not randomly generated, but enemy placement is. Fog of war hides the aliens and their actions from view until the player's soldiers are in range and have line of sight on them, and enemies <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not act at all until the squad initially comes within line of sight. Soldiers can carry items and perform special abilities; use of these items and abilities is controlled through a toolbar on the head-up display (HUD). A few examples of abilities include firing on enemies automatically after they emerge, launching explosives, and healing allies.|$|E
25|$|Many {{molecular}} liquids can be supercooled into a glass; {{some are}} excellent glass formers that <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not crystallize.|$|E

25|$|Airpoints members receive Status Points {{for almost}} every Air New Zealand flight, {{as well as}} many other flights with its Star Alliance partners. Status Points enable members to reach a higher status faster. Status Points will still be granted even on {{discount}} fares (such as Smart Saver and grabaseat fares) that <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not earn Airpoints Dollars.|$|E
25|$|Reuse of treated feces in {{agriculture}}—like reuse of excreta {{in agriculture}} in general—can result in increased crop production through fertilizing effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and improved soil fertility through organic carbon. If the dried feces are not reused in agriculture they can instead be buried {{at a minimum}} depth of 25cm in which case they <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not pose a public health risk.|$|E
25|$|The Special Operations Group (SOG) is the {{department}} within SAD responsible for operations that include high-threat military or covert operations {{with which the}} US government {{does not wish to}} be overtly associated. As such, members of the unit (called Paramilitary Operations Officers and Specialized Skills Officers) <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not carry any objects or clothing (e.g., military uniforms) that would associate them with the United States government. If they are compromised during a mission, the United States government may deny all knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Incandescent lamps {{have been}} phased {{out over the}} years. They are {{wasteful}} of energy, producing between 15 and 30 lumens per watt of power (out of a possible 683 lumens per watt for an ideal light source). They can be found many times in older aquarium light hoods. They burn out frequently, put {{off a lot of}} heat, and <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> not have an appropriate spectrum associated with them. Most incandescent lamps can be replaced with commonly available and efficient screw in power compact bulbs.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} {{are equipped with}} GPS, debit/credit card reader, a meter, a roof light and a camera or a partition {{in the same way}} as in the yellow cabs. The meter fares for street hailed trips are the same rate as in the yellow cabs. Boro taxis are still considered a car service, therefore customers can call their bases for pre-arranged trips in the same way that they <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> with other car services. The pre-arranged trips can pick up passengers in the outer boroughs including the airports and northern Manhattan, but are still prohibited from picking up any passengers below East 96th and West 110th streets.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware Valley {{has four}} {{distinct}} seasons with ample precipitation and is {{divided by the}} 0°C (32°F) January isotherm. Most of Philadelphia and the NJ portion, {{almost all of the}} DE and MD portions, part of Delaware County, and extreme southern portions of Bucks and Chester Counties have a humid subtropical climate (Cfa.) The remainder of the Delaware Valley has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa.) Snow amounts may vary widely year-to-year and <b>normally</b> <b>do</b> vary widely within the Delaware Valley. The region has only two ski areas: Bear Creek Ski and Recreation Area in eastern Berks County and Spring Mountain in central Montgomery County.|$|E
