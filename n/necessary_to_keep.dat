5|$|The Air Ministry was unsympathetic to Coastal Command and {{the lack}} of any {{suitable}} place for aerodromes made improvements difficult to implement. OTU airfields required a number of features not available in all locations. The main requirement was a quiet area so that OTU flights would not interfere with stations that were already operational. To prevent losses to enemy air attacks, it was also <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> OTUs as far away from enemy airspace as possible, while the sensitive airspace over convoy routes and near Scapa Flow were also inappropriate places to launch OTUs.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{objected to}} the {{construction}} of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area was lacking, preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs. OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, however, one of {{the neon}} lights in the flame {{structure}} short-circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual fire on the Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle, but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the program active.|$|E

5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the scarcity of water to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> clean with a paucity of water.|$|E
5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conscription}} ran {{contrary to}} British political tradition, but the sheer {{scale of the}} Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The Rhodesia Herald and Bulawayo Chronicle newspapers broadcast the news in special editions. While some settlers supported {{the extension of the}} same system to white Southern Rhodesians, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of John Chilembwe's anticolonial uprising in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt that it was <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s.|$|E
