The A-weighting system is used in any measurement of environmental noise (examples of which include roadway noise, rail noise, aircraft noise).

25|$|Although the A-weighting curve, in {{widespread}} use for <b>noise</b> <b>measurement,</b> {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of spectral content, each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E

40|$|Jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements</b> {{have been}} {{acquired}} at many anechoic jet-facilities around the world. These measurements {{have been used}} to form the basis for prediction schemes and to understand the generation and radiation of jet noise. Often, when jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements</b> from different jet-facilities that are thought to be acquired at or corrected to similar conditions are compared, differences are observed in the spectra. These comparisons are typically performed {{on the basis of the}} same nozzle-exit diameter, jet velocity, microphone distance from the jet flow, and ambient conditions. This phenomenon has spurred much discussion in the aeroacoustics community, with some even claiming that some of the measurements are contaminated with rig-noise. This study investigates following four factors that can be responsible for the differences in jet noise measurements: (1) rig noise contamination, (2) the jet’s Reynolds number, (3) the nozzle-exit boundary layer of the jet, and (4) reflections and shielding from surfaces inside the anechoic jet-facility. First, the Doubling-Diameter Method, a scheme used to detect rig-noise contamination in jet-noise measurements, is verified and used on jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements</b> acquired in the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) Anechoic Jet-Facility to verify the cleanliness of the jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements.</b> Second, the effect of Reynolds number of the jet is investigated qualitatively and quantitatively for its effect on jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements.</b> Third, the effect of the nozzle-exit boundary layer on jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements</b> is categorized qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, a potential correction is developed that can be used to account for the differences in jet <b>noise</b> <b>measurements</b> from jets with different nozzle-exit boundary layer states. Finally, surfaces inside the anechoic chamber itself, such as, the plenum chamber, and a secondary nozzle are investigated as potential reflectors and shields that can cause waviness and modifications in the jet noise spectra, respectively.
