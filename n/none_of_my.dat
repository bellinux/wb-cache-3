500|$|The lyric [...] "Boy, you actin’ so corny like Fritos" [...] {{generated}} {{a positive response}} from both critics and fans alike, with MTV News reporting that fans were [...] "freaking" [...] over it. Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as [...] "hilarious", while Camp likened it {{to a form of}} product placement. Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus, [...] "Close the door/Lose the key/Leave my heart on the mat for me/I was yours eternally/There's an end to infinity" [...] and one of the verses, [...] "Name hold weight like kilos/Boy you actin' so corny like Fritos/Wouldn't have none of that without me, though/Ain't <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business, it's tea though/Outta ammo, gotta reload/If life was a game you're a free throw/It's nothing that you don't already know," [...] noting that the former is [...] "almost sweet" [...] compared to the latter.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

HPB said that the next interpretation of the Ageless Wisdom would be a psychological approach, and , which I published in 1925, is the psychological key to The Secret Doctrine. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> books would have been possible had I not at one time made a very close study of The Secret Doctrine." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Limp Bizkit {{recorded}} The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1), with returning member Wes Borland, but John Otto {{was replaced}} by Sammy Siegler {{for much of the}} album. Following the release of the band's Greatest Hitz album, the band went on hiatus.

2500|$|Regarding {{the general}} notion of {{consistency}} of political positions over time, McCain said in June 2008: [...] "My principles and my practice and my voting record are very clear. Not only from 2000 but 1998 and 1992 and 1986. And you know, it's {{kind of a}} favorite tactical ploy now that opponents use, of saying the person has changed. Look, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> principles or values have changed. Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances? I would hope so! I would hope so!" [...] It is often reported that McCain has grown more conservative throughout his tenure in the Senate, according to various studies.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bell said, in a half-sad and half-complaining tone: [...] "I {{see that}} <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> old friends were over {{to hear me}} speak." [...] "No," [...] said Mr. Brownlow, [...] "we were not present, and did not intend being. We {{did not wish to}} witness the {{spectacle}} of your being surrounded by your enemies, who a few months ago were denouncing you as a traitor. We did not wish to hear these men shouting for you and see you in a such a position." [...] Mr. Brownlow then poured forth a torrent of abuse and denunciation of secession. Mr. Bell made no attempt to defend them, nor indeed to defend his own course.|$|E
2500|$|Although not {{ordered to}} take part, psychiatrists and many {{psychiatric}} institutions {{were involved in}} the planning and carrying out of Aktion T4 at every stage. After protests from the German Catholic and Protestant churches, Hitler ordered the cancellation of the T4 program in August 1941, although the disabled and mentally ill continued to be killed {{until the end of the}} war. The medical community regularly received bodies and body parts for research. Eberhard Karl University received 1,077 bodies from executions between 1933 and 1945. The neuroscientist Julius Hallervorden received 697 brains from one hospital between 1940 and 1944: [...] "I accepted these brains of course. Where they came from and how they came to me was really <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> business." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Record, Carr stated he wanted to entertain the reader, while also staying faithful to the time period. Carr, a historian by training, {{wanted to find a}} form of writing where he could meld his interest in fiction with his knowledge of history. [...] "The one thing I wanted to show was that people back then are a lot more like people today than we realize," [...] said Carr. Carr researched the science and literature of the time period and noted, [...] "The biggest challenge was to study the psychological literature of that day so that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> characters would not know more than they could have known in terms of psychology. We're talking about a time when [...] had just published his first book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson, visiting London {{in early}} October, had {{discussed}} French's replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King. [...] After {{he returned to}} France and conferred with Haig, Haig recorded (diary 24 October) [...] "I ha(ve) been more than loyal to French and {{did my best to}} stop all criticism of him or his methods … I ha(ve) {{come to the conclusion that}} it (i)s not fair to the Empire to retain French in command. [...] Moreover, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John's military ability or military views; in fact they had no confidence in him. [...] Robertson quite agreed and left me saying [...] "he knew how to act, and would report to Stamfordham" [...] ". Robertson thought (24 October) that French's [...] "mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes" [...] and that his ideas were [...] "reckless and impossible" [...] and that he had poor relations with Joffre.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} later, World War I began. At first, Klee was {{somewhat}} detached from it, {{as he wrote}} ironically, [...] "I have long had this war in me. That is why, inwardly, it is <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> concern." [...] Klee was conscripted as a Landsturmsoldat (soldier of the reserve forces in Prussia or Imperial Germany) on 5 March 1916. The deaths of his friends August Macke and Franz Marc in battle began to affect him. Venting his distress, he created several pen and ink lithographs on war themes including Death for the Idea (1915). After finishing the military training course, which began on 11 March 1916, he was committed as a soldier behind the front. Klee moved on 20 August to the aircraft maintenance company in Oberschleissheim, executing skilled manual work, such as restoring aircraft camouflage, and [...] accompanying aircraft transports. On 17 January 1917, he {{was transferred to the}} Royal Bavarian flying school in Gersthofen (which 54 years later became the USASA Field Station Augsburg) to work as a clerk for the treasurer {{until the end of the}} war. This allowed him to stay in a small room outside of the barrack block and continue painting.|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the many}} stunts shot {{there was a}} {{particular}} sequence in which Roshan had to dance using a large transparent ball as a property. The actor {{said that he had}} trained the hardest to practice spin in one of the dance sequence. Roshan said, [...] "I trained for a month. It was not a long piece of dance but there was lot of jazz ballet where I was required to spin as there is a ball in my hand and I am playing with it as well as dancing. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songs up till now have spin because I am very bad at it." [...] The cinematographer of the movie Sudeep Chatterjee was asked to interpret the script completely so that Bhansali could understand his perception too. Praising his director to be very open and cooperative Chatterjee acknowledged in an interview about Bhansali's penchant for closed spaces. He said that his main challenge was to make the scenes look different though the protagonist is locked in a single room. To make these differences the lighting was adjusted such that one sees the room in twilight, at night, during the day, in early morning. The camera was made always mobile to counter Ethan's stillness. Slightly mobile things were deliberately kept always around Ethan like a fluttering curtain, a fish bowl near Ethan's head which according to the cinematographer mocked at his stillness all the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention you would not be in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and things of that sort. That is the hysteria that has been swept up by this committee.” ...|$|E

5000|$|The tune of {{the chorus}} of [...] "Son <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Father" [...] has been used on the {{terraces}} of British football grounds for football chants, for example [...] "Oh Man United, the only English team to win the European Cup", and the anthem for Teddy Sheringham that started with [...] "Oh Teddy, Teddy ...". In the 1970s and 1980s, the synthesizer solo from this song {{was used in the}} Polish public TV as an intro to sport magazines.
