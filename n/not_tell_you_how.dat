60|$|CONJURER. Doctor, {{there are}} about a {{thousand}} reasons why I should <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> I really did that trick. But one will suffice, {{because it is the}} most practical of all.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true the pale-faces are {{the most}} numerous, now; but once they were not. Do <b>not</b> your traditions <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> few the Yangeese were, when they first came across the salt lake?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feared {{this when}} I {{saw he was}} <b>not</b> with <b>you.</b> <b>Tell</b> me <b>how</b> it happened. It {{is not the first}} shrewd blow fate has dealt me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right to {{keep him}} out of the way. Ethel has been {{disposed}} of these ten years. Did <b>not</b> Anne <b>tell</b> <b>you?</b> <b>How</b> foolish of her! But all mothers like to have young men dying for their daughters. Your son is really the handsomest boy in London. Who is that conceited-looking young man in the window? Mr. Pen--what? has your son really been very wicked? I was told he was a sad scapegrace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I need <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> heavily {{this new}} {{responsibility}} presses on me, as I see the islands opening, and at present feel how very difficult {{it must be}} to obtain men to occupy this opening-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My faith, sir," [...] {{said the}} fellow with a shrug, [...] "it might be carrots, and still I could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>How</b> should I know? The house is kept like a garrison, as you perceive." ...|$|E
60|$|As for {{the face}} of the statue, white paper and black ink could <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{beautiful}} it was. When Selim looked at it, it made his heart stand still in his breast, it was so beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that was}} a go, and no mistake, Joe!" [...] Jim Tucker said. [...] "Fancy having to live for six months on seal frizzled over a lamp and raw cabbages! <b>You</b> did <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> us <b>how</b> <b>you</b> did for drink." ...|$|R

60|$|I will <b>not</b> {{attempt to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> {{affected}} and gratified I am by the intelligence your kind letter conveys to me.

6000|$|... "O Periwinkle!" [...] cried Eustace Bright, [...] "there you are wrong, {{and would}} do {{a great deal of}} mischief. Were I Midas, I would make nothing else but just such golden days as these over and over again, all the year throughout. My best {{thoughts}} always come a little too late. Why did <b>not</b> I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> old King Midas came to America, and changed the dusky autumn, such as it is in other countries, into the burnished beauty which it here puts on?

6000|$|... "I am here {{to plead}} the cause of my master," [...] I said. [...] "I need <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> he acts. You know how he is placed.

60|$|Poor Mainwaring! I need <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much I miss him, how perpetually {{he is in}} my thoughts.
