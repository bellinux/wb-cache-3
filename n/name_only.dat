5|$|In 1071, {{the year}} before his grandfather's death, Domnall and an Uí Chennselaig kinsman, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair, battled for control of Leinster. Although Domnall is accorded the title King of Leinster in one mediaeval king-list, Donnchad was evidently a more {{powerful}} claimant, and Domnall appears to have held the Leinster kingship in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E
5|$|Baybars died in July 1277 and was {{succeeded by}} his sons who ruled in <b>name</b> <b>only</b> while Baybars' closest subordinate, Qalawun, acted as strongman. Qalawun usurped the throne in 1279 {{and soon after}} faced a {{rebellion}} by his viceroy in Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar, who was joined by Isa. The Ilkhanids and their Armenian and Georgian allies {{took advantage of the}} intra-Mamluk strife and an invitation by Sunqur to invade Syria, and sacked Aleppo. Isa reprimanded Sunqur for inciting the Muslims' enemies to attack and urged him not to betray Islam in his late age. Isa persuaded Sunqur not to join the Ilkhanids and the latter escaped Qalawun's advancing army. Isa also sought to evade Qalawun's troops and barricaded himself in the desert fortress of al-Rahba. He was replaced by his relative Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr as punishment by Qalawun for supporting Sunqur's revolt. Muhammad's appointment was likely in <b>name</b> <b>only,</b> and in any case, Isa reconciled with Qalawun by 1280, when the sultan received him in Cairo.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{commercial}} failures, Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were more dramatic, albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din, set at a military station in India. Roles as a pilot opposite Jean Arthur and Rita Hayworth in Hawks's Only Angels Have Wings, and a wealthy landowner alongside Carole Lombard in In <b>Name</b> <b>Only</b> followed.|$|E
5|$|Ermac {{appeared}} in two episodes of the 1996 animated series , voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He has a minor {{role in the}} 1997 feature film , {{in which he was}} played by assistant stunt coordinator John Medlen and is identified by <b>name</b> <b>only</b> in the closing credits. Though the script and print media publications such as SciFi Entertainment and Black Belt mentioned his telekinetic powers, they were not seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow” and thought it “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a <b>name,</b> <b>only</b> calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E

5|$|Perdiccas {{initially}} did {{not claim}} power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, {{under the command}} of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed {{following}} {{a meeting at}} the Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883. It was initially called Black Arabs F.C., after the Arabs rugby team and the predominantly black kits in which they played. This <b>name</b> <b>only</b> lasted for the 1883–84 season, and in a bid to draw more fans from the local area the club was renamed Eastville Rovers in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The {{moderate}} Conservatives were Conservatives in <b>name</b> <b>only,</b> and did {{not support}} the saquarema ideology and leadership. During the years following 1857, successive cabinets quickly collapsed, unable to muster a majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the two Conservative wings undercut each other in a fight for dominance. The Emperor asked Caxias to head a new cabinet on 2 March 1861. Among his ministers were José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco), whom Caxias had met and befriended during the Platine War while serving as secretary to Paraná.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative <b>name,</b> <b>only</b> distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
5|$|Wise {{was born}} in 1884 to Sophie Hasel and her husband, farmers in Hardscrabble, a town in Medina County, Ohio. Three {{brothers}} and a sister were also born to the family, although contemporary sources <b>name</b> <b>only</b> one, a brother named Fred. In 1906, Martha Hasel met the substantially older Albert Wise at a box social; the two were married, though Wise neglected {{to give her a}} wedding ring.|$|E
5|$|World of Dance Tour (WOD) {{was founded}} in 2008 by Myron Marten and David Gonzales in Pomona, California. It differs from other {{competitions}} {{because there is no}} final championship. WOD travels to different cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe and holds a competition in each location; therefore, WOD distinguishes itself as a tour. Each tour stop is a stand-alone competition; they are all related to each other in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b> In 2013, WOD will travel to New York City, Vallejo, Seattle, Vancouver, Berlin, Dallas, Toronto, San Diego, Montreal, Eindhoven, Boston, Orlando, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Union City, and Antwerp.|$|E

5|$|After Genghis Khan {{defeated}} the Naimans in 1204, Naiman prince Kuchlug fled his homeland to take refuge among the Qara Khitai. The Gurkhan Yelü Zhilugu welcomed Kuchlug into his empire, and Kuchlug became an advisor and military commander, eventually marrying {{one of the}} daughters of Zhilugu. However, during a war with the bordering Khawarzmian dynasty, Kuchlug initiated a coup d'état against Zhilegu. After Kuchlug took power, he allowed Zhilegu to rule the Qara Khitai in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b> When the Gurkhan died in 1213, Kuchlug took direct control of the khanate. Originally a Nestorian, once among the Khitai Kuchlug converted to Buddhism and began persecuting the Muslim majority, forcing them to convert to either Buddhism or Christianity, a move which alienated Kuchlug {{from most of the}} population. When Kuchlug besieged the Karluk city of Almaliq, the Karluks, vassals of the Mongol Empire, requested aid from Genghis Khan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North of them was the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in <b>name</b> <b>only,</b> having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August 1944, the vast {{majority}} of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions—the Panzer Lehr and 9th SS—now existed in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b> The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates for the number of German soldiers captured in the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000, although some estimates put total German losses (killed and captured) in the Pocket as high as 200,000.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{affection for}} Mary, Henry was deeply {{disappointed}} that his marriage had produced no sons. By the time Mary {{was nine years}} old, {{it was apparent that}} Henry and Catherine would have no more children, leaving Henry without a legitimate male heir. In 1525, Henry sent Mary to the border of Wales to preside, presumably in <b>name</b> <b>only,</b> over the Council of Wales and the Marches. She was given her own court based at Ludlow Castle and many of the royal prerogatives normally reserved for the Prince of Wales. Vives and others called her the Princess of Wales, although she was never technically invested with the title. She appears to have spent three years in the Welsh Marches, making regular visits to her father's court, before returning permanently to the home counties around London in mid-1528.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ramesses XI in 1078BC, Smendes assumed {{authority}} over {{the northern part of}} Egypt, ruling from the city of Tanis. The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in <b>name</b> <b>only.</b> During this time, Berber tribes from what was later to be called Libya had been settling in the western delta, and the chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy. Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945BC, founding the Libyan Berber, or Bubastite, dynasty that ruled for some 200 years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in <b>name</b> <b>only,</b> and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E
