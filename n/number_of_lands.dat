5|$|As {{a reward}} for his service, Warenne was given custody of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> confiscated from Prince John, {{including}} the Honour of Gloucester, which Warenne administered for the royal government from 1194 to 1196 during the captivity of King Richard I. He also received as a further mark of royal favour the wardships of various minor heirs. In 1194 Warenne was given custody of the heir of Hugh de Chandos, in return for which he gave the king 40 marks. Warenne's career was closely tied to Hubert Walter's, who promoted {{his career as a}} justice. Besides his royal service, Walter employed Warenne as a justice on ecclesiastical matters and sent him in 1194 to York to deal with complaints by the cathedral chapter of York Minster against their archbishop, Geoffrey. A sign of further ties between the two was that Warenne served as a witness on Walter's charters founding a monastery at West Dereham.|$|E

The rights included the keeping of Berwick Castle, which {{had not been in}} Scottish hands since 1482. Fast Castle had been a possession of Coldingham Priory, but after 1598 the lands of the Priory were annexed to the crown, and so Logan now held Fastcastle and Flemington directly from the crown. On 5 April 1603, James VI of Scotland raised the status of the Restalrig estate into a free barony, which gave Robert extra jurisdictions over his tenants.|$|E
5000|$|Barrel: Made of 416R {{stainless}} steel. The bore twist is 1-turn-in-11.25 inches mm and the rifling is five radial {{lands and}} grooves (5-R) with a right-hand (RH) twist. Because of the odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands,</b> {{none of the}} lands are 180° apart, i.e. in direct opposition. This results in less bullet deformation, which (at least in theory) produces more consistent point of impact. In 5-R rifling, the [...] "side" [...] {{of the land is}} cut at a 65° angle, rather than 90° in conventional rifling. This results in less barrel fouling, and more consistent point of impact, compared to conventional rifling when relatively high numbers of rounds are fired between cleaning, as might be expected in military applications.|$|E

Twenty years after the Reformation, on 22 April 1581 James VI granted the income from a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands</b> to Glasgow town for the kirk's upkeep. He traced the ownership of these lands to money left by Archbishop Gavin Dunbar as a legacy for repairing the cathedral. The town council agreed on 27 February 1583 to take responsibility for repairing the kirk, while recording they had no obligation to do so. The church survives because of this resolution. Inside, the rood screen is also a very rare survivor in Scottish churches.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of each Major Power move, the {{controlling}} player must choose an impulse type. This represents that Major Power's current allocation of resources and planning. The possible choices are: Land impulse, Naval impulse, Air impulse, Combined impulse, and Pass impulse. Choosing a Land impulse will allow the player to move any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> units, some air units and no naval units. Correspondingly, a Naval impulse will allow the movement <b>of</b> any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> naval units, some air units and no land units. The Air impulse allows the movement <b>of</b> any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> air units, but no other moves. A Combined impulse allows a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> air and naval movements, and restricts the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> attacks that can be performed. The exact <b>number</b> <b>of</b> movements allowed depends on the Major Power and reflects its overall size and organization. Larger and more powerful Major Powers like the U.S. have more moves available in each category than, for instance, Italy. The Pass impulse allows no moves or attack. If two or more Major Powers choose this option, the chance for ending the turn increases.|$|R

5000|$|Much {{is known}} about Thutmosis [...] "the warrior", {{not only because of}} his {{military}} achievements, but also because of his royal scribe and army commander, Thanuny, who wrote about his conquests and reign. The prime reason why Thutmosis was able to conquer such a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>lands,</b> is because of the revolution and improvement in army weapons. When the Hyksos invaded and took over Egypt with more advanced weapons such as horse-drawn chariots, the people of Egypt learned to use these weapons. He encountered only little resistance from neighbouring kingdoms, allowing him to expand his realm of influence easily. His army also had carried boats on dry land.

Household farmer survey method was performed to conduct this research. Farming model chosen in this research was partial and average aggregate.   Cobb-Douglas function were chosen to predict functional relationship. Result stated from this research were : 1) goat farming has a significant contribution in integrated farming system, 2) integrated farming  (goat and paddy, goat and fish, and goat, fish and paddy) in Banyumas district was economically efficient.   3) partially, factor affecting production level in goat farming was <b>number</b> <b>of</b> goat owned (P< 0. 01), factor affecting paddy production were urea application and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> owned (P< 0. 01), TSP application (P< 0. 05) and man power (P< 0. 10).   Furthermore, factor affecting fish farming were feed, breed and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> owned (P< 0. 01); 4) aggregately, factor affecting integrated farming I were urea application and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> owned (P< 0. 01), feed and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> owned (P< 0. 01), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> goat owned (P< 0. 10) integrated farming II, where as in integrated farming III were <b>number</b> <b>of</b> paddy <b>land</b> area and breed (P< 0. 01) also <b>number</b> <b>of</b> goat owned (P< 0. 10); 5) integrated farming III (goat, paddy and fish farming) gave the highest profit, which gave Rp 6. 219. 283, 81 with relatively high efficiency.
