40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} <b>neotectonic</b> {{activities in the}} region of the Rio Paraiba do Sul Shear Zone, an importantgeotectonic feature adjacent to the central segment of the Continental Rift of Southeastern Brazil, and contiguous areas. The methodology used in this work is based on the integration of morphostratigraphic and structural data analysis. Theanalysis of the fault/striae pairs observed in Cenozoic sediments and weathered basement rocks was highlighted in order tocharacterize <b>neotectonic</b> stress fields. The relationship among the different fracturing patterns, geologic units affected bythese events and overlapping patterns of striae on a same fault plain lead to the characterization of three <b>neotectonic</b> stageswhich could be correlated to the <b>neotectonic</b> events described for the Southeastern Brazil: E-W left-lateral transcurrentstage (Miocene); E-W right-lateral transcurrent stage (Pleistocene/Holocene); and NW-SE extensional stage (Holocene). These <b>neotectonic</b> stages have a strong relationship with the reactivation of the preexisting structural anisotropies...|$|R
30|$|<b>Neotectonic</b> {{movement}} {{refers to}} the tectonic movement that has happened since the Cenozoic, which is the latest movement. It has the most important influence on the basins in west China, especially on the hydrocarbon accumulation in the western foreland basins. We determined the time of <b>neotectonic</b> movement in the Kuqa Foreland Basin, which began from the Neogene, and analyzed the patterns of movement, which were continuous and fast subsidence in the vertical direction and intense lateral compression. The structure styles are that the faulting is weakened and the folding is strengthened gradually from north to south. We studied the control of <b>neotectonic</b> movement on the hydrocarbon accumulation process and model in the Kuqa Foreland Basin with basin simulation technique. The largest subsidence rate of the Kuqa Foreland Basin reached 1, 200 m/Ma during the <b>neotectonic</b> movement, leading to rapid maturing of source rock within 5 Ma and a large quantity of hydrocarbon being generated and expelled. The thick <b>neotectonic</b> strata can form high quality reservoirs with the proved gas and oil reserves accounting for 5 % and 27 % of the total reserves, respectively. 86 % of the structural traps were formed in the <b>neotectonic</b> movement period. The faults formed during the <b>neotectonic</b> movement serve as important migration pathways and they exist in the region where the hydrocarbon reservoirs are distributed. Abnormally high pressure caused by the intense lateral compression, thick <b>neotectonic</b> strata deposition and rapid hydrocarbon generation provide driving force for hydrocarbon migration. The accumulation elements match each other well over a short period, leading to many large gas fields formed later in the Kuqa Foreland Basin.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} assess possible <b>neotectonic</b> {{influence in the}} formation of sandization in southwest ofRio Grande do Sul. The main objective of this research is to identify points of <b>neotectonic</b> “anomalies” insegments of drainage and make the relationship with the points of occurrences of sandization. Theidentification of these points of failure was obtained through DEM (Digital Elevation Model) as subproductof the SRTM image. The analysis was undertaken based on the employment index RDE (Relationshipslope-extension) applied in segments of drainage. The drainages were scanned images from shaded withdifferent contrasts, SRTM products.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of <b>neotectonic</b> activity is of high priority {{when dealing with}} inaccessible regions where a lack of data and a limited knowledge of the tectonic activity is often typical. There are various individual analyses that investigate features associated with <b>neotectonic</b> activity (for example geoinformatics, geophysical methods and field surveys). However, none of these methods combine low cost techniques based on geospatial and geophysical technologies with field validation of the outcomes. This study offers a methodology that covers all aforementioned approaches for detecting zones of <b>neotectonic</b> activity, linking computer-based observations with actual field observations and geophysical measurements. The combination of satellite imagery and DEM analysis can provide a cost-effective alternative to satellite radar interferometric analysis (InSar) and differential GPS monitoring. Crete is a complex, tectonically active region: an ideal “natural laboratory” to assess the interaction between <b>neotectonic</b> processes and geomorphological processes in landscape evolution and to test the effectiveness of geomorphometric methods for determining zones of <b>neotectonic</b> activity. Geoinformatic and geomorphometric techniques have been used here to assess landscape evolution in tectonically active zones. The results provide new information {{about the influence of}} tectonic and erosional processes on geomorphological evolution, with specific insights into the interactions between <b>neotectonic</b> deformation, faulting and drainage networks. Geomorphic indices have been used here to evaluate <b>neotectonic</b> behaviour at regional and local scales, identifying uplifted blocks, valley-floor tilting and zones of relatively intense <b>neotectonic</b> activity. Landsat ETM+ imagery and DEMs were used to discriminate lithological boundaries and identify lineaments. Field and VLF geophysical surveys verified that the lineaments coincide with faults. The GIS based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was considered as a strong approach to integrate the various factors associated with tectonic activity and to highlight, spatially, the potential zones undergoing active tectonic control.

40|$|Earthquakes and {{vertical}} land movements inferred from geodetic levelling results {{demonstrate that the}} Netherlands is situated on a tectonically active part of the Earth's surface. Tectonic subsidence analyses of the sedimentary records in the basins {{and the history of}} tectonic uplift inferred from Meuse river terraces show that the current tectonic activity is part of a deformation phase which began in the late Early Miocene, which we take as the start of the <b>neotectonic</b> period. The <b>neotectonic</b> faulting mode is normal-slip. This is in accordance with the present-day orientation of the maximum horizontal stress, and the vertical orientation of the maximum stress. However, the <b>neotectonic</b> fault zones are reactivated Variscan or older wrench faults. These faults have been reactivated repeatedly during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic in normal and wrenching modes, and therefore represent fundamental crustal weakness zones. As a result, the surficial <b>neotectonic</b> fault pattern resembles the inherited wrenching fault pattern, although the faulting mode is normal-slip. This is illustrated for the area where normal faults have displaced the Meuse fluvial terrace system in the southeastern part of the Netherlands. The <b>neotectonic</b> vertical motions in and around the Roer Valley Rift System have affected the courses of the Rhine and Meuse rivers from Pliocene times until the present. In addition, a fluvial terrace staircase developed along the Meuse river in response to the uplift of the Ardennes-Rhenish Massif and its foreland, for example near Maastricht. Furthermore, small fault scarps are present along segments of the bounding fault zones of the Roer Valley Graben: the Peel Boundary Fault Zone and the Feldbiss Fault Zone. In other parts of the Netherlands the <b>neotectonic</b> vertical motions have no direct expression in the morphology. Examples of possible indirect control on the morphology in these areas occur in glacial landscapes, the Zuiderzee Basin and the coastal zone. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
