5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
