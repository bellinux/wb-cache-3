2500|$|When Halvorssen was in prison, {{officials}} in Miami distanced the DEA from Halvorssen {{and stated that}} his drug information was considered unreliable. The head of that office {{at the time was}} Tom V. Cash. [...] Cash, ultimately was involved in covering up the fraud of convicted criminal Allen Stanford of Stanford Bank and had to resign in disgrace from his job at Kroll Associates for both protecting Stanford's reputation and for investigating U.S. Senate investigators rooting out corruption[...] [...] One of those investigated by Cash was Jonathan Winer of the office of John Kerry. [...] Winer had worked closely with Halvorssen in the 1990s. [...] Kroll, coincidentally, is also the firm that was hired by the banks Halvorssen had been investigating for money laundering: Banco Latino. When Halvorssen was in prison, Tom V. Cash had stated that Halvorssen had [...] "unusual ties to and knowledge of drug traffickers"; the DEA said it [...] "refused to deal with him, citing as reasons 'duplicity and manipulation.'" [...] Halvorssen denied working with Florida agencies, and human rights advocates who knew him said that, considering his involvement in the fight against <b>narcotrafficking,</b> the accusations were not unexpected. Meanwhile, Senate investigators like Jonathan Winer and the New York District Attorney continued to stand by Halvorssen. Another critic of Halvorssen was opinion columnist Manuel Malaver, who published a weekly opinion column in Venezuelan media, in his book La DEA contra la Guardia Nacional de Venezuela claims that Halvorssen was part of parallel underworld of rogue police officers that became involved in a conspiracy to destabilize the government of Ramón J. Velásquez in association with a group of powerful adversaries against the possible presidency of Rafael Caldera or Andrés Velásquez. Presidential elections were scheduled in December 1993 after the impeachment of President Perez in May 1993. Halvorssen publicly responded to Malaver in a 3,500 word point-by-point rebuttal. Halvorssen referred to Malaver as acting in bad faith, malicious, and violating journalistic ethics: [...] "Lamentable, shameful, and cowardly." [...] Malaver's accusations, in his book, contain opinions and provide no statements of fact about the accusations he makes against Halvorssen.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades, with an {{increased}} rhythm and greater intensity, the so-called neoliberal violence has come to play a relevant role within the history of world societies. The Latin American institutional, political, social, and economic changes of the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, especially those produced under dictatorships, contributed to create the conditions {{for the implementation of}} the processes of economic liberalization and global market as part of the concept of institutional modernization and cultural globalization that gave rise to the neoliberal mentality. In this context, neoliberalism becomes hegemonic as a mode of discourse and is incorporated into the way individuals interpret, live in, and understand the world. Its incorporation into world societies has motivated changes in the division of labor, changes in social relations, the dismantling of welfare necessities, increase in technology, and differentiation in the ways of life and thought, but more importantly, it has motivated the rise of new forms of contemporary violence which develop and nurture themselves from the political and economic opportunities that neoliberalism creates. This work will present a theoretical approach of the theme of neoliberalism and will concentrate its study on literary and cinematic representations of the theme of <b>narcotraffic</b> and the relation migration-feminicides as new forms of contemporary neoliberal violence in the context of Latin America with special interest in Mexico and Colombia. In this sense, the work of authors such as David Harvey, Hermann Herlinghaus, Ileana Rodriguez, Jean Franco, and others; will contribute to the analysis of the theme of violence in this study in ways that will support how violence has been used historically as a tool to perpetuate relationships of domination. Also, the literary and cinematic representations of the theme of neoliberal violence will be analyzed in the works of Fernando Vallejo (La virgen de los sicarios), Jorge Franco (Rosario Tijeras), Roberto Bolaño (2666), Orfa Alarcón (Perra Brava), Juan Pablo Villalobos (Fiesta en la madriguera), and Yuri Herrera (Los trabajos del reino) are analyzed in this work.
