5|$|On 23 March 1989, the MND {{revealed}} {{plans in}} Parliament {{to build a}} new <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> and four new branches in Yishun, Tampines, Hougang and Woodlands. This announcement generated extensive discussion in the ensuing months on the potential of a new <b>National</b> <b>Library.</b> On 17 March 1990, the Ministry of Community Development confirmed in Parliament that the new <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> would be sited at the former Raffles Girls' School site in Queen Street. A library consultant was appointed the following month to advise on the planning of the new building.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> at Victoria Street was {{completed}} on July 2005. In {{memory of the}} old <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> building, about 5,000 red bricks were salvaged from the old Library and used to construct a commemorative wall in a bamboo garden located within the new building.|$|E

50|$|Bibliographies {{differ from}} library catalogs by {{including}} only relevant items rather than all items {{present in a}} particular library. However, the catalogs of some <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> effectively serve as national bibliographies, as the <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> own almost all their countries' publications.|$|R

5|$|Designed {{and built}} by the Public Works Department, the new red-bricked {{building}} was officially opened and christened as the <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> on 12 November 1960 by the President of Singapore, Yusof bin Ishak. The architecture was said to reflect the red-brick epoch of British architecture in the 1950s. Hedwig Anuar was appointed the first Singaporean Director of the <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> in April 1960 and served until June 1961. Aside from its extensive English collection, the library also made Chinese, Malay and Tamil books available for loan. Occupying a total floor area of 10,242 square metres, the library included reading sections for adults and children, a microfilm unit and a lecture hall.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work was carried out to investigate the roles of <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> generally in developing countries and the consequent building requirements. Since the work involves studies of current trends and problems in planning or designing <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> and their services in the developing regions (South Asia, South-east Asia, South-west Asia, Africa, Latin America and. Oceania), background information {{on some of the}} countries in these regions, as well as information on the library services in general and the <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> in particular, are given. For the purpose of this work, eleven functions which seemed to be important in influencing the design of <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> were chosen for the questionnaire sent to the <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> of the various regions: and these are tabled in this work. Concern for library architecture is a new phenomenon in developing countries. There is a lack of trained and skilled building technicians, a lack of experienced librarians and architects in the field, and a lack of research on building materials. Apart from these, there are various other socio-economic, climatic (e. g. monsoons, prevailing winds such as tornadoes and harmattan) and nonclimatic (e. g. earthquakes) problems which have been studied. In order to overcome these problems more efficiently, and bearing in mind the functions of <b>national</b> <b>libraries,</b> principles of building requirements for <b>national</b> <b>libraries</b> are proposed. These principles are intended as a guide to architects without imposing any restrictions to individuality of design...|$|R

5|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> of Somalia was {{established}} in 1975, and came under {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Education, Culture and Higher Education. In 1983, it held approximately 7,000 books, {{little in the way of}} historical and cultural archival material, and was open to the general public. The <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> later closed down in the 1990s. In June 2013, the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies organized a shipment of 22,000 books from the United States to Somalia as part of an initiative to restock the library. In December of the year, the Somali authorities officially launched a major project to rebuild the <b>National</b> <b>Library.</b> With Zainab Hassan serving as Director, the $1 million federal government funded initiative will see a new library complex built in the capital within six months. In preparation for the relaunch, 60,000 additional books from other Arab League states are expected to arrive.|$|E
5|$|The Old <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the <b>National</b> <b>Library</b> {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge groundswell of public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city. The controversy surrounding the building's demise has been credited for sparking greater awareness of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans.|$|E
