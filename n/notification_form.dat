40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} {{patterns}} and legal requirements of methylphenidate consumption. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional {{study of the}} data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> and balance lists of drugs sales – psychoactive and others – subject to special control in the fifth largest city of Brazil, in 2006. We determined the defined and prescribed daily doses, the average prescription and dispensation periods, and the regional sales distribution in the municipality. In addition, we estimated the costs of drug acquisition and analyzed the individual drug consumption profile using the Lorenz curve. RESULTS The balance lists data covered all notified sales of the drug while data from prescription <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> covered 50. 6 % of the pharmacies that sold it, including those with the highest sales volumes. Total methylphenidate consumption was 0. 37 DDD/ 1, 000 inhabitants/day. Sales were concentrated in more developed areas, and regular-release tablets were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical formulation. In some regions of the city, approximately 20. 0 % of the prescriptions and dispensation exceeded 30 mg/day and 30 days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Methylphenidate was widely consumed in the municipality and mainly in the most developed areas. Of note, the consumption of formulations with the higher abuse risk was the most predominant. Both its prescription and dispensation contrasted with current pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and legal requirements. Therefore, the commercialization of methylphenidate should be monitored more closely, and its use {{in the treatment of}} behavioral changes of psychological disorders needs to be discussed in detail, in line with the concepts of the quality use of medicines...|$|R

A Strategic Environmental Permitting Plan was released in August 2007, followed by a Phase 1 Alternatives Analysis Report in April 2008 which narrowed 65 options (including unlikely modes like heavy rail metro and monorail) to five plausible alternatives including Attleboro, Stoughton, and Middleboro routes plus express bus service or a mixture of Attleboro and Middleboro service.

5000|$|The South End is {{not only}} residential, it is also commercial. Since it is located where there was access to railroads and port {{facilities}} it attracted a lot of manufacturers. Albany Street, which is along the Roxbury Canal, became occupied by warehouses and factories. By the 19th century, it {{became the center of}} Boston's furniture and piano-making industry. Today, the South End has many new developments that will add not only residential space, but also commercial space. According to the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) there is a new project being constructed that will be built on Albany Street. According to the Expanded Project <b>Notification</b> <b>Form</b> this new development will [...] "include two hotels: a 16-story select service hotel, which will have a restaurant on its first floor; and a 9-story extended-stay hotel. The hotels together will have approximately 408 rooms. While the split between the two types of hotels has not been finally determined, current plans anticipate approximately 210 rooms in the select service hotel and approximately 198 rooms in the extended-stay hotel. The select-service hotel will include an approximately 4,000 square-foot (approximately 267-seat) restaurant on its first floor. A 3-level, above-ground parking garage with approximately 137 parking spaces will serve both hotels."

40|$|Effective {{discharge}} planning {{is important to}} ensuring a high quality of patient care and operational efficiency. The general internal medicine (GIM) environment is very complex and fluid, with multiple health professions providing care for patients. This makes coordination of discharges difficult, even with structured daily interprofessional rounds. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> that predicts next-day discharges. The main measures of the study, {{which took place in}} GIM wards at two academic teaching hospitals, were the completion and accuracy of the discharge forms, length of stay, discharge times, post-discharge admissions, and emergency department visits. Seventy-six of 200 patients studied had information completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form.</b> The overall effect appeared to move discharges earlier in the day, while having no effect on length of stay. Patients whose information was completed on the discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> were less likely to have an emergency department visit within 30 days post-discharge. The use of a discharge <b>notification</b> <b>form</b> appears to move discharges earlier in the day, without increasing length of stay.

40|$|International audienceMeningococcal {{meningitis}} {{remains a}} periodical {{threat in the}} African meningitis belt. The countries concerned, such as Burkina Faso, provided guidelines for its surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention during outbreaks. The objective {{of this study is}} to assess the quality of the surveillance system and case management during an outbreak in Fada N'Gourma district. A retrospective study of the meningitis outbreak in 2007 was conducted by literature review and interviews of health caretakers across 27 health centers (CSPS) and three units in the regional hospital in the district. We reported all data available about surveillance and case management, and then we compared it with the guidelines of the Ministry of Health. The case definition and <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available in all centers and units. During the outbreak, 861 cases were recorded, but only 89 % was notified at the upper level and 87 % of <b>notification</b> <b>forms</b> were available. The age is marked on all the forms, while the interval between the onset of symptoms and consultation is noted only in 90. 7 %. The forms were distributed weekly at the district level. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram coloration was performed for a limited number of cases (150 / 349 samples, 42. 9 %); it showed Gram-negative diplococcus in 86 %. Culture was performed for a limited number of patients (7 cases). According to the results of a central level laboratory study, the outbreak was due to Group A Neisseria meningitidis. The case management guidelines were available in all the centers and units which were supervised during the outbreak. Anti-biotherapy was appropriate in 93. 6 % of the cases. A shortage of antibiotics (free prepositioning) was observed in 7 centers (23. 3 %). The mortality rate was 3. 5 %. This assessment shows an under-notification of cases, despite the existence of a surveillance system and supervision, a weak laboratory contribution in germ identification, appropriate case management, and shortage of antibiotics during the outbreak. Management of a meningitis outbreak may become more efficient by improving the notification, the laboratory's capabilities, and the availability of drugs...|$|R

METHOD An epidemiological, prospective, observational study conducted in a public hospital in southern Brazil {{for the period of}} one year (August 2013 to August 2014). Sepsis <b>notification</b> <b>forms,</b> medical records and data of the cost sector were used for the collection of clinical and epidemiological data. RESULTS The sample comprised 95 patients, resulting in a total high cost of hospitalization (R$ 3, 692, 421. 00), and an average of R$ 38, 867. 60 per patient. Over half of the total value of the treatment of sepsis (R$ 2, 215, 773. 50) was assigned to patients who progressed to death (59. 0 %). The higher costs were related to discharge, diagnosis of severe sepsis, the pulmonary focus of infection and the age group of up to 59 years. CONCLUSION The high cost of the treatment of sepsis justifies investments in training actions and institution of protocols that can direct preventive actions, and optimize diagnosis and treatment in infected and septic patients...|$|R
