Nonetheless, it is worthwhile investigating the possibility of using these byproducts as energy source and evaluating their value as a fuel. However, storing such residues presents several problems connected with spontaneous microbial degradation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the storage effects on chipped biomass deriving from the crown and stem wood of poplar and how they affect fuel quality and dry matter losses. A storage trial was carried out with three piles of stem wood chips and three of crown chips coming from a 15 year old poplar plantation.

Demand for woodfuel in the form of firewood and charcoal is continuously increasing in this region, and it is therefore necessary to devise and sustain feasible production methods bearing in mind the influence of native intelligence, indigenous/traditional knowledge and/or users’ perspectives on their success. In line with this, a survey was carried out by administering questionnaire to 240 respondents in 8 rural communities of Akinyele and Ido Local Government Areas of Oyo State, Nigeria, where the predominant type of agroforestry system practiced is that of scattered trees in croplands, to elicit information on wood species used as fuelwood and preferred by the respondents for incorporation into or retention in most agroforestry plots, out of which 179 (i. e. 75 % {{of the total number of}} questionnaires administered) were successfully retrieved for statistical analyses. Twelve woody species were selected on the basis of respondents’ preference and prioritization. The mean specific gravity (SG) and <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> (NCV) of the species were found to range between 0. 42 - 0. 84 g · cm- 3 and 14. 65 - 21. 88 MJkg- 1 respectively.

The <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the original and demineralized Beypazari lignite was measured as 3663. 4 J/g and 7435. 7 J/g, respectively. In order to determine the experimental conditions for the most efficient results in terms of the highest <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the lignite with plausible wt % metal loading and decarboxylation temperature after metal treatment, a set of experiments was carried out...|$|R
40|$|Empty fruit bunches (EFB) has {{not been}} {{utilized}} optimally. EFB {{can be used as}} source of solid fuel in the form of briquettes. The <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the EFB is 18. 200, 975 kJ / kg. The <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> can be increased by carbonization process that is followed by densification process. Carbonization process aims to minimize the elements forming of the smoke, so the exhaust gas can be cleaner. Densification Process aims to increase the density and simplify the handling process. The <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the combustion products can be enhanced by adding the filler. Crude glycerol is used as the filler, because it has a the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of 25. 175, 98 kJ / kg which aims to improve the <b>calorific</b> <b>value.</b> The purpose of this research is to utilize EFB and wasting crude glycerol as a source of solid fuel, to learn how is the effect of crude glycerol, particle size, and compression pressure, to determine the influence of <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and compressive strength of the briquettes produced. EFB Densification uses a hydraulic press in operating conditions of particle sizes (60, 80, and 100 mesh), the composition of the filler (60 : 40, 70 : 30 and 80 : 20) and a pressing pressure (100. 110, and 120 bar). Responses were analyzed, namely the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and compressive strength by using Response Surface Methodology. The Best <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> is obtained by 28. 999, 4 kJ / kg at 80 mesh particle size, composition filler 53 : 47, and the pressing pressure of 110 bar. While the best compressive strength value is 9, 5316 kg / cm 2 at 100 mesh particle size, composition filler 60 : 40, and the pressing pressure of 120 bar. Process conditions is very influence significantly on the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and compressive strength is the composition of the filler and the pressing pressure...|$|R
