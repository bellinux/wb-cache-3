5000|$|Parties {{must either}} pass the threshold, 2% of the <b>national</b> <b>vote,</b> or gain a {{district}} seat to gain any supplemental seats. Though very rare, {{it is possible}} for a party to gain a district seat without getting 2% of the <b>national</b> <b>vote.</b> There is also an esoteric third rule that allows a party to be represented, if it has enough votes in two of the three areas that the country is divided into. No party has ever fulfilled this rule without getting 2% of the <b>national</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, black plaintiffs {{who had lived}} in the city prior to the {{annexation}} claimed a violation of the <b>National</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act of 1965. The claim was that their voting power had been deliberately diminished by the attempts of city leaders to add white voters and dilute to black vote. The pre-annexation population of the city as of 1970 was 202,359, of which 104,207 or 52% were black citizens. The annexation added to the city 47,262 people, of whom 1,557 were black and 45,705 were non-black. The post-annexation population of the city was therefore 249,621, of which 105,764 or 42% were black. The plaintiffs prevailed in court by creation of a ward system which guaranteed black voters would be represented fairly in city government.|$|E
25|$|Although the McGovern {{campaign}} {{believed that}} its candidate {{had a better}} chance of defeating Nixon because of the new Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution that lowered the <b>national</b> <b>voting</b> age to 18 from 21, the plan backfired when most of the youth vote went to Nixon. This was the first election in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every single Southern state, continuing the region’s transformation from a Democratic bastion into a Republican one as Arkansas was carried by a Republican presidential candidate {{for the first time in}} a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried by a Republican in either the previous election or the one in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956). As a result of this election, Massachusetts was the only state that Nixon did not carry in any of his three presidential campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Secretary Land led {{the charge}} to {{consolidate}} Michigan’s elections, which saved money, reduced confusion, and helped eliminate ‘stealth elections’. Staying ahead of the work required by the Help America Vote Act, Land also selected a single style voting machine to be implemented statewide with funding from the federal government. In 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A New York Times investigation found that 33,000 people {{were removed from the}} rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The New York Times pointed out that “the problems were not unique to Michigan, and that states with Republican and Democratic election officials had struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.” In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the <b>national</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office told the Detroit Free Press that, “If you're eligible to vote, {{you will be able to}} cast a vote on Election Day". Furthermore, Land spearheaded several outreach initiatives that increased voter participation, including touring all university campuses to offer registration opportunities, which caused unprecedented voter turnout rates in 2004, 2006, and 2008.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to conducting voter registration drives, ACORN {{has worked to}} remove systemic obstacles to voter registration. In 2006, it brought a lawsuit {{in federal court in}} Ohio against the Ohio Secretary of State, at that time Ken Blackwell, and the Director of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. ACORN alleged that, during the period that included the 2004 United States election voting controversies, the defendants had committed multiple violations of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The district court dismissed the case, but that decision was reversed in 2008 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. After extensive fact discovery in 2009, the parties agreed to a settlement, under which the defendants agreed to implement several measures to facilitate registration of low-income voters to bring the state into compliance with the <b>National</b> <b>Voting</b> Rights Act. The Dayton Daily News characterized the settlement as [...] "accepting the thrust of [...] complaint." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Boivin {{played a}} key role in the {{ratification}} of the 26th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which lowered the <b>national</b> <b>voting</b> age to 18. [...] This occurred during a period when Governor McCall was out of the state and the president of the senate, John D. Burns, was acting governor. [...] As president pro tempore of the senate, Boivin presided over the senate when Burns was acting governor. [...] Boivin and Burns were both conservative Democrats who allied themselves with the Republican minority to control the senate. [...] However, in the case of the 26th Amendment, Burns had been holding the ratification bill in committee while Boivin wanted it brought before the full senate for a vote. [...] When Burns became acting governor, Boivin took advantage of his position as presiding officer in the senate to appoint two new members to the committee considering the amendment. [...] Both of the new members favored the amendment, and with their help the resolution was reported out of committee. [...] When Burns returned to the senate, he refused to allow a vote on the bill. [...] This prompted 14 Democratic senators to walk out of the assembly, leaving the body without a quorum. [...] Burns directed the Oregon State Police to find the missing senators and bring them back to the capitol. [...] Over the course of the next three days, telephone negotiations resulted in a deal to allow the senate to vote on the amendment. [...] Oregon ratified the 26th Amendment on July 1, 1971, thanks in large part to Boivin’s committee stacking maneuver.|$|E
