5|$|There {{have been}} police {{stations}} in the town since 1857, when the first Police Station was rented. It had three cells and a petty session courtroom. A <b>new</b> <b>police</b> station was built in 1974, which underwent a major refurbishment in 2011, to become a police force hub for Mid Devon, with 72 staff members. The town acquired its first steam driven fire engine in 1914 which cost £100 and was paid for by voluntary subscription.|$|E
5|$|There {{was further}} {{violence}} in the build-up to the 1985 election, with ZAPU supporters facing harassment from ZANU-PF Youth Brigades. Despite this intimidation, ZAPU won all 15 of the parliamentary seats in Matabeleland. Mugabe then appointed Nkala as the <b>new</b> <b>police</b> minister. Nkala subsequently detained over 100 ZAPU officials, including five of its MPs and the Mayor of Bulawayo, banned the party from holding rallies or meetings, closed all of their offices, and dissolved all of the district councils that they controlled. To avoid further violence, in December 1987 Nkomo signed a Unity Accord in which ZAPU was officially disbanded and its leadership merged into ZANU-PF. The merger {{between the two parties}} left ZANU-PF with 99 of the 100 seats in parliament, and established Zimbabwe as a de facto one-party state.|$|E

40|$|The central {{goal of this}} Article is to {{describe}} the burgeoning turn to <b>new</b> <b>policing</b> techniques in the business crime context and to offer some initial thoughts on the promises and limits of the approach. Part II begins by explaining the traditional or “old policing” of business crime. After implementing an initial strategy that focused on pursuing individuals, the government turned its attention to the organizations where those individuals operated. It increased the sanctions for violators and sought to target companies {{in an effort to}} prompt them to adopt internal compliance pro-grams. The focus on company compliance programs was designed to change corporate culture, sharing with the broken windows theory a focus on norms. This policy did not, however, stop enormous corporate frauds or the economic meltdown that occurred in 2007 and 2008 that many believe depended on illegal activities. In response to these failures, Part III argues, the United States is embarking on a <b>new</b> era in <b>policing</b> business crime that, like the <b>new</b> <b>policing</b> of street crime, aims to be more proactive. And like its street crime counterpart, business crime policing is pursuing different approaches. Finally, Part IV explores how the <b>new</b> <b>policing</b> techniques in the business crime context are likely to play out, given that business crime is different from street crime in fundamental ways. Part IV further explains what those differences mean for the ultimate success of the <b>new</b> <b>policing</b> paradigm. Part V concludes...|$|R

5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power within the military junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and <b>new</b> <b>police</b> powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E
5|$|In June, the {{conflict}} escalated {{in the region}} of Banovina, which had been declared a part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina (SAO Krajina) by that time. Three municipalities in the region—Dvor, Glina and Hrvatska Kostajnica—had predominantly Serb populations, although all of them were inhabited by a substantial number of non-Serbs as well. On 24 June, the Sisak police administration set up a <b>new</b> <b>police</b> station in the village of Kozibrod in the Una River valley, along the Dvor–Hrvatska Kostajnica road. It was manned by two platoons of police and ZNG troops drawn from the Sisak company of the 2nd Guards Brigade. The new station drew a strong reaction from the SAO Krajina authorities, who issued an ultimatum on the same day the police station was set up, demanded its removal and threatened to remove it by force unless Croatia complied with their ultimatum.|$|E

40|$|From the 1990 s onwards, the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Police</b> {{followed}} a global trend of progressively {{becoming involved in}} overseas peacekeeping and development deployments that over time changed from operational interventions to deployments that were more developmental in nature. While development concepts within these <b>New</b> Zealand <b>Police</b> development interventions have been committed to in principal, {{there has been little}} or no research undertaken as to how <b>New</b> Zealand <b>police</b> perceive and undertake their roles within these interventions. Using a post-development framework this research explores how these development interventions and the subsequent expectations for the role of the <b>New</b> Zealand <b>police</b> officer during development interventions overseas were created. A survey and interviews were conducted with a small number of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>police</b> officers who have deployed within these interventions to identify their perceptions of development practice so as to compare with the expectations of the development programmes. My research predominantly finds that <b>New</b> Zealand <b>police</b> officers place a high value on their prior <b>New</b> Zealand <b>policing</b> experiences. In implementing development programmes there was an overwhelming recognition by the research participants for the need to form positive relationships by listening and acknowledging another’s culture. This recognition of the benefits of positive working relationships has led this research to conclude that a recognition {{of the importance of the}} personal agency of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>police</b> officers could contribute to recognise and support the personal agency of their development partner to achieve realistic and desirable development outcomes for the intended beneficiary, provided programme design is constructed to incorporate this approach...|$|R
