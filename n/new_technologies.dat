5|$|Many {{programming}} {{languages are}} already widely accepted and understood. However, {{the desire to}} create radically different programming languages to support the aspect-oriented programming paradigm is not significant due to business-related concerns; there are risks associated with adopting <b>new</b> <b>technologies.</b> Use of an entirely new language relies on a business's ability to acquire new developers. Additionally, the existing code base of a business {{would need to be}} discarded. Finally, a business would need to acquire a new toolchain (suite of tools) for development, which is often both an expense in both money and time. Primary concerns about roadmaps for the adoption of <b>new</b> <b>technologies</b> tend to be the need to train new developers and adapt existing processes to the new technology.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the incentives}} to adopt cost-reducing technology by firms in a horizontally differentiated industry. In our model {{there are several}} suppliers of a <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> The extent of the cost reduction depends {{on the quality of}} the <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> A firm has to buy the technology in a 'scoring auction'. This means that both the price and the quality (which affects marginal cost of production) of this <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> are no longer given but depend on the equilibrium outcome in the 'scoring auction'. We show that the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand) has no effect on the equilibrium decision of the firms to adopt the <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> when the quality of the <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> offered by the suppliers lies in the interior of the feasible range of qualities. In this case, both firms adopt <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> However, when there is a corner solution, then it is possible to have equilibria where only one firm (or no firm) adopts the <b>new</b> <b>technology.</b> With corner solution the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand) makes a difference to the equilibrium outcomes...|$|R
