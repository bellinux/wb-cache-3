50|$|Ethylene glycol dinitrate (EGDN,NGc), {{also known}} as <b>nitroglycol,</b> is a {{chemical}} compound a colorless, oily explosive liquid obtained by nitrating ethylene glycol. It is similar to nitroglycerin in both manufacture and properties, though it is more volatile and less viscous.|$|E
5000|$|Gelignite (...) , {{also known}} as {{blasting}} gelatin or simply jelly, is an explosive material consisting of collodion-cotton (a type of nitrocellulose or gun cotton) dissolved in either nitroglycerine or <b>nitroglycol</b> and mixed with wood pulp and saltpetre (sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate).|$|E
5000|$|Home Workshop Explosives details how the {{underground}} chemist can easily manufacture explosives. It describes manufacture of nitroglycerin {{as well as}} syntheses for RDX, ammonium nitrate, acetone peroxide blasting caps, <b>nitroglycol,</b> mannitol hexanitrate or nitromannitol, and PETN. It also has {{information on how to}} purify glycerin, how to synthesize nitric acid with minimal equipment, and how to make a fuel-air explosive (commonly known as an FAE). One reviewer of Home Workshop Explosives (David Harber, author of Guerrilla's Arsenal) notes that although the chemistry is solid, the chapter on detonation systems [...] "borders on insanity." ...|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Wastewater samples originating from an explosives production plant (3, 000 mg N l − 1 nitrate, 4. 8 mg l − 1 nitroglycerin, 1. 9 mg l − 1 <b>nitroglycol</b> and 1, 200 mg l − 1 chemical oxygen demand) {{were subjected to}} biological purification. An attempt to completely remove nitrate and to decrease the chemical oxygen demand was carried out under anaerobic conditions. A soil isolated microbial consortium capable of biodegrading various organic compounds and reduce nitrate to atmospheric nitrogen under anaerobic conditions was used.

40|$|Wastewater samples {{originating}} from an explosives production plant (3, 000  mg N l− 1 nitrate, 4. 8  mg l− 1 nitroglycerin, 1. 9  mg l− 1 <b>nitroglycol</b> and 1, 200  mg l− 1 chemical oxygen demand) {{were subjected to}} biological purification. An attempt to completely remove nitrate and to decrease the chemical oxygen demand was carried out under anaerobic conditions. A soil isolated microbial consortium capable of biodegrading various organic compounds and reduce nitrate to atmospheric nitrogen under anaerobic conditions was used. Complete removal of nitrates with simultaneous elimination of nitroglycerin and ethylene glycol dinitrate (<b>nitroglycol)</b> was achieved {{as a result of}} the conducted research. Specific nitrate reduction rate was estimated at 12. 3  mg N g− 1 VSS h− 1. Toxicity of wastewater samples during the denitrification process was studied by measuring the activity of dehydrogenases in the activated sludge. Mutagenicity was determined by employing the Ames test. The maximum mutagenic activity did not exceed 0. 5. The obtained results suggest that the studied wastewater samples did not exhibit mutagenic properties...|$|E
40|$|Several reports {{during the}} last few years have {{described}} chest pain and sudden death in workers exposed to <b>nitroglycol</b> in combination with nitroglycerine. A report is given here of nine persons suffering from chest pain (including one sudden death) after exposure to nitroglycerine alone. The pains occurred between 30 and 65 hours after termination of the exposure. The differential diagnosis from angina pectoris is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{instability}} of spent acids from nitration units {{has caused a}} great deal of severe accidents in the explosives industry. To cope with this hazard, safety charts have been constructed by various authors. In this work, evaluation of the three most commonly used safety charts found in the literature showed that they are not, in general, consistent with each other, due to different storing temperatures considered. Simulation of these experimental data was accomplished, based on simple reaction kinetics models. By using these models the existing safety charts were investigated and explained properly. In addition, the validated chemical reaction kinetics models can be used to predict the safety performance of both nitroglycerine and <b>nitroglycol</b> spent acids at temperatures in the range 20 - 70 degrees C...|$|E
