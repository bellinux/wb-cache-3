5|$|Every year Reading {{hosts the}} Reading Festival, {{which has been}} running since 1971. The festival takes place on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the August bank holiday weekend and is the largest {{of its kind in}} the UK aside from the Glastonbury Festival. For some twenty years until 2006, Reading was also known for its WOMAD Festival until it moved to Charlton Park in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The Reading Beer Festival was first held in 1994 and has <b>now</b> <b>grown</b> to one of the largest beer festivals in the UK. It is held at King's Meadow for the five days {{immediately}} preceding the May Day bank holiday every year. Reading also holds Reading Pride, an annual LGBTA festival in Kings Meadow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has <b>now</b> <b>grown</b> into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding areas is now 60–70 animals.|$|E

5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats {{four of the}} Space Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has <b>now</b> <b>grown</b> to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy given to her by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes. If the player rescues the Dachora and the Etecoons—the creatures Samus encountered earlier in the game—during the escape, they are shown leaving the planet in the distance.|$|E
5|$|The period did {{lead to some}} {{reform of}} {{internal}} Society statutes, such as in 1823 and 1831. The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report, along {{with a copy of}} the total income and expenditure of the Society. These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting, with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing. This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions, where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before. As with the other reforms, this helped ensure that Fellows had a chance to vet and properly consider candidates. The Society's financial troubles were finally resolved in 1850, when a government grant-in-aid of £1,000 a year was accepted. This was increased to £4,000 in 1876, with the Society officially acting merely as the trustee for these funds, doling them out to individual scientists. This grant has <b>now</b> <b>grown</b> to over £47million, some £37million of which is to support around 370 fellowships and professorships.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{the modern}} Evolutionists {{have made no}} real use {{of the idea of}} evolution, {{especially}} in the matter of social prediction. They always fall into what is (from their logical point of view) the error of supposing that evolution knows what it is doing. They predict the State of the future as a fruit rounded and polished. But the whole point of evolution (the only point there is in it) is that no State will ever be rounded and polished, because it will always contain some organs that outlived their use, and some that have not yet fully found theirs. If we wish to prophesy what will happen, we must imagine things <b>now</b> moderate <b>grown</b> enormous; things <b>now</b> local <b>grown</b> universal; things <b>now</b> promising <b>grown</b> triumphant; primroses bigger than sunflowers, and sparrows stalking about like flamingoes.|$|R
