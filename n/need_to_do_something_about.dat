50|$|The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this {{discovery}} was the initiator of the ITD Movement.

The first step was taken. In March 2012, Denny JA published his collection of poetic essays entitled Atas Nama Cinta, or In the Name of Love. These were stories of discrimination in different guises, based on ethnicity, religion or religious understanding, gender and sexual oriententation.|$|E

5000|$|In {{her essay}} [...] "A Press of our Own: Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press", founder Barbara Smith {{describes}} {{the beginnings of}} the press this way: [...] "In October 1980, Audre Lorde said to me during a phone conversation, 'We really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> publishing.'" [...] In an interview with Joseph F. Beam in Blacklight Magazine, Lorde spoke to the need to [...] "develop those structures (like Kitchen Table) that will present and circulate our culture." [...] As a result of Lorde's suggestion, Smith assembled a group for a meeting on Halloween weekend in Boston, the home city of the press in its first year. In 1981, Smith relocated the press to New York City.

50|$|Her novels, {{taken from}} her {{experiences}} and travels around Australia, were written for children and young adults; however, they expressed many themes that have gained more prominence in today's world - such as the fragility and beauty {{of the environment and}} indigenous areas and the need for their conservation, the effect of ecological damage, the plight of refugees and societies disaffected and the human cost of resource development. As examples, Echo in the Wilderness, set on Lake Pedder on the eve of its destruction, chronicles the submergence and obliteration of the lake. Her 1983 book, I Will Not Say the Day Is Done (her only non-fiction/adult book) brought to life the struggle to save Lake Pedder. She was passionately consumed by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> environmental vandalism in Tasmania. Her book Isle of the Sea Horse, released in 1969, grew out of her concern about the ecological devastation to the Great Barrier Reef and, among other concerns, the plight of refugees. Her Longtime trilogy was set in, and inspired by her upbringing in, the Blue Mountains.|$|E
5000|$|Casting Crowns' frontman, Mark Hall wrote [...] "Jesus, Friend of Sinners" [...] {{to address}} {{the idea that the}} world knows those who follow the Christian faith more for what they oppose than what they support; he stated that the song is a [...] "reminder that we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that". He also commented that, despite the use of [...] "strong words" [...] in the song to grab attention, the true focus of the song is the chorus, which calls the church to be more aware of the world and to let their hearts be [...] "led by mercy". While Hall noted the song was [...] "one of the more direct songs Crowns have written", he said that [...] "it also speaks truth. And I think believers should speak truth to each other as long as we do it in love". Additionally, Hall noted that the band isn't simply criticizing others within the church with the song; he commented the first verse of the song speaks about himself.|$|E

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter agreed with Gilligan, and noted that several events that the show had been building up to in past episodes finally came to fruition. On his blog, George R. R. Martin, the creator of the book series A Song of Ice and Fire (which was adapted to the critically acclaimed TV series Game of Thrones), called both the series and the episode [...] "amazing" [...] and noted that [...] "Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros", adding further [...] "I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that". Drusilla Moorhouse, an online contributor to The Today Shows website, remarked how [...] "nothing could compare to Walts cruelty" [...] when he revealed to Jesse the truth about his involvement in Janes death, and described the episode as the destruction of Walts family; however, she also noted Walts selflessness when he [...] "rewrote the history of Skylers complicity" [...] by making the phone call, and when he placed Holly in a fire truck to be safely returned home.|$|E

50|$|Naturally, Timoleon {{turns his}} {{attention}} to his daughter as his last hope. When he is informed {{in the spring of}} 1975 that Sofia has seen her gynaecologist and he listens to a taped telephone conversation between her and Forster in which she informs her lover that she is pregnant, he feels the urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> this uncalled for situation before it is too late. Intending to persuade Sofia to have an abortion right during her stay on the island, he has one of the many guest rooms of his villa converted into an operating theatre, hires Dr Patrikios and a nurse to perform the operation, and, to her great surprise, sends Sofia an invitation to a lavish birthday party in honour of her 25th birthday. On the day of the party, he arranges a private talk with Ian Forster during which he threateningly explains to him that he will be allowed to publish anything about his life on condition that he can persuade Sofia to have an abortion and that he subsequently vanish from her life forever. When Forster cautiously broaches the subject to Sofia, she realises how little her love for him is reciprocated. She tells Forster that she has never been pregnant, that she only wanted to put his loyalty to the test, and that he has failed that test as far as she is concerned. Then she breaks off their relationship and retires to her room while the party is still in full swing. There, having inherited her mother's melancholy disposition, Sofia swallows an overdose of pills. She survives her suicide attempt because on the following day she is rescued by Dr Patrikios and the nurse.|$|E
5000|$|In March, 1982, local {{residents}} formed {{a group called}} Citizens for Constitutional Cities to oppose the Ranch development. (Hortsch, Dan 18 Mar 1982 [...] "Fearing 'religious cities' group forms to monitor activities of commune" [...] The Oregonian p. D28.) An initiative petition was filed which would order the governor to contain, control and remove' the threat of invasion by an 'alien cult. In 1985, another state petition, supported by several Oregon legislators, was filed to invalidate {{the charter of the}} City of Rajneeshpuram.In July 1985, the venue of a civil trial was moved because studies offered by the Foundation showed bias. The judge stated that [...] "community attitudes would not permit a fair and impartial trial".The Oregon legislature passed several bills seeking to slow or stop the development and the City of Rajneeshpuram, including HB 3080 which stopped distribution of revenue sharing funds [...] "for any city whose legal status had been challenged. Rajneeshpuram was the only city impacted by the legislation."Oregon Gov. Vic Atiyah stated in 1982 that since their neighbours did not like them, they should leave Oregon. A representative of the community responded [...] "all {{you have to do is}} insert the word Negro or Jew or Catholic…and it is a little easier to understand how that statement sounded." [...] In May 1982, US Senator Mark Hatfield called the INS in Portland. An INS memo stated that the Senator was [...] "very concerned" [...] about this [...] "religious cult" [...] is [...] "endangering the way of life for a small agricultural town…and is a threat to public safety". Such actions [...] "often do have influence on immigration decisions". Charles Turner, the US Attorney responsible for the prosecution of the immigration case against Rajneesh, said, after Rajneesh left the US his deportation was effective because it [...] "caused the destruction of the entire movement".In January 1989, INS Commissioner Charles Nelson acknowledged that there had been [...] "a lot of interest" [...] in the immigration investigation from both the Oregon Senators, the [...] "White House and the Justice Department".

Mr. Turner later acknowledged, [...] "we were using the legal process to solve…a political problem."A noted legal expert on new religion reported, as to press coverage generally, that the commune was the [...] "focus of a huge outpouring of media attention, virtually all negative in tone". The Oregonian, by far the dominant newspaper in the state, ran a full page ad in 1987 which stated that the Oregonian [...] "contributed to the demise of the Rajneesh commune in Oregon and the banishment of Bhagwan".An Oregon State University professor of religious studies stated that the [...] "hysteria…erodes freedom, and presents a much more serious threat than Rajneeshism, which he viewed as an emerging religion". Mr. Richardson further found that [...] "this plethora of legal action also shows the immense power of governmental entities to deal effectively with unpopular religious groups." [...] (id. p. 483.) He concludes his study: [...] "Given the record…, Oregon new religions have been on trial, and usually they have lost."In 1983 the Oregon Attorney General filed a lawsuit seeking to declare the City void because of an alleged violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Court found that the City property was owned and controlled by the Foundation, and entered judgment for the State. The court disregarded the controlling US constitutional cases requiring that a violation be redressed by the [...] "least intrusive means" [...] necessary to correct the violation, which it had earlier cited. The City was forced to [...] "acquiesce" [...] in the decision, as part of a settlement of Rajneesh's immigration case.|$|E

The principle of SD is now widely discussed throughout the world and it is critical that planners respond. One of the best known advocates for SD states that, &dquo;We desperately need a planning system that puts the environment on a level playing field&dquo; (Pearce 1991, 288). Sustainable development is a term that is now widely used, but its meaning is obtuse. Different interest groups have different interpretations either through ignorance, bias, or design. Perhaps its vagueness is why the term has been so acceptable (Redclift 1991, 36). Some skeptics even say that SD is an oxymoron (Rogers 1993, 21).
