A hunting party led by the Cherokee chief Slave Catcher met the Timberlake expedition {{near the mouth of}} the Little Tennessee River, and supplied the weary expedition with provisions of [...] "dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn." [...] The following day, Slave Catcher guided the expedition by canoe up the Little Tennessee, although the Timberlake party struggled to keep up. Timberlake recalled, [...] "my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when we set out the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> was scarce able to handle a pole."

At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as [...] "I Care" [...] and [...] "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write and record [...] "I Miss You" [...] at MSR, saying to Complex, [...] " [...] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> asked him to fly to New York and work on my record." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the release}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a {{relatively}} unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, {{it was noted that}} Ocean had become the [...] "go-to vocal hook man." [...] The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". Singer Beyoncé Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write [...] "I Miss You" [...] for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; [...] "Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> asked him to fly to New York and work on my record.|$|E

2500|$|Regardless of {{who decided}} on the title, Lennon {{immediately}} {{made up his mind}} that he would compose the movie's title track. He dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning. [...] As he described in his 1980 Playboy interview, [...] "the <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> brought in the song … 'cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side – who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine … in the early period I'm dominating the group … The reason Paul sang on 'A Hard Day's Night' (in the bridge) is because I couldn't reach the notes."
