5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and <b>no</b> <b>pictures</b> published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced {{to respond to the}} growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted to little more than an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E

500|$|What's Cooking? was {{generally}} poorly received by video game critics, receiving a 49% aggregated score on Metacritic. IGN's Daemon Hatfield called disguising a cooking tutorial as {{a video game}} a [...] "pretty brilliant idea", but {{only as long as}} it was done well. He stated that both the cookbook and food preparation halves of the game were not strong enough to make the game worth purchasing. Hatfield commented that the game's controls are [...] "terribly unintuitive, and the cookbook doesn't offer anything its physical counterpart can't for cheaper". [...] He was also disappointed that there were <b>no</b> <b>pictures</b> to illustrate each step, and not every cooking process is explained. Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson was satisfied with the number of recipes available, most of which were [...] "pretty easy to follow". Gibson, however, preferred to see instructional videos to observe how a recipe was made before making it.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle [...] {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as early as 1886, {{it was not until}} 1901 Potter began elaborating it while on holiday at Lingholm west of Derwentwater where she met young Kathleen and Lucie Carr, daughters of the local vicar. In 1902, it was put to paper. The Carr family lived at Skelghyl, but Potter took some artistic liberty and moved the house's location to Little Town in the text. The family came to tea at Lingholm often with Potter delighted by the one-year-child's behaviour. On one occasion, Lucie left her gloves behind at Lingholm, and Potter transformed the incident into the fictional Lucie's propensity for losing her pocket handkerchiefs. A small copy book contains what {{is believed to be the}} earliest manuscript of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle. Its title page is inscribed: [...] "Made at Lingholm, Sept. 01 told to cousin Stephanie at Melford Nov. 01—written down Nov. 02.

500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were <b>no</b> <b>pictures.</b> They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E

2500|$|While all current Bahá'í Houses of Worship have a dome, {{they are}} not {{regarded}} as {{an essential part of}} their architecture.

To date all the Houses of Worship built or planned have a single, undivided room under their dome. Furthermore, in all seven, the seats in the auditorium face the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh in 'Akká, Israel. While each of the Houses of Worship is unique, the designs, through the selection of materials, landscaping and architecture, reflect the indigenous cultural, social and environmental elements of their location, {{to a greater or lesser}} degree.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was {{to examine the effects of}} frequency of picture presentation on young children's learning to read. The subjects were 132 children whose average age was 5 : 7. 0 n the basis of the age, the male-to-female ratio, and the number of hiragana and katakana letters they could read, they were assigned to one of the following six groups: high familiarity words - <b>no</b> <b>picture</b> presentation, high familiarity words - picture presentation twice, high familiarity words - picture presentation eight times, low familiarity words - <b>no</b> <b>picture</b> presentation, low familiarity words - picture presentation twice, and low familiarity words - picture presentation eight times. Each subject was taught to read two artificial words (four artificial scripts) for eight trials by a study-test method. For the scripts in the words the performance in the <b>no</b> <b>picture</b> groups and picture presentation twice groups was better than that in the picture presentation eight times groups. For the scripts in the words there was no significant difference between the <b>no</b> <b>picture</b> presentation groups and picture presentation twice groups, but for the scripts in the words with low familiarity the performance in the picture presentation twice groups was better than that in other groups. The finding suggests that pictures have a facilitating effects on learning to read words with low familiarity...|$|R

She follows it down a rabbit hole, but suddenly falls {{a long way to}} a curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes. She finds a small key to a door too small for her to fit through, but through it she sees an attractive garden. She then discovers a bottle on a table labelled [...] "DRINK ME", the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key, which she has left on the table. She eats a cake with [...] "EAT ME" [...] written on it in currants as the chapter closes.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{persecution}} of Christians under the Roman Empire, Christian art was necessarily furtive and ambiguous, and there was hostility to idols in a group still with a large component of members with Jewish origins, surrounded by, and polemicising against, sophisticated pagan images of gods. [...] Irenaeus (d. c.202), Clement of Alexandria (d. 215), Lactantius (ca. 240 – ca. 320) and Eusebius of Caesarea (d. ca. 339) disapproved of portrayals in images of Jesus. The 36th canon of the non-ecumenical Synod of Elvira in 306 AD reads, 'It has been decreed that <b>no</b> <b>pictures</b> be had in the churches, and that which is worshipped or adored be not painted on the walls', which has been interpreted by Calvin and other Protestants as an interdiction of the making of images of Christ. The issue remained the subject of controversy {{until the end of}} the 4th century.|$|E
2500|$|At least 13 fires {{have been}} {{reported}} on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868. The largest river fire in 1952 caused over $1 million in damage to boats, a bridge, and a riverfront office building. On June 22, 1969, a river fire {{captured the attention of}} Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that [...] "oozes rather than flows" [...] and in which a person [...] "does not drown but decays". The fire did eventually spark major changes as well as the article from Time, but in the immediate aftermath very little attention was given to the incident and it was not considered a major news story in the Cleveland media. Furthermore, the conflagration that sparked Times outrage was in June 1969, but the pictures they displayed on the cover and as part of the article were from the much more dangerous and costly 1952 fire. <b>No</b> <b>pictures</b> of the 1969 fire are known to exist, as local media did not arrive on the scene until after the fire was under control. The 1969 fire caused approximately $50,000 in damage, mostly to an adjacent railroad bridge.|$|E

2500|$|He played {{music at}} clubs in Montana solo {{and with a}} four-piece combo called the Night Hawks during the time he lived in Montana. [...] His break came when [...] Chet Atkins at RCA Victor heard a {{demonstration}} tape and got Pride a contract. In 1966, he released his first RCA Victor single, [...] "The Snakes Crawl at Night". [...] Nashville manager and agent Jack D. Johnson signed Pride. Atkins was the longtime producer at RCA Victor who had made stars out of country singers such as Jim Reeves, Skeeter Davis, and others. Pride was signed to RCA Victor in 1965. [...] "The Snakes Crawl at Night" [...] did not chart. On the records of this song submitted to radio stations for airplay, the singer was listed as [...] "Country Charley Pride". At this time, country music was a white medium. Jack made sure that <b>no</b> <b>pictures</b> of Charley were distributed {{for the first two}} years of his career, to avoid the effects of Jim Crowism. [...] Pride disputes that the omission of a photo was deliberate; he stated that getting promoters to bring in a black country singer was a bigger problem: [...] "people didn’t care if I was pink. RCA signed me... they knew I was colored...They decided to put the record out and let it speak for itself.” [...] While living in Montana, he continued to sing at local clubs, and in Great Falls had an additional boost to his career when he befriended local businessman Louis Allen “Al” Donohue, who owned radio stations including KMON, the first stations to play Pride's records in Montana.|$|E
