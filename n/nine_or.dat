5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} has <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> more subspecies which {{breed in}} different parts of its range in temperate Eurasia. This species is found in woodlands of all kinds, but where it overlaps with the short-toed treecreeper in western Europe it {{is more likely to be}} found in coniferous forests or at higher altitudes. It nests in tree crevices or behind bark flakes, and favours introduced giant sequoia as nest sites where they are available. The female typically lays five or six pink-speckled white eggs in the lined nest, but eggs and chicks are vulnerable to attack by woodpeckers and mammals, including squirrels.|$|E

Mac Suzuki, Micheal Nakamura, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. The system does not work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as Alex Cabrera, who moved to NPB.|$|E

5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. <b>Nine,</b> <b>or</b> possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve with guns and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state {{without access to}} food and water for <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E

5|$|Béla's and Agnes-Anna's first child, Emeric, {{was born}} in 1174. Emeric's sister, Margaret, who was renamed Maria in Constantinople, {{was born in}} 1175. At the age of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten, she was given in {{marriage}} to the Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos, who was about 30 the time. Maria's husband died in 1204, before the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade. Margaret–Maria married {{one of the leaders}} of the Crusade, Boniface of Montferrat, who seized Thessaloniki after the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Historian Makk writes that in about 1210, Maria married Nicholas I of Saint Omer after the death of Boniface, but scholar Peter Lock says that Saint Omer's wife and Margaret–Maria were not identical.|$|E
5|$|Incubation {{has been}} {{recorded}} as averaging around 17 days. Like all passerines, the chicks are altricial; they are born blind and naked, and start to develop down on their heads on day two. Their eyes open around day six, and they begin developing their primary flight feathers around day <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten. For {{the first three days}} after hatching, the mother feeds the nestlings alone, with food brought to her by the father. The father feeds them directly from the fourth day onwards, with the mother brooding them afterwards until day seven. Flies, butterflies, moths, caterpillars and beetles predominate in the food fed to the young birds. Flame robins fed a higher proportion of flying insects to their young at Nimmitabel than did scarlet robins, which may have been due to their later start to breeding. Both parents participate in removing faecal sacs from the nest. Parents have been observed feeding young up to five weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
5|$|James II's son, aged <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten, became king as James III, and {{his widow}} Mary of Gueldres acted as regent until her own death three years later. The Boyd family, led by Robert, Lord Boyd, {{emerged as the}} leading force in the government, making {{themselves}} unpopular through self-aggrandisement, with Lord Robert's son Thomas being made Earl of Arran and marrying the king's sister, Mary. While Robert and Thomas {{were out of the}} country in 1469 the king asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd family. His foreign policy included a rapprochement with England, with his eldest son, the future James IV, being betrothed to Cecily of York, the daughter of Edward IV of England, a change of policy that was immensely unpopular at home.|$|E

5|$|Kỳ {{specifically}} said <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten {{other officers}} should be dismissed for {{involvement in the}} coup, but refused to identify who he had in mind. Some observers accused Kỳ and Thi of deliberately orchestrating or allowing the plot to develop before putting it down in order to embarrass Khánh and allow themselves to gain prominence and prestige on the political stage. In later years, Cao Huy Thuan, a professor and Buddhist activist based in the northern town of Da Nang, claimed that during a meeting with Kỳ and Thi {{a few days before}} the coup, the officers had discussed their plans for overthrowing Khánh. Another conspiracy claim was propagated by General Trần Văn Đôn, who conjectured that Khánh had tried to provoke or bait rival generals, such as Khiêm, into revolting against him so he could defeat and remove them from the scene, thereby strengthening himself and boosting his political image.|$|E
5|$|Lennie {{started on}} the family's player piano {{at the age of}} two or three. He had {{classical}} piano lessons when he was eight, but indicated later that they had hindered, rather than helped, his development. He was born with weak eyesight, possibly as a consequence of his mother being affected by the 1918–19 flu pandemic during pregnancy. A bout of measles when aged six may have exacerbated his condition, and by the age of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten he was totally blind as a result of glaucoma. He initially went to standard state schools, but attended the Illinois School for the Blind in Jacksonville for a decade from around 1928. During his school days he played several instruments, including saxophones, trumpet, guitar, and drums. At the age of eleven he had his first gigs, playing clarinet in a brothel.|$|E
5|$|Nadanian {{was born}} on 19 September 1972 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, which then {{was part of the}} Soviet Union, to Sergei and Irina, both hairdressers. He was taught to play chess by his father when he was seven. His early coach was Rafael Sarkisov, who took him on as a pupil at Spartak in Baku. In his article The Voiceless Old Man Nadanian recollects, that when he was <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> ten there were almost no chess tournaments in which young players could play with seniors and {{therefore}} he often went to the park near his house to play chess with older chess lovers. He remembers that in one of these park-battles he played against a mysterious, silent stranger {{who turned out to be}} the highly respected chess champion Vladimir Makogonov. In 1986 and 1987 Nadanian won the under-sixteen Azerbaijani championship. With the beginning of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1988, his family was forced to leave Baku and flee to Armenia.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska {{was heavily}} {{favored to win}} the contest, as the point spread favored Nebraska by 16 points to 17 points. Heading into the Orange Bowl, the two teams {{presented}} a study in contrasts. The Cornhuskers boasted a string of 28 seasons with <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> more victories, received 28 straight bowl bids, spent 256 consecutive weeks ranked in the AP poll, and had recorded 214 straight sellouts in their 75,000-capacity home stadium. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, had a bowl streak dating back just three years, to the 1993 Independence Bowl, and while the game was Nebraska's 16th Orange Bowl, it was Virginia Tech's first. Nebraska and Virginia Tech were among the winningest seven teams in Division I-A college football during the two seasons prior to the Orange Bowl. Virginia Tech had 20 wins in those two seasons, while Nebraska had 22 victories.|$|E
5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark is an apex {{predator}} that mostly hunts low in {{the water}} column. It has a varied diet, consisting mainly of bony and cartilaginous fishes and also including crustaceans, molluscs, sea snakes, and cetaceans. This species gives birth to live young, with the developing embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Litters of three to thirteen pups are born after a gestation period of <b>nine</b> <b>or</b> twelve months. Young sharks spend their {{first few years of}} life in sheltered inshore habitats such as bays, where their movements follow tidal and seasonal patterns. The pigeye shark's size and dentition make it potentially dangerous, though it has not been known to attack humans. The shark is infrequently caught in shark nets protecting beaches and by fisheries, which use it for meat and fins. The IUCN presently lacks adequate data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
