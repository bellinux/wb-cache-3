40|$|Abstract—Fireworks {{algorithm}} {{is a novel}} swarm intelligence algorithm for solving optimization problems- the latest version-s include the adaptive fireworks algorithm and the dynamic fireworks algorithm. However, the mutation operator in the former algorithm was ineffective, whereas there was <b>no</b> mutation <b>operator</b> <b>available</b> in the latter algorithm. In this paper, a mu-tation operator is proposed, dubbed as the covariance mutation (CM) operator. The CM operator utilizes the information of the sparks with better fitness values to generate potential sparks for finding the optima of functions with higher possibility. Therefore, we proposed the fireworks algorithm with covariance mutation (FWACM) and compared it with the most advanced fireworks algorithms. The experimental results show that FWACM is a significant improvement for fireworks algorithms. I...|$|R
50|$|Finally, Human-based genetic {{algorithm}} (HBGA) encourages human participation in multiple different roles. Humans {{are not limited}} to the role of evaluator or some other predefined role, but can choose to perform a more diverse set of tasks. In particular, they can contribute their innovative solutions into the evolutionary process, make incremental changes to existing solutions, and perform intelligent recombination. In short, HBGA allows humans to participate in all operations of a typical {{genetic algorithm}}. As a result of this, HBGA can process solutions for which there are <b>no</b> computational innovation <b>operators</b> <b>available,</b> for example, natural languages. Thus, HBGA obviated the need for a fixed representational scheme that was a limiting factor of both standard and interactive EC. These algorithms can also be viewed as novel forms of social organization coordinated by a computer (Kosorukoff and Goldberg, 2002).|$|R
50|$|The group retreats {{though they}} are forced to {{initially}} go back to retrieve their equipment. The group splits up into teams to search for a way out, but to no avail. During the search Thelma reflects on what is happening and wonders if the disappearance of the astronauts is connected. Maurine stumbles upon a group of aliens who kill her and Burt who tries to save her. Roy hurts his ankle and is forced to sit and rest. Cliff opts to go and locate Burt and Maurine while the others rest. Thelma telepathically warns Cliff of a nearby alien after their radio goes dead, though Cliff is killed by the alien. Thelma and the others find Cliff who is actually an alien in disguise. Thelma uses her abilities to explode the imposter's head revealing the alien. The alien attacks the other member of the group while Thelma and Roy outrun the alien and escape the caves. On their way back to the city, they discover a police car, but no police officers are in sight. They stop at the roadside café again, but no one is there. Roy tries to call for help on a payphone, but <b>no</b> <b>operator</b> is <b>available.</b> They get back into the car and continue to drive to the city.|$|R
40|$|The optimal size of {{a transit}} {{operating}} workforce is based on determining the appropriate amount of overtime requested of the workforce. Overtime is typically used to fill in for absent <b>operators</b> if <b>no</b> extra <b>operators</b> are <b>available</b> {{to do the work}} on regular time. Relying more heavily on overtime has two risks. First <b>no</b> <b>operator</b> may be willing and available to work overtime when it is needed, resulting in missed service and hence poor service quality. Second operators may be absent more, knowing that they can readily obtain overtime work at asignificant wage premium to replace lost regular wages. This paper examines these interrelationships between overtime, absence, and service reliability which are critical to overall workforce planning. In order to study the relationship between overtime and absence, a disaggregate model of absence is developed as a dynamic form of motivated behavior, a problem in time allocation across activities. The model is used to test the hypothesis that widespread availability of overtime may induce absence. Panel data of surface transit operators from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) were used with the tobit model. The results suggest that absence is more a habit than the result of a decision process based on past overtime worked. The relationship between overtime and reliability is studied using aggregate data from the MBTA bus system. The results show a strong linear relationship which makes it possible to include reliability constraints in the strategic problem by setting an upper limit on the amount of overtime that can be planned for that period. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Security {{protocol}} {{design is}} a creative discipline where the solution space {{depends on the}} problem to be solved and the cryptographic <b>operators</b> <b>available.</b> In this paper, we examine the general question of when two agents can create a shared secret. Namely, given an equational theory describing the cryptographic <b>operators</b> <b>available,</b> is there a protocol that allows the agents to establish a shared secret? We examine this question in several settings. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for secret establish-ment using subterm convergent theories. This directly yields a decision procedure for this problem. As a consequence, we obtain impossibility results for symmetric encryption and signature schemes. Second, we use algebraic methods to prove impossibility results for two important theories that are not subterm convergent: XOR and abelian groups. Finally, we develop a general combination result that enables modular impossibility proofs. For example, the results for symmetric encryption and XOR can be combined to obtain impossibility for the joint theory. I...|$|R
