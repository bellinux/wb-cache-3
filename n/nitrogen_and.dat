40|$|Field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate the <b>nitrogen</b> efficiency <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> response under no <b>nitrogen</b> application <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> application conditions. The differences of grain yield, nitrogen absorption amount, <b>nitrogen</b> response <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> use efficiency among 16 winter varieties of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) were systematically studied and the contribution of <b>nitrogen</b> absorption efficiency <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> use efficiency to nitrogen efficiency in different oilseed rape varieties were preliminarily discussed. Results showed that, the differences of grain yield, <b>nitrogen</b> use efficiency <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> response among the 16 oilseed rape varieties were significantly, regardless of N application level; but only under no N application conditions, the differences of nitrogen absorption amount among varieties were significantly. The 16 oilseed rape varieties were divided into four different genotypes {{in accordance with the}} <b>nitrogen</b> use efficiency <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> response under no nitrogen application condition: (1) Nitrogen High Efficiency-Nitrogen High Response, included Xy 1, Xy 16, Xy 17, Xh 19, Xh 20 and Xy 21.

(4) Nitrogen Low Efficiency-Nitrogen High Response (NLE-NHR), included Xy 11 and Xy 13. The variation coefficient of nitrogen use efficiency was higher than nitrogen absorption efficiency, regardless of N application level; it was also showed that the contribution of nitrogen use efficiency to nitrogen efficiency was higher than nitrogen absorption efficiency. However, variation coefficient of nitrogen absorption efficiency under nitrogen application condition was higher than under no N application condition; variation coefficient of nitrogen use efficiency was reverse. It was indicated that, under no N application condition, the variation of nitrogen efficiency because of nitrogen use efficiency was decreased <b>and</b> variation of <b>nitrogen</b> efficiency because of nitrogen absorption efficiency was increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{replacement}} of the natural systems by sugar cane leads to fundamental alterations in soil carbon <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> stocks <b>and</b> consequently in the global cycle of these elements. This {{study was conducted in}} the municipality of Capim, Paraiba State, and the objective was to evaluate carbon <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> stocks in soils of a natural forest in comparison to sugar cane with and without vinasse. The studied soil was a Dystrophic Gray Argisol. The soil samplings were performed in five replicates (five profiles) at the depths of 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 20 e 20 - 40 cm. The systems were selected namely, native forest; sugar cane with vinasse and cane sugar with- out vinasse. The carbon <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> contents <b>and</b> stocks decrease after the change of native forest to plant sugar cane. In general, there is not significant difference in the carbon <b>and</b> <b>nitrogen</b> contents <b>and</b> stocks be- tween the environments of cane sugar.

5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining <b>nitrogen</b> <b>and</b> other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a cryogenic process. This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E
