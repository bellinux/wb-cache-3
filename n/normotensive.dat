2500|$|Normal {{fluctuation}} {{in blood}} pressure is adaptive and necessary. [...] Fluctuations in pressure that are significantly greater than the norm are associated with greater white matter hyperintensity, a finding consistent with reduced local cerebral blood flow and a heightened risk of cerebrovascular disease. [...] Within both high and low blood pressure groups, {{a greater degree of}} fluctuation was found to correlate with an increase in cerebrovascular disease compared to those with less variability, suggesting the consideration of the clinical management of blood pressure fluctuations, even among <b>normotensive</b> older adults. [...] Older individuals and those who had received blood pressure medications were more likely to exhibit larger fluctuations in pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} MI {{can be treated}} with vasodilators as well to {{decrease}} afterload. In the chronic state, {{the most commonly used}} agents are ACE inhibitors and hydralazine. Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and hydralazine can delay surgical treatment of mitral insufficiency. The current guidelines for treatment of MI limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension, however. Any hypertension is treated aggressively, e.g. by diuretics and a low-sodium diet. In both hypertensive and <b>normotensive</b> cases, digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated. Also, chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation. [...] In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.|$|E

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} and accompanying hyperinsulinemia are often linked with essential hypertension. The proposed hypertensive mechanisms of insulin are as follows: {{the enhancement of}} renal tubular sodium reabsorption, the augmentation of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, sympathetic nerve stimulation and intracellular calcium accumulation. On the other hand, {{it has also been}} reported that acute insulin administration has elicited renal calcium retention and might {{contribute to the development of}} hypertension. To clarify the effect of hyperinsulinemia on calcium metabolism, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp technique (GC) was applied in 43 <b>normotensives</b> and 35 essential hypertensives. The subjects were divided into four groups, young (< 40 years old) and elder (≧ 40 years old) <b>normotensives</b> and hypertensives. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated as M value (mg/m 2 /min), blood and urine samples were collected before and at the end of 2 -hour hyperinsulinemia to measure the following parameters: plasma free calcium ion (pCa 2 +), serum inorganic phosphorus (Pi), plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH), urinary calcium, inorganic phosphorus and sodium excretion (UCaV, UPiV and UNaV), fractional excretion of calcium, inorganic phosphorus and sodium (FECa, FEPi and FENa). Elder <b>normotensives</b> and both young and elder hypertensives showed significantly lower M values than young <b>normotensives.</b> After GC, pCa 2 + was elevated and Pi and PTH had decreased significantly in both <b>normotensives</b> and hypertensives. UCaV, FECa, UNaV and FENa increased significantly during GC only in young <b>normotensives.</b> In the other three groups, UNaV and FENa decreased significantly, and UCaV and FECa showed no change under hyperinsulinemia. On the other hand, diminished UPiV and FEPi were observed in all four groups through GC. Significant negative correlations were found between age and changes of UNaV, UCaV, FENa or FECa in <b>normotensives,</b> but not in hypertensives. There were significant positive correlations between the changes of UNaV and those of UCaV, and between the changes of FENa and those of FECa. In summary, 1) insulin sensitivity decreased with aging in <b>normotensives,</b> while hypertensives were insulin resistant regardless of age; 2) in young hypertensives, hyperinsulinemia augmented renal sodium excretion and concomitant renal calcium excretion, and 3) hyperinsulinemia caused sodium retention in elder <b>normotensives</b> and both young and elder hypertensives with suppressed calcium excretion. These results suggest that hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin resistance could contribute to blood pressure elevation due to sodium and calcium retention...|$|R
2500|$|The {{mechanisms}} of increased {{sympathetic nervous system}} activity in hypertension involve alterations in baroreflex and chemoreflex pathways at both peripheral and central levels. Arterial baroreceptors are reset to a higher pressure in hypertensive patients, and this peripheral resetting reverts to normal when arterial pressure is normalized. Furthermore, there is central resetting of the aortic baroreflex in hypertensive patients, resulting in suppression of sympathetic inhibition after activation of aortic baroreceptor nerves. This baroreflex resetting seems to be mediated, at least partly, by a central action of angiotensin II. Additional small-molecule mediators that suppress baroreceptor activity and contribute to exaggerated sympathetic drive in hypertension include reactive oxygen species and endothelin.

In this study, leg and forearm blood flow and resistance were monitored noninvasively every 15 min for 22 h in 14 <b>normotensives</b> and 14 age-matched hypertensives confined to bed. A significant blood pressure fall (<b>normotensives,</b> - 4. 8 %/- 6. 1 %; hypertensives, - 7. 1 %/- 6. 3 %; all P <. 0001), heart rate decrease (- 14. 9 in the former, - 10 % in the latter; both P <. 0001) and leg flow increase (<b>normotensives,</b> + 47. 4 %, hypertensives, + 36. 1 %; both P <. 0001) were found during sleep in all subjects, because of a blood redistribution probably attributable to activation of the cholinergic system.

40|$|Objective: Oxidative stress {{has been}} implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of hypertension and its complications through alterations in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. This {{study was designed to}} investigate whether a relationship exists between phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-dependent superoxide anion (•O 2 -) production and NO generation in patients with essential hypertension. Methods: Superoxide production was assayed by chemiluminescence under baseline and stimulated conditions on mononuclear cells obtained from hypertensives (n = 51) and <b>normotensives</b> (n = 43). NO production was evaluated by determining serum NO metabolites, nitrate plus nitrite (NOx). Results: Although there were no differences in baseline •O 2 - production between <b>normotensives</b> and hypertensives, the •O 2 - production in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -stimulated mononuclear cells was increased (P < 0. 05) in hypertensives compared with <b>normotensives.</b> The PMA-induced •O 2 - production was completely abolished by apocynin, a specific inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. Moreover, stimulation of •O 2 - production by angiotensin II and endothelin- 1 was higher (P < 0. 05) in cells from hypertensives than in cells from <b>normotensives.</b> In addition, diminished (P < 0. 001) serum NOx was detected in hypertensives compared with <b>normotensives.</b> Interestingly, an inverse correlation (r = 0. 493, P < 0. 01) was found between •O 2 - production and NOx in hypertensives. Conclusions: Generation of •O 2 - mainly dependent on NADPH oxidase is abnormally enhanced in stimulated mononuclear cells from hypertensives.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} G protein coupled {{receptor}} kinase GRK 2 appear {{to participate in}} hypertension presumably through the desensitization of beta adrenergic receptors (betaARs) that mediate vasodilatation. There are contrasting data on the occurrence of betaAR desensitization in the vasculature, we therefore investigated betaAR vasodilatation and desensitization in <b>normotensives</b> and in hypertensive humans. In blood lymphocytes, we assessed betaAR signaling and GRK 2 expression and found betaAR signaling alterations and, consistent with desensitization, ncreased GRK 2 levels in hypertensives. We studied in vivo vasodilatation to the betaAR agonist isoproterenol (ISO) injected in the brachia artery in control conditions and during the concomitant infusion of heparin, a known in vitro nonspecific GRK inhibitor. ISO induced a dose-dependent vasorelaxation that was attenuated in hypertensives indicating a loss of betaAR signaling. Intra-arterial infusion of heparin nhibited lymphocyte GRK 2 activity and prevented desensitization of betaAR vasodilatation in <b>normotensives.</b> In hypertensives, heparin restored vasodilatation to ISO, to levels observed in <b>normotensives.</b> Our results suggest that betaAR desensitization does indeed occur at the vascular levels in vivo, and that heparin by acting as a GRK inhibitor prevents this in <b>normotensives</b> and restores impaired betaAR vasodilation in hypertensives.

40|$|This is {{the tale}} in first person of how I {{discovered}} the “Tensive target organ damage/Monitoring prehypertension syndrome”, which received an {{acknowledgement of paternity}} with the nosographic eponym of “Cugini’s syndrome”. The presentation is made {{with the intention of}} showing how the research methodology and clinical reasoning can act as an epistemological guide, primarily in detecting and, secondarily in defining such a syndromic picture. I will narrate, in an anecdotal way, the history of this syndrome that has origin in 1980 when I received the invitation to approach, as Visiting Professor, the Chronobiology Laboratories of Minnesota University, directly from their legendary Chief, Prof. Franz Halberg, the Founder of the discipline “Chronobiology”. As an invited participant to an international project of research named: “International Womb-to-Tomb Chronome Initiative”, devoted to standardize the time-qualified reference limits of blood pressure from neonatal to old age, I could use the first available equipments (Pressurometers) for executing the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring. Accordingly, I started to collect the ABPM of a large sample size of clinically healthy subjects. Collection continued going back and forth between Italy and USA. In this activity of recruitment for creating a database of true <b>normotensives</b> and true hypertensives, I had the chance to meet some office <b>normotensives</b> who inexplicably showed initial signs of hypertensive retinopathy, a sign of “Target Organ Damage” (TOD), while, unexpectedly, were showing no supranormal BP values at the ABPM. In order to explain the retinal TOD, I suspected that they were true non-hypertensives but not true <b>normotensives</b> (presumably <b>normotensives</b> alias putative <b>normotensives).</b> Therefore, I compared the Daily Mean Level of their 24 -h systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP values [DML(SBP/DBP) ] with the analogous estimate of the true <b>normotensives.</b> With surprise I could see that the retinopathic putative <b>normotensives,</b> despite the lack of surpranormal at the ABPM, had their DML(SBP/DBP) significantly increased, just in between true normotension and true hypertension. It was the year 1997, when I called this intermediate BP regimen: “ABPM-diagnosable prehypertension”, alias “monitoring prehypertension”, alias “pressurometric prehypertension”, alias “masked prehypertension”, and described the “Minimal-change hypertensive retinopathy/monitoring prehypertension syn- drome”. The association of a minimal tensive TOD with a monitoring prehypertension in office <b>normotensives</b> received a confirmatory certainty in other consecutive investigations, performed by me from 1997 to 2002, dealing with minimal signs respectively of: 1. interventricular septum hypertrophy in native hearts, 2. interventricular septum hypertrophy in novel transplanted hearts, 3. gestational impaired blood flow uterine arteries, 4. intrauterine growth retardation, 5. endothelial dysfunction. In all these clinical pictures, I could demonstrate that the initial tensive TOD was associated to a significant elevation of DML(SBP/DBP) just in between normotension and hypertension as per a monitoring prehypertension. Accordingly, I enlarged the appellative of the syndromic picture in “Minimal signs of TOD/monitoring prehypertension”, alias “Tensive target organ damage/Monitoring prehypertension”. Importantly, in 2007 and 2009 this clinical association has been eponimically called: “Cugini’s syndrome” in an international context...|$|R
