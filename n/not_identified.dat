5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were <b>not</b> <b>identified,</b> but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to date recessions in America {{beginning}} in 1790. These periods of recession were <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> until the 1920s. To construct the dates, researchers studied business annals during the period and constructed time series of the data. The earliest recessions for which there is the most certainty are those that coincide with major financial crises.|$|E

5|$|Hafnium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Hf and atomic number 72. A lustrous, silvery gray, tetravalent transition metal, hafnium chemically resembles zirconium and {{is found in}} many zirconium minerals. Its existence was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, though it was <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> until 1923, by Coster and Hevesy, making it the last stable element to be discovered. Hafnium is named after Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-Akkadain kingdom's era, Hazna, an old cultic {{center of}} {{northern}} Syria, {{served as a}} pilgrimage center for Nagar. The Eye Temple remained in use, but as a small shrine, while the goddess Belet-Nagar became the kingdom's paramount deity. The temple of Belet-Nagar is <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> but probably lies beneath the Mitannian palace. The Eblaite deity Kura was also venerated in Nagar, and the monarchs are attested visiting {{the temple of the}} Semitic deity Dagon in Tuttul. During the Akkadian period, the temple in area FS was dedicated to the Sumerian god Shakkan, the patron of animals and countrysides. Tell Brak was an important religious Hurrian center, and the temple of Belet-Nagar retained its cultic importance in the entire region until the early second millennium BC.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was <b>not</b> <b>identified.</b> A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E

5|$|New {{migrants}} {{began moving}} from Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries to more industrialized regions {{around the world}} {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Although these migrants possessed a Chinese heritage, they were often <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> as such; this trend has continued into the modern day. There have been several independent estimates made on the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. James Jupp's The Australian People encyclopedia estimated that half of over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities. In New Zealand, many migrants reside in the suburbs of Auckland after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April, {{an autopsy}} {{was carried out}} on Mussolini at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Milan. One version of the {{subsequent}} report indicated {{that he had been}} shot with nine bullets, while another version specified seven bullets. Four bullets near the heart were given as the cause of death. The calibres of the bullets were <b>not</b> <b>identified.</b> Samples of Mussolini's brain were taken and sent to America for analysis. The intention was to prove the hypothesis that syphilis had caused insanity in him, but nothing resulted from the analysis; no evidence of syphilis was found on his body either. No autopsy was carried out on Petacci. In 2009, Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini demanded a police investigation into claims that samples of his blood and brain had been reportedly offered for sale on eBay.|$|E
5|$|The CCRC finally {{rejected}} the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> any new evidence or legal argument that {{would raise the}} real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the conviction. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer. As of December 2013 Bamber's defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.|$|E

5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the facial nerve) and kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire started}} on August 17, 2013 at 3:25pm in the Stanislaus National Forest, east of Groveland, when a hunter {{lost control of}} an illegal campfire. The hunter was <b>not</b> <b>identified</b> {{publicly}} until a year later, when two felony, and two misdemeanor charges were filed against Keith Matthew Emerald of Columbia, California. The fire had only burned 40 acres when it was discovered, but it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after just four days. In two days, in mid-August, the fire burned nearly 90,000 acres. The fire's rapid spread was attributed to drought and extreme weather conditions. It burned into backcountry areas of Yosemite National Park. The park remained open, and though Yosemite Valley was never in danger, the fire did burn 78,895 acres of parkland. Heavy smoke was, at times, a factor.|$|E
