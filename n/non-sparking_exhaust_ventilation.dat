40|$|An {{experimental}} portable local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{system was}} installed in three dental operatories where nitrous oxide was used routinely. Standard methods of <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> design used in industry to control exposures to toxic airborne substances were applied to the dental operatory setting. The concentration of nitrous oxide in the dentists' breathing zones was measured before and after installation to determine {{the efficiency of the}} system in reducing occupational exposures. Results indicate that placement of the exhaust opening and exhaust air flow rate are important in determining the degree of control achieved. After the system had been installed in one operatory, peak exposures declined from over 600 parts per million (ppm) to less than 70 ppm: the time-weighted average exposure was below the NIOSH recommended level of 25 ppm. A permanently installed local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system modeled after the portable one used in this pilot study may be feasible for most operatories and should not interfere with dental procedures.

50|$|Ventilation {{systems can}} be local or general. Local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{operates}} {{at or near the}} source of contamination, often in conjunction with an enclosure. Examples of local exhaust systems include fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures.

Energy saving, indoor thermal comfort and inhaled air quality in an office are strongly affected by the flow interaction in the micro-environment around the occupants. The local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system, which aims to control the transmission of contaminant and extract contaminant air locally, is widely used in industrial applications. In this study, the concept of the local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system is developed for use in office applications. Consequently, a novel local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system for offices was combined with an office work station in one unit. Energy saving, thermal comfort and inhaled air quality were used to evaluate the performance of the new system. Experimental data from published work are used to validate the computational fluid dynamic model of this study. The performance of the new system for three different amounts of recirculated air (35 %, 50 %, and 65 % of the total mass flow rate) was investigated numerically in an office room with and without using the new system to show its impact on energy saving, thermal comfort and inhaled air quality. The result shows that the new local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system can reduce the energy consumption by up to 30 %, compared with an office not using this system. Furthermore, this system was able to reduce the contaminant concentration in a micro-environment area by up to 61 % and improve the human thermal comfort in the occupied zone.

40|$|Over 2 {{million workers}} are {{potentially}} exposed to respirable crystalline silica with {{the overwhelming majority}} in the construction industry. Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica can lead to silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse diseases. The present research evaluated novel designs in both traditional <b>ventilation</b> and local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> for a concrete dowel drill to reduce occupational exposures such as silica. The first study investigated traditional ventilation novel designs to increase capture velocities without increasing fan speeds or power consumption. The second and third study focused on improving a concrete dowel drill local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> design to reduce potential respirable crystalline silica exposures during large concrete construction project such as airport runways. Previous research indicated that the manufacturerâs local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system reduced respirable crystalline silica exposures by over 90 percent but the system was susceptible to filter and hose clogging which reduced performance. In the second study, a laboratory study evaluated two novel local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> hoods, one commercially available hood, and the dowel drill manufacturerâs hood for hood efficiency and airflow characteristics. The novel design hoods increased hood coefficient of entry from 0. 59 for the manufacturerâs hood to 0. 64 indicating increased efficiency. Novel simple hood analysis found an average hood coefficient of entry of 0. 81 indicating further improvements can be made.

The current {{study sought to}} examine {{exposure to}} welding fumes among welders {{who work in the}} repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex and design a local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system to control exposure to welding fumes. 			Materials & Methods: This applied analytical study was conducted in the summer of 2016 among welders working in the repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex. The study comprised three phases; in the first one, weldersâ exposure to welding fumes was assessed {{at the beginning of the}} study. After that, a local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system was designed and installed in the aforementioned repair shop. In the final stage, weldersâ exposure to welding fumes was assessed again after installation of the ventilation system. The procedure recommended by NIOSH (method number 7300) was used for individual sampling of welders. 			Results: Based on the obtained findings, before installing the ventilation system, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 3 mg/m 3 of copper fumes and 0. 04 mg/m 3 of chromium fumes. Journeyman welders were also exposed to 2. 16 mg/m 3 of manganese fumes, while stellar welders were exposed to 6. 9 mg/m 3 of iron fumes. In the light of these measurements, a local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system was designed and installed. Subsequently, measurement of exposure to welding fumes showed a significant reduction. That is, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 17 mg/m 3 and 0. 015 mg/m 3 of copper and chromium fumes respectively. Additionally, journeyman welders were exposed to 0. 86 mg/m 3 of manganese fumes, whereas stellar welders were exposed to 4. 3 mg/m 3 of iron fumes. 		 	 Conclusions: A comparison of standard limits of exposure to welding fumes and the results obtained from measurements in sampling stations before and after the installation of the local <b>exhaust</b> <b>ventilation</b> system reveals that this controlling measure was very effective in the repair shop of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex...|$|R
