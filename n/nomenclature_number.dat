40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{modulation}} technique {{to be applied}} to multilevel voltage-source converters suitable for high-voltage power supplies and flexible ac transmission system devices. The proposed technique can generate output stepped waveforms {{with a wide range of}} modulation indexes and mini-mized total voltage harmonic distortion. The main power devices switch only once per cycle, as is suitable for high-power applica-tions. In addition to meeting the minimum turn-on and turn-off time requirements for high-power semiconductor switches, the proposed technique excludes from the synthesized waveform any pulses that are either too narrow or too wide. By using a systematic method, only the polarities and the number of levels need to be determined for different modulation levels. To verify the theory and the simulation results, a cascaded converter-based hardware prototype, including an 8 -b microcontroller as well as modularized power stage and gate driver circuits, is implemented. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique is effective for the reduction of harmonics in multilevel converters, and both the theoretical and simulation results are well validated.

40|$|Abstract—Call {{admission}} control (CAC) plays {{a significant role}} in providing the desired quality of service in wireless networks. Many CAC schemes have been proposed. Analytical results for some performance metrics such as call blocking probabilities are obtained under some specific assumptions. It is observed, however, that due to the mobility, some assumptions may not be valid, which is the case when the average values of channel holding times for new calls and handoff calls are not equal. In this paper, we reex-amine some of the analytical results for call blocking probabilities for some call {{admission control}} schemes under more general as-sumptions and provide some easier-to-compute approximate for-mulas.

40|$|Background: The {{past decade}} has seen a {{remarkable}} {{increase in the number}} of recognized mouse lemur species (genus Microcebus). As recently as 1994, only two species of mouse lemur were recognized according to the rules of zoological <b>nomenclature.</b> That <b>number</b> has now climbed to as many as fifteen proposed species. Indeed, increases in recognized species diversity have also characterized other nocturnal primates – galagos, sportive lemurs, and tarsiers. Presumably, the movement relates more to a previous lack of information than it does to any recent proclivity for taxonomic splitting. Due to their nocturnal habits, one can hypothesize that mouse lemurs will show only minimal variation in pelage coloration as such variation should be inconsequential for the purposes of mate and/or species recognition. Even so, current species descriptions for nocturnal strepsirrhines place a good deal of emphasis on relatively fine distinctions in pelage coloration.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} considerations concerning {{usefulness of}} integrals of unnormalized quasi-velocities. These quasi-velocities described by Jain and Rodriguez (IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation 11, 571 / 84, 1995) are obtained {{as a result}} of diagonalization of the manipulator mass matrix in velocity space. Equations of motion are expressed in terms of generalized co-ordinates and an unnormalized velocity vector. Both quasi-velocities and their integrals can serve as a tool for improvement of manipulator dynamics. It is shown that sometimes there exist integrals of these quasi-velocities in explicit analytical form for a 2 d. o. f. manipulator. In other cases one can calculate integrals of unnormalized quasi-velocities using numerical methods. The numerically procedure was used for 3 d. o. f. three-dimensional DDArm robot.

40|$|A major {{obstacle}} to path-planning and formation-control algorithms in multi-vehicle systems are strong flows in which the ambient flow speed {{is greater than the}} vehicle speed relative to the flow. This challenge is espe-cially pertinent in the application of unmanned aircraft used for collecting targeted observations in a hurricane. The presence of such a flowfield may inhibit a vehicle from making forward progress relative to a ground-fixed frame, thus limiting the directions in which it can travel. Using a self-propelled particle model in which each particle moves at constant speed relative to the flow, this paper presents results for motion coordination in a strong, known flowfield. We present the particle model with respect to inertial and rotating reference frames and provide for each case a set of con-ditions on the flowfield that ensure trajectory feasibility.
