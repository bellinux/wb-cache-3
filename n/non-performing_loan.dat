In 1972, the {{government}} decided to nationalise all banks to channel {{funds to the}} public sector and to prioritise credit to those sectors that sought to reconstruct the war-torn country – mainly industry and agriculture. However, government control of the wrong sectors prevented these banks from functioning well. This was {{compounded by the fact}} that loans were handed out to the public sector without commercial considerations; banks had poor capital lease, provided poor customer service and lacked all market-based monetary instruments. Because loans were given out without commercial considerations, and because they took a long time to call a <b>non-performing</b> <b>loan,</b> and once they did, recovery under the erstwhile judicial system was so expensive, loan recovery was abysmally poor. While the government made a point of intervening everywhere, it didn't set up a proper regulatory system to diagnose such problems and correct them. Hence, banking concepts like profitability and liquidity were alien to bank managers, and capital adequacy took a backseat.|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate if there are differences in the classification and management of <b>non-performing</b> <b>loans</b> in Islamic banks as a result of the existence of the Investment Account Depositors (IADs). The nature of profit and sharing loss agreement has made the position of IADs in an Islamic bank unique. This uniqueness, however, has posed some degree of risk where in case the bank incurs a loss, the IADs are liable to share this loss. This has made the investment of IADs very risky and is subject to the potential problem of asymmetric information. This paper finds that the Islamic banks define and manage their <b>non-performing</b> <b>loans</b> differently from the conventional banks in the UK and Japan. The analysis shows that even though Islamic banks have special characteristics, the classification and management of its <b>non-performing</b> <b>loans</b> are quite lenient.
