Alekseyev is {{credited}} with construction of the city's first sanitation system, the first pressurized water supply network reaching individual houses, a psychiatric hospital and 30 new public schools. Alekseyev reorganized the city finances, significantly increasing the share of <b>non-tax</b> <b>revenue</b> from city-owned commercial ventures, and was known for unorthodox and successful fundraising campaigns for the municipal charities. Alekseyev was a long-time sponsor of Moscow Conservatory and local musicians; during his tenure the city acquired the Tretyakov Gallery.|$|E
2500|$|The Province of Manitoba charges Manitoba Hydro a water {{rental fee}} {{proportionate}} {{to the total}} volume of water passed through the generating stations. Increases in this rental have provided an important stream of <b>non-tax</b> <b>revenue</b> to the Provincial government. [...] While at first glance it may seem [...] for the provincial government to collect such fees from a company it owns, the government argues that such fees help ensure that Manitobans receive a direct return on that portion of energy resources that is exported. More controversially, in 2002-2004 the New Democratic Party provincial government collected a direct dividend from Manitoba Hydro. This was criticized by the provincial opposition parties for various reasons but mostly as evidence that Hydro rates were unnecessarily high with the excess amounting to a hidden tax.|$|E
6000|$|In {{national}} as {{in domestic}} housekeeping, {{the figure of}} available [...] income is the vital question. The total receipts of the Irish [...] exchequer would be £8,350,000, from customs, excise, stamps, [...] income-tax, and <b>non-tax</b> <b>revenue.</b> On a general comparison of the [...] taxable revenues of Ireland and Great Britain, as tested more [...] especially by the property passing under the death duties, the [...] fair proportion due as Ireland’s share for imperial purposes, such [...] as interest on the debt, defence, and civil charge, was fixed at [...] one-fifteenth. This would bring the total charge properly imperial [...] up to £3,242,000. Civil charges in Ireland were put at £2,510,000, [...] and the constabulary charge on Ireland was not to exceed [...] £1,000,000, any excess over that sum being debited to England. The [...] Irish government would be left with a surplus of £404,000. This [...] may seem a ludicrously meagre amount, but, compared with the total [...] revenue, it is equivalent to a surplus on our own budget of that [...] date of something like five millions.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} the impact of the STAR highway located in Batangas province, Philippines, on the public finance of the cities and {{municipalities}} through which it directly passes. Specifically, we exploit a unique, disaggregated dataset on tax (property and business taxes) as well as <b>non-tax</b> <b>revenues</b> (regulatory fees and user charges) of the cities and municipalities in the Batangas province. We find, based on our two specifications of a modified difference-in-difference model, that the STAR highway had a robust, statistically significant, and economically growing impact on business taxes. We also find that this so-called "highway effect" also extends to municipalities located in a neighboring province to Batangas. Furthermore, based on more careful inspection and robustness checks, it appears that the STAR highway had a significant impact not only on business taxes, but also on property taxes and regulatory fees. These findings support the widely held belief that infrastructure investments matter; further, our micro-case study suggests that infrastructure investments can indirectly boost tax and <b>non-tax</b> <b>revenues</b> through their power to reduce transportation costs and enhance the activity of firms and workers located along the highway...|$|R
