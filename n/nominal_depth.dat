30|$|As one {{important}} enabling technology for achieving superior surface finish, single point diamond tool-based nanometric cutting {{has been widely}} applied in various industrial fields [1 – 3]. However, the lack of fundamental understanding of machining mechanisms greatly hinders the further development of the nanometric cutting machinability. In the conventional macroscopic machining where the edge radius of cutting tool (i.e., tool sharpness) is significantly smaller than the <b>nominal</b> <b>depth</b> of cut, the work piece is usually considered to be composed of continuous, isotropic, and defect-free materials. However, in the nanometric cutting, the work piece materials are mainly discrete, anisotropic, and not defect-free, because of the comparable edge radius of cutting tool with the <b>nominal</b> <b>depth</b> of cut. Consequently, the well-established conventional macroscopic machining mechanisms may be not be suitable for {{the interpretation of the}} nanometric cutting, and thus, a fundamental understanding of the nanometric cutting mechanisms is essentially required to facilitate the nanometric cutting technique.|$|E

40|$|The {{organic matter}} of sinking {{particulate}} material {{collected in the}} Northeast Atlantic Ocean (ca. 49 °N, 16 °W) was investigated {{in order to determine}} temporal and depth-related variability in its composition. Three sediment traps were deployed at <b>nominal</b> <b>depths</b> of 1000 m (below the permanent thermocline), 3000 m (representing the deep-water fluxes) and at 4700 m, about 100 m above the seafloor (just above the benthic boundary layer). The samples span a 28 -month sampling period from October 1995 until February 1998, each sample representing a period of between 7 and 28 days. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen contents decrease with depth, as did the absolute concentrations of most biochemicals measured in this study, such as intact proteins and individual lipids. However, concentrations of proteins relative to total organic carbon and total nitrogen did not show any significant change with depth, implying that they are not being rapidly degraded and so may provide an important supply of nitrogen to the benthos. Fluxes of protein, TN and TOC are significantly correlated at all depths. Lipid compositions vary temporally. During periods of high flux, particularly in the summer, the lipids are richer in ‘labile components’, namely unsaturated fatty acids and low molecular weight alcohols. During periods of low flux other compounds, such as sterols, steroidal ketones and a trisnorhopan- 21 -one are more abundant.

40|$|High-heat-flux removal is {{necessary}} for next-generation microelectronic systems to operate more reliably and efficiently. Extremely high heat removal rates are achieved in this work using a hierarchical manifold microchannel heat sink array. The microchannels are imbedded directly into the heated substrate to reduce the parasitic thermal resistances due to contact and conduction resistances. Discretizing the chip footprint area into multiple smaller heat sink elements with high-aspect-ratio microchannels ensures shortened effective fluid flow lengths. Phase change of high fluid mass fluxes can thus be accommodated in micron-scale channels while keeping pressure drops low compared to traditional, microchannel heat sinks. A thermal test vehicle, with all flow distribution components heterogeneously integrated, is fabricated to demonstrate this enhanced thermal and hydraulic performance. The 5 mm x 5 mm silicon chip area, with resistive heaters and local temperature sensors fabricated directly on the opposite face, is cooled by a 3 x 3 array of microchannel heat sinks that are fed with coolant using a hierarchical manifold distributor. Using the engineered dielectric liquid HFE- 7100 as the working fluid, experimental results are presented for channel mass fluxes of 1300, 2100, and 2900 kg/m 2 s and channel cross sections with nominal widths of 15 micrometers and <b>nominal</b> <b>depths</b> of 35 micrometers, 150 micrometers, and 300 micrometers.

The {{goal of the}} study was to provide detailed information on the microbial contributions to the particulate organic carbon and DNA fluxes. Bacterial fluxes associated with settling particles in the PAP area were generally low and significantly lower than bacterial fluxes reported from the same area during 1989 - 90. Marked seasonal pulses in the microbial assemblages were observed in all years that were associated with particle flux maxima in April-June. No significant differences were found in microbial fluxes between 1000 and 4700 m depth, but both the bacterial biomass flux and the frequency of dividing bacteria increased with depth, suggesting that organic matter turnover and conversion into bacterial biomass increased in the deeper traps. The structure of microbial assemblages displayed clear changes with increasing depth; the ratios of bacteria to both flagellates and cyanobacteria increased up to 4 -fold between 1000 and 4700 m, showing a marked increase in bacterial dominance in the deeper layers of the water column. A parallel increase of the bacterial contribution to particulate organic carbon (POC) and DNA fluxes was observed. Total microbial contribution to the POC flux in the PAP area was about 2 %, whereas the contribution of cyanobacteria was negligible. Fluxes of microbial assemblages were significantly correlated with DNA fluxes and on average the bacteria accounted for 5 % of DNA fluxes.

5000|$|The more {{recently}} developed laser peening process, the Toshiba LPwC process, varies in significant ways {{from the process}} described above. The LPwC process utilizes low energy, high frequency Nd-YAG lasers producing pulse energies of ≤ 0.1 J and pulse durations of ≤ 10 ns, using spot sizes [...] ≤1 mm diameter. Because the process originally was intended to operate in large water-filled vessels, the wave frequency was doubled to halve the wavelength to 532 μm. The shorter wavelength decreases the absorption of beam energy while traveling through water to the target. Due to access constraints, no opaque overlay {{is applied to the}} target surface. This factor, combined with the small spot size, requires many shots to achieve a significant surface compressive stress and depths of 1 mm. The first layers applied produce a tensile surface stress due to surface melting, although a compressive stress is developed below the melt layer. However, as more layers are added, the increasing subsurface compressive stress [...] "bleeds" [...] back through the melted surface layer to produce the desired surface compressive stress. Depending on material properties and the desired compressive stresses, generally about 18 spots/mm2 to 70 spots/mm2 or greater spot densities are applied, about 100 times the spot densities of the high pulse energy process. The effects of the higher spot densities on processing times are compensated for in part by the higher pulse frequency, 60 Hz, of the low energy lasers. Newer generations of these laser systems are projected to operate at higher frequencies. This low energy process achieves compressive residual stress magnitudes and depths equivalent to the high energy process with <b>nominal</b> <b>depths</b> of 1 to 1.5 mm. However, the smaller spot size will not permit depths deeper than this.|$|R
