40|$|A {{computer}} keyboard consists of several sections and each section consists of several <b>numbers</b> of <b>keys.</b> The text entry section contains the standard character keys, navigation section contains cursor movement and page control keys, numeric keypad contains numeric keys and function keys section contain function keys and special keys. Although the increased <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> helps smooth interaction {{with a computer}} there are situations where {{it is necessary to}} reduce the <b>number</b> of <b>keys.</b> The need for reducing <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> in a keyboard creates a technical contradiction. Generally more <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> can support more number of functions and less <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> can support less number of functions. We need more number of functions (all the functions available in a full size keyboard), but we want only less <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> (Contradiction). This contradiction has been solved by using multi-stroke mechanism. There may be different purposes to reduce the <b>number</b> of <b>keys</b> in a keyboard. Some of them intend {{to reduce the size of}} the keyboard while some others intend to increase the speed of typing. But all of these inventions use multi-stroke mechanism to generate more number of signals from less <b>number</b> of <b>keys.</b> Comment: 8 page...|$|R

In 1961, after working as an editor at Thames and Hudson, he accepted a position at the University of Sydney as Lecturer and subsequently Senior Lecturer in European Iron Age Archaeology. From 1971 to 1982 he held the Chair of Archaeology and Head of Department at Leicester University. His other appointments have included Visiting Professorship at the University of Edinburgh and Senior Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Glasgow (from 1998 with his wife).

50|$|A softkey or {{soft key}} is a button {{flexibly}} programmable to invoke {{any of a}} number of functions rather than being associated with a single fixed function or a fixed set of functions. A softkey is often located alongside a display device of a portable device such as a cellular phone, where the button invokes a function described by the text at that moment shown adjacent to the button on the display. However, softkeys are also found away from the display device, for example on the sides of cellular phones, where they are typically programmed to invoke functions such as PTT, memo, or volume control. Softkeys are generally found on keyboards (e.g. the F keys), cellular phones, Automated Teller Machines, Primary Flight and Multi-Function Displays, although they are also found elsewhere. Hard key is the contrary term, which means a hard-coded key such as a <b>number</b> <b>key</b> pad or the Send/End key of a mobile phone. Depending on the development company, cellular phone softkeys are often called F1(Left), F2(Right).|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} in the late 1990s, a <b>number</b> <b>key</b> employees—including Ohshima—left the company {{to form a new}} video game {{development}} studio named Artoon. Sonic Team achieved success in the arcade game market in 1999 with the launch of rhythm game Samba de Amigo, which was released the following year for the Dreamcast. Sonic Team also began exploring online gaming; they developed ChuChu Rocket! (1999) a puzzle video game that made use of the Dreamcast's online capabilities. In 2000, the studio delved further into online gaming with the release of the role-playing video game Phantasy Star Online, which became a critical and commercial success. Despite Sonic Team creating a number of well received titles for the Dreamcast, Sega would discontinue production of the system in 2001, and consequently drop out from the hardware business. Sega transitioned into to third-party developer and began developing games for multiple platforms. One of the first titles to be released on a major non-Sega platform was Sonic Adventure 2, which was released for Nintendo's GameCube console in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Red Alert {{was praised}} for its user interface, which {{claimed to be}} more {{developed}} than the competing games of its time. Players could queue commands, create unit groups that could be selected by a <b>number</b> <b>key,</b> and control numerous units at a time. The game {{was known to be}} easy to control, simple to learn and responsive to users' commands. It also featured two factions that had differing styles of play. Red Alert is also hailed {{as one of the first}} games to feature competitive online play. The single player campaign also received high praise for its detailed story line and missions, which often required the player to defeat the enemy with various sets of circumstances before continuing. Like Tiberian Dawn, the game has split routes for most missions. The objective stays the same but only the map layout differs. The single player campaign was also complemented by live action cinematic sequences that are a feature of all Command & Conquer RTS games since the original, except for Command & Conquer: Generals and its sequel.|$|E
