At school, Kate is questioned by a curious student as to why she is not gaining weight. She subsequently feigns a miscarriage and her students accuse her of killing her baby, for which she reprimands them.|$|E

5|$|The Illustrated Guide to Film Directors credits Allan Dwan for {{directing}} {{the film and}} Sweethearts of the Sage attribute Wallace Reid. Wallace Reid: The Life and Death of a Hollywood Idol credits Dwan as the producer and Reid as the director, but gives an incorrect release date.

5|$|The {{first part}} of the line to open for {{temporary}} operation was between Flekkefjord and Moi on 1October 1904. For the official opening, the town of Flekkefjord was adorned with Norwegian flags. A train departed to Egersund on 31October 1904 with several notable passengers: Prime Minister Francis Hagerup, State Railways director Elias Sunde and board member Sven Aarrestad, director of traffic Jens Christian Mellbye, Flekkefjord's mayor and city council as well as other mayors of the district. Festivities continued on the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> the train returned from Egersund to Flekkefjord.|$|E
5|$|The main British attack {{started in}} the west on 19 September; the {{regiment}} remained in the Jordan Valley keeping patrols close to the Turkish positions to watch for any withdrawal. The first evidence of that was observed the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> the Turks retired from their forward positions. The regiment then moved to join {{the rest of the}} brigade at Khubret Fusail on the western bank of the Jordan.|$|E

5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 16 the JMA {{started to}} issue Typhoon force wind warnings, for the Naha, Okinawa; however these were {{discontinued}} later that day. The JMA then placed the Yokohama, Moji and Naha under a Typhoon Warning {{early the next}} day. These warnings were kept in place until early on September 19, when the JMA added the Kushiro and Otaru to the warnings. However, the warnings were dropped for all areas except Yokohama and Kushiro as the typhoon turned away from Japan. These warnings stayed in effect until late the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> they were cancelled as Choi-wan began to dissipate.|$|E
5|$|General Papagos rushed Greek {{units to}} the Metsovon pass where the Germans were {{expected}} to attack. On 14 April a pitched battle between several Greek units and the LSSAH brigade—which had by then reached Grevena—erupted. The Greek 13th and Cavalry Divisions lacked the equipment necessary to fight against an armoured unit but nevertheless fought on till the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> the defenders were finally encircled and overwhelmed. On 18 April, General Wilson {{in a meeting with}} Papagos, informed him that the British and Commonwealth forces at Thermopylai would carry on fighting till the first week of May, providing that Greek forces from Albania could redeploy and cover the left flank.|$|E
6000|$|So {{passed the}} <b>next</b> <b>days.</b> <b>When</b> {{once more the}} {{cloudless}} heat of the sun had diminished, I made another attempt to press back by the way I had come, if only {{to look up at}} those windows again. But I was dazed and exhausted; lost my way; and, keeping watch until daybreak, I returned again to the pool. Sitting there, I tried to control my misery and be calm. [...] "Wait, wait; I am coming," [...] was my one inarticulate thought. Surely that other solitude must be the easier to bear. But it was in vain. He was dead; and I had killed him--pride, vanity, greed, obstinacy, lovelessness. Every flower and fading leaf bore witness against me.|$|R

5|$|Junayd {{used the}} {{diversion}} {{to break through}} to Samarkand, but as his army exited the defile, his officers persuaded him to make camp and spend the night there instead of making for the city. The advice proved sound, as the Turgesh caught up with them and would likely have annihilated Junayd's army on open ground. As it was, the camp's fortifications could not be completed before the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> the Turgesh renewed their attack. At this point, the Arabs were so hard-pressed that Junayd even promised the army's slaves their freedom if they would fight. Many did so, using saddle blankets as armour. The Turgesh attacks were repelled, and despite its heavy casualties the Umayyad army reached Samarkand after almost three days of battle.|$|E
5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} risky and costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind {{had to make it}} appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Tongan Meteorological Service {{reported}} {{that some of}} its property and equipment had been damaged. The property damage had an approximate value of about $2,000 (2009TOP, $1,0002009 USD). This included a Stevenson screen, office guttering, a HF radio antennae, signal processor, and satellite receiver. They also {{reported that}} the National weather forecasting center in Fua’amotu had experienced power failure on April 4 at 1600 UTC; for this reason the center operated using a small portable generator until early the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> they stopped issuing warnings as Lin {{was no longer a}} threat to Tonga.

5|$|The final {{series of}} the home stand {{featured}} the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching led some {{to suggest that he}} would retire after the season, he dominated game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings for a 3–2 win. The Phillies' success continued the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three RBIs in a 4–3 victory. The team swept the series when Sizemore entered the game as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning, and his two-run homer helped the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.|$|E
5|$|A {{month and}} a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor PedroI abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom PedroII was a minor, a regency was formed, and {{more than a decade of}} {{instability}} and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the presiganga (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner Jaguaripe which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered musket fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.|$|E

5|$|Astana's Vuelta {{was a quiet}} one. Vinokourov {{placed in}} the top ten of the opening {{individual}} time trial but he {{fell out of the}} top ten of the overall standings the next day due to a crash. Haimar Zubeldia's 18th-place finish on stage 8, which was the Vuelta's first high mountain stage, propelled him into eighth overall until the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> he lost time and fell to ninth. In stage 10, Vinokourov figured in a winning breakaway, but his poor positioning in the four-man sprint finish meant the stage victory went to 's Simon Gerrans. Before stage 12, Astana held ninth overall. They continued to hold it after the stage, but the rider in that position changed; Zubeldia had been in the top ten, but finished further behind stage winner Ryder Hesjedal than Daniel Navarro, so it was Navarro who was the team's highest-placed rider after the stage. After the next two stages, Navarro also fell from the top ten, and the team did not achieve anything further, with Navarro in 13th their highest-placed rider in the race's final standings.|$|E
5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group going up the climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) {{emergency}} meeting {{concluded that the}} RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first armed reconnaissance mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E
