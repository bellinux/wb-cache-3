The strength is exponential decay as the <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> decrease, the smooth specimen {{that corresponds to}} the infinity <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> topped the fracture strength, but the lowest value relys on the micro feature of the materials. Plotted the strengths on Weibull and Normal probability paper, the fitness coefficients reveal that the strength of smooth specimen, as the past literatures indicated, follows Weibull distribution, but the strength of notched specimen follows Normal distribution better. Such result {{is due to the}} fact that the decreasing <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> reduces and limits the effective original fracture volume, when the notch becomes a slim crack, the weakest link place becomes deterministic...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{comprehensive}} and accurate stress field equations for sharp rounded V-notches derived in Part I of this contribution, the microstructural support factor of these notches is determined which quantifies the fictitious <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> in Neuber's elastic microstructural support concept. By means of Filippi's equations and considering different failure criteria (Rankine, von Mises and Beltrami) the fictitious <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> is evaluated for different notch opening angles {{as a function of the}} actual <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> and the microstructural support length. Plane stress and, alternatively, plane strain conditions are introduced. Once the fictitious radius has been found, the support factor s is derived from the expression: fictitious <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> minus actual <b>notch</b> <b>radius</b> divided by microstructural support length. The support factor s is found to be very sensitive to the notch opening angle, but constant 'plateau values' are determined for all actual radius greater than the microstructural support length. The dependence of s on the failure criterion and the multiaxiality conditions (plane stress or plane strain) is also investigated. Various numerical analyses using the FE method have been carried out to compare the theoretical stress concentration factor to the effective stress concentration factor, the former obtained by considering fictitiously rounded notches under tension loading using the plateau values of s, the latter obtained by integrating the relevant stress over the microstructural support length along the bisector of the pointed V-notch. Finally, dealing with out-of-plane shear loading, Neuber's corresponding solution valid for sharp rounded notches is re-evaluated and the numerical analysis described above is extended to this loading case. All the comparisons above are preceded by elementary solutions for pointed notches in general. It is shown that the plateau values of s are well suited for engineering usage in structural strength assessments...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the minimum value of a {{fracture}} load, {{with respect to the}} <b>notch</b> root <b>radius,</b> in plates weakened by U-notches under Mode I loading. It has been found that the fracture load has a minimum value at a critical value of the <b>notch</b> root <b>radius</b> (ρ), using four criteria, namely, Mean Stress (MS), maximum tangent stress or Point Stress (PS), Critical Strain-Energy (CSE) and Averaged Strain-Energy Density (ASED). Using a characteristic length (lch), which is a function of material properties, the results showed that the dimensionless critical <b>notch</b> root <b>radius</b> (ρ/lch) cr depended on w/a ratio (the specimen width to the notch depth), Poisson ratio, and loading condition (tensile or bending loading) under Mode I loading. In other words, according to these criteria, a <b>notch</b> root <b>radius</b> different from zero exists, providing a minimum fracture load. Therefore, a crack is not more dangerous rather than a U-notch under Mode I loading. This critical <b>notch</b> root <b>radius</b> is important for a quasi-brittle material, but may not be significant for brittle ones in practical engineering situations.

The approach consists of a shape design and analysis procedure which incorporates a finite element model. The finite element model is used to characterize the radius of the rotor notch fillet for ensuring the designed thermal and mechanical stress state/pattern and associated deflection during start-up. The results indicate that the <b>notch</b> fillet <b>radius</b> r has significant impact on the total stress of the rotor, in particular on thermal stress.
