40|$|A copper {{resistance}} {{gene cluster}} (6 genes, ? 8. 2 ?kb) was {{isolated from the}} cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by recombineering recovery (RR). Following integration of a <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> vector adjacent to the target region in the Synechocystis genome (pSYSX), DNA was isolated from transformed cells and the plasmid plus flanking sequence circularized by recombineering to precisely clone the gene cluster. Complementation of a copper-sensitive Escherichia coli mutant demonstrated the functionality of the pcopM gene encoding a copper-binding protein. RR provides a novel alternative method for cloning large DNA fragments from species that can be transformed by homologous recombination...|$|E
40|$|We {{constructed}} a restriction endonuclease {{map of the}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> R 91 - 5. Insertions of transposons Tn 7 and Tn 501 into the plasmid DNA were characterized physically and genetically. The distribution of sites of insertion showed some regional specificity for the insertion of these transposons, especially TN 501. The insertion of Tn 7 was unusual in that all 42 of 43 insertions {{were in the same}} orientation. By relating phenotypic changes to the site of insertion, the Tn 1 transposon that was already present on R 91 - 5 and coded for carbenicillin resistance was mapped, and its orientation was determined. Two major transfer regions were identified. We believe that Tra 1 is involved in conjugal DNA metabolism, whereas Tra 2 is involved mainly in production of the sex pili...|$|E
40|$|The {{moderately}} halophilic bacterium Chromohalobacter marismortui {{contains a}} 17. 5 -kb <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid,</b> pCM 1, which shows interesting properties {{for the development}} of cloning vectors for the genetic manipulation of this important group of extremophiles. Plasmid pCM 1 can stably replicate and is maintained in most gram-negative moderate halophiles tested. The replication origin has been identified and sequenced, and the minimal pCM 1 replicon has been localized to a 1, 600 -bp region which includes two functionally discrete regions, the oriV region and the repA gene. oriV, located on a 700 -bp fragment, contains four iterons 20 bp in length adjacent to a DnaA box that is dispensable but required for efficient replication of pCM 1, and it requires trans-acting functions. The repA gene, which encodes a replication protein of 289 residues, is similar to the replication proteins of other gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|Conjugative {{transfer}} of mobilizable derivatives of the Escherichia coli <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmids</b> pBR 322, pBR 325, pACYC 177, and pACYC 184 from E. coli to {{species of the}} gram-positive genera Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium resulted in {{the integration of the}} plasmids into the genomes of the recipient bacteria. Transconjugants appeared at low frequencies and reproducibly with a delay of 2 to 3 days compared with matings with replicative vectors. Southern analysis of corynebacterial transconjugants and nucleotide sequences from insertion sites revealed that integration occurs at different locations and that different parts of the vector are involved in the process. Integration is not dependent on indigenous insertion sequence elements but results from recombination between very short homologous DNA segments (8 to 12 bp) present in the vector and in the host DNA. In the majority of the cases (90 %), integration led to cointegrate formation, and in some cases, deletions or rearrangements occurred during the recombination event. Insertions were found to be quite stable {{even in the absence of}} selective pressure...|$|R
40|$|The use of broad-host-range {{plasmids}} {{derived from}} RP 4 as intermediate vectors {{for the transfer}} of <b>narrow-host-range</b> recombinant <b>plasmids</b> from Escherichia coli to Agrobacterium tumefaciens as a preliminary to marker exchange is described. Recombinant plasmids having a ColEl type origin were linked to the RP 4 derivative. Cointegrate formation appeared to take place by RecA-independent, homologous recombination within a short piece of DNA derived from the P-lactamase gene of TnllTn 3 carried by both vector components, so that it never disrupted the recombinant portion of the construction. pNJ 5000 provides an unstable intermediate vector for use in marker exchange experiments, while its stable relative pNJ 1020 provides a carrier for use in binary vector systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here a dual-labeling technique {{involving the}} {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) and the red fluorescent protein (DsRed) for in situ monitoring of horizontal gene transfer via conjugation. A GFPmut 3 b-tagged derivative of <b>narrow-host-range</b> TOL <b>plasmid</b> (pWWO) was delivered to Pseudomonas putida KT 2442, which was chromosomally labeled with dsRed by transposon insertion via biparental mating. Green and red fluorescent proteins were coexpressed in donor P. putida cells. Cells expressing both fluorescent proteins were smaller in size than cells expressing GFP alone. Donors and transconjugants in mixed culture or sludge samples were discriminated {{on the basis of}} their fluorescence by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Conjugal plasmid transfer frequencies on agar surfaces and in sludge microcosms were determined microscopically without cultivation. This method worked well for in situ monitoring of horizontal gene transfer in addition to tracking the fate of microorganisms released into complex environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that discusses the coexpression of GFP and DsRed for conjugal gene transfer studies...|$|R
40|$|Two hundred ninety-seven {{bacteria}} carrying plasmids {{that range}} in size from 5 to 250 kb were identified from more than 1, 000 aerobic heterotrophic bacteria isolated from coastal California marine sediments. While some isolates contained numerous (three to five) small (5 - to 10 -kb) plasmids, the majority of the natural isolates typically contained one large (40 - to 100 -kb) plasmid. By the method of plasmid isolation used in this study, the frequency of plasmid incidence ranged from 24 to 28 % depending on the samples examined. Diversity of the plasmids occurring in the marine sediment bacterial populations was examined at the molecular level by hybridization with 14 different DNA probes specific for the incompatibility and replication (inc/rep) regions of a number of well-characterized plasmid incompatibility groups (repB/O, FIA, FII, FIB, HI 1, HI 2, I 1, L/M, X, N, P, Q, W, and U). Interestingly, we found no DNA homology between the plasmids isolated from the culturable bacterial population of marine sediments and the replicon probes specific for numerous incompatibility groups developed by Couturier et al. (M. F. Couturier, F. Bex, P. L. Bergquist, and W. K. Maas, Microbiol. Rev. 52 : 375 - 395, 1988). Our findings suggest that plasmids in marine sediment microbial communities contain novel, as-yet-uncharacterized, incompatibility and replication regions and that the present replicon typing system, based primarily on plasmids derived from clinical isolates, may not be representative of the plasmid diversity occurring in some marine environments. Since the vast majority of marine bacteria are not culturable under laboratory conditions, we also screened microbial community DNA for the presence of broad- and <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> replication sequences. Although the replication origin of the conjugally promiscuous broad-host-range plasmid RK 2 (incP) was not detectable in any of the plasmid-containing culturable marine isolates, DNA extracted from the microbial community and amplified by PCR yielded a positive signal for RK 2 oriV replication sequences. The strength of the signal suggests the presence of a low level of the incP replicon within the marine microbial community. In contrast, replication sequences specific for the <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> F were not detectable in DNA extracted from marine sediment microbial communities. With the possible exception of mercuric chloride, phenotypic analysis of the 297 plasmid-bearing isolates did not demonstrate a correlation between plasmid content and antibiotic or heavy metal resistance traits...|$|E
40|$|<b>Narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> pPS 10, {{originally}} {{found in}} Pseudomonas savastanoi, {{is unable to}} replicate in other strains such as Escherichia coli. Here, we report that the establishment of pPS 10 in E. coli {{can be achieved by}} a triple mutation in the dnaA gene of E. coli (dnaA 403), leading to Q 14 amber, P 297 S and A 412 V changes in the DnaA host replication protein (DnaA 403 mutant). As the E. coli strain used contained double amber suppressor mutations (supE, supF), the amber codon in dnaA 403 can be translated into glutamine or tyrosine. Genetic analysis of DnaA proteins containing either the individual changes or their different combinations suggests that the P 297 S mutation is crucial for the establishment of the pPS 10 replicon in E. coli. The data also indicate that the P 297 S change is toxic to the cell and that the additional mutations in DnaA 403 could contribute to neutralize this toxicity. To our knowledge, this work reports the first chromosome mutant described in the literature that allows the host range broadening of a plasmid, highlights the essential role played by DnaA in the establishment of pPS 10 replicon in E. coli and provides support for the hypothesis that interactions between RepA and DnaA modulate the establishment of pPS 10 in that bacteria and probably in other species.

40|$|The gut of {{the soil}} microarthropod Folsomia candida {{provides}} a habitat for a high density of bacterial cells (T. Thimm, A. Hoffmann, H. Borkott, J. C. Munch, and C. C. Tebbe, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64 : 2660 – 2669, 1998). We investigated whether these gut bacteria act as recipients for plasmids from Escherichia coli. Filter mating with E. coli donor cells and collected feces of F. candida revealed that the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pRP 4 -luc (pRP 4 with a luciferase marker gene) transferred to fecal bacteria at estimated frequencies of 5. 4 × 10 − 1 transconjugants per donor. The mobilizable plasmid pSUP 104 -luc was transferred from the IncQ mobilizing strain E. coli S 17 - 1 and less efficiently from the IncF 1 mobilizing strain NM 522 but not from the nonmobilizing strain HB 101. When S 17 - 1 donor strains were fed to F. candida, transconjugants of pRP 4 -luc and pSUP 104 -luc were isolated from feces. Additionally, the <b>narrow-host-range</b> <b>plasmid</b> pSUP 202 -luc was transferred to indigenous bacteria, which, however, could not maintain this plasmid. Inhibition experiments with nalidixic acid indicated that pRP 4 -luc plasmid transfer {{took place in the}} gut rather than in the feces. A remarkable diversity of transconjugants was isolated in this study: from a total of 264 transconjugants, 15 strains belonging to the alpha, beta, or gamma subclass of the class Proteobacteria were identified by DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes and substrate utilization assays (Biolog). Except for Alcaligenes faecalis, which was identified by the Biolog assay, none of the isolates was identical to reference strains from data banks. This study indicates the importance of the microarthropod gut for enhanced conjugative gene transfer in soil microbial communities...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods have}} been {{successful}} in the isolation of transfer-deficient mutants of the <b>narrow-host-range</b> R <b>plasmid</b> R 91 - 5 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: (i) selection for donor-specific phage resistance; (ii) direct screening after mutagenic treatment with either ethyl methane sulfonate or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; (iii) in vitro mutagenesis of plasmid DNA by hydroxylamine followed by transformation and direct screening. The majority of transfer-deficient mutants were donor-specific phage resistant, supporting the view that sex pili and other surface components are essential for conjugal transfer (since the phages PRD 1 and PR 4 adsorb to these sites). Some of the transfer-deficient mutants were also unable to inhibit the replication of phage G 101 or lost entry exclusion or both phenotypes. The ability to revert these pleiotropic mutants to wild type implicates the latter two functions in R 91 - 5 transfer. Suppressor mutations in P. aeruginosa enabled the detection of suppressor-sensitive, transfer-deficient mutants. Such mutants should prove useful in conjugational complementation tests for the identification of the transfer cistrons of R 91 - 5...|$|R
40|$|Acidithiobacillus caldus is a {{moderately}} thermophilic, acidophilic bacterium {{that has been}} reported to be the dominant sulfur oxidizer in stirred-tank processes used to treat gold-bearing arsenopyrite ores. It is also widely distributed in heap reactors used for the extraction of metals from ores. Not only are these bacteria commercially important, they have an interesting physiology, the study of which has been restricted by the nonavailability of defined mutants. A recently reported conjugation system based on the broad-host-range IncW Plasmids pSa and R 388 was used to transfer mobilizable <b>narrow-host-range</b> suicide <b>plasmid</b> vectors containing inactivated and partially deleted chromosomal genes from Escherichia coli to A. caldus. Through the dual use of a selectable kanamycin resistance gene and a hybridization probe made from a deleted portion of the target chromosomal gene, single- and double-recombinant mutants of A. caldus were isolated. The functionality of the gene inactivation system was shown by the construction of A. caldus arsB and tetH mutants, and the effects of these mutations on cell growth in the presence of arsenic and by means of tetrathionate oxidation were demonstrated.

40|$|To {{understand}} the mechanisms for structural diversification of Pseudomonas-derived toluene-catabolic (TOL) plasmids, the complete sequence of a self-transmissible plasmid pDK 1 {{with a size}} of 128, 921 bp from Pseudomonas putida HS 1 was determined. Comparative analysis revealed that (i) pDK 1 consisted of a 75. 6 -kb IncP- 7 plasmid backbone and 53. 2 -kb accessory gene segments that were bounded by transposon-associated regions, (ii) the genes for conjugative transfer of pDK 1 were highly {{similar to those of}} MOBH group of mobilizable plasmids, and (iii) the toluene-catabolic (xyl) gene clusters of pDK 1 were derived through homol-ogous recombination, transposition, and site-specific recombination from the xyl gene clusters homologous to another TOL plasmid, pWW 53. The minireplicons of pDK 1 and its related IncP- 7 plasmids, pWW 53 and pCAR 1, that contain replication and partition genes were maintained in all of six Pseudomonas strains tested, but not in alpha- or betaproteobacterial strains. The recipient host range of conjugative transfer of pDK 1 was, however, limited to two Pseudomonas strains. These results indicate that IncP- 7 <b>plasmids</b> are essentially <b>narrow-host-range</b> and self-transmissible <b>plasmids</b> that encode MOBH group-related transfer functions and that the host range of IncP- 7 -specified conjugative transfer was, unlike the situation in other well-known plasmids, narrower than that of its replication.
