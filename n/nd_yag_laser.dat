40|$|BACKGROUND: Because the {{survival}} after treatment of advanced inoperable endo-tracheobronchial carcinoma is so poor, {{a pilot study}} was undertaken to evaluate the combined cumulative effect on survival of neodymium yttrium aluminium garnet (<b>Nd</b> <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> followed by photodynamic treatment used endoscopically. METHODS: Seventeen patients who presented between January 1992 and March 1996 with inoperable tracheobronchial lesions causing more than 50 % endoluminal obstruction were selected to enter the pilot study. Initially they had bronchoscopic <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treatment to debulk the tumour, and this was followed six weeks later by photodynamic therapy to treat the residual tumour. RESULTS: All patients had symptomatic relief {{and at least a}} partial response, and seven had a complete response for 3 - 6 months. Eight of the 17 (47 %) survived {{for at least two years}} and 11 (65 %) survived for a year or more. The median survival of the 10 patients who had died by the time of writing was 18. 5 months (range 5 - 39), 95 % confidence interval (CI) 9. 9 to 29. 5. CONCLUSIONS: Combined <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and endoscopic photodynamic therapy may be an effective palliative treatment for patients with inoperable endotracheobronchial cancer. ...|$|E

They present difficult management problems as they are often multiple, involving more than one part of the gastrointestinal tract, and may give rise to bleeds of increasing frequency and severity over a period of many years. We present the results of endoscopic argon and <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treatment of 18 patients with documented recurrent, severe haemorrhage from vascular lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract with follow up of up to five years. Four patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, five with single angiodysplasias and three with multiple angiodysplasias have had their transfusion requirements reduced to minimal levels after one or more courses of laser treatment. Two of these have required no blood for over two years despite previous total requirements of 52 and 129 units of blood. Four patients were submitted to surgery (two in whom the laser failed to control haemorrhage and two who did not have immediate access to laser therapy at the time of severe bleed). Two of these, however, bled again soon afterwards. Two patients are still undergoing courses of laser therapy although have already shown reductions in transfusion requirements. Both lasers were effective. The <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> appears to produce better long term results as its greater penetration makes it possible to ablate the main areas of vascular ectasia in the submucosa, although it does have a slightly higher risk of causing haemorrhage in the first few days after treatment...|$|E

This study {{aimed to}} assess the apical surface {{morphology}} of maxillary central incisors resected 3. 0 mm from the tooth apex using Zekrya burs or Er:YAG laser, with or without subsequent direct Nd:YAG laser irradiation (apical and buccal surfaces) and indirect irradiation (palatal surface). Study design. Forty maxillary central incisors were instrumented and obturated. The roots were divided into 4 groups according to the root resection method (Zekrya bur or Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> - 1. 8 W, 450 mJ, 4 Hz, 113 J/cm(2)) and further surface treatment (none or Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> - 2. 0 W, 100 mJ, 20 Hz, 124 J/cm(2)). The teeth were prepared for SEM analysis. Scores ranging from 1 to 4 were attributed to cut quality and morphological changes. The data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test and by Dunn`s test. Results. SEM images showed irregular surfaces on the apical portions resected with Zekrya burs, with smear layer and grooves in the resected dentine and slight gutta-percha displacement and plasticization. On the other hand, apicectomies carried out with Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> showed morphological changes compatible with ablated dentine, with rough surfaces and craters. In spite {{of the presence of}} plasticized gutta-percha, with the presence of bubbles, an irregular adaptation of the filling material to the root walls was also observed. Direct Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation of the apical and buccal surfaces of the resected roots resulted in areas of resolidification and fusion in the dentine and cementum, with a vitrified aspect; indirect Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation of the palatal surfaces yielded a lower number of changes in the cementum, with irregular resolidification areas.

Methods: Twenty female volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin types II-V) aged between 20 and 40 years with striae (3 patients with the rubra type and 17 with the alba type) were enrolled in the study. The duration of striae ranged from 4 months to 12 years. Lesions were located on the abdomen in all patients except one patient who had striae on the arms and two patients with striae in the lumbar region. Treatments were randomly allocated to both sides of the body in each patient, one side being treated with VSP erbium: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> and the opposite side with LP Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser.</b> All subjects were treated monthly for a total of three treatments.

Study design: On 56 teeth with X-ray we determined periapical radiolucency {{and most of them}} had acute symptoms characteristic for the exacerbation stadium. The teeth were opened, the contents of the canals were removed and we achieved drainage in the first session. In the second step we prepared endodontic treatment, crown-down technique for root canal instrumentation and NaOCl irrigation after each file change. The root canals were dried with paper points. The optic fiber, from the pulsed <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> was set in each canal and laser radiation with circular slow motions from the apex to the crown was applied 3 times, each period of 5 seconds. After the treatment the root canals were obturated temporally or permanent with AH plus and gutta-percha. We made control radiograms in different periods of time after the therapy. Results: Out of the 56 tested cases, in 3 patients, after the first laser treatment, subjective symptoms were found and the patients were submitted for surgical treatment. Seventeen root canals after the sterilization with Nd: Yag laser were obturated temporally with Ca(OH) 2 paste.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ninety seven {{patients}} with tracheobronchial tumours {{have been treated}} with the neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet (<b>Nd</b> <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> {{over a period of}} 33 months. Fifty one of these patients were treated under local anaesthesia and 46 under general anaesthesia. The results obtained with the two methods have been compared retrospectively. The numbers of patients responding to treatment, the magnitude of the response, and the duration of palliation were similar in the two groups; significantly more treatment sessions, however, were required during each course of treatment under local anaesthesia. This advantage of general anaesthesia was thought to arise from the ability to continue treatment for longer and with greater efficiency. The use of the rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation under general anaesthesia was also thought to provide better control of the airway and to allow more efficient clearance of blood and mucus. Two operative deaths occurred under local anaesthesia, when bleeding led to asphyxiation, but none have occurred under general anaesthesia. Treatment under general anaesthesia is not, however, without risk and is potentially hazardous in {{patients with}} severe chronic hypoxic lung disease. During the last six years the neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet (<b>Nd</b> <b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> has become established as an important method of palliative treatment in patients with tracheobronchial tumours. " The thermal action of the laser is used to resect and cauterise intraluminal tumour within the proximal tracheobronchial tree and breathlessness and haemoptysis can be relieved in selected patients. Treatment may be given under either local or general anaesthesia. Although each method has gained favour among different groups, no attempt has been made to compare them.

Fifteen healthy bovine incisors teeth were sectioned and the surfaces were divided, schematically, in four different areas for treatment: etching with 37 % phosphoric acid (Control group-CG); Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> 80 mJ, 153 pulses (Group I); Er:YAG laser 120 mJ, 103 pulses (Group II), and Er:YAG 180 mJ, 70 pulses (Group III). The samples were analyzed before and after the treatments by XRay fluorescence spectrometry. The acid etching treatment of the surfaces reduced significantly the mineral component of the dentin. The Er: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> treatment of the surfaces with 180 mJ affected the hydroxyapatite stoichiometry...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{machining}} {{of engineering}} materials requires deep {{investigation into the}} laser-workpiece interaction mechanism, which is generally complicated and depends on the laser and workpiece properties. The present study examines the heat transfer mechanism, including conduction, phase change and convection processes taking place during <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation of steel workpieces. Gaussian profile is considered for the spatial distribution of the laser output power intensity, while a time-dependent profile resembling the actual laser output pulse is introduced in computation. The thermal properties of the substance is considered as temperature dependent. Mass removal from the laser irradiated spot is modeled considering momentum and continuity equations. To validate the theoretical predictions, experimental measurements of surface temperature and evaporating surface velocities are carried out. Optical method and streak photography techniques are employed fo...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} using cooled and intensified CCD cameras. Two different cameras were identically tested using different Optical test stimulus variables. Camera gain and dynamic range were measured by varying microchannel plate (MCP) voltages and controlling light flux using neutral density (ND) filters to yield analog digitized units (ADU) which are digitized {{values of the}} CCD pixel`s analog charge. A Xenon strobe (5 {micro}s FWHM, blue light, 430 nm) and a doubled <b>Nd.</b> <b>yag</b> <b>laser</b> (10 ns FWHM, green light, 532 nm) were both used as pulsed illumination sources for the cameras. Images were captured on PC desktop computer system using commercial software. Camera gain and integration time values were adjusted using camera software. Mean values of camera volts versus input flux were also obtained by performing line scans through regions of interest. Experiments and results will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Tissue changes {{produced}} in the dog stomach by exposure to a <b>Nd</b> <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> varied from mild mucosal oedema to cell vaporisation. Intermediate degrees of damage caused a marked inflammatory response leading to extensive fibrosis in the submucosa and muscularis propria. The true extent of tissue damage was not apparent immediately, and treated mucosa that initially appeared intact sometimes sloughed several days later to leave an ulcer. The extent of damage {{and the rate of}} healing depended on the amount of laser energy used. With pulses at optimum laser power (75 w) and exposure time (0. 4 sec), however, haemostasis was achieved in induced ulcers with total energy concentrations that did not produce full thickness tissue damage nor alter the healing rate from that observed in untreated ulcers. Thermal contraction was the primary haemostatic mechanism, thrombosis only occurring as a secondary effect...|$|E

CONCLUSION: There was no relapse demonstrating the efficacy of Nd: <b>YAG</b> <b>laser...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Granular cell tumor (GCT) {{is a rare}} lesion. Approximately 4 % to 6 % {{of these}} tumors occur in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, one-third of them affecting the esophagus. Almost all GCTs are benign lesions. Approximately 1 % to 3 % are malignant. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is a diagnostic support. The best treatment for esophageal GCT is not yet clear, whether surgical excision, periodic observation, endoscopic excision, or yttrium-aluminum-garnet (<b>YAG)</b> <b>laser</b> therapy. METHODS: From November 1992 to December 2000, four patients with GCTs of the esophagus were observed. All the patients underwent EUS evaluation and endoscopic <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy of the esophageal neoplasm. At each session, a biopsy at the tumor site was obtained. The treatment was continued until endoscopic and histologic evidence of the tumor disappeared. RESULTS: After the <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy, no evidence of the tumor was found {{in any of the}} four patients with esophageal GCT. At this writing, the patients remain disease free after a mean follow-up period of 66 months. No complication has been observed. Only four sessions for each patient were necessary to eliminate the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> was effective in all four patients with esophageal GCT, and complete necrosis of the submucosal neoplastic cells was achieved. Endoscopic <b>YAG</b> <b>laser</b> therapy appears to be a good compromise between esophageal dissection and long-term observation without tumor excision. Esophageal laser therapy is safe if correctly used, and previous EUS evaluation increases treatment safety...|$|R
