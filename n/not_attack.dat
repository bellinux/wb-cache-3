5|$|On 25 and 26 May, the Luftwaffe {{focused their}} {{attention}} on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, Lille, and Amiens, and did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> Dunkirk. Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May. Remnants of the French First Army, surrounded at Lille, fought off seven German divisions (several of them armoured) until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender, having run out of food and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, General Jean Lannes beat Feldmarschallleutnant Peter Ott in the Battle of Montebello. This caused Bonaparte {{to become}} overconfident. He became {{convinced}} that Melas would <b>not</b> <b>attack,</b> and further, that the Austrian was about to retreat. As other French forces closed from the west and south, the Austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near Nice and Genoa to Alessandria on the main Turin-Mantua road.|$|E

5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the Israeli troops did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E

5|$|Diplomacy failed despite {{continuing}} pressure {{applied by}} the Allies against Athens. On 24 November, du Fournet presented a 7-day ultimatum demanding the immediate surrender {{of at least}} ten Greek mountain artillery batteries. Du Fournet was instructed not {{to use force to}} take possession of the batteries. The admiral made a last effort to persuade the king to accept France's demands. He advised the king that he would land an Allied contingent, and occupy certain positions in Athens until all the demands were accepted by Greece. The king said that the citizens of Greece, as well as the army, were against disarmament, and only promised that the Greek forces would <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the Khalids were pardoned {{and allowed}} back to Bahrain after {{the leaders of}} the Shia {{community}} in Sitra were persuaded that the Khalids would <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> their villages again. Ibrahim bin Khalid, the eldest of the Khalids, who was exiled to Zubara (Qatar) for 10 years, was convicted in 1929 of being responsible for a failed assassination attempt on the ruler, his first cousin, in 1926. Instead of getting tried, the ruler appointed Ibrahim at his Sakhir Palace. His brother Salman, originally exiled for 10 years, was allowed back in 1928, while Abdulla was probably not exiled as he was an infant when the 1923 and 1924 incidents occurred.|$|E
5|$|Harding's general {{election}} opponent was Ohio Attorney General Timothy Hogan, who {{had risen to}} statewide office despite widespread prejudice against Roman Catholics in rural areas. In 1914, the start of World War I {{and the prospect of}} a Catholic senator from Ohio increased nativist sentiment. Propaganda sheets with names like The Menace and The Defender contained warnings that Hogan was the vanguard in a plot led by Pope Benedict XV through the Knights of Columbus to control Ohio. Harding did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> Hogan (an old friend) on this or most other issues, but he did not denounce the nativist hatred for his opponent.|$|E

Although Al-Adil {{was willing to}} renew it, Jerusalemite lords {{did not want to}} sign a new treaty without John's consent. During John and Maria's coronation, Al-Adil's son Al-Mu'azzam Isa pillaged the area around Acre but did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> the city.

5|$|On 25 July 1993, {{following}} Hezbollah's {{killing of}} seven Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, Israel launched Operation Accountability (known in Lebanon as the Seven Day War), {{during which the}} IDF carried out their heaviest artillery and air attacks on targets in southern Lebanon since 1982. The aim of the operation was to eradicate {{the threat posed by}} Hezbollah and to force the civilian population north to Beirut so as to put pressure on the Lebanese Government to restrain Hezbollah. The fighting ended when an unwritten understanding was agreed to by the warring parties. Apparently, the 1993 understanding provided that Hezbollah combatants would not fire rockets at northern Israel, while Israel would <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> civilians or civilian targets in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Sources differ about Morgan's {{activities}} in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued {{a letter of}} marque for the invasion of Curaçao, although he did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> Willemstad, the main city, either after he {{decided that it was}} too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.|$|E

PedroII's coordination of the military operations and his personal example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton, who apologized on behalf of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation {{of the world as}} sufficient and renewed friendly relations.|$|E

The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did <b>not</b> <b>attack</b> Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a formal agreement, which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate interlocutor. Goyeneche agreed to sign an armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he actually used the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with the truce still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared the truce broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E
