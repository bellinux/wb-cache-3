5|$|As the 48th Highlanders secured their {{positions}} west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment {{was involved in}} intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions to the <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Donato.

On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling.|$|E
5|$|Petaluma, a {{similarly}} small town approximately 20 miles <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Rafael, became more cooperative and American Graffiti moved there without {{the loss of}} a single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible in the finished film. Shooting in Petaluma began on June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B movie producer Sam Katzman in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there was}} never an {{official}} tour of the album, the band gigged in the UK to promote the album. They played dates in Ireland and Scandinavia, and in late October the band was to embark on their first tour of the United States. It was unsuccessful, {{mainly because of the}} mental breakdown of Barrett. In his capacity as tour manager, Andrew King travelled to New York to begin preparations, but he ran into serious problems. Visas had not arrived, prompting the cancellation of the first six dates. The band finally flew across the Atlantic on 1 November, but work permits were not yet obtained, so they settled into a hotel in Sausalito, California, just <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Francisco.

5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Francisco Bay. It was the RAC's southernmost outpost and {{operated}} from 1812 to 1841, and was established as an agricultural base for supplying the northern settlements with food {{as well as for}} conducting trade with Alta California. The Ross Colony included a number of settlements spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese sappers built a {{pontoon bridge}} over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese {{quarters}} in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river. Having reinforced Santa Engracia, <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Critsóbal, and fortified a {{bridge over the}} Gévora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover {{the construction of the}} circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison that was there and had to build the circumvallation line behind it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Early on September 10, the eyewall {{became less}} defined, the {{convection}} near the eye became eroded, and northeasterly outflow became slightly restricted. As a result, Isabel weakened slightly to a Category3 hurricane. The hurricane turned {{more to the}} west due {{to the influence of}} the Bermuda-Azores High. Later on September 10, Isabel restrengthened to a Category4 hurricane after convection deepened near the increasingly organizing eyewall. The hurricane continued to intensify, and Isabel reached its peak intensity of 165mph (270km/h) on September 11, a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Isabel weakened slightly, though it retained Category5 status for 24hours. As Isabel underwent another eyewall replacement cycle, outflow degraded in appearance and convection around the eye weakened, and early on September 13 Isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane. A weakness in the ridge to its north allowed the hurricane to turn to the west-northwest. After completing the replacement cycle, the hurricane's large 40mile (65km) wide eye became better defined, and late on the 13th Isabel re-attained Category5 status. A NOAA Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance Aircraft flying into the hurricane launched a dropsonde which measured an instantaneous wind speed of , the strongest instantaneous wind speed recorded in an Atlantic hurricane. Cloud tops warmed again shortly thereafter, and Isabel weakened to a strong Category4 hurricane early on September 14. Later that day, it re-organized, and for the third time it attained Category5 status while located 400miles (650km) <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|The state {{legislature}} extended the highway in 1925, defining it {{to run from}} near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and San Bruno Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of San Francisco and San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South San Francisco and Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from San Francisco, and was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment <b>north</b> <b>of</b> <b>San</b> Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between San Francisco and Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929 the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo, several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third Avenue). Even then, motorists {{had to wait until}} May 7, 1931 to reach Jefferson Avenue in Redwood City (near the west end of the four-year-old Dumbarton Bridge). The roadway was extended to Oregon Avenue in Palo Alto in mid-1932, Lawrence Station Road in mid-1933, and to Lafayette Street near Santa Clara, across the Guadalupe River from San Jose, by 1934. The final piece to Oakland Road (13th Street) in San Jose, which was then the main road - Legislative Route 5 and Sign Route 17 - between San Jose and Oakland, was dedicated on June 12, 1937, over ten years after the Dumbarton Bridge opened in January 1927.|$|E
