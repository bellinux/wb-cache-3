His use of Nazi imagery led an accusation of neo-Nazi sympathies and anti-semitism. Finlay sued a Paris magazine which had made such accusations, and was awarded <b>nominal</b> <b>damages</b> of one franc.

40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the wave load induced fatigue damage {{accumulated}} by a vessel sailing along the North Atlantic route (NAr) is presented. This method {{is based on}} the Palmgren-Miner additive rule and the rainflow cycle (RFC) count. For simplicity, the load the vessel experiences is assumed to be proportional to the encountered significant wave height process, $H_s$. The asymptotically normal character of the <b>nominal</b> <b>damage</b> is proved and used to derive the probability distribution of the fatigue life prediction. The proposed method improves the already existing ones by making use of the information contained in the variance of the fatigue damage accumulated during the voyages. The method is illustrated through numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} vibration-based damage {{identification}} method based on 6 -dof Jeffcott rotor system, {{which is based}} on harmonic balance and Newton-Raphson methods. First, the equations of motion are derived by using energy method and Lagrange principle. The crack model is based on strain energy release rate (SERR) in fracture mechanics and modified to accommodate 6 -dof Jeffcott rotor model. Then, Gear’s method is used to solve the vibration responses of <b>nominal</b> and <b>damaged</b> rotor systems. By processing vibration responses, the transfer function shifts between <b>nominal</b> and <b>damaged</b> systems are taken as the input of damage identification algorithm. Finally, damage severity can be correlated with the damage parameter estimated via developed damage identification model. Numerical examples are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness in identifying the breathing crack in the rotor system...|$|R

After irradiations at 473 and 563 K, Fe– 1 Mn and Fe– 1 Ni showed significant irradiation hardening, which was due to irradiation induced dislocation loops in high density. In pure-Fe, the dislocation loops were localized {{in the vicinity of}} dislocations, while those in Fe alloys were distributed rather homogeneously. This can be interpreted in terms of the interaction between alloying element and dislocation strain field. Irradiation at 673 K resulted in the formation of voids in pure-Fe, Fe– 1 Cr, and Fe– 1 Mn. We found that chromium suppressed void swelling...|$|R

25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that have addressed the issue have applied Intel and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A supreme court in New York in School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory. The Fourth Circuit in Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc. also followed Intel, although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system. The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than <b>nominal</b> <b>damages,</b> which in this case it had not.|$|E

40|$|Composite spar-shell {{fan blades}} for a 1. 83 meter (6 feet) {{diameter}} fan stage were fabricated and {{tested in a}} whirling arm facility to evaluate foreign object damage (FOD) resistance. The blades were made by adhesively bonding boron-epoxy shells on titanium spars and then adhesively bonding an Inconel 625 sheath on the leading edge. The rotating blades were individually tested at a tip speed of 800 feet per second. Impacting media used were gravel, rivets, bolt, nut, ice balls, simulated birds, and a real bird. Incidence angles were typical of those which might be experienced by STOL aircraft. The tests showed that blades of the design tested in this program have satisfactory impact resistance to small objects such as gravel, rivets, nuts, bolts, and two inch diameter ice balls.

30|$|In this section, various {{approaches}} {{used for}} modelling fatigue damage evolution in braided composites were reviewed. The ideas behind these methods are actually similar, i.e.: {{to describe the}} residual strength or stiffness during fatigue loading in a reasonable way. Typically, such descriptions can be based on S-N data, <b>nominal</b> <b>damage</b> accumulation laws and specific observed damage mechanisms. Therefore, the models are mostly empirical, phenomenological, statistical or mechanistic in nature (Kavousi Sisi et al. 2015). Considering their high computational time, fatigue simulations are mainly carried out with macroscopic models. Sometimes they do not consider evolution of the underlying damage mechanisms and, therefore, cannot be used for damage tolerance analysis. For the employed damage-accumulation laws, mathematical fitting always need some empirical damage parameters, which have no direct physical basis; so, extensive testing is often required for their definition. PFA is still regarded as the most suitable way to analyse the damage tolerance of composite structures, because damage states in composites can be effectively presented by internal state variables and material constitutive equations.|$|R
30|$|Post-irradiation {{annealing}} {{was discussed}} for {{the recovery of}} irradiation damage and mechanical properties recently [9 – 11]. For post-irradiation annealing above 600  °C, the recovery of damage structure and tensile properties occurred and irradiation hardening completely disappeared in V- 3 Fe- 4 Ti- 0.1 Si. No significant recovery of irradiation hardening could be observed in the irradiated specimens after post-irradiation annealing at 500  °C for 2  h [12]. The research of irradiation damage of recovery by post-irradiation annealing of EUROFER base steels showed that repeated intermediate annealing treatment at 550  °C made RAFM steel withstood much higher <b>nominal</b> <b>damage</b> dose rates. After annealing, the embrittlement further decreased, while the hardening also decreased. Meanwhile, annealing at 500  °C {{was supposed to be}} the minimum temperature for starting recovery [13] of EUROFER base steels. Temperature below 500  °C should also be explored for the possibility of the recovery process from irradiation hardening in an operating mode maintenance process of a fusion reactor because the temperature will be kept in the regime where liquid lithium will circulate in the blanket module for cooling the decay heat after neutron exposure even in the suspension period of the operation of a fusion reactor. Investigating the recovery process from irradiation hardening and the post-irradiation annealing at a lower temperature would require a long-term annealing treatment to extend the temperature regime to a lower temperature and thus promote easier self-healing treatment in the reactor [14].|$|R

The other witnesses for him were unconvincing and the jury's own reaction to the work was derisive.

Nonetheless, the jury reached a verdict in favor of Whistler, but awarded a mere farthing in <b>nominal</b> <b>damages,</b> and the court costs were split.

[...] Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well. [...] This would presumably reduce people's willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet's ability to function as an open, democratic forum. Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient's computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system.

40|$|Capsicum baccatum var. {{pendulum}} {{was first}} {{grown in the}} Makana District in 2005. Extremely little was known about best practices for cultivation or the insects and diseases associated with the crop in this area. The study was conducted during {{the second year of}} production, November 2005 and November 2006, in an attempt to identify the composition and phenology of insects occurring on C. baccatum. In the more rural parts of the Eastern Cape, and more particularly in Grahamstown, there are very few industries. With the advent of this new agricultural venture, a processing factory has been opened in Grahamstown creating more than 600 seasonal jobs in the factory and 1000 seasonal jobs on farms for local people. This business enterprise has not only brought about the creation of jobs, but also training and skills development and empowerment, generating much-needed income in this area. An extensive literature review yielded limited information on insect pests associated with Capsicum. Data from a pilot sampling trial undertaken were statistically analyzed to establish the number of plants to be scouted per site and the most effective scouting techniques to use. Based on the data available and insects collected during the pilot sampling trial, a surveillance programme was designed. Five different types of monitoring traps were placed in each of the eight study sites. Collection of trap catches and scouting of fifteen individual plants per site was undertaken on a weekly basis over the 52 -week study period. The most commonly occurring potential insect pests were African Bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), False Codling Moth Thaumatotibia leucotreta (= Cryptophlebia leucotreta) (Meyrick), Mediterranean Fruit Fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) and several species of thrips. Population densities of these pests and their phenology on Capsicum were determined. Statistical analyses established the efficacy of the monitoring traps for each pest, tested for differences among and between study sites, calculated an estimate of the number of pods damaged and a measure of plant damage. The results show that the majority of damage caused to the Capsicum baccatum cropping system was due to Mediterranean Fruit Fly populations. It was established that, although African Bollworm and False Codling Moth were present during the study period, their numbers were negligible and only <b>nominal</b> <b>damage</b> was caused by these pests. Damage caused by thrips species was apparent but not quantifiable. Intervention strategies using an Integrated Pest Management approach, are discussed...|$|R
