50|$|Hop {{diffusion}} - is a <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{of proteins}} and lipid molecules within the plasma membrane. Hop diffusion occurs {{due to the}} discontinuity of the cell cytoplasmic membrane. According to the Fences and pickets model, plasma membrane is compartmentalized by actin-based membrane-skeleton “fences”, that occur when cytoplasmic domains collide with the actin-based membrane skeleton; and anchored-transmembrane protein “pickets”. Due to these obstacles membrane proteins undergo temporary conﬁnement within 30-700- nm compartments with infrequent intercompartmental hops.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We study a {{model of}} self {{propelled}} particles exhibiting run-and-tumble dynamics on lattice. This <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> is characterised by a random walk with a finite persistence length between changes of direction, and is inspired by the motion of bacteria such as E. coli. By defining a class of models with multiple species of particle and transmutation between species we can recreate such dynamics. These models admit exact analytical results whilst also forming a counterpart to previous continuum models of run-and-tumble dynamics. We solve the externally driven non-interacting and zero-range versions of the model exactly and utilise a field theoretic approach to derive the continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics for more general interactions. We make contact with prior approaches to run-and-tumble dynamics off lattice and determine the steady state and linear stability for a class of crowding interactions, where the jump rate decreases as density increases. In addition to its interest {{from the perspective of}} nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this lattice model constitutes and efficient tool to simulate a class of interacting run-and-tumble models relevant to bacterial motion, so long as certain conditions (that we derive) are met. a...|$|E
40|$|We examine by {{extensive}} {{computer simulations}} the self-diffusion of anisotropic star like particles in crowded two-dimensional solutions. We investigate {{the implications of}} the area coverage fraction ϕ of the crowders and the crowder-crowder adhesion properties on the regime of transient anomalous diffusion. We systematically compute the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the particles, their time averaged MSD, as well as the effective diffusion coefficient. The diffusion appears ergodic in the limit of long traces, such that the time averaged MSD converges towards the ensemble averaged MSD and features a small residual amplitude spread of the time averaged MSD from individual trajectories. At intermediate time scales we quantify the anomalous diffusion in the system. Also, we show that the translational [...] -but not rotational [...] -diffusivity of the particles D is a non-monotonic function of the attraction strength between them. Both diffusion coefficients decrease as D(ϕ) ∼ (1 -ϕ/ϕ^*) ^ 2 with the area fraction ϕ occupied by the crowders. Our results might be applicable to rationalising the experimental observations of <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> for a number of standard macromolecular crowders used in vitro to mimic the cytoplasmic conditions of living cells.

40|$|Inspired by {{models for}} A+A→A(0) {{reactions}} with <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion,</b> we suggest a possible analytical {{explanation for the}} phenomena of anomalous coalescence of bubbles found in one-dimension (1 d) by Josserand and Rica through numerical work [Phys. Rev. Letters 78 (1997) 1215]. The explanation firstly requires an exponent γ, which is sometimes used to describe anomalous diffusion. Here it displays an explicit dependence on the dimensionality (γ=γ(d) = 4 /d for d⩽ 2). So we have dc= 2, coinciding with the upper critical dimension of A+A→A(0) reactions (Mod. Phys. Lett. B 13 (1999) 829; Mod. Phys. Lett. B 15 (26) (2001) 1205) with Brownian diffusion condition (γ= 2). Thus anomalous coalescence emerges, only below the critical dimension (d< 2). We show that the typical size of the structures (bubbles) grows as R(t) ∼t 1 / 4 in 1 d. An alternative explanation could also be thought as a diffusion constant D which depends on the average concentration (〈n〉), namely D=D 0 〈n〉α. It is introduced into an effective action for A+A→A(0) reactions. Therefore we are also able to reproduce the anomalous behavior for n(t) and R(t) in 1 d, being α= 0 for d⩾ 2 (mean field behavior) and α= 2 (2 −d) /d 2 for d⩽ 2. _______________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E
40|$|Molecules undergo <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> in {{the plasma}} membrane, but the {{mechanism}} behind this anomalous diffusion is controversial. To characterize the anomalous diffusion {{in the complex}} system of the plasma membrane and to understand its underlying mechanism, single-molecule/particle methods that allow researchers to avoid ensemble averaging {{have turned out to}} be highly effective. However, the intrinsic problems of time-averaging (resolution) and the frequency of the observations have not been explored. These would not matter for the observations of simple Brownian particles, but they do strongly affect the observation of molecules undergoing anomalous diffusion. We examined these effects on the apparent motion of molecules undergoing simple, totally confined, or hop diffusion, using Monte Carlo simulations of particles undergoing short-term confined diffusion within a compartment and long-term hop diffusion between these compartments, explicitly including the effects of time-averaging during a single frame of the camera (exposure time) and the frequency of observations (frame rate). The intricate relationships of these time-related experimental parameters with the intrinsic diffusion parameters have been clarified, which indicated that by systematically varying the frame time and rate, the anomalous diffusion can be clearly detected and characterized. Based on these results, single-particle tracking of transferrin receptor in the plasma membrane of live PtK 2 cells were carried out, varying the frame time between 0. 025 and 33 ms (0. 03 – 40 kHz), which revealed the hop diffusion of the receptor between 47 -nm (average) compartments with an average residency time of 1. 7 ms, with the aid of single fluorescent-molecule video imaging...|$|E

In addition to its interest {{from the perspective of}} nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this lattice model constitutes an efficient tool to simulate a class of interacting run-and-tumble models relevant to bacterial motion. Pattern formation in bacterial colonies is confirmed to be able to stem solely from the interplay between a diffusivity that depends on the local bacterial density and regulated division of the cells, in particular without the need for any explicit chemotaxis. This simple and generic mechanism thus provides a null hypothesis for pattern formation in bacterial colonies which has to be falsified before appealing to more elaborate alternatives. Most of the literature on bacterial motility relies on models with instantaneous tumbles. As I show, however, the finite tumble duration can {{play a major role in}} the patterning process. Finally a connection is made to some real experimental results and the population ecology of multiple species of bacteria competing for the same resources is considered.

40|$|AbstractThe {{dynamics}} of constituents {{and the surface}} response of cellular membranes—also in connection to the binding of various particles and macromolecules to the membrane—are still a matter of controversy in the membrane biophysics community, {{particularly with respect to}} crowded membranes of living biological cells. We here put into perspective recent single particle tracking experiments in the plasma membranes of living cells and supercomputing studies of lipid bilayer model membranes with and without protein crowding. Special emphasis is put on the observation of anomalous, <b>non-Brownian</b> <b>diffusion</b> of both lipid molecules and proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. While single component, pure lipid bilayers in simulations exhibit only transient anomalous diffusion of lipid molecules on nanosecond time scales, the persistence of anomalous diffusion becomes significantly longer ranged on the addition of disorder—through the addition of cholesterol or proteins—and on passing of the membrane lipids to the gel phase. Concurrently, experiments demonstrate the anomalous diffusion of membrane embedded proteins up to macroscopic time scales in the minute time range. Particular emphasis will be put on the physical character of the anomalous diffusion, in particular, the occurrence of ageing observed in the experiments—the effective diffusivity of the measured particles is a decreasing function of time. Moreover, we present results for the time dependent local scaling exponent of the mean squared displacement of the monitored particles. Recent results finding deviations from the commonly assumed Gaussian diffusion patterns in protein crowded membranes are reported. The properties of the displacement autocorrelation function of the lipid molecules are discussed in the light of their appropriate physical anomalous diffusion models, both for non-crowded and crowded membranes. In the last part of this review we address the upcoming field of membrane distortion by elongated membrane-binding particles. We discuss how membrane compartmentalisation and the particle–membrane binding energy may impact the dynamics and response of lipid membranes.
