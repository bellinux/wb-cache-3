5|$|Natural predators of the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{include the}} barn owl, the tawny owl, the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> the peregrine falcon, the golden eagle, the eagle owl, the red fox, the stone marten and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the <b>Northern</b> <b>goshawk.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mount Pinos is {{considered}} by ecologists to be {{home to one of}} the most significant populations of birds of prey in California. In the area live five owl species, <b>Northern</b> <b>Goshawks,</b> as well as California Condors.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} element of diet analysis is species adaptability to alternative prey sources. The breeding-season diet of <b>Northern</b> <b>Goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) includes both mammalian and avian species, varies geographically, {{and is often}} dependent upon tree squirrels of the genera Sciurus andTamiasciurus. We studied alternative prey sources of <b>Northern</b> <b>Goshawks</b> in the South Hills of south-central Idaho, an area where tree squirrels are naturally absent and other prey frequently important in the diet of goshawks, such as smaller corvids, are uncommon. We quantified the diet of goshawks using nest cameras and surveyed abundance of prey using line transects. We found that goshawks consumed roughly 18. 5...|$|R
5|$|Animal {{species in}} the park with special {{conservation}} status are the northern spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou gazelle beetle, and Pacific fisher. Five at-risk bat species {{are found in the}} cave: Townsend's big-eared bat, and the long-eared, fringed, long-legged, and Yuma myotis.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk.</b> This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes {{a higher proportion of}} birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk.</b>|$|E
50|$|Elevations in the WMA {{range from}} 2300 ft to 6760 ft on Snow Peak. Snow Peak {{has a good}} populations of {{mountain}} goats and elk {{as well as other}} species less common in Idaho, such as pileated woodpeckers and <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Little dietary {{information}} {{exists for}} <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) {{in the southwestern}} United States. I conducted 1, 539 hours of direct observation at 20 active goshawk nests in ponderosa pine forests on the North Kaibab Ranger District, Arizona, 1990 - 1992. I recorded 385 prey deliveries at a mean delivery rate of 0. 25 /hr. I identified 63 deliveries to class, and 307 to genus or species. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Spermophilus lateralis) and cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) were the most common mammalian prey species (41 %). Stellar's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and northern flickers (Colaptes auratus) were the most common avian prey species (16 %). Mammals and birds accounted for 76 and 24 % of the prey observed, and mammals accounted for 94 % of the biomass used by <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks.</b> I compared the characterization of diet of <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> based on direct observation to the characterization of diet based on prey remains. Diet based on prey remains differed from diet based on direct observation for individual prey species {{and the proportion of}} mammals and birds. Goshawk diet information based on prey remains should be interpreted cautiously. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
50|$|Competition for <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> {{can also}} come from {{mammalian}} carnivores. Martens, {{and to a}} lesser extent other weasels, are presumably one of their more major competitors as their diet often consists of similar prey primarily during spring and summer, tree squirrels and woodland birds, but little has been studied in terms of how the two types of predator effect each other. Most recorded interactions have been predatory, as the goshawk has been recorded preying on a dozen species, from the 122 g least weasel (Mustela nivalis) to the 1700 g stone marten (Martes foina). <b>Northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> have also been recorded as feeding on much bigger predators such as the 5775 g red fox (Vulpes vulpes), the 4040 g raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and the 3500 g striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), but it is not clear whether these were actual kills, as many may be encountered as already dead carrion. Domestic carnivores are sometimes eaten, including dogs and cats, the latter of which has reportedly been taken alive by goshawks. The red fox is a surprisingly considerable competitor for resources with <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks.</b> It was found in Norway that goshawk numbers were higher when voles were at peak numbers, not due to voles as a food source but because foxes were more likely to eat the rodents and ignore grouse, whereas during low vole numbers the foxes are more likely to compete with goshawks over grouse as prey. A decrease of the fox population of Norway due to sarcoptic mange was found result in an increase of grouse numbers and, in turn, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks.</b> In some areas, red foxes have been found to steal up to half of the goshawksâ€™ kills.|$|R
5|$|Across {{most of its}} European range, {{the most}} {{important}} predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|Forty-two {{species of}} birds have been {{observed}} on the site, 25 of which are breeding there. Twenty-two species are protected nationally; five are listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Going {{higher in}} elevation, the {{coniferous}} forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, {{and the occasional}} foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk.</b> Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of Sarcocystis spp. infect birds as {{intermediate}} hosts, but pigeons are rarely affected. We identified a novel Sarcocystis sp. that causes lethal neurologic disease in domestic pigeons in Germany. Experimental infections indicated transmission by <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> and sequence analyses indicated transnational distribution. Worldwide spread is possible...|$|R
50|$|This secluded area {{is nearly}} roadless and offers great {{opportunities}} for solitude and nature study. You may encounter white-tailed deer, American black bear, fishers, and several bat species. Bird watchers can search for numerous species that prefer old growth forests, like barred owls, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> pileated woodpeckers, flycatchers, thrushes, and warblers.|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to experimentally test the hypothesis that a positive correlation exists between weight of accipters and the weight of their prey. Sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus) and <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> (A. gentilis) were selected for the study due to their abundance during migration, ease of trappings, and differences in weight...|$|R
5|$|Pennsylvania IBA #33is on the Allegheny Front, {{which is}} along a prime migratory path {{for a variety}} of birds of prey. The golden eagle, bald eagle, osprey, and {{northern}} harrier pass through the area during their annual migration periods. It is possible that the bald eagle may nest within the IBA, but this has not been confirmed. Raptors which do nest in the forests of the IBA include the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> red-shouldered, broad-winged, red-tailed, sharp-shinned, and Cooper's hawks.|$|E
5|$|Predators of the {{yellowhammer}} {{include the}} sparrowhawk, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> {{lesser spotted eagle}} and hobby. It is not a significant host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite, although as a ground-nesting bird its eggs and chicks are vulnerable to predation from small mammals such as mice and other rodents. Nests are also raided by crows, Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies. Predation {{accounted for more than}} 60% of nest failures in a 2012 survey in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
50|$|The lake also {{attracts a}} wide variety of birds of prey. There are seven owl speciesâ€”northern pygmy owl, flammulated owl, boreal owl, spotted owl, barn owl, great gray owl, and great horned owl. There are also American kestrels, {{peregrine}} falcons, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> Cooper's hawks, red-tailed hawks, osprey, golden eagles, bald eagles, and turkey vultures.|$|R
5000|$|Among mammals, common predators are red fox, wolverines, {{wolves and}} lynx. Also common are forest mammals such as brown bear, and {{ungulates}} such as moose, sika deer, and caribou. [...] The Shantar Islands and the Sea of Okhotsk are host to large colonies of seabirds. Common land birds include <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> Ural owls, Oriental cuckoos, and brown creepers.|$|R
5000|$|Reynolds [...] {{suggested}} that <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) may take enough Abert's squirrels to regulate Abert's squirrel populations. Hawks (Accipitridae and Falconidae) prey on Abert's squirrels in central Arizona, {{but even though}} other potential predators are present, i.e., gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), {{there is no evidence}} that they prey on Abert's squirrels.|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds â€“ {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to wipe out the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> and pine marten â€“ predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk â€“ may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainsonâ€™s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrowâ€™s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with scattered trees. Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk,</b> it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|E
5000|$|Their predators include American martens, bobcats, {{domestic}} cats, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> and owls; {{although they}} quickly acclimatise to human presence, humans {{can be a}} threat to them, through robbing of their cone caches to find seeds for tree cultivation and through the destruction of old growth forest. However, the squirrels' numbers appear to be unaffected by commercial thinning of forests.|$|R
50|$|Hunting with eagles is a {{traditional}} form of falconry found throughout the Eurasian steppe, practiced by Kazakh and Kyrgyz people in contemporary Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, as well as diasporas in Bayan-Ã–lgii, Mongolia, and Xinjiang, China. Though these Turkic people are most famous for hunting with golden eagles, they {{have been known to}} train <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> peregrine falcons, saker falcons, and more.|$|R
5000|$|If a {{predator}} bird enters the flock, the starlings initiate a veritable bombardment with droppings and vomit that soil the feathers of the predator. In rare cases the sticky deposits may render the predator unable to stay airborne. Over 20 years, {{there have been}} two confirmed cases of young <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> that drowned because the incident took place over water.|$|R
5|$|Over 152 {{species of}} birds are known or {{suspected}} {{to live in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, including the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> and the northern spotted owl, a vulnerable species. Bald eagles nest around Willow Lake. Amphibians such as the vulnerable Oregon spotted frog and the near threatened Cascades frog inhabit some regions of the watershed. Black-tailed deer, Roosevelt elk, cougars, and black bears are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. Fishers and American martens have also been spotted. The gray wolf and the vulnerable grizzly bear once lived in the watershed, but are now considered extirpated. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the wolverine, the western pond turtle, the sandhill crane, and Townsend's big-eared bat.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the <b>northern</b> <b>goshawk</b> (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
25|$|The state bird is the baz (<b>northern</b> <b>goshawk).</b> (Melierax poliopterus), {{the state}} animal is the {{blackbuck}} (Antilope cervicapra), {{and the state}} tree is the shisham (Dalbergia sissoo).|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{ability of}} <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) {{to persist in}} intensively managed and {{selectively}} harvested forest habitats is largely unknown. To address the concern that populations of <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> in eastern Oregon may be declining in response to habitat alteration, I studied occupancy rates and habitat relationships of nesting goshawks on the Fremont National Forest and adjacent private lands during 1992 - 1994. My objectives were to determine if historic territories (i. e., those occupied â‰¥ 1 season during 1973 - 1991) were still occupied, document current site conditions and quantify changes in forest cover on those territories between 1973 - 1994, and compare present conditions of forest vegetation between nest sites that were currently occupied and those where I did not detect the presence of territorial goshawks (no-response sites). In 1994, I surveyed a forest-wide random sample of 51 historic nest sites, stratified by forest cover type. Occupancy of historic sites by goshawks was 29...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lifespan}} in {{the wild}} is variable. It is known that in captivity, <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks</b> may live up to 27 years of age. Wild birds that survive their first two years can expect a lifespan of up to 11 years. There is one record (apparently sourced to the AOU) of a 16 year, 4 month old goshawk. [...] In Fennoscandia, starvation was found to account for 3-6% of reported deaths. In Norway, 9% of deaths were from starvation, but the percentage of demises from this increased {{to the north and}} effected juveniles more so than adults. In Gotland, Sweden, 28% of mortality was from starvation and disease. Both bacterial and viral diseases have been known to cause mortality in wild <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks.</b> Variable numbers of goshawks are killed by flying into man-made objects such as powerlines and buildings and by automobiles, although lesser numbers are effected by powerline collisions than larger types of raptor.|$|R
5|$|The {{eggs and}} chicks of this ground-nesting bird are {{vulnerable}} to predation by red foxes, pine martens, European hedgehogs, least weasels and domestic dogs, and by birds including crows, Eurasian magpies, Eurasian jays and owls. Snakes, such as common adders, may also rob the nest. Adults may be caught by birds of prey including <b>northern</b> <b>goshawks,</b> hen harriers, Eurasian sparrowhawks, common buzzards, peregrine and sooty falcons.|$|R
