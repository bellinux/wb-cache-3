The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild <b>negative</b> <b>emotions.</b> However, those actions that are influenced by intense <b>negative</b> <b>emotions</b> cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

Results: Early P 3 b and late P 3 b were reduced in the <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> condition for both the spatial and verbal tasks at encoding. At retention, the sustained negative slow wave (NSW) showed a significant interaction between emotional state and task type.

5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is being sought. Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of <b>negative</b> <b>emotions</b> and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E

Veigue begins to have difficulty {{in dealing with}} Claire's condition, and his cold attitude causes her to leave with Milhaust. Eventually, Veigue opens up {{to the rest of}} the group and overcomes his difficulties. As the continuing negative feelings of Karegia's population are starting to damage the world, the group decide to revive Georgyas again and bring him round to their way of thinking. At Geyorkias' resting place, Zilva appears and reveals herself as the mastermind behind the incidents, declaring that she will use Geyorkias to destroy the Humas and create a Gajuma-ruled kingdom. After her defeat, the party revive Geyorkias: he in turn reveals that the force influencing Zilva and spreading hatred was in fact Yuris, and that Yuris has become a threat to the world. The group travel to confront Yuris, but are initially sapped of strength by its <b>negative</b> <b>emotions.</b> The growing positive emotions of the people of Karegia as the racial disputes fade give them the strength to destroy Yuris' core. Agarte then recovers her Force, returns herself and Claire to their original bodies, and summons the Sacred Beasts to destroy Yuris. The effort costs Agarte her life, and she leaves Karegia in Milhaust's charge and reveals her love for him before dying. The group then go their separate ways to resolve the remaining conflicts in the land.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examined}} the role of emotion and emotion control in children’s externalizing problems. Third- to sixth-grade children were administered a self-report measure of positive <b>emotion,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>emotion,</b> and emotion control.

Less positive emotion was associated with more external-izing problems. However, when <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> was examined in a more differ-entiated manner (anger, sadness and fear), the effect of positive emotion was diminished. Anger consistently emerged as {{a significant predictor of}} behavior problems.

This research aims to investigate the effects of parental controlling on <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> and self-discipline of at-risk adolescents. Quantitative research was carried out at the area of People Housing Project (PHP), Pantai Dalam, Kuala Lumpur. Eighty four adolescents between the ages of 13 to 18 were recruited. The correlation result of Pearson showed that parental controlling has significant relation with <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> and self-discipline of adolescents. Meanwhile, the t-test showed that the level of parental controlling has a significant difference with <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> and self- discipline among the adolescents. Meanwhile, MANOVA test result suggests that parental controlling might generate more <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> than build up self-discipline in at-risk adolescents.

5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off <b>negative</b> <b>emotions,</b> but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E

Results indicated that the corrugator measure of regulatory skill predicted amygdala-prefrontal functional connectivity.

40|$|People have a {{fundamental}} need to belong that, when satisfied, {{is associated with}} mental and physical well-being. The current investigation examined {{what happens when the}} need to belong is thwarted—and how individual differences in self-esteem and emotion differentiation modulate neural responses to social rejection.

Combining daily diary and neuroimaging methodologies, the current study showed that low self-esteem and low <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> differentiation represented a toxic combination that was associated with stronger activation during social rejection (versus social inclusion) in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula—two regions previously shown to index social distress.

40|$|Background: Negative {{emotional}} state might selectively modulate spatial cognitive activities but not verbal cognitive activities, since both negative mood and spatial cognition are right hemisphere dominant. To test the hypothesis, we used functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to assess the influence of <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> on brain activities associated with spatial and verbal working memory (WM). Results: With a modified n-back task, fMRI data showed as compared with neutral <b>emotion,</b> <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> elicited increased activities in right insula, right medial frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate. The contrast between spatial WM and verbal WM showed a right-sided dominance in the superior occipital gyrus for spatial WM, and a left-sided dominance in the middle frontal cortex for verbal WM. Furthermore, ROI analysis suggested that the region relevant to spatial WM task was affected by <b>negative</b> <b>emotion.</b> The same emotion effect was not observed in the region relevant to verbal WM task. Conclusion: The main findings from this study indicate significant right hemisphere lateralization of <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> and a right-sided dominance in spatial WM, which suggests the neural resource competition on the same dominant hemisphere as the neural basis of the selective influence of <b>negative</b> <b>emotion</b> on spatial WM. © 2014 Trade Science Inc. - INDIA. </p...|$|R
