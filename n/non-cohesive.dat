50|$|Hydraulic {{processes}} at {{or below}} the surface of the water may entrain sediment and directly cause erosion. <b>Non-cohesive</b> banks are particularly vulnerable to this type of failure, due to bank undercutting, bed degradation, and basal clean-out.|$|E
50|$|When {{considering}} scour it {{is normal}} {{to distinguish between}} <b>non-cohesive</b> or cohesionless (alluvial) sediments and cohesive material. The former are usually of most interest to laboratory studies. Cohesive materials require special techniques and are poorly researched.|$|E
50|$|Zones of {{fault breccia}} and fault gouge in rocks {{can be a}} hazard for the {{construction}} of tunnels and mines, as the <b>non-cohesive</b> zones form weak places in the rock where a tunnel can collapse more easily.|$|E

50|$|The most {{frequently}} encountered bridge scour problems usually involve loose alluvial material {{that can be}} easily eroded.

50|$|Externally grouted or {{friction}} piles {{are installed}} with an oversized patented conical grout shoe {{attached to the}} base of the lead pile section. As the pile is driven, the annulus created between the pile shaft and the soil is filled simultaneously with a sanded grout bonding the pile shaft to the surrounding soil. Grouted friction piles have external grout diameters of 220mm, 270mm, 320mm and 370mm. These friction piles can be used as tension elements with the addition of tension reinforcing within the pile annulus. When considering skin friction piles, STP values should exceed 3 blows for cohesive soils and 4 blows for <b>non-cohesive</b> soils. Advancing piles in cohesive materials with blow counts exceeding 40 blows in cohesive soils and 60 in <b>non-cohesive</b> soils becomes difficult.|$|E
50|$|Suffosion {{occurs when}} loose soil, loess, or other <b>non-cohesive</b> {{material}} lies {{on top of}} a limestone substratum containing fissures and joints. Rain and surface water gradually wash this material through these fissures and into caves beneath. Over time, this creates a depression on the landscape of varying depth.|$|E
50|$|Failure {{caused by}} dry {{granular}} flow occurs typically on <b>non-cohesive</b> banks at, or near to, {{the angle of}} repose, which are undercut. This increases the local bank angle above the friction angle, and individual grains roll, slide, and bounce down the bank in a layer. Accumulation usually occurs at the toe.|$|E

50|$|In SISYPHE, {{sediment}} transport processes are grouped as bed-load, suspended-load or total-load, with an extensive library of bed-load transport relations. SISYPHE is applicable to <b>non-cohesive</b> sediments {{that can be}} uniform (single-sized) or non-uniform (multiple-sized), cohesive sediments (multi-layer consolidation models), as well as sand-mud mixtures. A number of physically-based processes are incorporated into SISYPHE, such as the influence of secondary currents to precisely capture the complex flow field induced by channel curvature, the effect of bed slope associated with the influence of gravity, bed roughness predictors, and areas of inerodible bed, among others.|$|E
50|$|Research {{shows that}} {{cohesive}} teams tend to sit closer to each other, focus more attention on each other, {{show signs of}} mutual affection, display coordinated patterns of behavior as well as give due credit to their partners. <b>Non-cohesive</b> teams {{are more likely to}} take credit for successes and blame others for mistakes and failures. It is important to differentiate between team cohesiveness and individual morale. An individual who has low morale can influence team cohesion, but it may be possible for a team to remain cohesive even with low-morale members.|$|E

50|$|People in {{cohesive}} {{groups have}} greater pressure to conform than people in <b>non-cohesive</b> groups. The theory of groupthink {{suggests that the}} pressures hinder the group from critically thinking about the decisions it is making. Giordano (2003) has suggested that this is because people within a group frequently {{interact with one another}} and create many opportunities for influence. It is also because a person within a group perceive other members as similar to themselves and are thus, more willing to give into conformity pressures. Another reason is because people value the group and are thus, more willing to give into conformity pressures to maintain or enhance their relationships.|$|E
50|$|Thermal erosion is {{the result}} of melting and {{weakening}} permafrost due to moving water. It can occur both along rivers and at the coast. Rapid river channel migration observed in the Lena River of Siberia is due to thermal erosion, as these portions of the banks are composed of permafrost-cemented <b>non-cohesive</b> materials. Much of this erosion occurs as the weakened banks fail in large slumps. Thermal erosion also affects the Arctic coast, where wave action and near-shore temperatures combine to undercut permafrost bluffs along the shoreline and cause them to fail. Annual erosion rates along a 100 km segment of the Beaufort Sea shoreline averaged 5.6 m per year from 1955 to 2002.|$|E

50|$|Rills cannot form {{on every}} surface, and their {{formation}} is intrinsically {{connected to the}} steepness of the hillside slope. Gravity determines {{the force of the}} water, which provides the power required to start the erosional environment necessary to create rills. Therefore, the formation of rills is primarily controlled by the slope of the hillside. Slope controls the depth of the rills, while the length of the slope and the soil’s permeability control the number of incisions in an area. Each type of soil has a threshold value, a slope angle below which water velocity cannot produce sufficient force to dislodge enough soil particles for rills to form. For instance, on many <b>non-cohesive</b> slopes, this threshold value hovers around an angle of 2 degrees with a shear velocity between 3 and 3.5 cm/s.|$|E

5000|$|The defect theory {{proposes that}} the {{turbulent}} sweeps that are generated in turbulent flows [...] entrain sediment that upon deposition generates defects in a <b>non-cohesive</b> material. These deposits then propagate downstream via a flow separation process, thus developing bedform fields. The {{origin of the}} defects {{is thought to be}} linked to packets of hairpin vortex structures. These coherent turbulent structures give rise to entrainment corridors on the mobile bed, forming grain lineations that interact with the low-speed streaks generating an agglomeration of grains. Once a critical height of grains is reached, flow separation occurs over the new structure. Sediment will be eroded close from the reattachment point and deposited downstream creating a new defect. This new defect will thus induce formation of another defect and the process will continue, propagating downstream while the accumulations of grains quickly evolve into small bedforms.|$|E
50|$|During {{his long}} rule Amenemhat {{continued}} the work probably started {{by his father}} to link the Fayum Depression with the Nile. The area had been a mere swamp previously. A canal 16 km long and 1.5 km wide was dug, known as Mer-Wer (the Great Canal); it {{is now known as}} Bahr Yussef. The banks for the central deep side were at a slope of 1:10, to allow the use of <b>non-cohesive</b> soil and rock fill. A dam called Ha-Uar run east-west and the canal was inclined towards the Fayum depression at the slope of 0.01 degrees. The resultant Lake Moeris was able to store 13 billion cubic meters of flood water each year. This immense work of civil engineering was eventually finished by his son Amenmehat IV and brought prosperity to Fayum. The area became a breadbasket for the country and continued to be used until 230 BC when the Lahun branch of the Nile silted up.|$|E
50|$|The load {{carrying}} capacity for skin friction piles {{should be based on}} a maximum friction embedment length of up to 15m. This limitation will prevent a progressive failure developing between the pile shaft and the surrounding soil.Due to their small diameter, ductile iron piles, like other small diameter piles, have limited capacity to transfer lateral loads. Larger lateral load dissipation can be achieved by passive soil forces or raked piles.Due to the relatively small diameter of TRM piles, buckling of the pile shaft must be considered in soft soil conditions with SPT values of less than 2, a buckling check is required. In cohesive soils with an un-drained shear strength with Cu<15kPa buckling needs to be investigated. In <b>non-cohesive</b> soils it can be assumed that lateral support provided by embedment in generally adequate. For non-grouted TRM piles the minimum spacing between piles can be as little as 3d where “d” is the outside diameter of the pile. For grouted TRM piles the same rule applies.|$|E

5000|$|A mid-channel bar, is {{also often}} {{referred}} to as a braid bar because they are often found in braided river channels. Braided river channels are broad and shallow and found in areas where sediment is easily eroded like at a glacial outwash, or at a mountain front with high sediment loads. These types of river systems are associated with high slope, sediment supply, stream power, shear stress, and bed load transport rates. Braided rivers have complex and unpredictable channel patterns, and sediment size tends to vary among streams. [...] It is these features that are responsible for the formations of braid bars. Braided streams are often overfed with massive amounts of sediment which creates multiple stream channels within one dominant pair of flood bank plains. These channels are separated by mid-channel or braid bars. Anastomosing river channels also create mid-channel bars, however they are typically vegetated bars, making them more permanent than the bars found in a braided river channel which have high rates of change because of the large amounts of <b>non-cohesive</b> sediment, lack of vegetation, and high stream powers found in braided river channels.|$|E
50|$|A river bank can {{be divided}} into three zones: Toe zone, bank zone, and overbank area. The toe zone is the area which is most {{susceptible}} to erosion. Because it is located in between the ordinary water level and the low water level, it is strongly affected by currents and erosional events. The bank zone is above the ordinary high water level, but can still be effected periodically by currents, and gets the most human and animal traffic. The overbank area is inland of both the toe and bank zones, and can be classified as either a floodplain or a bluff, depending on its slope. A river bank will respond to erosional activity based on the characteristics of the bank material. The most common type of bank is a stratified or interstratified bank, which consists of cohesionless layers interbedded with cohesive layers. If the cohesive soil is at the toe of the bank, it will control the retreat rate of the overlying layer. If the cohesionless soil is at the toe of the bank, these layers are not protected by the layers of cohesive soil. A Bedrock bank is usually very stable and will experience gradual erosion. A cohesive bank is highly susceptible to erosion in times of lowering water levels due to its low permeability. Failures in cohesive soils will be in rotational or planar failure surfaces, while in <b>non-cohesive</b> soils failures will be in an avalanche fashion.|$|E
