Single inoculations of plasmids expressing measles hemagglutinin or fusion glycoproteins raised <b>neutralizing</b> antibody in BALB/c mice. Plasmids expressing the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (both normal and secreted) raised <b>neutralizing</b> responses that persisted for 1 year.

40|$|Total anti-gp 120 {{antibodies}} (total anti-gp 120 Abs) were purified from {{a pool of}} four {{human immunodeficiency}} virus-positive (HIV+) sera by affinity chromatography on a gp 120 SF 2 -Sepharose column and exhibited both type- and group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities. To dissect the epitope specificity of the group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies, CD 4 attachment site-specific antibodies (CD 4 -site Abs) were isolated from total anti-gp 120 Abs by using a CD 4 -blocked gp 120 SF 2 -Sepharose column. The CD 4 -site Abs exhibited group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities. Another approach to dissecting type- and group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities of total anti-gp 120 Abs was to separate the third variable region (V 3) -specific antibodies (V 3 -region Abs) from non-V 3 -region-specific antibodies (non-V 3 Abs). The results indicated that V 3 -region Abs exhibited type-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities, whereas non-V 3 Abs exhibited group-specific <b>neutralizing</b> activities. By comparing the <b>neutralizing</b> activities of V 3 -region Abs to those of non-V 3 Abs, we concluded that V 3 -region Abs are more effective than non-V 3 Abs in <b>neutralizing</b> a specific HIV isolate.

40|$|Strategies {{are needed}} for human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 vaccine development that improves the <b>neutralizing</b> antibody response against primary isolates of the virus. Here we examined recombinant DNA priming followed by subunit protein boosting as a strategy to generate <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies. Both plasmid-based and recombinant protein envelope (Env) glycoprotein immunogens were derived from a primary viral isolate, JR-FL. Serum from rabbits immunized with either gp 120 or gp 140 DNA vaccines delivered by gene gun inoculation followed by recombinant gp 120 protein boosting was capable of <b>neutralizing</b> JR-FL. Neither the DNA vaccines alone nor the gp 120 protein alone generated a detectable <b>neutralizing</b> antibody response against this virus. <b>Neutralizing</b> antibody responses using gp 120 DNA and gp 140 DNA for priming were similar. The results suggest that Env DNA priming followed by gp 120 protein boosting provides an advantage over either approach alone for generating a detectable <b>neutralizing</b> antibody response against primary isolates that are not easily <b>neutralized...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected individuals has cross-reactive <b>neutralizing</b> activity in serum, with a similar prevalence in progressors and long-term nonprogressors (LTNP). We studied whether disease progression {{in the face of}} cross-reactive <b>neutralizing</b> serum activity is due to fading <b>neutralizing</b> humoral immunity over time or to viral escape. In three LTNP and three progressors, high-titer cross-reactive HIV- 1 -specific <b>neutralizing</b> activity in serum against a multiclade pseudovirus panel was preserved during the entire clinical course of infection, even after AIDS diagnosis in progressors. However, while early HIV- 1 variants from all six individuals could be <b>neutralized</b> by autologous serum, the autologous <b>neutralizing</b> activity declined during chronic infection. This could be attributed to viral escape and the apparent inability of the host to elicit <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies to the newly emerging viral escape variants. Escape from autologous <b>neutralizing</b> activity was not associated with a reduction in the viral replication rate in vitro. Escape from autologous serum with cross-reactive <b>neutralizing</b> activity coincided with an increase in the length of the variable loops and in the number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the viral envelope. Positive selection pressure was observed in the variable regions in envelope, suggesting that, at least in these individuals, these regions are targeted by humoral immunity with cross-reactive potential. Our results may imply that the ability of HIV- 1 to rapidly escape cross-reactive autologous <b>neutralizing</b> antibody response...|$|R

The prevalence of antibody to all four heterotypic viruses increased with the age of the children and the number of human RV serotypes <b>neutralized,</b> but prevalences did not differ significantly between children from rural and urban areas of Ecuador. No serum sample that specifically <b>neutralized</b> bovine RV NCDV was identified. We inferred from the seroepidemiological analysis that human RVs contain immunorecessive neutralization epitopes that can stimulate cross-neutralizing antibody to heterotypic animal RVs. This occurs increasingly with age and with the number of human serotypes recognized by a child's <b>neutralizing</b> antibody. Thus, it appears that a broadened immune response to the heterotypic strains occurs with repetitive RV infections...|$|R

The <b>neutralizing</b> capacity of guinea pig immune serum was not increased by the use of filtered virus. The rate of virus neutralization, however, was increased with the addition of 10 hemolytic units of complement.

40|$|AbstractStudies were {{performed}} to induce cross-clade <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies (Abs) by testing various combinations of prime and boost constructs that focus the immune response on structurally-conserved epitopes in the V 3 loop of HIV- 1 gp 120. Rabbits were immunized with gp 120 DNA containing a V 3 loop characterized by the GPGR motif at its tip, and/or with gp 120 DNA with a V 3 loop carrying the GPGQ motif. Priming was followed by boosts with V 3 -fusion proteins (V 3 -FPs) carrying the V 3 sequence from a subtype B virus (GPGR motif), and/or with V 3 sequences from subtypes A and C (GPGQ motif).

When purified under conditions that retain its native structure, gp 110 bound CD 4 and elicited antisera that <b>neutralized</b> SIVmac 251 with high titer. Native gp 110 also completely inhibited <b>neutralizing</b> antibody in sera from SIVmac 251 -infected macaques. In contrast, denatured gp 110 and gp 140, large envelope fragments, and synthetic peptides (including peptides analogous to the HIV- 1 PND) elicited very low or undetectable <b>neutralizing</b> antibody titers and did not inhibit <b>neutralizing</b> antibody in infected macaque sera. Enzymatically deglycosylated gp 110 efficiently absorbed <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies from macaque sera, showing that <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies primarily bind the protein backbone. A 45 -kDa protease digest product, mapping to the carboxyl-terminal third of gp 110, also completely absorbed <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies from infected macaque sera. These {{results show that the}} PND(s) of this SIV isolate depends on the native conformation and that linear peptides corresponding to the V 3 loop of SIV envelope, in contrast to that of HIV- 1, do not elicit <b>neutralizing</b> antibody.
