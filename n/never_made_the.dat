Johnson considered taking Shoup as an adviser on a February 1964 trip to Vietnam, but did not, either because he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> invitation or because Shoup declined. Johnson appointed Shoup to the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service in early 1966. It disbanded on 1 January 1967 after submitting a report.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers Annuals were {{produced}} {{every year from}} 1958 until 1994, and again in 2000. A number of tie-in books were also published, including a handful of paperback prose storybooks in 1977 and 1993, and two football quiz books in 1978 and 1979. Roy of the Rovers <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> leap from page to screen, although he did make an appearance on the BBC comedy sports quiz They Think It's All Over in 1999, {{in the form of}} a cardboard cut-out. on 10 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft and have <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> first overall selection. They have also had 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Dodgers have failed to sign one of their first-round picks, Luke Hochevar (2005), but received no compensation pick.|$|E

They have had 30 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Red Sox have failed to sign two first-round picks across their draft history. First, Jimmy Hack (1970) did not sign but they received no compensation pick. The Red Sox also did not sign Greg McMurtry (1986) and were given the 32nd pick of the 1987 draft in compensation which they used to draft Bob Zupcic.|$|E
5|$|Tommy Amaker {{inherited}} {{a team that}} imposed sanctions on itself after {{his first year at}} the helm of the program. Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005–06, when the team compiled a 22–11 overall (8–8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached the #20 position. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI became {{seriously ill}} from {{tuberculosis}} and the councillors {{were told that}} he did not have long to live. In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving. Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the Regius Chair in Cambridge which was vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses. Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer. Despite his plea, Melanchthon <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> voyage to England. While this effort to shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to convince several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward's cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's daughter and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act. Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors. Edward told him that he supported what he wrote in his will. Cranmer's decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession.|$|E

25|$|A second {{series was}} planned at one point, with a storyline, {{according}} to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey, {{that would have}} come from Adams' abandoned Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen project (instead of a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell and/or Geoffrey Perkins involved were all offered as causes), and the second series was <b>never</b> <b>made.</b> <b>The</b> elements of the Doctor Who and the Krikketmen project instead became the third novel, Life, the Universe and Everything.|$|E

25|$|The Canberra Knights were a semi-professional {{ice hockey}} {{team in the}} Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL). The team played its home games at the Phillip Swimming & Ice Skating Centre in Phillip, a suburb of Australia's capital city, Canberra. In February 2014 the team owner {{announced}} that operations would fold due to financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance. They were replaced in the league by the CBR Brave. The Knights were only ever premiers once, in 1998, in the now defunct East Coast Super League, and <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> finals since {{the formation of the}} AIHL.|$|E
25|$|Higgins {{was raised}} in the Church Of Ireland religion. He started playing snooker at the age of 11, often in the Jampot club in his native Sandy Row area of south Belfast and later in the YMCA in the nearby city centre. At age 14, he left for England and a career as a jockey. However, he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> grade because he was too heavy to ride competitively. He {{returned}} to Belfast and by 1965, aged 16, he had compiled his first maximum break. In 1968 he won the All-Ireland and Northern Ireland Amateur Snooker Championships.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Australian Baseball League (ABL) {{started in}} 1989 with Adelaide {{represented by the}} Adelaide Giants.

During {{their time in the}} ABL the Giants were affiliated, as were every other team in the league, with a team from Major League Baseball. In a massive coup the Giants managed to get themselves affiliated with the 1988 World Series champions the Los Angeles Dodgers with the team receiving 3-4 'import players' a season from the Dodgers Minor League system to complement their array of 'local' talent. Unfortunately during the ABL the Giants <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> ABL's championship series.|$|E

25|$|The {{start of}} the 1995 season saw Church play only {{occasionally}} for the first team, and he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average languishing in the mid-teens and a top score of only 35 {{in a total of}} 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the face of it, with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50.|$|E
25|$|After having {{resigned}} as Prime Minister of France, he left politics. He {{was aware that}} the link between himself and public life was broken forever, and he <b>never</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> slightest attempt to renew it. The greater {{part of the year}} he spent at his residence at Val Richer, an Augustine monastery near Lisieux in Normandy, which had been sold {{at the time of the}} first Revolution. His two daughters, who married two descendants of the illustrious Dutch family of De Witt, so congenial in faith and manners to the Huguenots of France, kept his house. One of his sons-in-law farmed the estate. And here Guizot devoted his later years with undiminished energy to literary labour, which was in fact his chief means of subsistence. Proud, independent, simple and contented he remained to the last; and these years of retirement were perhaps the happiest and most serene portion of his life.|$|E
25|$|Faith is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Played by actress Eliza Dushku, Faith {{was introduced in}} the third season of Buffy and was a focus of that season's overarching plot. She returned for shorter story arcs on Buffy and its spin-off, Angel. The character's story is continued in the comic book series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, and she also appears in apocryphal material such as other comic books and novels. Faith was set to receive her own spin-off television series after the final season of Buffy, but Eliza Dushku declined the offer, and the series was <b>never</b> <b>made.</b> <b>The</b> character later co-stars in the 25-issue comic book Angel & Faith beginning in August 2011 under the banner of Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine, the story taking place mostly in London and the surrounding area. Seven years after the character's creation, Whedon granted her the surname Lehane for a role-playing game and subsequent material. The last issue of Season Eight was the first source officially confirmed to be canon that referred to Faith by her full name.|$|E
