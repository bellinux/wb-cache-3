40|$|Preliminarystandardized {{catch rates}} in biomass were {{obtained}} using General Linear Modeling (GLM) procedures fromsets carried out bythe Spanish surface longline fleet targeting swordfish in the Indian Ocean over two independent periods, 1993 - 2000 and 2001 - 2007. The factors used for modeling were year, area, semester/quarter, gear and ratio between swordfish and blue shark catches. The models explained 24 % and 51 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPUE</b> variability for <b>the</b> {{first and the}} second period, respectively. As in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic and Pacific swordfish, an important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPUE</b> variabilitywas attributed to the ratio between the two most prevalent species inthe catch. Other significant, although less important factors, were also identified. The different sensitivity trials have shown similar trends over time.

Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received <b>the</b> three types <b>of</b> news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: <b>The</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> psychological stress response was <b>the</b> highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. <b>The</b> influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a GLM approach, {{assuming}} a quasi-Poisson error distribution and log as link function, was {{used with a}} view to generate a standardized <b>CPUE</b> series for <b>the</b> blue shark caught by the tuna longliners based in Santos, São Paulo, off southern Brazil, from 1998 to 2006. The response variable was <b>the</b> <b>CPUE</b> defined as number of fish caught per thousand hooks. The following factors were tested in the analyses: year (9), month (12), area (5) and target (3). <b>The</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factor “area” were based on <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fishing sets, while <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factor “target ” were defined by a cluster analysis, as five areas; and cluster C 1 : other fishes; C 2 : blue shark; and C 3 : swordfish. A stepwise approach was initially used to identify the variables and interactions with a significant influence on <b>the</b> <b>CPUE.</b> <b>The</b> “target ” and “area ” were the main factors explaining <b>the</b> observed <b>CPUE</b> variability (36. 5 % and 28. 5 %, respectively). <b>The</b> overall pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standardized <b>CPUE</b> indicates a relatively high stability, up to 2005.

40|$|Standardized CPUE indexes are {{important}} components of traditional stock assessment analysis. To be useful <b>the</b> <b>CPUE</b> should {{be related to}} the stock biomass. Nevertheless, besides the biomass, several factors (e. g. fishing ground) affect <b>the</b> <b>CPUE.</b> <b>The</b> standardization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPUE</b> is necessary to make possible its use as a measure <b>of</b> relative abundance. <b>The</b> generalized linear model (GLM) is an alternative to model CPUE data and to calculate standardized indexes. <b>CPUE</b> data <b>of</b> <b>the</b> albacore (Thunnus alalunga) caught in <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic by the Brazilian tuna fleet comprised of Chinese Taipei leased longliners were standardized using GLM. An observational log-normal error was assumed for <b>the</b> <b>CPUE.</b> Akaike information criteria (AIC) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to select the relevant factors.
