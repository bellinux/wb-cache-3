40|$|Nozzle {{arrangement}} (34) for {{laser beam}} cutting, said arrangement having a truncated nozzle body (10) matched to and surrounding the {{focused laser beam}} and a transmission opening (11) for the laser beam, comprising a <b>nozzle</b> <b>sleeve</b> (13) surrounding the nozzle body (10) concentrically and thus forming an annular gap (12), said sleeve having an outlet opening on the same axis as the transmission opening (11) for a cutting gas beam of the annular gap (12) connected to a gas source. To achieve the deflection of the gas beam from the nozzle parallel to the access of the laser beam {{with a minimum of}} flow losses, the nozzle arrangement is designed so that the outlet opening is a bore hole (14) arranged on the workpiece side in front of the transmission opening (11), said bore hole having a diameter (D) exceeding the diameter (D) of the transmission opening (11), and that the outlet cross-section of the outlet opening (14) is roughly identical to the transition cross-section of the annular gap (12) in relation to the outlet opening (14) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this letter is for PP&L, Inc. (PP&L) to request {{approval}} of deferral of the requirements of Section 4. 3 of NUREG- 0619. In accordance with Section 4. 3 of NUREG- 0619, for the feedwater <b>nozzle</b> thermal <b>sleeve</b> configuration, a liquid penetrant examination of the nozzle bore and inner radius areas is required every nine refueling cycles (or 135 startup/shutdown cycles). Permission to defer the liquid penetrant examinations for an operating cycle was granted for Susquehanna SES Units 1 and 2 o...|$|R
40|$|The nozzle (14) is {{surrounded}} by a tapered sleeve (17) forming an annular gap (16) into which a welding electrode (13) is inserted for striking an arc between a current source (28) and the workpiece (12). The <b>nozzle</b> and <b>sleeve</b> are arranged with slightly offset axes (19, 20). The wire electrode and/or its guide (26) are arranged at least partially in the region of offset of the axes. The axis (19) of the nozzle chamber lies in the median plane through the electrode {{on the far side of}} the sleeve axis (20). ADVANTAGE - Range of possible applications of nozzle is maximised...|$|R
40|$|PWR {{reactor vessel}} (RV) head {{has a number}} of {{penetration}} nozzles, including <b>nozzles</b> with thermal <b>sleeve</b> for control rod drive mechanisms (CRDM) and without thermal <b>sleeve.</b> These <b>nozzles</b> are typically made of nickel-based Alloy 600 or 690 and welded {{to the inside of the}} RPV head. Cracking has been reported in Alloy 600 nozzles and the J-weld regions...|$|R
40|$|Alloy 600 {{penetrations}} {{in several}} pressurized water reactors have experienced primary water {{stress corrosion cracking}} near the partial penetration J-welds between the Alloy 600 and the cladding on the inside diameter of the components. The microstructure and tensile properties indicated that the Alloy 600 was susceptible to primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) providing that a high tensile stress (applied + residual) was present. The residual stress distributions at the inside diameter surface and at different depths below the surface were measured in Alloy 600 <b>nozzle</b> and heater <b>sleeve</b> mockups. Surface residual stresses on the nozzle mockup ranged from- 350 to + 830 MPa. For the heater sleeve mockup, the surface residual stresses ranged from- 330 to + 525 MPa. In the areas of high tensile residual stress, for the most part, the residual stresses decreased with increasing depth below the surface. For the <b>nozzle</b> and heater <b>sleeve</b> mockups, the percent cold work and yield strength {{as a function of}} depth were determined...|$|R
40|$|APS) hereby {{requests}} NRC {{approval of}} {{an alternative to the}} repair requirements of 10 CFR 50. 55 a as implemented through the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section XI. Specifically, APS requests authorization for alternative use of Mechanical Nozzle Seal Assemblies (MNSAs) for Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressurizer heater sleeves for a duration not to exceed two operating cycles. As demonstrated in the enclosed request for relief and by extensive industry experience, the use of MNSAs for restoring structural integrity and leak tightness to the RCS provides an acceptable level of quality and safety. As described in references 1 and 2 above, the NRC Staff previously approved a similar APS request for the use of MNSAs for PVNGS Alloy 600 RCS system hot leg pipe nozzles. PVNGS performs dedicated walk-downs of the RCS Alloy 600 <b>nozzles</b> and <b>sleeves</b> at the start of each outage. Based on the results of these walk-downs, there are currently no identified nozzle or pressurizer heater sleeve leaks at PVNGS. During the recentlyU. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissio...|$|R
