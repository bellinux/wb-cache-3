The four institutes involved, NILU (Norway), met. <b>no</b> (<b>Norway),</b> DMU (Denmark) and SMHI (Sweden), all have active programmes in data assimilation. The intention of this project and workshop is to bring together these institutes to share knowledge and experience within a Nordic context and to further support development in this research area. In total 21 people attended the workshop, including invited experts in data assimilation from Europe. The workshop showed itself to be successful, being both informative and helpful to the participants.

40|$|The EURODELTA {{project is}} a {{continuing}} collaboration between the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) at Ispra (Italy) and five air quality modeling teams at Ineris (France), the Free University of Berlin (Germany), Met. <b>no</b> (<b>Norway),</b> TNO (Netherlands) and SMHI (Sweden). This phase of Eurodelta investigates how different air quality models would represent the effect on pollutant impacts of applying, on a European scale, emission reductions to individual emission sectors. The reason for doing this is to test whether there are important sensitivities not captured by the sound science approach to air quality policy making on a European scale {{which is based on}} an integrated assessment (IA) approach and embodied in the IIASA RAINS/GAINS model. This study shows that there are important differences between sectors in the amount of concentration (deposition) reduction obtained by changing a pollutant emission. This difference is not accounted for in the present process used to evaluate future national emissions ceiling reductions for both beneficial effect and cost-effectiveness. This raises the possibility that, when national bodies consider how to implement an emission ceiling taking account of the information used in deriving that ceiling, choices might be made that are less effective than expected.

40|$|The EURODELTA II (ED II) {{project is}} a {{continuing}} collaboration between the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) at Ispra (Italy) and five air quality modelling teams at Ineris (France), the Free University of Berlin (Germany), Met. <b>no</b> (<b>Norway),</b> TNO (Netherlands) and SMHI (Sweden) in which the results from air quality model simulations are brought together in the JRC assessment toolkit and compared {{with each other and}} against data. ED I examined the common performance of the models in predicting recent (2000) and future (2020) air quality in Europe using the concept of a model ensemble to measure robustness of predictions. The spread of predictions about the ensemble gave a measure of uncertainty for each predicted value. In a 2020 world the effect of making emission reductions for key pollutants of NOx, SO 2, VOC and NH 3 independently in France, Germany and Italy, and of NOx and SOx in sea areas, was investigated. Source-receptor relationships used in integrated assessment (IA) modelling were derived for all the models and compared to assess how model choice might affect this key input. ED II builds on this project by taking a closer look at how the different models represent the effect on pollutant impacts on a European scale of applying emission reductions to individual emission sectors. A total of 60 different emission scenario calculations were run using meteorology from 1999. Sectors were defined using the SNAP 97 designation and main focus was on Sectors 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 10 with some scenarios including sectors 6 and 8. Sector definitions are given in the introduction. Although the time-line for the scenarios is 2020 in line with the EU CAFE study and with the NECD review, an extra set of three 2010 scenarios was run for the Mediterranean Sea. These examine the effect of EU legislation requiring the use of a 0. 1 % S fuel for ships at berth in ports and the use of a maximum 1. 5 % S fuel for ferries. The main recommendation is that, at minimum, validation calculations are carried out as part of the NEC process to examine if the implied sectoral reductions are able to deliver the intended benefits. If sectoral weights could be incorporated into the integrated assessment itself then this may lead to an overall better recommendation for emission ceilings. JRC.

40|$|Though {{numerous}} studies of {{damage caused by}} beaver (Castor canadensis and C. fiber) to commercially managed forests have been conducted, few have incorporated the economic advantages beaver can create for forest owners. In Norway, hunting rights belong to the landowner, who in turn can obtain income from the further sale of hunting privileges to others. In this study we have measured 1) {{the proportion of the}} landscape affected by beaver, 2) the relative volume of commercially valuable timber destroyed and its potential value, 3) the costs involved in controlling beaver damage to forest stands and technical installations and 4) the income derived from the sale of beaver hunting privileges on a large (61, 500 hectare) and intensively managed commercial forest in southeast Norway. The field study was conducted in 1993 on 3469 hectares (6 %) of the forest, divided into 648 managed stands. All waterways here were censused in July and 38 beaver colonies located of which 19 (50 %) were active. Density of active colonies was 0. 55 kolonies/km 2. The combined area affected by tree felling and impoundment from dam building was defined as the beaver "activity area". The total beaver activity area comprised 2. 8 % of the upland study area and 2. 9 % of the productive forest area. Present and recently impounded forest comprised 7 % of the beavers total activity area and only 0. 2 % of the upland study area. Fiftyfive percent of this inundated area was classified as bog and of little value for commercial tree production. Thus only 0. 1 % of the productive forest on the study area and been impounded. This low proportion of impounded area was due mainly to the beaver’s use of already existing bodies of water and the mountainous topography of the region. Assuming that inundated forest is permanently removed from commercial production, then flooding by beaver, in the long run, should reduce this landowners income by about 0. 1 %. <b>No</b> <b>Norway</b> spruce (Picea abies) or Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestrus) was found felled. Beaver removed 50 % of the birch (Betula pubescens) and 60 % of the aspen (Populus tremula) ≥ 10 cm diameter breast high (dbh) from 2. 6 % of the study area. This amounted to 1. 3 % of the harvestable broadleaves there. On 43 % of the productive forest area within the beaver activity area, the forest management plan called for heavy thinning of most young birch and aspen to enhance conifer growth. Felling by beaver within these stands probably accomplished much of the same task, probably creating production benefits for the forester rather than damage. Between 1970 - 93 the landowner paid trappers to remove problem animals and allowed employees and others to hunt beaver for free. After 1993, an increasing number of hunters have paid for the right to hunt beaver on this property. In 1998 the landowner paid 60, 000 Norwegian crowns (about $ 7700 American dollars) to control beaver damage on the entire property, while income from the sale of beaver hunting rights amounted to 20, 000 crowns. Based on estimates of population density, it is predicted that about 10 times as many beaver could be harvested from the property on a sustained basis as were removed in 1998. With the present rapid increase in demand for beaver hunting, income from hunting may soon surpass the cost of controlling damage for this landowner. Due to initial high densities of broadleaves following clear-cutting, it was predicted that intensive forestry practices may actually enhance beaver density. At the landscape level, the presence of beaver is likely to increase biodiversity in commercial forests - a major goal of Norwegian forest management...|$|E
