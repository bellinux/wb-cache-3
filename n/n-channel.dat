25|$|For {{devices of}} equal current driving capability, <b>n-channel</b> MOSFETs {{can be made}} smaller than {{p-channel}} MOSFETs, due to p-channel charge carriers (holes) having lower mobility than do <b>n-channel</b> charge carriers (electrons), and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler. These were the driving principles {{in the design of}} NMOS logic which uses <b>n-channel</b> MOSFETs exclusively. However, neglecting leakage current, unlike CMOS logic, NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place. With advances in technology, CMOS logic displaced NMOS logic in the mid-1980s to become the preferred process for digital chips.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we used LB-nTM, {{a direct}} {{printing}} method, to fabricate {{an array of}} organic complementary inverters using single-crystal TIPS-PEN and C 60 nanowires as p- and <b>n-channels,</b> respectively, and Ag micron-sized structures as electrodes. It was found that both the width and {{the height of the}} cross sections of the channels should be around 100  nm or less in order to produce single-crystal structures. The OFET arrays based on the single-crystal nanowires show highly uniform field-effect mobilities of 1.01 [*]±[*] 0.14 and 0.10 [*]±[*] 0.01 cm 2 V− 1  s− 1 for TIPS-PEN and C 60, respectively. The complementary inverter array with TIPS-PEN nanowires as p-channels and C 60 nanowires as <b>n-channels</b> showed good performance with a gain of ~ 25. Printed single-crystal organic nanowire arrays could potentially be used in organic nanowire integrated electronics for transparent, flexible, inexpensive, and large-area applications.|$|R
30|$|The {{fabrication}} of {{an array of}} single-crystal organic nanowire inverters was initiated by generation of a single-crystal TIPS-PEN nanowire array, as active p-channels, on 200  nm-thick SiO 2 /p+-Si substrates using LB-nTM. Subsequently, an array of single-crystal C 60 nanowires as active <b>n-channels</b> was placed alongside the TIPS-PEN nanowire array using LB-nTM. Next, on this substrate with the two printed nanowire arrays, source and drain electrodes of 1.5  μm-thick Ag were prepared and placed by LB-nTM so as to electrically connect the arrays of p-type and n-type FETs, producing an array of complementary inverters.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Deformed Superheavy Nuclei (1983 - 85) a bridge connects the island of SHE to known isotopes of lighter elements. What we know experimentally and theoretically on the nuclear structure of SHE is reported in a first section. The making of the elements with an analysis of production cross sections and its macroscopic limitation to Z = 112 + #epsilon# is presented in a second section. The break-down of fusion cross sections in the ''Coulomb Falls'' within a range of about 10 elements is introduced as the universal limiting phenomenon. How the nuclear structure of the collision partners modifies the on-set of this limitation is presented in section 3. Reactions induced by deformed nuclei are pushed by side collisions to higher excitation energies (4 n-and 5 <b>n-channels),</b> whereas reactions driven by the cluster-like, closed-shell nuclei, " 2 " 0 " 8 _ 1 _ 2 _ 6 Pb and " 1 " 3 " 8 _ 8 _ 2 Ba, are kept at low excitation energies (1 n- and 2 <b>n-channels).</b> The on-set of production limitation for deformed collision partners is moved to smaller effective fissilities x = 0. 68 #=# 0. 72 and x 0. 79 #>=# 0. 72 for " 1 " 3 " 8 Ba and " 2 " 0 " 8 Pb, respectively.

The company was a second source for Intel MOS/LSI {{circuits}} by 1973, with products such as Am14/1506 and Am14/1507, dual 100-bit dynamic shift registers. By 1975, AMD was producing 212 products – of which 49 were proprietary, including the Am9102 (a static <b>N-channel</b> 1024-bit RAM) and three low-power Schottky MSI circuits: Am25LS07, Am25LS08, and Am25LS09.|$|E
40|$|Annealing of {{radiation}} damage {{was investigated in}} the commercial, Z- and J-processes of the RCA CD 4007 A ICs in the temperature range from - 140 C to + 375 C. Tempering curves were analyzed for activation energies of thermal annealing, following irradiation at - 140 C. It was found that at - 140 C, the radiation-induced shifts in the threshold potentials were similar for all three processes. The radiation hardness of the Z- and J-process is primarily due to rapid annealing {{of radiation}} damage at room temperature. In the region - 140 to 20 C, no dopant-dependent charge trapping is seen, similar to that observed at higher temperatures.

40|$|A {{series of}} four novel n-type {{molecules}} has been synthesized. Unlike previous approaches, the end group of these molecules was fixed and the molecular core was varied. The resulting materials were thoroughly analyzed.

In addition, prototypical organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) (forming <b>n-channels</b> in OFETs) have been fabricated and tested. The correlation between the device performance of the respective OFETs (i. e., electron mobility) and their electronic as well as structural properties was investigated.

40|$|Enhanced {{electron}} trapping {{has been observed}} in <b>n-channels</b> of rad-hard CMOS devices due to electron and gamma-ray irradiation. Room-temperature annealing results in a positive shift in the threshold potential far beyond its initial value. The slope of the annealing curve immediately after irradiation was found to depend strongly on the gate bias applied during irradiation. Some dependence was also observed on the electron dose rate. No clear dependence on energy and shielding over a delidded device was observed. The threshold shift is probably due to {{electron trapping}} at the radiation-induced interface states and tunneling of electrons through the oxide-silicon energy barrier to fill the radiation-induced electron traps.

25|$|In an <b>n-channel</b> 'depletion-mode' device, a {{negative}} gate-to-source voltage causes a depletion region {{to expand in}} width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the active region expands to completely close the channel, {{the resistance of the}} channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch (see right figure, when there is very small current). This is called 'pinch-off', and the voltage at which it occurs is called the 'pinch-off voltage'. Conversely, a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily (see right figure, when there is a conduction channel and current is large).|$|E
25|$|In an <b>n-channel</b> 'enhancement-mode' device, a {{conductive}} channel {{does not exist}} naturally within the transistor, and a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create one. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a {{conductive channel}}. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added {{to the body of}} the FET; this forms a region with no mobile carriers called a depletion region, and the voltage at which this occurs {{is referred to as the}} threshold voltage of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called inversion.|$|E
30|$|A {{large-scale}} {{array of}} complementary inverters made of single-crystal TIPS-PEN and C 60 organic nanowires was prepared on a 2 -inch Si wafer {{as shown in}} Figure  2 (a). The inverter array was fabricated by direct printing through LB-nTM as demonstrated in a schematic illustration that focuses on a single complementary inverter (Figure  2 (b)). First, a single-crystal TIPS-PEN nanowire array was generated on a Si substrate as active p-channels using LB-nTM. Subsequently, an array of single-crystal C 60 nanowires as active <b>n-channels</b> was placed alongside the TIPS-PEN nanowire using LB-nTM. Next, a pair of 1.5  μm-thick Ag structures with 3  μm gap between them were defined as source and drain electrodes to contact the TIPS-PEN nanowires and the C 60 nanowires on the substrate by LB-nTM so as to prepare the arrays of p-type and n-type OFETs {{as well as the}} complementary inverters.|$|R
30|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} and electrical characterization of a wafer-scale array of organic complementary inverters using single-crystal 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-PEN) and fullerene (C 60) nanowires as p- and <b>n-channels,</b> respectively. Two arrays of single-crystal organic nanowires were generated consecutively on desired locations {{of a common}} substrate with a desired mutual alignment by a direct printing method (liquid-bridge-mediated nanotransfer molding). Another direct printing of silver micron scale structures, as source and drain electrodes, on the substrate with the two printed nanowire arrays produced an array of complementary inverters with a bottom gate, top contact configuration. Field-effect mobilities of single-crystal TIPS-PEN and C 60 nanowire field-effect transistors (FETs) in the arrays were uniform with 1.01 [*]±[*] 0.14 and 0.10 [*]±[*] 0.01 cm 2 V− 1  s− 1, respectively.

Uniform alloyed surface morphology is observed in Ni/AuGe/Ni/Au contacts, while the blistered surface appearance of the Ni/AnTe/Ni/Au sys-tem correlates with degraded performance.

25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or <b>n-channel</b> at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|The MOSFET is used {{in digital}} {{complementary}} metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and <b>n-channel</b> MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating {{is a major concern}} in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.|$|E
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an <b>n-channel</b> device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch. Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E
40|$|Desensitization of μ- and κ-opioid receptor-mediated {{inhibition}} of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels was studied in a Xenopus oocyte translation system. In the oocytes coexpressing κ-opioid receptors with N- or Q-type Ca 2 + channel α 1 and β subunits, the κ-agonist, U 50488 H, inhibited both neuronal Ca 2 + channel current responses in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner and the inhibition was reduced by prolonged agonist exposure. More than 10 [*]min {{was required to}} halve the {{inhibition of}} Q-type channels by the κ-agonist. However, the half-life for the inhibition of N-type channels was only 6 ± 1 [*]min. In addition, in the oocytes coexpressing μ-opioid receptors with N-type or Q-type channels, the uncoupling rate of the μ-receptor-mediated inhibition of <b>N-channels</b> was also faster than that of Q-type channels. In the oocytes coexpressing both μ- and κ-receptors with N-type channels, stimulation of either receptor resulted in a cross-desensitization of the subsequent response to the other agonist. Treatment of oocytes with either H- 8 (100 [*]μM), staurosporine (400 [*]nM), okadaic acid (200 [*]nM), phorbol myristate acetate (5 [*]nM) or forskolin (50 [*]μM) plus phosphodiesterase inhibitor did not affect either the desensitization or the agonist-evoked inhibition of Ca 2 + channels. These {{results suggest that the}} rate of rapid desensitization is dependent on the α 1 subtype of the neuronal Ca 2 + channel, and that a common phosphorylation-independent mechanism underlies the heterologous desensitization between opioid receptor subtypes...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of InGaAs <b>n-channels</b> in CMOS devices requires an intervening buffer layer of GaAs or InP between a Si substrate and the InGaAs channel layer, {{which has to}} be planarized to enable {{the growth of a}} channel that is free of defects due to uneven surface topography. This report discusses the material removal rates (RRs) and AsH 3 evolution observed during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of GaAs using aq. solutions of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and silica slurries containing H 2 O 2. GaAs RRs were negligible with deionized water or with silica slurries alone. They were relatively high in aq. solutions of H 2 O 2 alone and showed a strong pH-dependence, with significantly higher RRs in the alkaline region. The addition of silica particles to aq. H 2 O 2 did not increase the GaAs RRs significantly. The evolution of arsenic trihydride (AsH 3) during the dissolution of GaAs in aq. H 2 O 2 solution was similarly higher in the basic pH range than in neutral pH or in the acidic pH range. However, no AsH 3 was measured during polishing, evidently because of the relatively high water solubility of AsH 3. In this report, GaAs removal rates and AsH 3 formation are analyzed using data from contact angle measurements, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-Ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. Reaction pathways leading to material removal are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Tottering, a {{mouse model}} for absence {{epilepsy}} and cerebellar ataxia, carries a mutation in the gene encoding class A (P/Q-type) Ca 2 + channels, the dominant exocytotic Ca 2 + channel at most synapses in the mammalian central nervous system. Comparing tottering to wild-type mice, we have studied glutamatergic transmission between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Results from biochemical assays and electrical field recordings demonstrate that glutamate release from parallel fibre terminals of the tottering mouse is controlled largely by class B Ca 2 + channels (N-type), {{in contrast to}} the P/Q-channels that dominate release from wild-type terminals. Since <b>N-channels,</b> in a variety of assays, are more effectively inhibited by G proteins than are P/Q-channels, we tested whether synaptic transmission between parallel fibres and Purkinje cells in tottering mice was more susceptible to inhibitory modulation by G protein-coupled receptors than in their wild-type counterparts. GABAB receptors and α 2 -adrenergic receptors (activated by bath application of transmitters) produced a three- to fivefold more potent inhibition of transmission in tottering than in wild-type synapses. This increased modulation is likely to be important for cerebellar transmission in vivo, since heterosynaptic depression, produced by activating GABAergic interneurones, greatly prolonged GABAB receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition in tottering as compared to wild-type slices. We propose that this enhanced modulation shifts the balance of synaptic input to Purkinje cells in favour of inhibition, reducing Purkinje cell output from the cerebellum, and may contribute to the aberrant motor phenotype that is characteristic of this mutant animal...|$|R
25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the <b>n-channel</b> case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value ({{a negative}} voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an <b>n-channel</b> enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its ohmic behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E

The low-field high electron mobility for narrow bandgap III-V semiconductors such as InAs and InSb and high hole mobility for Ge and GaSb make them possible {{to operate at}} low drain and gate bias voltages thus with low power dissipation. To enable high-mobility channel materials for logic applications, the oxide/semiconductor interface quality is essential. ^ In this thesis, I mainly focus on the interface studies of atomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al 2 O 3 as gate dielectric on narrow bandgap materials such as InSb and InAs, for <b>n-channels</b> and GaSb and Ge for p-channels. By using multi-frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) approaches, we can determine the Dit (Interface Trap Density) vs energy level within the semiconductor bandgap. The interface study includes both (100) and (111) orientations since the atomic structure on different crystal orientations plays {{a very important role}} in terms of the interface quality.
