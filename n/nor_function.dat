40|$|There is {{currently}} a great debate about whether the holobiont, i. e. a multicellular host and its residential microorganisms, constitutes a biological individual. We propose that resident microorganisms have a general and {{important role in the}} individuality of the host organism, not the holobiont. Drawing upon the Equilibrium Model of Immunity (Eberl 2016), we argue that microorganisms are scaffolds of immune capacities and processes that determine the constituency and persistence of the host organism. A scaffolding perspective accommodates the contingency and heterogeneity of resident microorganisms while accounting for their necessity and unifying contributions to host individuality. In our symbiotic view of life, holobionts may not be organisms or units of selection, but macroorganisms cannot persist <b>nor</b> <b>function</b> without their scaffolding microorganisms.

Modification of microcapsules aimed at reducing pore size should prevent PFO and improve graft survival. This study investigated the effect of increased gelling time (20 vs. 2 min) in barium chloride on intrinsic properties of alginate microcapsules and tested their biocompatibility in-vivo. Prolonged gelling time affected neither permeability nor size of the microcapsules. However, prolonged gelling time for 20 min produced brittle microcapsules compared to 2 min during compression test. Encapsulation of human islets in both types of microcapsules affected neither islet viability <b>nor</b> <b>function.</b> The presence of PFO when transplanted into a large animal model such as baboon and its absence in small animal models such as rodents suggest that the host immune response towards alginate microcapsules is species rather than alginate specific. 9 page(s...|$|E
