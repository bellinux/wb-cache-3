40|$|More than 85 % of {{ruminants}} in Zambia {{are found}} in the traditional smallholder sector and their production is limited by inadequate nutrition during the dry-season. This is because these animals depend on fibrous crop-residues and natural pasture which are usually in short supply and of low nutritive value. Inadequate nutrition in the dry season often results in reduced productive and reproductive performance of livestock which culminate in substantial economic losses to the farmers. The approach to improved nutrition of smallholder owned animals in the dry-season may be through increased utilisation of on-farm feed resources. The first approach would be to teach farmers to conserve wet-season fodder for dry-season supplementation of animals. The next step would be to improve the feeding quality of available fodder. This may be done through treatment of crop residues with urea or poultry manure and supplementation of animals with urea/molasses blocks. The quality of dry-season feed materials may also be enhanced through intercropping of cereals with fodder legumes or establishment of fodder gardens. Farmers must also be taught new methods for improving their <b>natural</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> through establishment of fodder legumes, selected thinning of browse species, introduction of rotational grazing and reduction of animal stocking rates.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2006 / 07 in Metema district, North Gondar Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia, with the objectives to characterize the existing rangeland and to determine the feed resources utilization practices, to assess the <b>natural</b> <b>grazing</b> land condition based on herbaceous, woody and soil condition and to evaluate the chemical composition of major livestock feed resources of the area. A single-visit formal survey, group discussions and visual observations are used to collect the primary information and secondary sources are also used in livestock feed resources assessment of the district. A total of 140 respondents from 7 kebeles were selected for interviewing by stratified random sampling techniques. To assess the range conditions, the samples were collected by classifying the district into cotton–livestock and sesame–livestock farming systems. Within a farming system, grazing lands were further stratified into three sampling areas: communal, road side and enclosure <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> In each of the range sites a sampling block of 4 km × 1 km was demarcated and this was further stratified into four sampling plots of equal size. In each of the plot, a belt transects of 50 m × 4 m was laid out randomly. Then, the parameter used for (herbaceous, soil and woody) grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, soil erosion, soil compaction, seedling count, age distribution and woody density enumeration, canopy cover and hedging were determined. For the height classes 1 – 3 m, > 3 – 4. 5 m and > 4. 5 m was used. Feed samples were stratified by season and types and subjected to chemical analysis for determination of DM, ash, CP, ADF, ADL and IVDMD. About 83 % of the inhabitants in the district practice mixed crop–livestock farming system. The mean family size is 5. 31 ± 0. 20 persons per household, while the average land holding is 6. 78 ± 1. 33 ha/household. The mean livestock holding per household is 12. 52 ± 6. 23 TLU, and is composed of cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys and camels. Natural pasture (55. 7 %), crop residues (20. 7 %), stubble (14. 3 %) and hay (9. 3 %) are the major feed resources for dry season whereas in the wet season only natural pasture serves as feed resource. The total estimated DM yield of grazing land and stubble is 780, 750 and 51, 954 t DM per annum, respectively. The total estimated available feed supply is 833, 531. 2 t DM per annum. Of the identified 33 herbaceous species, 14 and 19 are different grasses and non-grass species. From the non-grass species 6 legumes and 13 sedges and other species are recorded. Of the grasses, 23. 07 %, 38. 46 % and 30. 77 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. Of the identified 20 woody species, 15 %, 35 %, and 50 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. The largest proportion of woody vegetation is contributed by different species of acacia (20 %) and commbretum (10 %). Trees and shrubs grouped within the height class of > 1 – 3 m constituted 41. 2 % in communal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas,</b> 38. 5 % in road side grazing and 33. 3 % in enclosures. Range condition assessment factors such as basal cover, litter cover, grass species composition, woody vegetation density, canopy cover, hedging effect, age distribution and total condition score are significant (P< 0. 05) in communal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> of the sesame–livestock than in the cotton–livestock farming system. The communal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> have significantly (P< 0. 05) higher values of grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, age distribution, and woody species density score, than the road side <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> and lower (P< 0. 05) than the enclosure <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The dry matter biomass of grass, highly desirable, desirable species of grasses and legumes and others obtained in the same farming system were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the road side grazing types and lower (P< 0. 05) in total grass biomass, highly desirable grass, and total biomass than enclosure areas. The total dry matter biomass, dry matter biomass of grass and highly desirable grasses, and legumes are significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the enclosure followed by communal grazing and the road side <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> In general, there is low feed resources conservation and utilization and very poor traditional grazing land management system in Metema. The abundant feed resources in the wet season are wasted. In the dry season, grasses are turned to ash by wild and man-made fire in the process of forest honey harvesting and crop land cleaning. As a result, the livestock populations seriously suffer from the critical feed shortage during the long dry season. The rangeland, species composition and biomass production are also affected by human, livestock and natural factors (biotic and abiotic factors). The human population of the district has increased due to settlement programs, investment induced settlers, expanding crop cultivation and have increased the pressure on the rangelands and <b>natural</b> <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Bush encroachment and overgrazing are also serious problems. Shifting cultivation practice is also contributing to the increased bush encroachment. The seasonal movement and transhumant livestock production by highlanders in adjacent districts also increases the grazing intensity. Absence of adequate baseline information about the rangeland resources, unsynchronized seasonal availability of feed resources and cropland encroachment to the rangeland are some of the main constraints of the district, and studies on rangeland management systems and improved livestock production should be initiated.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the diet composition of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in late summer in different kinds of grazing conditions in northernmost Finland. The composition of diet by reindeer was determined {{on the grounds of}} microhistological analysis of feces samples collected in early August in different seasonal <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> (winter or summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas)</b> in three reindeer management districts. Although the proportion of different plant groups varied between the studied districts, the quantified group of ground lichens (which also contained small amounts of mushrooms) was the most abundant, varying from 33. 0 to 46. 4 % in the analyzed samples. In general, there were significant differences in the proportions of lichen between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> The proportion of lichen in samples increased significantly when the amount of lichen pasture around a sample site increased. The proportion of dwarf shrubs and leaves in samples varied from 24. 9 to 37. 9 % and differed significantly between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> In the same way, the proportion of graminoids varied between 20. 9 and 36. 2 % and differed significantly between districts and also between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Higher amounts of graminoids in feces were observed in summer/year-round <b>grazing</b> <b>areas</b> than in winter <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> Finally, the proportion of bryophytes varied between 2. 9 and 6. 5 % and was significantly different between districts, but not between <b>grazing</b> <b>areas.</b> An increase in old and mature coniferous forest around a sample site significantly increased the amounts of bryophytes in samples. The results indicate that reindeer adapt their summer diet composition according to the availability of food plants. The results also show that when reindeer are allowed to select their summer ranges freely, reindeer tend to use lichen pastures intensively also during summer, which causes a considerable reduction in lichens due to grazing and trampling. Therefore, a proper seasonal pasture rotation system to protect lichen pastures from grazing and trampling, from early spring to late autumn, {{is an essential part of}} sustainable pasture use in reindeer herding...|$|R

Wintering geese feeding in the polder are expected to prefer <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> due to a shorter sward, a higher protein content, a higher tiller density and less bare ground in these areas than in areas with other management types. Therefore, the expectation is that geese prefer sheep grazed grass to cattle grazed grass, which is {{at that time of}} year, ungrazed grass. In a choice-experiment, where the geese could choose between two treatments, two geese were allowed to forage on the treatment of their choice. Foraging time was used as an indication for the foraging preference of the geese. Several vegetation parameters were measured for each treatment. The geese showed a large preference for the sheep <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> compared to ungrazed <b>areas.</b> The sheep <b>grazed</b> <b>area</b> had a higher tiller density, a lower sward height and biomass and the intake rate of sheep grazed grass was higher than in the ungrazed parcels.

The geese preferred grazing on sheep grazed compared to goose <b>grazed</b> <b>areas.</b> The goose <b>grazed</b> <b>areas</b> have a lower sward height, a lower biomass and a lower intake rate. Height and not treatment seems to be the major determinant a goose selects on.
