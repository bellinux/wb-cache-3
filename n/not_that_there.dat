500|$|Although Smith {{has never}} {{been one of the}} most commercially {{successful}} or career-driven artists, she is one of country music's most celebrated and respected. Music critics, fans, and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history. Music critics have often compared Smith's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline, due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing. In his review of Smith's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith, Jurek explained why Smith's vocals are usually compared to Cline's, [...] "Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline's throne. It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> aren't many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it." [...] Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith's version of [...] "The Wonders You Perform", but never got around to doing so. In a discussion with country songwriter Fred Foster, Dolly Parton famously said, [...] "You know, there's really only three female singers in the world: Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, and Connie Smith. The rest of us are only pretending".|$|E

2500|$|Though the Supreme Court did not {{explicitly}} decide whether Benitez met the proper standard, its opinion nonetheless proceeded with an unfavorable analysis of his case. [...] The Court believed that his {{statements in the}} record showed {{that he may have}} been confused about the substantive law of the safety valve provision, but <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "causal link" [...] between his confusion and the Rule 11 violation.

[...] This was especially true because the written plea agreement included the warning that it would be irrevocable, and it had been read to him in Spanish. [...] The Court accordingly reversed the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case.|$|E
2500|$|Second Chance {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics.

Entertainment Weeklys Mikael Wood commented that [...] "his ethereal vocals still shimmer so effortlessly", and called it [...] "the year's most elegant tell-all". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "DeBarge simply soars, his feather-light vocals still in top form". Steve Jones of USA Today felt that DeBarge's [...] "sweet, soaring falsetto remains intact, and he has lost none of his knack for writing catchy, romantic tunes".

2500|$|In 1997, {{economist}} Jeffrey Sachs said, [...] "My {{concern is}} <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are too many}} sweatshops, but {{that there are too}} few." [...] Sachs and other proponents of free trade and the global movement of capital cite the economic theory of comparative advantage, which states that international trade will, in the long run, make all parties better off. The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do [...] "better" [...] than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-1917, Colter made known his {{intentions}} {{to run for}} the governorship on the Democratic ticket in 1918. In declaring his intention to run, Colter said: [...] "It has never occurred to me until recently that I could further assist in bringing about better results in the democratic situation by running for State office but, as I have had so many personal requests and letters from all over the state from people who think I am the logical man to get the party together, to counteract the immense Republican machine, I have decided {{to run for the}} governorship of the state." [...] While he was seen as a strong candidate, it was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> weren't several strong opponents vying for the Democratic nomination. When the former governor, Hunt, announced that he had no intention on contending for the governorship in 1918, Sidney Osborn was a favorite for the nomination, representing the more conservative arm of the Democratic Party, and Colter established himself as the favorite of what some considered the radical part of the Democrats. While Hunt did not openly endorse him, most of his backers threw their support behind Colter. In late February, another prominent Arizona Democrat, Benjamin Baker [...] "Billy" [...] Moeur announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor at the meeting of the Arizona Cattlemen's Association in Nogales, Arizona. In June, Judge Fred Sutter officially entered the race, although he had been discussed as a possible contender since March. After Sutter's entrance into the race, Hunt officially threw his support behind Colter. In the midst of the race, Colter purchased a large home at the southwest corner of Central Avenue and McKinley Street in Phoenix, for the sum of $20,000.|$|E
