5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> vandalism.|$|E
5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he was equally disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and {{a great number of}} his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system built into the palace's foundation, years of <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> damage, and population loss.

5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E

5|$|By 1978, {{the number}} of Amin's {{supporters}} and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed {{as a result of}} the years of <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile. In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General Mustafa Adrisi, was injured in a car crash, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border. Amin accused Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of Tanzanian territory, and formally annexed a section of the Kagera Region across the boundary.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year. A series of businesses opened and closed in the building, with none finding lasting success. In the late 1960s, landlord David Kircher bought the building, using it as a warehouse. From 1996 until 2005, the building was tied up in legal disputes. Kircher was found guilty of demolition by <b>neglect,</b> <b>and</b> first Barnes and Barnes and then Beal Properties were named receivers. In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great ironworks furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Nash {{formed the}} Steve Nash Foundation. Through grants {{to public service}} and nonprofit entities, the {{foundation}} aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty, illness, abuse, or <b>neglect,</b> <b>and</b> create opportunity for education, play, and empowerment. It focuses its resources on communities in Phoenix, Arizona, and British Columbia, Canada. It was given charitable status in 2004. This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008. Nash also founded the Jim Jennings Memorial Endowment Fund, established in honour of a volunteer staff member at Santa Clara University who served the basketball team for more than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Robert Foehl {{died and}} Evelyn Foehl sold {{the hotel to}} Ramada, a hotel chain. The Ramada {{managers}} remodeled the hotel, stripping out and covering {{much of what they}} considered an outdated interior. The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho. Though it remained a fashionable location for a while, its original character was largely absent and it began to suffer from <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> disrepair. It continued to host conferences and business meetings, such as the Natural Health, Aromatherapy and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000, and the Arizona LANBasher's League party in early 2001. Later that year, the hotel closed and was put on the market. Plans for its demolition were considered when no offers were made. To protect it, Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance, and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to place it on the Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past. To save it from demolition, business partners Scott Lyon and Bill Nassikas of Westroc Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $80M. Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003, two years after the hotel was closed for renovation.|$|E
5|$|The tax was {{rescinded}} by the British in 1812, {{who then}} imposed a British style constitution on the island. One legal innovation {{of this time}} of particular consequence for the aristocracy was that creditors, who had previously only been able to enforce repayments of the interest on a loan or mortgage, could now seize property. Property began to change hands in smaller parcels at auctions, and consequently a land-owning bourgeoisie immediately began to flourish. Revolts against the Bourbons in 1821, and 1848 divided the nobility, and liberalism was in the air. These factors coupled with {{the social and political}} upheaval of the following Risorgimento in the 19th century meant the Sicilian aristocracy was a doomed class. Furthermore, because of their <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> dereliction of noblesse oblige, an essential element of the feudal system, the countryside was often ruled by bandits outside the enclosed villages, and the once grand country villas were decaying. The building mania of the Sicilian upper class was over.|$|E
