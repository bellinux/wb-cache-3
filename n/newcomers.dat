30|$|In Chord, after hashing the <b>newcomer’s</b> IP {{address and}} {{generating}} its nodeId, the system relies on some external mechanism {{to introduce the}} <b>newcomer</b> to an existing node in the overlay. Afterwards, the existing node will generate a lookup message to find the successor of the <b>newcomer</b> based on its generated nodeId. The <b>newcomer</b> will then connect to its successor and join the overlay. CAN {{on the other hand}} assumes the existence of a domain name server that maintains the addresses of bootstrapping nodes which hold partial lists of available nodes in the overlay. In order to join the overlay, the <b>newcomer</b> has first to obtain the address of one of the bootstrapping nodes. Later, the <b>newcomer</b> contacts this node in order to retrieve a list of randomly selected available nodes. Finally, the <b>newcomer</b> sends a join request to one of those nodes which accordingly splits its zone in half and assigns it to the <b>newcomer.</b>|$|R

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American <b>newcomers</b> had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these <b>newcomers,</b> William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents {{neighborhood}} of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, and Pleasant Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E

40|$|The {{innovative}} <b>newcomer</b> program concept, {{developed as}} a model {{to meet the needs}} of the growing limited-English-proficient (LEP) population in American classrooms, is described. <b>Newcomer</b> programs function as temporary stopcvers for recently arrived LEP immigrant and refugee students. They operate on the assumption that LEP <b>newcomer</b> students need a period of adjustment not only to the education system but also to the U. S. social environment. These students face such challenges as language limitations, less than age-appropriate education, lack of familiarity with the U. S. school system, and personal trauma and low self-esteem. <b>Newcomer</b> programs feature orientation to school and society, specialized curriculum, access to support services, individualized attention, specialized teacher training, and multicultural education. A variety of <b>newcomer</b> programs are in place in California, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. <b>Newcomer</b> identification and placement are described, along with program components and support services of the <b>newcomer</b> curriculum. Three models are discussed, including: all day, school within a school (Los Angeles); half day, separate site (Hayward, California); and all day, separate site (Long Island City, New York).
