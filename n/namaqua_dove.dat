40|$|Birds show phylogenetic {{variation}} in {{the relative importance of}} respiratory versus cutaneous evaporation, but the consequences for heat tolerance and evaporative cooling capacity remain unclear. We measured evaporative water loss (EWL), resting metabolic rate (RMR) and body temperature (Tb) in four arid-zone columbids from southern Africa [Namaqua dove (Oena capensis, ∼ 37  g), laughing dove (Spilopelia senegalensis, ∼ 89  g) and Cape turtle dove (Streptopelia capicola, ∼ 148  g) ] and Australia [crested pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes), ∼ 186  g] at air temperatures (Ta) of up to 62 °C. There was no clear relationship between body mass and maximum Ta tolerated during acute heat exposure. Maximum Tb at very high Ta was 43. 1 ± 1. 0, 43. 7 ± 0. 8, 44. 7 ± 0. 3 and 44. 3 ± 0. 8 °C in <b>Namaqua</b> <b>doves,</b> laughing doves, Cape turtle doves and crested pigeons, respectively. In all four species, RMR increased significantly at Ta above thermoneutrality, but the increases were relatively modest with RMR at Ta= 56 °C being 32, 60, 99 and 11 % higher, respectively, than at Ta= 35 °C. At the highest Ta values reached, evaporative heat loss was equivalent to 466, 227, 230 and 275 % of metabolic heat production. The maximum ratio of evaporative heat loss to metabolic production observed in <b>Namaqua</b> <b>doves,</b> 4. 66, exceeds by a substantial margin previous values reported for birds. Our results support the notion that cutaneous evaporation provides a highly efficient mechanism of heat dissipation and an enhanced ability to tolerate extremely high Ta.

40|$|Environmental {{temperatures}} {{that exceed}} body temperature (Tb) force endothermic animals to {{rely solely on}} evaporative cooling to dissipate heat. However, evaporative heat dissipation can be drastically reduced by environmental humidity, imposing a thermoregulatory challenge. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of humidity on the thermoregulation of desert birds and to compare the sensitivity of cutaneous and respiratory evaporation to reduced vapor density gradients. Rates of evaporative water loss, metabolic rate, and Tb were measured in birds exposed to humidities ranging from ∼ 2 to 30 g H 2 O m 23 (0 %– 100 % relative humidity at 307 C) at air temperatures between 447 and 567 C. In sociable weavers, a species that dissipates heat primarily through panting, rates of evaporative water loss were inhibited by as much as 36 % by high humidity at 487 C, and these birds showed a high degree of hyperthermia. At lower temperatures (407 – 447 C), evaporative water loss was largely unaffected by humidity in this species. In <b>Namaqua</b> <b>doves,</b> which primarily use cutaneous evaporation, increasing humidity reduced rates of evaporative water loss, but overall rates of water loss were lower than those observed in sociable weavers. Our data suggest that cutaneous evaporation is more efficient than panting, requiring less water to maintain Tb at a given temperature, but panting appears less sensitive to humidity over the air temperature range investigated here.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesClimate change poses a {{major threat}} to living organisms, with maximum {{temperatures}} expected to continue to rise over the next few decades. Hot desert environments are particularly at risk because they experience high environmental temperatures, scarce vegetation, low productivity and unpredictable water sources. Endotherms such as birds face the challenge of maintaining a stable body temperature while avoiding dehydration. This study was carried out in the southern Kalahari, in South Africa's Northern Cape, where about 50 % of bird species (36 species) depend on free-standing drinking water. Livestock farms within this area provide artificial water points, which benefit birds as well as livestock. This study determined the role of shade and cover in the use of these artificial water points by birds. An experiment was conducted at six waterholes using the Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) design. After an initial baseline was established, three waterholes were shaded while the other three were left unshaded. Camera traps were used to record the pattern and intensity of water use by bird species at different times of the day and at varying air temperatures. A total of 36 bird species drank at the water holes, but data analysis was confined to the ten most abundant species. Of the ten, six species responded to the presence of shade/cover, with four species reacting positively (Cape Glossy Starling Lamprotornis nitens, Red - headed Finch Amadina erythrocephala, Black - throated Canary Serinus atrogularis, and Laughing Dove Spilopelia senegalensis), four showing no significant change in drinking patterns, and two showing a decrease in visitor numbers when the site was shaded (Cape Turtle - Dove Streptopelia capicola, <b>Namaqua</b> <b>Dove</b> Oena capensis). This suggests that providing shade at waterholes is not a universal {{solution to the problem of}} increasing heat stress experienced by birds coming to drink. Certain species such as the Laughing Doves and Cape Turtle-Doves avoided waterholes during the warmest time of the day while the Namaqua Doves were frequent visitors at this time. However, the Laughing Dove took advantage of the shade provided at midday (warmest temperatures) as their numbers increased. The Red-headed Finch and Black-throated Canary also increased at water holes with temperature irrespective of the time of day. These patterns imply that the provision of shade modifies the behavior of some bird species in response to predation risk or heat stress. These species utilized shade at different times of day and with varying intensities as temperatures rose...|$|E
