40|$|Abstract Broadband Internet {{access is}} now widely {{available}} to home users, providing better data transfer rates than dial-up Internet access. However this improvement in technology {{comes at a}} price, with home users at {{an increased risk of}} unauthorised access to their resources and information {{as a result of the}} 'always on' nature of Broadband. These <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> <b>mean</b> that there is a need to provide a web-based risk analysis tool specifically for home users which overcome the problems associated with both the current standards and techniques available and the security guidelines provided by various websites. The standards and techniques require expertise in security and risk analysis, are oriented towards organisations and may be prohibitively expensive. The websites do not provide a clearly defined path to improved security, they assume a certain level of knowledge and understanding, they provide an overwhelming amount of information, and generally recommend products that must be purchased. The prototype tool developed as part of this research is designed around the relevant sections of the IS 017799 standard. The advantage of this is that it is based on an industry wide standard that has been adapted specifically to the home user. The standard indicates why various security controls are required but does not indicate how to implement them. The tool provides this implementation information along with advice on secure working practices. In addition to this functionality additional information is included so that it also serves as an educational tool, indicating the various threats and the ways in which to detect that the computer security has been compromised.

40|$|This paper revisits {{social policy}} {{developments}} in Belgium {{in the decade}} 2000 - 2010 {{on the basis of}} stylized facts with regard to spending, employment, the social policy caseload, dependency rates and poverty. With regard to spending it focuses on the long-term evolution in Belgian public social spending {{and the extent to which}} the observed spending pattern accommodated the perceived emergence of <b>new</b> social <b>risks.</b> By <b>means</b> of ‘budgetary effort indicators’, the analysis disentangles the impact of demographic evolutions from deliberate shifts in broad policy priorities. In addition, the paper addresses some critical points in the performance of the Belgian welfare state, such as the rising number of children at risk of poverty, the need to anticipate long-term demographic ageing, and (briefly) the need for structural changes in parts of the health care system. I conclude that preparing the next wave of social reform is imperative for this country. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{discussion}} of “new risks ” {{in the field}} of social policy started to gain attention in the late 1990 s. It is commonly argued that <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> are provoked by deindustrialization and/or globalization and that <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> tend to be more concentrated among the young, women and low skilled individuals. This study commences its inquiry with a scientific conceptualization of social risk in an attempt to critically rethink the argument of <b>new</b> <b>risk.</b> A reevaluation of the concept is followed by an empirical investigation of the question whether {{there is such a thing}} as <b>new</b> <b>risk</b> and whether there might be a convergence in the characteristics of <b>new</b> <b>risk</b> as the literature suggests. A lack of comparative empirical evidence on <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> in the existing literature calls for an investigation of advanced economies both from the global West, as well as the East. 18 countries are selected in order to provide a comparative account to understanding <b>new</b> <b>risk.</b> These are comparatively analyzed using the fuzzy-set qualitative analysis method (fs/QCA) discover different types of social risks and to measure degrees of changes in relation to social risk. In sum, this paper aims to answer two questions: 1) What is <b>new</b> <b>risk?</b> and 2) How do the characteristic of risks differ in different post-industrial countries? This study contributes to the <b>new</b> <b>risk</b> discussion not only theoretically and empirically, but also methodologically...|$|R

Our methodology uses actual fund trades to identify funds that actively change risk. Funds that are statistically identified as trading to change return variance or tracking error variance do not exhibit <b>risk</b> <b>mean</b> reversion. Mostly, funds trade to reduce risk and, in particular, tracking error variance. This is most evident for funds that previously attained a low tracking error variance.

30|$|Results During 3  years, 82 {{patients}} (51 female, {{median age}} 69, 5, ranging from 24 to 89, 48 {{with more than}} 65  years) were admitted due to PE, more frequently from the Emergency Service (86, 6  %).The most common symptoms were dyspnea (61  %), chest pain (50  %) and syncope (24, 4  %) and 54 patients were classified as low probability PE using Wells Criteria. Computed Tomography was positive in 97, 6  % of patients. Using Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) Score, 9 patients had very low <b>risk</b> score (<b>mean</b> age 40, 4 [*]±[*] 7, 1  years), 13 low <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 50 [*]±[*] 16, 9  years), 26 moderate <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 70, 4 [*]±[*] 10, 3  years), 14 high <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 71, 4 [*]±[*] 12, 6  years)and 18 very high <b>risk</b> score (<b>mean</b> age 72, 6 [*]±[*] 14, 2  years). Age was different between PESI Score classes (p[*]<[*] 0, 001). The most common DVT risk factors were age, peripheral venous insufficiency (24, 4  %), obesity (23, 2  %), previous immobilization (17, 1  %). In the ICU, 10 patients were admitted due to massive PE, 23 submassive PE, 11 due to hypoxemia and 23 for other reasons, more frequently due to the need constant monitoring. DVT was confirmed in 17 patients. Thrombolytic therapy was administered to 29 patients (13 submassive PE; 13 massive PE), 3 with registered complications (haemoptysis, haematuria and multiple hematomas and skin haemorrhage). Ventilation and vasopressor support were needed in 7, 3  %. One patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit; 1 died in ICU, 2 after discharge of ICU and 2 in the next 6  months.|$|R

For patients at high risk, established guidelines recommend warfarin, or aspirin if anticoagulants are contraindicated; for those at medium risk, either may be used. Of 156 with atrial fibrillation (acute, chronic or paroxysmal), 119 were at high <b>risk,</b> <b>mean</b> age 79 years. According to the guidelines, 89 of these were suitable for anticoagulation but only 49 (55 %) received warfarin; 27 received aspirin and 13 neither. Of 27 patients at medium <b>risk</b> (<b>mean</b> age 70 years), 6 were not prescribed any antithrombotic therapy. This survey indicates that guidelines on antithrombotic therapy are commonly disregarded and that, in particular, warfarin is underutilized in the group for whom it is most indicated...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{societies}} are increasingly faced with <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> {{as a result}} of the co-evolution of society and technology. From 1975 to the present, more than three hundred Dutch dairy farmers have been confronted with cattle that experienced serious health problems.

Such scientific uncertainty typically accompanies <b>new</b> <b>risks</b> and causes difficulty in scientifically, politically, and judicially determining which party must be held responsible and or accountable for the situation.
