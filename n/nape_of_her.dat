5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E
25|$|Mary was a {{striking}} {{six feet tall}} presence with a curvy figure. She had large grey eyes set in an oval face, glossy chestnut-brown hair drawn back into a loose knot at the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, and delicate hands and feet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly--in her American way; a long face, {{with the}} hair parted {{in the middle and}} hanging over the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck. <b>Her</b> mouth is quite classic.' ...|$|R
60|$|She had unpinned her hat {{and thrown}} {{it on the}} seat opposite, showing the immense mass <b>of</b> <b>her</b> black hair, rolled low in the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the {{columnar}} neck and looped over the left ear. But Conroy had no eyes except for her grave eyes.|$|R
6000|$|He said nothing. He {{looked into}} her eyes while he {{struggled}} with her fingers about the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> his neck, and suddenly he tore her hands apart, holding her arms up in a strong grip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wrists, and bending his swollen face close over hers, he said-- ...|$|R
25|$|Mating occurs from May through June. Copulation is {{preceded by}} {{numerous}} head-bobs {{on the part}} of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to maneuver his tail under hers to position himself for intromission. Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. Anywhere from two to eighteen eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. The eggs go through a 90- to 100-day incubation period hatching in September and October. It has been noted that Cyclura eggs are some of the largest eggs laid by any lizard.|$|E
500|$|While filming Bachna Ae Haseeno in 2008, Padukone began {{a romantic}} {{relationship}} with co-star Ranbir Kapoor. She spoke openly about the relationship and sported a tattoo of his initials on the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck. She {{has said that the}} relationship {{had a profound effect on}} her, transforming her into a more confident and social person. The Indian media speculated on an engagement, and reported that this had occurred in November 2008, although Padukone had stated that she had no plans to marry within the next five years. The couple broke up a year later; she professed in an interview to feeling [...] "angry" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] for a long time, but insisted that they remained on good terms. In a 2010 interview, Padukone made a comment that the media speculated was a reference to her break-up with Kapoor: ...|$|E
500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be [...] "the perfect soldier," [...] Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold her breath underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name [...] "Guevara" [...] for herself.|$|E
40|$|In Monilethrix, {{the hair}} shaft is beaded and breaks easily. Elliptical nodes 0. 7 - 1 mm apart, are {{separated}} by narrower internodes. Histologically, the follicles show wide and narrow zones corresponding to the nodes and internodes. Clinically, there is a considerable variation in age of onset, severity and course. Follicular keratosis is also seen on occiput and <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> neck. In many cases the condition persists with little change. A lady with her two children came to our OPD with complaint of complete loss <b>of</b> hair <b>of</b> <b>her</b> male child, aged 5 yrs, since birth and complete loss <b>of</b> eyebrows <b>of</b> <b>her</b> female child, aged 6 yrs, with diffuse loss of hair since birth. Their father also had hair loss with similar type of beaded hair. Papular eruptions could be seen all over the scalp and <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> neck. Oral gresiofulvin along with nutritional support {{was given to the}} children as treatment and prognosis was explained to the mother...|$|R

2500|$|The title {{suggests}} the woman may be pondering a risky affair. [...] Utamaro uses {{a limited number}} of colours in the print; the deep blacks of the protective collar around her kimono and her large, rounded hairstyle draws the attention, contrasting with the white of the woman's face and <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck.|$|E
60|$|I saw her shrug her {{uncovered}} shoulders impatiently. Her forehead {{was against}} the very blackness of the panes; pulled upward from the beautiful, strong <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, the twisted mass of her tawny hair was held high upon her head by the arrow of gold.|$|E
60|$|Totty, however, had {{descended from}} her chair with great swiftness, and was already in retreat towards the dairy {{with a sort of}} {{waddling}} run, and an amount of fat on the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.|$|E

60|$|The throng {{carried her}} out just before him. He could nearly touch her. She {{did not know}} he was there. He saw the brown, humble <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck under its black curls. He would leave himself to her. She was better and bigger than he. He would depend on her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You carried {{yourself}} first rate," [...] said Lingard, {{smiling at}} the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, her ear, the film of escaped hair, the modelling {{of the corner of}} her eye. He could see the flutter of the dark eyelashes: and the delicate flush on her cheek had rather the effect of scent than of colour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadn't {{you better}} go in?" [...] he suggested, after {{watching}} {{for a while}} the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, a patch of dazzling white skin and soft shadow above the sombre line of her shoulders. Her wrap had slipped down to her elbows. [...] "You'll have all the town coming out presently. I'll wait here a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|Swiftly but silently the man {{reached down}} and hauled Eliphalet to the {{sidewalk}} by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck.|$|R
60|$|He {{closed his}} eyes obediently. She slipped a cool hand under the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> his neck and let it rest.|$|R

60|$|They {{turned to}} follow Madame into the house. And as Alvina went before him, {{she felt his}} fingers stroke the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck, and pass in a soft touch right down her back. She started as if some unseen {{creature}} had stroked her with its paw, and she glanced swiftly round, to see the face of Ciccio mischievous behind her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Nor was he {{disappointed}} entirely, for as {{she walked}} away she raised one hand to the black, waving mass at the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck--the peculiarly feminine gesture that admits cognizance of appraising eyes behind her--and Tarzan saw upon a finger of this hand the ring of strange workmanship {{that he had seen}} upon the finger of the veiled woman a short time before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well!" [...] he said, {{a little}} doubtfully, [...] "it's just a phase," [...] and {{bent down and}} rested {{his hand on her}} {{shoulder}} for a moment, with his heart beating and his nerves a-quiver. Then as she lay very still, with her hands clinched and her black hair tumbled about her face, he came still closer and softly kissed the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck....|$|E
50|$|Size: 10-11 inches (25-28 cm). The top <b>of</b> {{head and}} <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> neck are {{brilliant}} red, while {{the remainder of}} the head is white. The mantle, back and wings are black, narrowly barred with white. The breast and abdomen are yellowish-brown, with an orange patch in centre of lower abdomen. The tail is black. The red on the head of the female covers only a portion of the crown, but also extends to the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck.|$|R

60|$|Clara sat in {{the cool}} parlour reading. He saw the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck, and the fine hair lifted from it. She rose, looking at him indifferently. To shake hands she lifted her arm straight, {{in a manner that}} seemed at once to keep him at a distance, and yet to fling {{something}} to him. He noticed how her breasts swelled inside her blouse, and how her shoulder curved handsomely under the thin muslin {{at the top of her}} arm.|$|E
60|$|Engaged in {{the study}} of her ear and the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white neck, he {{suddenly}} became aware of the presence of a lady still further ahead in the aisle, whose attire, though of black materials in the quietest form, was of a cut which rather suggested London than this Ultima Thule. For the minute he forgot, in his curiosity, that Avice intervened. The lady turned her head somewhat, and, though she was veiled with unusual thickness for the season, he seemed to recognize Nichola Pine-Avon in the form.|$|E
60|$|Jean {{heard a noise}} at {{the cabin}} door, a rustle, and then a knock of {{something}} hard against wood. Silently he moved {{his head to look}} down through a crack between the rafters. He saw the glint of a rifle leaning against the sill. Then the doorstep was darkened. Ellen Jorth sat down with a long, tired sigh. She took off her sombrero and the light shone on the rippling, dark-brown hair, hanging in a tangled braid. The curved <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> neck showed a warm tint of golden tan. She wore a gray blouse, soiled and torn, that clung to her lissome shoulders.|$|E
