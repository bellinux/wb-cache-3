25|$|The {{discovery}} by Hertz in 1887 {{that the}} incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with <b>negative</b> <b>electricity,</b> rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by Elster and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the <b>negative</b> <b>electricity</b> {{under the influence of the}} electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.|$|E

He favoured archaic spellings such as [...] "shew" [...] for [...] "show"; he dropped the [...] "u" [...] in words like [...] "honour" [...] and [...] "favour"; and wherever possible he rejected the apostrophe in contractions such as [...] "won't" [...] or [...] "that's". In his will, Shaw ordered that, after some specified legacies, his remaining assets were to form a trust to pay for fundamental reform of the English alphabet into a phonetic version of forty letters.

I consider (1) a marketing regime that requires an {{independent system operator}} to transfer all available renewable electricity at zero prices to the spot market, and (2) a marketing regime where renewable plant operators directly sell their electricity on the spot or forward market. Similar marketing options coexist in Germany. I find that the dumping of renewable electricity at zero prices on the spot market is more beneficial for competition but bares the risk of negative prices at low levels of demand.

Again, {{in cases}} of {{disruptive}} discharge, as in the spark, there is frequently a dark part (1422.) which, by Professor Johnson, {{has been called the}} neutral point[A]; and this has given rise to the use of expressions implying that there are two electricities existing separately, which, passing to that spot, there combine and neutralize each other[B]. But if such expressions are understood as correctly indicating that positive electricity alone is moving between the positive ball and that spot, and <b>negative</b> <b>electricity</b> only between the negative ball and that spot, then what strange conditions these parts must be in; conditions, which to my mind are every way unlike those which really occur! In such a case, one part of a current would consist of positive electricity only, and that moving in one direction; another part would consist of <b>negative</b> <b>electricity</b> only, and that moving in the other direction; and a third part would consist of an accumulation of the two electricities, not moving in either direction, but mixing up together! and being in a relation to each other utterly unlike any relation which could be supposed to exist in the two former portions of the discharge. This does not seem to me to be natural. In a current, whatever form the discharge may take, or whatever part of the circuit or current is referred to, as much positive force as is there exerted in one direction, so much negative force is there exerted in the other. If it were not so we should have bodies electrified not merely positive and negative, but on occasions in a most extraordinary manner, one being charged with five, ten, or twenty times as much of both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>electricity</b> in equal quantities as another.

The proposed methodology can be employed to neutralize the positively charged pollutants in air, which {{are believed to be}} harmful to our health. Methodology: Atmospheric ions can be collected by a negatively charged antenna which comprises a dielectric layer sandwiched between a top aluminium layer and a bottom lead plate. The top aluminium layer is used to collect the ambient protons, whilst the bottom lead plate is negatively charged by a <b>negative</b> static <b>electricity</b> extracted from flowing water. The voltage has been measured between the top aluminium layer and the bottom lead plate with and without any sunlight. Results: Without any UV light or other electromagnetic disturbance, the generated voltage has rapidly increased from 200 mV to 480 mV within 5 seconds if the bottom lead plate is connected to the negative ion source. Without the negative ion source, however, the output voltage fell to around 10 mV and any significant voltage rise can be observed even in the presence of an UV light. Conclusions: Capturing atmospheric ions is technically feasible. Measured results suggest that, when used in conjunction with a negative ion source, the proposed device can harvest atmospheric ions without any UV light. </p...|$|R

This research project mainly scrutinize, whether {{the objectives of}} the electricity subsidies have been fulfilled or not. Further, both positive and <b>negative</b> impacts of <b>electricity</b> subsidy is descriptively discussed. Appropriate remedial actions are proposed for the betterment of identified indirect negative impacts. In the analysis, it was found that some primary objectives of the electricity subsidy have not been achieved. One of the most subtle negative impact recognised is the encouragement of energy inefficient equipment usage among subsidized consumers. A case study was conducted in Ratnapura District to investigate the energy inefficient equipment usage and to quantify the electricity wastage. Findings were used to estimate the electricity wastage in whole country due to inefficient equipment. Further, {{it was found that the}} existing tariff structure encourages the energy inefficient equipment usage and it acts contradictory to the fundamentals. As a possible way of saving electricity and catering the demand at night peak, replacement of incandescent lamps were analyzed and possible saving were estimated. Moreover the investment on replacing incandescent lamps by energy efficient equipment was estimated and financially evaluated with the returns. Additionally, it was found that the eligibility criteria of current subsidy is having many loopholes. The major shortcoming is that it allows unwanted people to enjoy the subsidy. The additional burden to the treasury has been estimated as LKR 11 billion per year. It was seen that modifications are needed for electricity subsidy eligibility to ensure only needy people receive the electricity subsidy. Meanwhile modifications are needed for tariff rates fixing method. New equation shall be introduced based on actual generation cost for the tariff rates calculation with appropriate justifications. Further it is recommended to reduce the electricity subsidy gradually to zero. Discouragement of energy inefficient equipment usage by introducing new taxes, promoting energy efficient equipment, introducing subsidies to energy efficient equipment and conducting awareness programs regarding the electricity conservation are the other recommendations to minimize the <b>negative</b> impacts of <b>electricity</b> subsidy...|$|R

Some estimates state {{that for every}} 10 MW of incremental renewable capacity, 8 MW of reserve capacity need to be readily available [10]. This added capital cost expenditure is counteracted by the negative marginal cost of renewable generation operations. Since wind and solar facilities do not burn fuel and have extremely low {{operation and maintenance costs}} [16], the <b>negative</b> cost of <b>electricity</b> production is driven largely by the 2.3 -cent per kWh renewable PTC. The credit applies to the first ten years of plant operations, and current law gradually phases down the credit amount through 2019 [17]. Therefore, renewable power producers are actually willing to pay a small amount to supply their generation, outbidding other steam plants with low operating costs [18]. Once a renewable plant has been constructed with relatively high capital costs, it is the lowest cost generation option during the periods in which it is able to produce electricity.|$|R

60|$|The most {{familiar}} exemplification {{of the phenomenon}} to be investigated is the following. Around the prime conductors of an electrical machine the atmosphere to some distance, or any conducting surface suspended in that atmosphere, {{is found to be}} in an electric condition opposite to that of the prime conductor itself. Near and around the positive prime conductor there is <b>negative</b> <b>electricity,</b> and near and around the negative prime conductor there is positive electricity. When pith balls are brought near to either of the conductors, they become electrified with the opposite electricity to it; either receiving a share from the already electrified atmosphere by conduction, or acted upon by the direct inductive influence of the conductor itself: they are then attracted by the conductor to which they are in opposition; or, if withdrawn in their electrified state, they will be attracted by any other oppositely charged body. In like manner the hand, if brought near enough to the conductor, receives or gives an electric discharge; now we have no evidence that a charged conductor can be suddenly discharged unless by the approach of a body oppositely electrified. In the case, therefore, of the electric machine, it appears that the accumulation of electricity in an insulated conductor is always accompanied by the excitement of the contrary electricity in the surrounding atmosphere, and in every conductor placed near the former conductor. It does not seem possible, in this case, to produce one electricity by itself.|$|E

3000|$|Individualization of {{electricity}} is another possibility to reduce load synchronization. To this end, Muratori and Rizzoni (2015) put forward {{the idea of}} “multi-TOU” where distinct tariff signals are distributed to {{a limited number of}} consumer pools. We extend this approach in the form of group pricing (GR) where customers are assigned to groups and members of one group receive the same electricity rate. This approach can be generalized to allow various differentiation degrees, including personal pricing. For an electric utility the application of group pricing requires three basic decisions—determine the number of different groups, assign customers to groups and specify a rate for each group. In the following section we analyze various group sizes including the limit case of fully individualized electricity rates. With respect to customer assignment, we only apply randomly allocation of customers to the groups. 9 To individualize group rates, we adopt a randomized approach. To this end, we add noise ϵ _t(σ [...]) to an underlying RT rate, yielding the randomized group prices ([...] p^GROUP_t). 10 The standard deviation σ reflects the level of rate individualization, that is how different the group-specific price vectors should be. The truncation on [-p_t,∞ [avoids <b>negative</b> retail <b>electricity</b> prices. The center panel of Fig. 4 depicts the aggregated EV load for 25 groups and a standard deviation level for tariff randomization, σ = 4. Looking at aggregate EV charging load, we observe that total load is distributed and RES generation can be exploited. Therefore, group pricing can also reduce over-coordination {{and at the same time}} induces load-shifting to hours with net availability of wind power. In Sect. 5.3 we discuss in more detail the effects of randomization and group size on load synchronization and RES utilization.|$|R

In this study possible effects of climate variability and change on electricity generation in Germany are analyzed.

While hydro power plants and thermal power plants are affected negatively due to declining river discharge or higher water temperatures, for wind power generation no clear tendency was found. The reduction for hydro power generation could be leveled out by a slight increase in installed capacity and modernization of turbines and generators. By a replacement of old once-through cooling systems by closed-circuit cooling systems for new thermal power plants the <b>negative</b> impacts on <b>electricity</b> generation can be reduced significantly.

40|$|<b>Negative</b> {{prices for}} <b>electricity</b> are a novelty in European power markets. At the German EEX spot market {{negative}} hourly prices have since occurred frequently, down to values as extreme as minus several hundred €/MWh. However, in some non-European markets as USA, Australia and Canada, negative prices are a characteristic {{for a longer}} period already. Negative prices are in fact natural for electricity spot trading: plant flexibility is limited and costly, thus, incurring a negative price for an hour can nevertheless be economically optimal overall. Negative prices pose a basic problem to stochastic price modelling: going from prices to log-prices is not possible. So far, this has been dealt with by “workarounds”. However, here a thorough approach is advocated, based on the area hyperbolic sine transformation. The transformation is applied to spot modelling of the German EEX, the ERCOT West Texas market and the exemplary valuation of an option. It is concluded that the area hyperbolic sine transform is well and naturally suited {{as a starting point for}} modelling negative power prices. It can be integrated in common stochastic price models without adding much complexity. Moreover, this transformation might be in general more appropriate for power prices than the log transformation, considering fundamentals of power price formation. Eventually, a thorough treatment of negative prices is indispensable since they significantly affect business. ...|$|R
