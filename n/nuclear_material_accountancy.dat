Cosmic ray muons are a naturally occurring form of radiation, are highly penetrating and exhibit large scattering angles on high Z materials. Specifically, we investigated how radiographic and tomographic techniques can be effective for non-invasive nuclear waste characterization and for <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> of spent fuel inside dry storage containers. We show that the tracking of individual muons, as they enter and exit a structure, can potentially improve the accuracy and availability of data on nuclear waste and the contents of Dry Storage Containers (DSC) used for spent fuel storage at CANDU plants. This could be achieved in near real time, {{with the potential for}} unattended and remotely monitored operations.

By integrating process- and operation-related information and methodologies within an unified modeling and monitoring framework that includes not only current but also past plant behaviors, the task of anomaly detection is greatly improved because this decision-making approach can benefit from not only known time-series relationships among measured signals but also from known event sequence relationships among generated events.

40|$|Abstract The {{regulatory}} control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (<b>nuclear</b> safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being licensed, imported and installed. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. STUK maintains a national <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> activities and <b>materials.</b> In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The results of STUK’s nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2016 continued to demonstrate that Finnish licence holders take good care of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> There were no indications of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2016. By means of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2016, the number of inspection days was significantly higher at a total of 98, owing to the system inspections carried out during the year as a part of STUK’s periodic inspection programme. In contrast to this, there was no survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, resulting in only 12 IAEA inspection days in 2016, whereas, the Commission needed 18 inspection days to fulfil its duties in 2016. A major goal of all current Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task as demonstrated twice during 2016. The human resources development at the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section during 2016 was focused on <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> control: in particular, standard operational procedures were addressed within the nuclear regulator departments. At the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section, the new <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> database was developed in this context. Due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site, safeguards instrumentation was under development, in particular the passive gamma emission tomography for the verification of spent fuel. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK also contributed to EU-funded projects in Tanzania and Vietnam, respectively. STUK and Finnish Customs finalised the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officer training and the updating of the technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance and}} modernise the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Material</b> <b>Accountancy</b> and Control (NMAC) at Mayak RT- 1 {{reprocessing}} plant {{the concept of}} near real time accountancy (NRTA) is applied. A defence in depth concept is proposed with the superposition of the following barriers: (i) 	continuous survey of the functional status, (ii) 	the follow-up of the nuclear material (NM) flow and inventory, (iii) 	Near real time control of declared NM in processed solutions, (iv) 	Periodical Physical Inventory Takings and Verifications. The combination of an operational network architecture, allowing automatic data acquisition and an efficient plant-specific data analysis and interpretation software enables to follow in near real-time the NM flow and inventory through the plant. The JRC data analysis and interpretation kernel DAI integrated with the commercial data historian Wizcon is proposed to establish the RT- 1 specific NM monitoring software tool. The data analysis focuses firstly {{on a combination of}} the pressure signals (for level and density) and the temperature signal, determining the total volume. This is then combined with the volume concentration measurement performed by the hybrid K-edge to derive the total mass of nuclear material. Once the complete system is validated, it can be applied also to other Russian reprocessing plants at Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. JRC. G. 8 -Nuclear safeguard...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} {{community in the}} post-Cold War period {{has suggested that the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) utilize its expertise in support of the arms control and disarmament process in unprecedented ways. The pledges of the US and Russian presidents to place excess defense materials, some of which are classified, under some type of international inspections raises the prospect of using IAEA safeguards approaches for monitoring classified materials. A traditional safeguards approach, based on <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy,</b> would seem unavoidably to reveal classified information. However, further analysis of the IAEA`s safeguards approaches is warranted in order to understand fully the scope and nature of any problems. The issues are complex and difficult, and it is expected that common technical understandings will be essential for their resolution. Accordingly, this paper examines and compares traditional safeguards item accounting of fuel at a nuclear power station (especially spent fuel) with the challenges presented by inspections of classified materials. This analysis is intended to delineate more clearly the problems as well as reveal possible approaches, techniques, and technologies that could allow the adaptation of safeguards to the unprecedented task of inspecting classified materials. It is also hoped that a discussion of these issues can advance ongoing political-technical debates on international inspections of excess classified materials...|$|E
40|$|The United States {{has long}} {{supported}} a strong international safeguards system {{and for many}} years {{has served as the}} foremost supplier of technology, equipment, and training to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In doing so, it drew in many instances on DOE sponsored R&D and training that was directed towards domestic safeguards and then adapted for IAEA purposes. This was relatively straightforward because of the strong overlap between the development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> measures needed for both domestic and international purposes. Two factors have emerged that have made this strong reliance on domestic measures less and less able {{to be a source of}} support for the IAEA. One is the shift by the IAEA safeguards system towards detecting undeclared activities. The second is the shift of domestic attention away from <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> and towards physical protection. As a result, a gap in US sponsored R&D and training relevant to international safeguards has developed. The NNSA Next Generation Safeguards Initiative and the DOE NA- 22 Safeguards R&D program are intended to help fill this gap and, thereby, permit the U. S. to remain as the pre-eminent supplier of technology for international safeguards purposes. In this context, IAEA challenges have been examined from the perspective of detecting the diversion of nuclear material from declared stocks; detecting undeclared production of nuclear material and activities at locations declared under INFCIRC/ 153; and detecting undeclared nuclear material and activities elsewhere in a state. Of these, the detection of undeclared nuclear material and activities is, perhaps, the IAEA’s most significant challenge. It is a challenge that even the international community finds difficult to meet because of the scope and the geographic scale of the problem, the technical constraints, the knowledge required, and the significant resources needed to deploy effective systems world-wide (e. g., satellite surveillance systems). The IAEA’s success in carrying out this mission hinges on its capability to evaluate the declarations made by the state for completeness, correctness, and consistency in order to detect possible indications of undeclared nuclear material and activities. Three elements go into this evaluation: (1) evaluating the internal consistency of a State’s declaration and comparing it to information gathered by IAEA inspectors on the basis of their access to the locations, facilities, sites, personnel, and documents disclosed in the state’s declarations; (2) comparison of States’ declarations with other information available to the IAEA, including the information it gathers from its review of open sources, including scientific and technical literature and data bases, trade journals, and media reports; and (3) its ability to archive, retrieve, organize, and analyze all available information for indications of potential undeclared nuclear material and activities, and, when warranted, to request states to provide further information and access in order to investigate and clarify any questions or inconsistencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{regulatory}} control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (<b>nuclear</b> safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to uphold the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is exercised by the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK'’s nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2014 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> There were no indications of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the licence holders’ declarations. Safeguards are applied to <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy,</b> control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> – often referred to as “licence holders” or “operators” – and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the nonproliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At then end of 2013, the new STUK regulations – called YVL Guides – entered into force. All the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. The approval process will continue in 2015. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (uranium, plutonium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the third reactor under construction at the Olkiluoto site are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the fourth reactor at the Olkiluoto power plant and at a new nuclear power plant site Hanhikivi in Pyhäjoki were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors will be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators have submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. In December 2013, Fennovoima announced that the Hanhikivi reactor will be supplied by Rusatom Overseas. This was not included as an option in the application of 2009, and thus the re-evaluation of the conditions for the previous authorisation was carried out in 2014, resulting in new Decision-in-Principle endorsed by the Parliament in December 2014. In parallel with this, the TVO application to extend the time line for the fourth unit was denied by the Government. Owing to these decisions, the construction licence applications are expected in 2015. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval from the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economical issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014; and, finally in November 2014 the Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK. STUK maintains a central national <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union legislation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to guarantee that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> activities and <b>materials.</b> In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level integrated safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2014. By means of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> and control systems, all licence holders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number in inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign carried out at Onkalo, the planned geological repository. In total, 65 working days were required for the one-week long scanning of the tunnels. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the government in December 2012. The licensing of the facility {{was one of the main}} topics over the year as a whole at STUK. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. This document will be included in the STUK statement to be finalised in 2015. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties that it is impossible to make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section during 2014 was focused on <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> control: in particular, information security issues were addressed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the applicability of isotope correlation techniques (ICT) to the Light Water Reactor (LWR) and the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) fuel cycles for <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> and safeguards surveillance. The isotopic measurement of the inventory input to the reprocessing phase of the fuel cycle is the primary direct determination that an anomaly may exist in the fuel management of nuclear material. The nuclear materials accountancy gap which exists between the fabrication plant output and the input to the reprocessing plant can be minimized by using ICT at the dissolver stage of the reprocessing plant. The ICT allows a level of verification of the fabricator's fuel content specifications, the irradiation history, the fuel and blanket assemblies management and scheduling within the reactor, and the subsequent spent fuel assembly flows to the reprocessing plant. The investigation indicates that there exist relationships between isotopic concentration which have predictable, functional behavior over a range of burnup. Several cross-correlations serve to establish the initial core assembly-averaged composition. The selection of the more effective functionals will depend not only on the level of reliability of ICT for verification, but also on the capability, accuracy and difficulty of developing measurement methods. The propagation of measurement errors on the correlation functions and respective sensitivities to isotopic compositional changes have been examined and found to be consistent with current measurement methods...|$|E
40|$|Quality Control (QC) {{is a set}} of procedures, {{including}} technical activities, {{to ensure}} that a final product or a performed service adheres to a defined set of quality criteria and meets the customer requirements. Quality assurance (QA) is defined as a systematic process to check whether a service/product under development is meeting specific requirements before the product or service is completed. The non-proliferation treaty (NPT) comprises a verification mechanism: nuclear safeguards. Safeguards aims at the verification of the non-diversion of fissile material from its intended and declared (peaceful) use. Therefore a reliable <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> system has to be established by the plant operator. This accountancy is subject to independent verification by the safeguards authorities. Measurement of samples (for their content in U or Pu and the respective isotopic composition) taken by inspectors remains the backbone of any verification system. Environmental sampling is a supplementary safeguards tool aiming at verifying the correctness and completeness of a state¿s declarations. The system of measurements applied in nuclear safeguards is expected to conform to the latest standards. This technical sheet lists the different aspects of QA and QC in analytical measurements, explains the fundamental role of reference materials, quality control samples, uncertainty of measurement results and interlaboratory comparisons in view of measurements of the nuclear fuel cycle materials.

40|$|Graduation date: 2018 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is {{the leading}} {{organization}} for monitoring nuclear facilities worldwide, and the Agency’s methods are constantly developing and improving {{in an effort to}} more effectively safeguard nuclear material. As such, the IAEA addresses near and long term risks in order to advance the capabilities of the IAEA inspectors to identify quantities of diverted material, known as defects. Advanced techniques enable the inspectors to decrease the uncertainty in measurements, which translates to smaller detectable defects. Recently, digital-imaging techniques for qualitative inspections of irradiated fuel using Cherenkov light measurements have advanced the Agency’s ability to perform verification measurements following discharge of the fuel from power reactor facilities. However, one area that continues to be difficult for the IAEA is the non-invasive, in-core inspection of research reactors with the objective of verifying the quantity of fissile isotopes. Current techniques do not quantify the relative fissile material content and cannot characterize a reactor during operations, limiting their value for safeguards and <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy.</b> Research reactors are typically smaller in size than power reactors, so identifying defects is innately more difficult. This study seeks to leverage existing optical measurement technology by assembling a new detecting method, the Cherenkov Radiation Assay for Nuclear Kinetics (CRANK) system, to identify and characterize Cherenkov light in an operating research reactor and to relate this signature to the quantity of fissile material in the reactor...|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} safeguards {{program for}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> {{is dependent on}} the integration of activities in the traditional safeguards elements: physical protection, protective force, and material control and accounting (MC&A). The design and integration of these traditional safeguards elements must be based on a technical analysis performed in characterizing the vulnerabilities and related risks of the facility against a designed-basis threat. Each of these elements requires a near seamless integration with each other, as well as within a site's operations organization. One of the key objectives of an effective <b>nuclear</b> <b>Material</b> Control and Accountability (MC&A) program is to address the threat posed by an active or passive 'insider' who, acting alone or in collusion, could attempt protracted or abrupt diversion or theft of special <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> (SNM). The function of <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> is to detect the loss or unauthorized removal of special <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> from the plant or facility in a timely manner. Detection is accomplished by means of measurements and transfer records of material movements and periodic inventories to verify that all material is accounted for. The function of material control is to assure the integrity of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> and the <b>accountancy</b> data. This paper focuses on {{the development and implementation of}} a detailed material control and accounting program plan that considers both regulatory compliance demands and performance standards. Consideration of both of these demands is necessary to reduce exposure to theft and diversion, to reduce regulatory jeopardy, and to minimize to the extent possible adverse impacts with site operations...|$|R
40|$|Executive summary The {{regulatory}} control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (<b>nuclear</b> safeguards) {{is a prerequisite}} for the peaceful use of nuclear energy in Finland. In order to maintain the Finnish part of the international agreements on nuclear non-proliferation – mainly the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – this {{regulatory control}} is implemented by the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section of the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK). The results of STUK's nuclear safeguards inspection activities in 2015 continued to demonstrate that the Finnish licence holders take good care of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> There were no indications of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> or activities and the inspected materials and activities were in accordance with the stakeholders' declarations. Safeguards are applied to <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> and activities that can lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. These safeguards include <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy,</b> control, security and the reporting of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities. The main parties involved in a state nuclear safeguards system are the facilities that use <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials,</b> often referred to as “licence holders” or “operators”– and the state authority. A licence holder shall take good care of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> and the state authority shall provide the regulatory control to ensure that the licence holder fulfils the requirements. The control of nuclear expert organisations, technology holders and suppliers, to ensure the non-proliferation of sensitive technology, is also a growing global challenge for all stakeholders. In Finnish legislation, all these stakeholders are dealt with as users of nuclear energy. At the end of 2013, the revised STUK requirements were published as regulatory guides on nuclear safety, security and safeguards, called YVL guides. According to the Guide YVL D. 1 Regulatory Control of Nuclear Safeguards all the stakeholders were requested to prepare their safeguards manuals as a part of their quality managements systems. During 2015, in total 19 draft manuals were submitted to STUK, and 14 of those were approved. Finland has quite significant nuclear power production, but the related nuclear industry is rather limited. Most of the declared <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> (uranium, plutonium and thorium) in Finland reside at the nuclear power plants in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. Additionally, there is the research reactor in Espoo, as well as a dozen minor <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> holders in Finland. Nuclear dual-use items and instrumentation for the Olkiluoto 3 reactor under construction are being imported and installed. The import licences are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the European Commission made their site visits to the construction site prior to the installation of safeguards instrumentation and fuel delivery. The planning and design of the Olkiluoto 4 reactor and a new nuclear power plant site, Hanhikivi in Pyhäjoki, were authorised in 2010. The safeguards systems for these new reactors shall be designed together with facility design and development. Similarly to the Olkiluoto 3 reactor that is under construction, the import licences for the new facilities are reviewed as applicable to ensure the peaceful use of the technology and sensitive information. The operators submitted the preliminary Basic Technical Characteristics to the European Commission and obtained Material Balance Area codes for the future reactors before the vendor companies were selected. During 2015, the construction licence application for the new Hanhikivi plant was submitted to the Government. The authorisation of the Olkiluoto 4 unit expired as the operator did not apply for the construction licence within the 5 year period of validity of the authorisation, i. e. the Decision-in-Principle by the Government, so the material balance area code was also withdrawn. The research reactor was shut down in 2015 and the preparations for decommissioning continue in Espoo. On the other hand, in order to continue research activities, the new VTT Centre for Nuclear Safety was under construction at the research campus in Espoo. Uranium production as one of the by-products of nickel at the Talvivaara mine was given approval by the Government in accordance with the nuclear energy legislation in March 2012. In 2013, the mining company constructed the uranium extraction plant, but the Supreme Administrative Court rescinded the approval, owing to claims of environmental and economic issues in December 2013 before the commissioning of the plant. The difficulties continued in 2014, and finally in November 2014 Talvivaara Sotkamo Ltd. filed for bankruptcy. During 2015 a new operator, Terrafame Mining Oy took over the mining and milling activities, but no uranium extraction nor safeguards activities took place at Talvivaara. Currently, uranium residuals are extracted from the nickel at Harjavalta Nickel Refinery and at Freeport Cobalt in Kokkola, and reported to STUK and to the European Commission. STUK maintains a national <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> system and verifies that nuclear activities in Finland are carried out in accordance with the Finnish Nuclear Energy Act and Decree, European Union Safeguards Regulation and international agreements. These tasks are performed to verify that Finland can assure itself and the international community of the absence of undeclared <b>nuclear</b> activities and <b>materials.</b> In addition to this, the IAEA evaluates the success of the state safeguards system, and the European Commission participates in safeguarding the materials under its jurisdiction. The application for the construction licence for the disposal facility, which consists of the encapsulation plant and the geological repository, was submitted to the Government in December 2012. During 2013 and 2014, the IAEA and the Commission defined the requirements for the safeguards equipment for the encapsulation plant in an interactive process with STUK and Posiva. These needs were included in the STUK statement and safety evaluation concerning the construction licence application finalised in February 2015. In November 2015 the Government granted the construction licence. In the meanwhile, the detailed design of the facility was updated resulting in the continuation of the planning of the safeguards system. The number of the routine inspection days of the international inspectorates has been reduced significantly due to the state-level safeguards approach for Finland, which has been in force since 2008. The number of international inspection days per year is approximately 25. Neither the IAEA nor the Commission made any remarks nor did they present any required actions based on their inspections during 2015. By means of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> <b>accountancy</b> and control systems, the stakeholders enabled STUK to fulfil its own obligations under the international agreements relevant to nuclear safeguards. In safeguards, STUK continues with 40 annual inspections and 60 inspection days. In 2014, the number of inspection days was significantly higher owing to the extensive survey campaign to verify the design of the planned geological repository, called Onkalo. In 2015 a concise survey campaign was carried out at Onkalo resulting in an increased number of inspection days since 2013. The number of annual inspection days for <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> holders has remained at 20 days per international inspectorate. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is one of the elements of the global nuclear non-proliferation effort. STUK has two roles in relation to the CTBT: STUK operates the Finnish National Data Centre (FiNDC) and one of the radionuclide laboratories (RL 07) in the CTBT International Monitoring Network (IMS). The main task of the FiNDC is to inspect data received from the International Monitoring System and to inform the national authority, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, about any indications of a nuclear weapons test. The FiNDC falls under the non-proliferation process in STUK’s organisation, together with the regulatory control of <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials.</b> A major goal of all current CTBT-related activities is the entry into force of the CTBT itself. An important prerequisite for such positive political action is that the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is functioning and able to provide assurance to all parties {{that it is impossible to}} make a clandestine nuclear test without detection. The FiNDC is committed to its own role in the common endeavour, so that the verification system of the CTBTO can accomplish its detection task. The human resources development at the <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Materials</b> Section during 2015 was focused on <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> control: in particular, information security issues were addressed. This was partly due to the need to regulate the construction of the disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel at the Olkiluoto repository site. In addition, STUK contributed to educational workshops and training courses for authorities who represent nuclear newcomers: countries that aim at uranium production or nuclear power in cooperation with the IAEA. STUK and Finnish Customs continued the joint multi-year border monitoring development project. The project covers customs officers training as well as the updating of technical equipment and of operational procedures. In 2014, the partnerships programme between King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy (K. A. CARE), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and STUK began supporting the establishment of the Saudi Arabia’s regulatory authority in relation to its nuclear energy programme. In the field of safeguards and nuclear security, STUK’s safeguards and security experts continued practical cooperation with their colleagues at K. A. CARE...|$|R

40|$|Large scale {{spent fuel}} {{reprocessing}} plants and fuel fabrication facilities require large numbers of grab samples taken for destructive analysis (DA) for <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> and safeguards. The resulting cost and radioactive waste generation is large and significant time is lost between the sample taking and the DA results. This paper presents an approach to combine nondestructive assay (NDA) with DA calibration and normalization {{to reduce the number}} of chemical analysis and shorten the time to obtain the results. For plutonium bearing samples, the preferred NDA system is a modified version of the high efficiency epithermal neutron counter. These are well-type neutron counters with efficiencies in the range of 60 - 70 % and short neutron die-away times. The counting precisions of the new counters are an order of magnitude better than for prior thermal-neutron counters for multiplicity analysis. The accuracy goal for the NDA is in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 5 % for the Pu- 240 effective mass. The stability and statistical precision of the neutron counters are better than 0. 1 %, and the total measurement error will be dominated by how well the standards from the DA laboratory match the samples measured with the NDA. The analysis of the neutron data can be performed in the simple coincidence (doubles) mode, or the “known-alpha ” mode, or the “multiplicity ” mode. Each of these modes has advantages and disadvantages depending on the experimental conditions. This paper will evaluate the analysis methods to obtain to obtain the best accuracy. Also, the preliminary design of a neutron counter that is optimized for the measurement of small samples such as powder and pellets will be presented...|$|E
40|$|International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{safeguards}} are {{one method}} of proliferation resistance which is applied at most nuclear facilities worldwide. IAEA safeguards act {{to prevent the}} diversion of nuclear materials from a facility through the deterrence of detection. However, even with IAEA safeguards present at a facility, {{the country where the}} facility is located may still attempt to proliferate nuclear material by exploiting weaknesses in the safeguards system. The IAEA's mission is to detect the diversion of nuclear materials as soon as possible and ideally before it can be weaponized. Modern IAEA safeguards utilize unattended monitoring systems (UMS) to perform <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> and maintain the continuity of knowledge with regards to the position of nuclear material at a facility. This research focuses on evaluating the reliability of unattended monitoring systems and integrating the probabilistic failure of these systems into the comprehensive probabilistic proliferation resistance model of a facility. To accomplish this, this research applies reliability engineering analysis methods to probabilistic proliferation resistance modeling. This approach is demonstrated through the analysis of a safeguards design for the Example Sodium Fast Reactor Fuel Cycle Facility (ESFR FCF). The ESFR FCF UMS were analyzed to demonstrate the analysis and design processes that an analyst or designer would go through when evaluating/designing the proliferation resistance component of a safeguards system. When comparing the mean time to failure (MTTF) for the system without redundancies versus one with redundancies, it is apparent that redundancies are necessary to achieve a design without routine failures. A reliability engineering approach to probabilistic safeguards system analysis and design can be used to reach meaningful conclusions regarding the proliferation resistance of a UMS. The methods developed in this research provide analysts and designers alike a process to follow to evaluate the reliability of a UMS...|$|E
40|$|As {{nuclear energy}} {{grows in the}} United States and around the world, the {{expansion}} of the nuclear fuel cycle is inevitable. All currently deployed commercial reprocessing plants are based on the Plutonium - Uranium Extraction (PUREX) process. However, this process is not implemented in the U. S. for a variety of reasons, one being that it is considered by some as a proliferation risk. The 2001 Nuclear Energy Policy report recommended that the U. S. "develop reprocessing and treatment technologies that are cleaner, more efficient, less waste-intensive, and more proliferation-resistant. " The Uranium Extraction (UREX+) reprocessing technique has been developed to reach these goals. However, in order for UREX+ to be considered for commercial implementation, a safeguards approach is needed to show that a commercially sized UREX+ facility can be safeguarded to current international standards. A detailed safeguards approach for a UREX+ 1 a reprocessing facility has been developed. The approach includes the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> (MA), containment and surveillance (C/S) and solution monitoring (SM). Facility information was developed for a hypothesized UREX+ 1 a plant with a throughput of 1000 Metric Tons Heavy Metal (MTHM) per year. Safeguard goals and safeguard measures to be implemented were established. Diversion and acquisition pathways were considered; however, the analysis focuses mainly on diversion paths. The detection systems used in the design have the ability to provide near real-time measurement of special fissionable material in feed, process and product streams. Advanced front-end techniques for the quantification of fissile material in spent nuclear fuel were also considered. The economic and operator costs of these systems were not considered. The analysis shows that the implementation of these techniques result in significant improvements in the ability of the safeguards system to achieve the objective of timely detection of the diversion of a significant quantity of nuclear material from the UREX+ 1 a reprocessing facility and to provide deterrence against such diversion by early detection...|$|E
40|$|The Fuel Conditioning Facility (FCF) treats spent {{nuclear fuel}} using an electrometallurgical process that {{separates}} the uranium from the fission products, sodium thermal bond and cladding <b>materials.</b> <b>Material</b> <b>accountancy</b> is necessary at FCF for two reasons: first, it provides a mechanism for detecting a potential loss of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> for safeguards and security; second, it provides a periodic check of inventories to ensure that processes and material are under control. By weighing material entering and leaving a process, and using sampling results to determine composition, an inventory difference (ID) results when the measured inventory is compared to the predicted inventory. The ID and its uncertainty, based on error propagation, determines the degree of assurance that an operation proceeded according to expectations. FCF uses the ID calculation in two ways: closeout, which is the ID and uncertainty for a particular operational step, and <b>material</b> <b>accountancy,</b> which determines an ID and its associated uncertainty for a material balance area through several operational steps. <b>Material</b> <b>accountancy</b> over the whole facility for a specified time period assists in detecting diversion of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material.</b> Data from depleted uranium operations are presented to illustrate the method used in FCF...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear fuel cycles {{safeguards}} {{should be}} considered in the dynamic context of a world deployment of various reactor types and varying availability of fuel-cycle services. There will be a close interaction between thermal-reactor cycles and the future deployment of fast breeders. The quantities of plutonium and the reprocessing, conversion, fabrication, and storage methods of the fuel for the fast breeders will {{have a significant impact on}} safeguards techniques. The approach to the fast breeder fuel cycle safeguards follows the general safeguards system approach proposed by the IAEA. Objective of IAEA safeguards is the detection of diversion of <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> and deterrence of such diversion. To achieve independent verification of <b>material</b> balance <b>accountancy</b> requires the capability to monitor inventory status and verify material flows and quantities of all <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> subject to safeguards.

Track III: Energy InfrastructureSuccess {{of global}} utilization {{of nuclear energy}} is highly dependent {{on the ability to}} deter any risk of nuclear proliferation. This is particularly important as we developed advanced Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuels using weapons-grade and/or recycled Plutonium. Therefore, it is exceedingly important to develop and deploy sound spent fuel monitoring technologies for Special <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Material</b> (SNM) <b>accountancy.</b> Nondestructive Burnup Analysis (NBA) using fission product gamma spectroscopy is a well documented process for UO 2. Currently 134 Cs, 137 Cs, and 154 Eu are being used either separately or in combination for estimating total burnup of UO 2. Our research is an extension of gamma spectroscopy based monitoring system for Plutonium. Given the performance similarities between UO 2 fuel and MOX fuel, investigations are underway to develop similar correlation for MOX. MOX fuel burnup and decay simulations were performed using ORIGEN-ARP (Oak Ridge Isotope Generation and Depletion Code - Automatic Rapid Processing). Several important gamma energy peaks were identified from these preliminary simulation results capable of discrimination between Uranium and Plutonium fission products. These peaks were experimentally confirmed using the Missouri S&T research reactor. Simulation results as well as experimental data are being analyzed to determine performance specifications of a detection system for field applications.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} safeguarding nuclear facilities, <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> (NMA), faces many challenges {{when applied to}} pyroprocessing facilities. To aid in the safeguarding of these facilities, process monitoring (PM) is being investigated as a complementary method to NMA. PM takes general process data, such as density, current etc., and applies it to safeguards {{through the use of}} a statistical framework. Signature Based Safeguards (SBS), a proposed statistical framework for the application of PM techniques, identifies anomalous scenarios and subsequently identifies and detects their respective PM signatures from a system of sensors. This work focuses both on assisting SBS through identifying anomalous scenarios, and on the computer modeling of these failure modes and the PM signatures for them. The anomalous scenarios investigated were mechanical failure modes with potential safeguards-significance as they could lead to the deposition of plutonium and other actinides in the final uranium product ingot. The signatures of these anomalous scenarios were primarily radiation signatures from a coincidence counter that is used to analyze the final ingots. Several different failure modes were identified for both the electrorefiner and the cathode processor. The signatures for these failure modes were then determined by coupling two separate computer models. The first model is a FORTRAN-based electrorefiner code named ERAD capable of modeling the mass transport of metals within an electrorefiner. The second model was an MCNP-based simulation of the Canberra JCC- 31 High Level Neutron Coincidence Counter. First, the identified failure modes were simulated by changing ERAD inputs. ERAD calculated an elemental mass composition at the cathode which was then used as the final ingot composition. The final ingot composition was analyzed for single and double neutron coincidence count rates using the MCNP model. The results demonstrate significant radiation signatures for the presence of plutonium as a result of the electrorefiner failure modes. Signatures from cathode processor failure modes were weak and thus warrant future investigation of better detectors for integration into a SBS framework.

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) and radioactive waste coming from the nuclear submarines and other nuclear powered ships have been accumulated in the former naval base at Andreeva Bay (Kola Peninsula, Murmansk Region). The Andreeva Bay site accumulating approximately 22, 000 spent nuclear fuel assemblies is currently considered the largest storage facility in North-West of Russia. Nowadays storage conditions do not meet safety requirements and prospectively pose serious environmental and proliferation issues. In the beginning of year 2000, the control over the storage site {{was transferred to the}} State Corporation for Atomic Energy “Rosatom”. It was soon realised that the engineering infrastructure was almost completely inoperable and needed restoration and replacement. In addition, most documentation of nuclear material characteristics was missing and some Spent Fuel Assemblies (SFA) are likely to be damaged to some extent. Starting in 2002 after the G 8 Global Partnership summit in Kananaskis, a considerable number of international cooperation projects are running to remediate the Andreeva Bay infrastructure, aiming at the safe removal of SFA for reprocessing. The Andreeva Bay programme is supported by international donors from (a) United Kingdom Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), (b) Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership Fund (the EBRD), (c) Italy (Ministry of Economic Development of the Italian Republic), (d) Norway (Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority - NRPA and Finnmark county governor), (e) Sweden (Swedish Radiation Safety Authority - SSM) and (f) European Commission (TACIS Programme – Technical Assistance to the Community of Independent States). In agreement with all the stakeholders the European Commission identified three areas for development and funding: (i) nuclear materials automated accounting and control system (NMAA&CS), (ii) gamma scanning unit for nuclear materials characterization prior to SNF transportation and (iii) provision of canisters for the safe transportation of spent fuel assemblies.

40|$|Since 1995 {{with the}} {{ratification}} {{and enforcement of}} the Non Proliferation Treaty in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kazakhstan Atomic Energy Committee (KAEC) {{is responsible for the}} implementation of the State System for Accountancy and Control (SSAC). In the SSAC, data on nuclear material inventories are periodically collected on individual nuclear facilities and stored into the KAEC data base, from which reports are prepared for the IAEA in accordance with the Safeguards Agreement between IAEA and Kazakhstan. Corresponding to the Agreement on Nuclear Safety between Euratom and Kazakhstan a programme on Nuclear Safeguards under TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States) was launched that should enhance the effectiveness of the present state system. After evaluating the different nuclear facilities in Kazakhstan with KAEC, the following facilities have been identified with a need for enhancing safeguards in methodology and instrumentation: -	the Ulba Fuel Fabrication Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk -	the research reactors of the Nuclear National Center at the Alatau and Baikal- 1 sites. Mainly, in the first facility, the Ulba plant, a scanning system for accurate, near-real time monitoring of the level and density in multiple tanks have been provided for an enhanced follow-up of the process and in particular the nuclear material flow. The automatic fusion of the data with analysis and interpretation is addressed in a future subsequent project for near real time accountancy at Ulba. Additionally, at the identified facilities a review camera station enhanced the surveillance and complemented the physical protection of the research reactors. Finally, the TACIS programme provided the beneficiary KAEC via the Nuclear Technology Safety Center with informatics equipment and data architecture for modernising the data collection and analysis of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>material</b> <b>accountancy</b> and control. Moreover with the expanding Kazak nuclear activities in particular the new nuclear power plant under design and construction, and the increasing tasks of KAEC also in the safety field, an automatic system for the analysis can help substantially KAEC in its reporting to IAEA under its future Additional Protocol agreement on all nuclear material and its transfers.
