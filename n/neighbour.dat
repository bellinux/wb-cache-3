40|$|Territorial animals {{typically}} respond less {{aggressively to}} <b>neighbours</b> than to strangers. This ‘dear enemy effect’ has been explained by differing familiarity or by different threat levels posed by <b>neighbours</b> and strangers. In most species, both the familiarity and the threat-level hypotheses predict a stronger response to strangers than to <b>neighbours.</b> In contrast, the threat-level hypothesis predicts a stronger response to <b>neighbours</b> than to strangers in species with intense competition between <b>neighbours</b> and with residents outnumbering strangers, as {{commonly found in}} social mammals such as the banded mongoose (Mungos mungo). The familiarity hypothesis predicts reduced aggression towards <b>neighbours</b> also in these species. We exposed free-living banded mongoose groups to translocated scent marks of neighbouring groups and strangers. Groups vocalized more and inspected more samples in response to olfactory cues of the <b>neighbours</b> than to the strangers. Our results support the threat-level hypothesis and contradict the familiarity hypothesis. We suggest that increased aggression towards <b>neighbours</b> {{is more common in}} social species with intense competition between <b>neighbours,</b> as opposed to reduced aggression towards <b>neighbours</b> typical for most solitary species...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines phonological neighbourhoods in the lexicons {{of children}} acquiring English. Analyses of neighbourhood densities were done on children’s earliest words {{and on a}} corpus of spontaneous speech, used to measure <b>neighbours</b> in the target language. Neighbourhood densities were analyzed for words created by changing segments in word-onset position (rhyme <b>neighbours</b> as in pin/bin), vowel position (consonant <b>neighbours</b> as in pin/pan/) and word-offset position (lead <b>neighbours</b> as in pin/pit). Results indicated that <b>neighbours</b> in children’s early lexicons are significantly more often distinguished in word-onset position (rhyme <b>neighbours)</b> and significantly less often distinguished in word-offset position (lead <b>neighbours).</b> Moreover, patterns in child language are more extreme than in the target language.

This study looks at the views of <b>neighbours</b> of two types of community-based residential supports: non-congregate settings where the minority of residents have challenging behaviour; and congregate settings {{where the majority of}} residents have challenging behaviour. Materials and methods A self-completion questionnaire was used to collect information on contact between <b>neighbours,</b> residents and staff, and the views of <b>neighbours.</b> Information was also collected by semi-structured interview with service staff on the characteristics of settings. Results Sixty-four questionnaires were returned. Contact between <b>neighbours</b> and service users was limited for both types of setting, with two-thirds of <b>neighbours</b> not knowing any service users by name, and a third having had no active contact with service users. <b>Neighbours</b> of non-congregate settings were more likely to think that community care was a 'good policy' (76 %) than <b>neighbours</b> of congregate settings (53 %) and to believe that there were benefits to the neighbourhood from having the group home in the area (46 % versus 29 %) but these differences were not significant. Contact with people with intellectual disabilities was associated with more positive attitudes to community care and specific characteristics of the settings. Conclusions Contact between <b>neighbours</b> and people with severe intellectual disabilities and challenging behaviour is limited. However, the majority of <b>neighbours</b> are positive about community care and the problems reported by <b>neighbours</b> are predominantly minor. The results point to the key role that contact plays in fostering positive attitudes.

For this purpose, a field experiment was performed by removing <b>neighbours</b> around individuals of Erica mnltiflora in a Mediterranean shrub community.
