He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

I rode thirty miles to-day--deliberately to see what this reward was, who made it, what for. When I read the placard I went sick to the bottom of my soul. So I rode in here to find you--to tell you this: I never saw Shirley before to-day. It was impossible for me to have--killed your wife. Last September I was two hundred miles north of here on the upper Nueces. I can prove that. Men who know me will tell you I couldn't murder a woman. I haven't any idea why such a deed should be laid at my hands. It's just that wild border gossip. I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> reasons <b>you</b> have for holding me responsible. I only know--you're wrong. You've been deceived. And see here, Aiken. You understand I'm a miserable man. I'm about broken, I guess. I don't care any more for life, for anything. If you can't look me in the eyes, man to man, and believe what I say--why, by God! you can kill me!" ...|$|R

5000|$|Dollhouse {{was created}} during a lunch between Joss Whedon and Eliza Dushku where they {{discussed}} her career and her recent development deal with Fox. Inspired by Dushku's {{life as an}} actress, Whedon {{came up with the}} premise of people who were hired out to be everybody's fantasy. Whedon and Dushku had long been friends since working together on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Dushku portrayed Faith, and he would occasionally intervene in her life to offer career advice. At one time, the two had considered producing a Faith spin-off project together. Whedon commented that he got [...] "frustrated with all these crappy horror movies she was making. Like Wrong Turn and Soul Survivor and whatnot" [...] which he says [...] "broke my heart." [...] Over lunch, Whedon told Dushku that he feels she possesses [...] "something that no other actor I've worked with has" [...] and from there, the concept of Dollhouse and Echo began to develop. Whedon propositioned Dushku, [...] "I know the perfect show to write for you. ... I've known you for 10 years, and I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who or <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are, so ... let's just video it." [...] Echo's story was very much inspired by Dushku's own career; Dushku had in Whedon's words, spent her whole life [...] "trying to take control of her career" [...] and feeling, in Dushku's words [...] "like everyone wants you to be a different person". Consequently, Dushku believes there is something of herself in Echo, in Caroline, and in every engagement identity Echo assumes. Whedon has described Echo as being [...] "absolutely the essence of strength boiled down" [...] and commenting [...] "She's at her strongest when she's at her least powerful. She has an extraordinary tenacity." [...] Dushku has described the character as [...] "fierce" [...] "hot", but also [...] "so complex" [...] and [...] "tripped out" [...] due to being [...] "in a world where there are people who can click a button and succeed in making <b>you</b> be <b>what</b> they want <b>you</b> to be".|$|R

40|$|FIRST PARAGRAPHS] The {{hypothesis}} {{presented in}} this paper has already appeared in various fragmentary forms (Carver 1986, 1993, 1998 b), but has not hitherto been drawn together, so it is fitting that I should try to do this in honour of my best teacher and most telling critic. After all, it would not do for Professor Cramp's Festschrift to be too burdened by flattering emulation; it should contain something exasperating as well. So I look forward to her leafing through these pages with growing despair, culminating in the tart response familiar from my carefree student days: 'really Mr Carver, I have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are talking about', meaning: 'actually, I know perfectly well; you on the other hand [...] . ' In brief, the hypothesis concerns the history of the early medieval period in north-west Europe and our ability to read it from archaeology, or more ' specifically from its major investments such as burial mounds, churches, illuminated manuscripts and sculpture: the word 'monumentality' of my title is intended as shorthand for all these things. Confidence in the idea that monuments had (and have) a meaning beyond some vague celebration of an individual or propitiation of an unseen omnipotence has been growing among prehistorians (e. g. Bradley 1993), and is an accepted feature of the historic period. We know that monuments are more than passive memorials because written commentaries, poetry and inscriptions declare their active purposes for us. Monuments comprise the vocabulary of a political language, fossilized versions of arguments that were continuous and may have related more to what was desired than what had occurred (Carver 1993). At the same time, we need not suppose that the expression is necessarily so subtle, sceptical or to use a fashionable word, ironical, as to lose all hope of making equations between a society and its ideas. That architecture, sculpture, burial mounds and brooches have messages beyond the functional which are dependant on their social, economic and above all their ideological context was never an issue: to understand their real meaning is the goal and the aim of each generation that studies them. It is very likely that the motives I attach to the construction of the monuments to be discussed are equally inadequate characterizations of the profound stresses that motivated and were concealed by their makers. That said, the monuments are what survive, and our story must temporarily keep the candle burning untiI their story can be told...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{working on}} a problem has been your primary effort for the past year, your {{leadership}} may have heard about this once in a briefing a decade ago. Now they are basically clueless. Pretend that you are talking to your daughter's fifth-grade class. Explain how your complicated gizmo works. If possible, do not use acronyms. Define your terms. Put your work in context. Assume your leader has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, who you work for, or what your gizmo does. That {{is a good place}} to start. Remember, taking the next century to study the problem or spending the Gross National Product to invent a new solution are probably not going to be acceptable solutions. Real engineers and technicians build real hardware that works in the real world in a reasonable manner within a reasonable time at a reasonable cost. True, skimping on time or money can cause mistakes, but folks whose gizmos are delayed unreasonably or cost more than is practical get their programs canceled, force the business into bankruptcy, or give the market over to the competition. Real engineers and technicians always consider cost and schedule in their work. Raising questions is important. However, we are in the business of doing things. Engineers and technicians are paid to get things done. Yes, you have to identify the problem, frame the design, identify the tests, perform the analysis, and assemble the hardware. But the goal is to solve the problem. Nobody ever said flying in space was easy. We make it look easy the same way that an Olympic champion makes her sport look easy: by working hard at improving performance every day. Better are the results of a well-defined test. Remember that a test on a laboratory bench is always an approximation of reality, and rules similar to those for good analysis also apply. One should always be mindful of Mechelay's rule: "It is better to be stupid than to run a stupid test. " Often we try to overtest. If a piece of hardware passes an unbelievably difficult test, then life is good. More often when an unbelievably difficult test fails, we are left with a very long discussion of why and what was wrong in the design or execution of the test. Make sure that the test is well defined. Even then, it is important to explain to your leaders what inherent accuracy (or error) the test conditions or equipment have and what the assumptions or initial conditions were for the test. Test results without a good understanding of the test's accuracy or the pedigree of the test assumptions are worth very little. Finally, there is flight test data. Always limited, never at the edge of the envelope, it still shows how the real hardware works in a combined environment. Flight experience is dangerous because it typically doesn't show how close to the edge of the cliff the equipment is operating, but it does demonstrate how the hardware really works. A flight test is the ultimate test, again taken with the knowledge that it is probably not the extreme but something more like the middle of the environmental and systems performance. Good understanding of a problem and its solution always relies on a combination of all these methods. Be sure to lead your leaders by using all the tools you have at your disposal. At the end of the day, decisions in space flight always come down to a risk trade. Our business is not remotely safe, not in the sense that the public, the media, or our legislators use the term. Everything we do has a risk, cost, schedule, or performance trade-off. For your leaders to make an appropriate decision, you need to educate them, lead them, talk with them, and engage them in the discussion until full understanding takes place. It's your job. ...|$|E
