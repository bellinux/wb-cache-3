5000|$|Murata's {{digitally}} animated kinetic sculpture [...] "Melter 3-D" [...] captivated {{visitors to}} the Frieze New York Art Fair in May 2014. As reported in the New York Times, For technical magic, <b>nothing</b> <b>beats</b> Takeshi Murata's [...] "Melter 3-D." [...] In a room lit by flickering strobes, a revolving, beachball-size sphere seems made of mercury. A hypnotic wonder, {{it appears to be}} constantly melting into flowing ripples." [...] Murata created this illusion by projecting digital animation onto a rotating sphere, with the spinning of the sphere synchronized with the blinking of a strobe light. This makes it a form of 3D-zoetrope. According to Liz Stinson, writing in Wired:Murata was able to take the same principles used centuries ago to create repeating zoetrope animations, and add some high-tech gloss. He started by designing the object on his computer with 3-D modeling software. The looping melting effect you see is the result of syncing the spinning of the sphere with the blinking of the strobe. [...] "It's the same concept as old cylindrical zoetropes, where you look through the slits to see the animation," [...] says Murata. [...] "But in a 3-D zoetrope, the slits are replaced with strobe lights, and drawings or photographs can become objects." ...|$|E
50|$|Most hulls {{have the}} lowest and clearest side decks mid-ships {{and this is where}} the {{casualty}} should be brought back aboard. If the guard rails are wire, there should be rope lashings at one end so that the lower, or both, wires can be freed to make recovery easier. All crew members involved in recovery should be harnessed on if the sea conditions that led to the first fall could lead to further people ending up in the water. The answer to a person overboard is never for more people either to jump over to 'help' them, or to fall in themselves by accident.The recovery operation is different for a conscious compared an unconscious casualty, but in either case there are two rules to be aware of. First, after a very short time in cold water, even a fit conscious person will have lost considerable strength and agility and will need help to get aboard, especially in heavy wet clothing. Second, the condition of a person {{in the early stages of}} hypothermia can be made considerably worse by hoisting them vertically so that what circulation they have drains from their head into their feet. It is much better to recover the casualty as horizontally as possible. Various pieces of equipment are on the market to help short-handed or weakened crews deal with this problem, but really <b>nothing</b> <b>beats</b> the combined efforts of several strong hands gripping various items of clothing on the arms, body, and legs, and hauling in unison. In a rough sea, the waves that caused the fall can sometimes help by lifting the floating person up within easy reach of the sidedeck as the boat rolls. Care must be taken as to what to do as each wave subsides if the person is not yet aboard, as their weight can pull unsuspecting helpers in themselves. Loops of rope passed under the arms and behind the knees on one wave can be held during the trough and hauled again during the next rise, if this is possible.|$|E
