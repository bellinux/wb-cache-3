40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of the Derby serotype of Salmonella enterica in Spain was examined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Out of 24 identified PFGE profiles, a major clone was detected in 19 % of strains from humans, 52 % from food, and 62 % from swine. This clone (clone 1) was isolated from pork products, suggesting swine as its source. Salmonellosis, a major public health concern worldwide, {{is one of the}} most common causes of human gastroenteritis. It is caused by the ingestion of contaminated food because of a failure to control Salmonella infection in animal husbandry. Its carriers are swine, poultry, and cattle, along with eggs, milk, and fresh seafood (1). Salmonella in pork carcasses is a result of fecal contamination during slaughtering and processing. In this case, the carrier swine is the main initial source of contamination (2, 3), and bacteria are usually located in the pharynx, lymph nodes, stomach, and feces (4). During 2002, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Derby was the second and sixth most common Salmonella serotype in clinical and nonclinical nonhuman sources, representing 24. 0 % and 3. 7 % of isolates reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Service,</b> respectively (5).

As an external border of EU, the Republic of Bulgaria has become an extremely important factor for ensuring favourable epizootic situation within all 27 member states and ensuring also the free movement of goods, people and capital. With regard to these new circumstances a scientific analysis is made of the specifics of the main epizootic factors for the country, in order certain adequate measures from Bulgarian and EU institutions to be undertaken. The epizootic risks are divided in two main groups – external and internal. As external factors are pointed out the globalization of trade in animals and products of animal origin, the increasing import of meat from South American countries, the climate change and the related migration of birds and insects, illegal meat trade, occurrence of new pathogens, etc. Within the section of internal factors, a scientific analysis is made of some risks concerning gaps within the legislative framework of the country, risks of organizational and structural, economic, geographic, social, ethnic and religious character. Analysis is made also of the epizootic role and importance of some typical for Bulgaria epizootic factors: pooled herds, illegal slaughter of animals at the backyard, especially during religious festivals (Bayram, Christmas, St. George`s Day), social contacts between Balkan countries, removing wire fencing along the Southern border, the role of swine from East Balkan breed, different principles and methods for eradication of some contagious diseases (FMD) in Bulgaria and in the border regions of Turkey...|$|E

We compared two data sources that capture spatial and temporal information about H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks reported since 2004 in four countries: Bangladesh, Egypt, Turkey, and Vietnam. One data source consisted of reports collected as part of each country's <b>national</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> surveillance program, while the other data source included reports collected using the Emergency Prevention System for Priority Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES-i) global animal health information system. We computed Spearman rank-order correlation statistics to compare spatial and temporal outbreak distributions, and applied a space-time permutation test to check for consistency between the two data sources. Although EMPRES-i typically captured fewer outbreaks than detailed national reporting data, the overall similarity in space and time, particularly after 2006, reflect the ability of the EMPRES-i system to portray disease patterns comparable to those observed in national data sets. Specifically, we show that the two datasets exhibit higher positive correlations in outbreak timing and reported locations after 2006 when compared to December 2003 through 2006. Strengthening the capacity of global systems to acquire data from national and regional databases will improve global analysis efforts and increase the ability of such systems to rapidly alert countries and the international community of potential disease threats.

40|$|Recent disease {{epidemics}} {{and their}} {{spread around the}} world have illustrated the weaknesses of disease surveillance and early warning systems (EWS), both at national and international levels. These diseases continuously threaten the livestock sector on a worldwide basis, some with major public health impact. EWS and accurate forecasting of new outbreaks of epidemic livestock diseases that may also affect wildlife, and the capacity for spread of such diseases to new areas is an essential pre-requisite to their effective containment and control. Because both the geographical and seasonal distribution of many infectious diseases are linked to climate, the possibility of using climaterelated environmental factors as predictive indicators, in association with regular disease surveillance activities, has proven to be relevant when establishing EWS for climate-related diseases. This article reviews the growing importance of using geographical information systems in predictive veterinary epidemiology and its integration into EWS, with a special focus on Rift Valley fever.

The presence of smooth lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated by the presence of 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonic acid and lipid, by Limulus lysate gelation activity, and by formation of characteristic lipopolysaccharide precipitates in immunoelectrophoresis. A polysaccharide antigen as well as two nonsurface antigens, A 2 and C, were also identified. BASA is a satisfactory antigen for use in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay since the smooth lipopolysaccharide component bound to polystyrene and functioned in the test.

40|$|Abstract Background Culture of M. bovis from {{diagnostic}} specimens is {{the gold}} standard for bovine tuberculosis diagnostics in the USA. Detection of M. bovis by PCR in tissue homogenates may provide a simple rapid method to complement bacterial culture. A significant impediment to PCR based assays on tissue homogenates is specificity since mycobacteria other than M. bovis may be associated with the tissues. Results Previously published IS 6110 based PCR diagnostic assays, along with one developed in house, were tested against environmental mycobacteria commonly isolated from diagnostic tissues submitted to the <b>National</b> <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Services</b> Laboratory. A real-time PCR assay was developed (IS 6110 _T) that had increased specificity over other IS 6110 based assays. Of the 13 non-tuberculous mycobacteria tested with IS 6110 _T only M. wolinskyi was positive. Thirty M. bovis infected tissue homogenates and 18 control tissues were used to evaluate the potential for the assay as a diagnostic test. In this small sample, IS 6110 _T detected 20 / 30 samples from M. bovis infected animals and 0 / 18 control tissues. Conclusions The IS 6110 _T assay provides a PCR based assay system that is compatible with current diagnostic protocols for the detection of M. bovis in the USA and compliments current testing strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent disease {{epidemics}} {{and their}} {{spread around the}} world have illustrated the weaknesses of disease surveillance and early warning systems (EWS), both at national and international levels. These diseases continuously threaten the livestock sector on a worldwide basis, some with major public health impact. EWS and accurate forecasting of new outbreaks of epidemic livestock diseases that may also affect wildlife, and the capacity for spread of such diseases to new areas is an essential pre-requisite to their effective containment and control. Because both the geographical and seasonal distribution of many infectious diseases are linked to climate, the possibility of using climaterelated environmental factors as predictive indicators, in association with regular disease surveillance activities, has proven to be relevant when establishing EWS for climate-related diseases. This article reviews the growing importance of using geographical information systems in predictive veterinary epidemiology and its integration into EWS, with a special focus on Rift Valley fever. It shows that, once fully validated in a country or region, this technology appears highly valuable and could play an increasing role in forecasting major epidemics, providing lead time to <b>national</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> to take action to mitigate the impact of the disease in a cost-effective manner...|$|R
