50|$|Flight {{tests that}} {{were carried out}} at the Zemun {{airfield}} proved that the SIM-VI-a had slightly better performance than its predecessor, {{and was able to}} perform basic stunts. After being granted a <b>navigation</b> <b>license</b> the plane was registered under civil designation YU-PEZ and it was bought by Aero Club’s Central Administration. The plane was used until {{the beginning of the war}} in 1941 at air shows, sports competitions and for pilot training. Pilot and engineer Arsenijevic, piloted this plane at the competition Little Entente states in 1938. during the competition the plane flew some 3,274 km (2,034.37 miles) achieving an average speed of 151.01 km/h. Pilots who flew the plane felt that the plane was agile and easy to operate and fly, but despite good features and relatively low cost, SIM-VI did not go into serial production it could not win over the traditional empirical approach (a robust and powerful aircraft is a good aircraft). Right before the outbreak of war, the aircraft was included into the Yugoslav Royal Air Force, deployed as a signalling plane but was destroyed during the bombing of Lazarevac airfield on 7 April 1941.|$|E
40|$|Text, {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} creations of humankind, has played a vital part in humanoid life, so far from olden periods. High level semantics embodied in the text are beneficial in a wide range of vision-based applications. For example, image understanding, image indexing, geo location, automatic <b>navigation,</b> <b>license</b> plate recognition, assisting blind person and other surveillance applications. There are approaches in the field of content based image retrieval to solve the above mentioned problems. However, these approaches are inadequate to generate annotation based on semantics according to content of video or images due to opening between high level and low level features. Therefore text detection and recognition in videos grow into active and important research areas in computer vision and document analysis, which is capable of understanding the content of video and images at high level with the help of Optical Character Recognizer (OCR). Especially in recent years, the researchers has seen a flow of research efforts and considerable developments in these fields, however many challenges e. g. low resolution, complex background and variations in colors, font, font size, Multi-orientations, Multi-orientation text movements, noise, blur, and distortion still remain. The objectives of this work are in four folds: (1) to introduce a new descriptor called Histogram Oriented Moments (HOM) for detecting multi-oriented text from videos. The HOM is created by considering the orientations calculated with the second order geometrical moments. Further, to verify the detected text, optical flow properties are used to estimate the motion between text candidates in temporal frames. However, the use of temporal information is limited to false positive elimination but not as main features to find text candidates. (2) to propose new models for finding multi-oriented moving text from video and scene images through moments, motion vectors are utilized to identify moving regions that have constant velocity. However, the model is slightly sensitive to window size used for moment‟s calculation and different scripts in video. (3) To develop automatic window size determination for detecting text from videos, the next method explored stroke width transform based on the information that the stroke width remains constant throughout the characters. Further, the temporal frames are used for identifying text candidates based on the fact that caption text stays at the same unchanged location for few frames. However, the performance of the proposed method degrades when there is blur present in the video frames because moments and stroke width transforms are sensitive to blur. (4) To develop a method for text detection and recognition in blur frames, a blind deconvolution model is introduced that enhances the edge sharpness by suppressing blurred pixels. In summary, each work has been tested over benchmark datasets and authors‟ created datasets from different resources using standard measures. Furthermore, the results of the proposed methods are compared with the state of art methods to show that the proposed methods are competent to existing methods...|$|E

25|$|Because {{the physics}} and {{metallurgy}} of boilers were poorly understood, steamboats were prone to boiler explosions that killed {{hundreds of people}} between the 1810s and 1840s. In 1838, legislation was enacted that mandated boiler inspections by federal agents under the threat of revocation of the operator's <b>navigation</b> <b>licenses</b> and lowered the threshold for liability in suits arising from such accidents. While Americans long resisted any government's power to regulate private property, these new rules demonstrated that many Americans believed that property rights did not override civil rights and set the precedent for future federal safety regulations.|$|R
25|$|During the 1930s, {{and up to}} 1938, the British {{government}} progressively {{implemented the}} recommendations of the Maybury Committee Report and related later reports, by organising and installing air traffic control, weather reporting, navigation and radio systems for civilian aviation. In 1938, the Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) was set up by the Air <b>Navigation</b> (<b>Licensing</b> of Public Transport) Order 1938, under the Air Navigation Act 1936 (S.5). Chaired by Trustam Eve, the ATLA issued provisional licences to airports and to air transport companies operating regular services, throughout 1938 and 1939. Licensing, and some subsidising of services, was conditional on agreements that commercial aircraft fleets would be made available to the government in a national emergency. In parallel, the Civil Air Guard scheme of 1938 provided subsidised pilot training in return for future military call-up commitments. At that time, the Air Ministry, headed by Secretary of State for Air, Sir Kingsley Wood, was responsible for both military and civil aviation, and the Director-General of Civil Aviation was Sir Francis Shelmerdine.|$|R
2500|$|Famed Mexican author José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, El Pensador ("the Mexican Thinker"), {{author of}} El Periquillo Sarniento, {{wrote about the}} subject at the time: [...] "If your {{excellency}} be not the Emperor, then our Independence be damned. We {{do not wish to}} be free if your excellency will not be at the lead of his countrymen". Timothy E. Anna points out that in the months between the achievement of Independence and his crowning as Emperor, Iturbide already practically ruled the nation, as he was president of the Regency, and the Junta (the Regency) had granted him command over all land and sea forces. He was appointed protector of commerce, navigation, local order and ports and he was given the right to expedite passports and <b>navigation</b> <b>licenses</b> even after the Emperor had been instated (and according to the Emperor's wishes). What powers Iturbide could have possibly wanted, he already had before becoming Emperor, Anna notes, and thus it is not probable that Iturbide conspired to appoint himself Emperor. Iturbide himself notes in his memoirs written in exile: [...] "I had the condescension-or, call it weakness- of allowing myself to be seated in a throne I had created for others." [...] Historians point out that indeed, Iturbide, had quite possibly all the power, influence and support he needed, before redacting the Plan of Iguala, to crown himself Emperor, and yet wrote the Plan with the clear intention of creating a throne meant for a European noble.|$|R
40|$|Text {{that appears}} in images {{contains}} important and useful information. Detection and extraction of text in images {{have been used in}} many applications. In this paper, we propose a multiscale edge-based text extraction algorithm, which can automatically detect and extract text in complex images. The proposed method is a general-purpose text detection and extraction algorithm, which can deal not only with printed document images but also with scene text. It is robust with respect to the font size, style, color, orientation, and alignment of text and {{can be used in a}} large variety of application fields, such as mobile robot <b>navigation,</b> vehicle <b>license</b> detection and recognition, object identification, document retrieving, page segmentation, etc. 1...|$|R
40|$|Structural MRIs of {{the brains}} of humans with {{extensive}} <b>navigation</b> experience, <b>licensed</b> London taxi drivers, were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} control subjects who did not drive taxis. The posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were significantly larger relative to those of control subjects. A more anterior hippocampal region was larger in control subjects than in taxi drivers. Hippocampal volume correlated with {{the amount of time spent}} as a taxi driver (positively in the posterior and negatively in the anterior hippocampus). These data are in accordance with the idea that the posterior hippocampus stores a spatial representation of the environment and can expand regionally to accommodate elaboration of this representation in people with a high dependence on navigational skills. It seems that there is a capacity for local plastic change in the structure of the healthy adult human brain in response to environmental demands...|$|R
