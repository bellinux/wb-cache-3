50|$|The <b>Northern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> inhabits {{the islands}} of Timor, {{specifically}} Indonesia and Timor Leste, Wetar and Leti (both to Indonesia) through the Kai Islands {{and a number of}} the Moluccan Islands of Indonesia (including: Ambon, Buru, and Seram); it is also found on {{the islands of}} Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati (all Indonesia), and ranges over much of {{the northern part of the}} island of New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), including a number of offshore islands. It ranges as far east as the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New Guinea, where it is present on many islands including the islands of New Britain and New Ireland. It also occurs on many of the Solomon Islands. It is believed that many of the insular island populations are the result of prehistorical introductions, possibly including: Timor, Seram, Buru, Sanana, the Kai Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Island chain.

50|$|In a {{phylogenetic tree}} {{published}} in 1987 by Tim Flannery and his colleagues, Phalanger lullulae {{was believed to}} share the same states with Phalanger intercastellanus {{also known as the}} Eastern common cuscus. A morphological consensus tree shows that the Phalanger lullulae is related to the Mountain cuscus (Phalanger carmelatie), Phalanger interpositus, Stein's cuscus (Phalanger vestitus), and the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis). This phylogenetic tree was created by Tim Flannery and his colleagues in 1987 but was also reanalyzed by Ruedas and Morales in 2005. A partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Ruedas and Morales demonstrated the firstly mentioned relationship between the Phalanger lullulae and Phalanger intercastellanus. The Partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Hamilton and Springer demonstrated that the Phalanger lullulae is most closely related to the <b>Northern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Phalanger orientalis). An ML tree of the nuclear gene BRCA1 created by Raterman and his colleagues shows the Phalanger lullulae's close relationship to the Phalanger orientalis as well. While these aforementioned phylogenies are more certain, there is another proposed morphological phylogeny by Flannery that demonstrates the uncertainty of the Phalanger lullulae's relationship among the Phalanger orientalis and Phalanger vestitus.|$|E

The cuscus is a pouched marsupial grouped in the Phalangeridae family, which is nocturnal, arboreal, herbivore, {{and in most cases}} the tail is prehensile. The animals are legally protected due to low reproduction, limited distribution area, and high rate of illegal hunting. The illegal hunting happened not only in the production forest areas but also in the reserve areas such as Nature Reserve of Arfak Mountain, directly or indirectly, affects the life quality of the ecosystem, mainly cuscuses population. Therefore, it is necessary to do efforts to have a better management of the region to ensure the sustenance of many components in it. This research is aimed to know the population density of cuscus in Arfak Mountain Nature Reserve and carried out for two months. The method used was descriptive by using direct and indirect observation. The result shows that cuscuses existing in the Arfak Mountain conservation area were <b>northern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Phalanger orientalis), ground cuscus (Phalanger gymnotis) and common spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus maculatus). The biggest individual number is of P. orientalis with 39 individuals consisting of 18 males and 21 females, the second is of P. gymnotis with 10 individuals consisting of 4 males and 6 females, and the smallest is of S. maculatus with 9 individuals consisting of 4 males and 5 females.

40|$|ON zoogeographic maps, the Solomon Islands {{are shown}} as the {{north-eastern}} limit of Australidelphian marsupial distribution in Australasia. This distinction {{is due to}} the presence of a single New Guinean marsupial, the <b>northern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> Phalanger orientalis, which was probably introduced via the Bismarck Archipelago by prehistoric human agency (Flannery 1995; Spriggs 1997; Heinsohn 1998; Wickler 2001). P. orientalis is found across most of the principal Solomon Islands, {{with the exception of the}} remote far-eastern oceanic islands of Santa Cruz (Temotu) Province. In the scientific literature, the exact eastern limit of distribution for P. orientalis is generally given as San Cristobal (Makira) Island in Makira Province (Laurie and Hill 1954; Flannery 1995), the eastern most peninsula of which extends to 162 ° 23 ' E. The next landmass to the east is the small 5 km diameter and 143 m high limestone atoll of Santa Ana (Owa Rafa) which lies across a 7. 5 km open water crossing. Curiously, during a visit to Santa Ana Island in May 2001, it was discovered that P. orientalis probably once occurred on that island, but is now considered to be locally extinct there. The circumstances surrounding its apparent extinction were related to me by Oscar Kuper, a Melanesian elder in Ghupuna Village on Santa Ana Island. This anecdotal information is paraphrased below. According to Kuper there had been possums [P. orientalis] living in the bush on Santa Ana Island up until 1969 when a cyclone struck. The cyclone was so severe and devastating that it blew trees over, snapped them off at the trunk or stripped them of all of their leaves, and only left one house standing. After the cyclone had passed many cattle, pigs, possums, birds and other wildlife were found dead on the ground. The bush was eerily quiet as all the birds, bats and other wildlife were gone. The few possums that survived the catastrophe appear to have been hunted and killed by hungry villagers (and their dogs) who had lost their gardens, livestock, canoes and fishing equipment to the cyclone. The tree cover eventually came back and many birds and bats returned, but the possum [P. orientalis] has not been seen since and now appears to be extinct on Sant...|$|E

50|$|The <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is {{hunted for}} its meat and pelt in New Guinea, but {{has very little}} {{economical}} influence.

The conservation status of the <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is least concern because of its wide population distribution, ability to flourish in a variety of environments, and lack of dominating predators. However, continued human expansion, an increase in demand for cuscus meat and pelts, and destruction of its natural habitat could lead to a demise in the spotted cuscus predominance.|$|R

Cuscus hunting was done to supply animal protein for households, inspite some hunting results raised for consumption and market purposes.

50|$|The <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is {{typically}} a solitary creature, feeding and nesting alone.

They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and hissing noises, and stand upright to defend their territories.
