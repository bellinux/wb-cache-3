40|$|This {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} how the European Union (EU) succeeded in bringing the International Accounting Standards (IAS) to being accepted as the international accounting standards. It overcame resistances mainly from the U. S. which considered its accounting stan-dards, US GAAP, to be the superior ones and had been reluctant in supporting EU’s attempt of this. Michael L. Katz’s and Carl Shapiro’s model of network externalities is conceptually applied to this case. First, EU regulated all EU listed companies to use IAS from 2005 onwards. Second, it {{announced that it would}} apply this regulation to <b>non</b> <b>EU</b> companies from 2007 onwards. <b>Non</b> <b>EU</b> companies were regulated not to have access to EU financial markets for raising capital unless they make financial reporting, using the accounting standards which EU would consider to be equivalent to the standards it uses. This gave a big push to non IAS using countries to switching to adopting IAS, making IAS de facto international accounting standards. This maneuver of EU had what Katz and Shapiro called “a strategic, first-mover advantage. ” The analysis covers developments only until early part of 2008 and does not cover developments after the global financial crisis of 2008...|$|R
