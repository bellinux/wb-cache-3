5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party of the drama, {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, as she felt it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that everyone received and because she liked singing; she felt it might work out somehow.|$|E
25|$|Going back to Nalebuff (1987), the Monty Hall {{problem is}} also much {{studied in the}} {{literature}} on game theory and decision theory, and also some popular solutions correspond to this point of view. Vos Savant asks for a decision, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices: first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running the quiz show, including the host.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as if I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to know him better." ...|$|E

500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} can torment me a little," [...] he said, smiling, [...] "but the forces arrayed against you are too strong, and you have <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on your side.
