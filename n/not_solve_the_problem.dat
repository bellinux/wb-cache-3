5|$|The River Don Navigation was {{the result}} of early efforts to make the River Don in South Yorkshire, England, navigable between Fishlake and Sheffield. The Dutch {{engineer}} Cornelius Vermuyden had re-routed the mouth of the river in 1626, to improve drainage, and the new works included provision for navigation, but the scheme did <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of flooding, and the Dutch River was cut in 1635 to link the new channel to Goole. The first Act of Parliament to improve navigation on the river was obtained in 1726, by a group of Cutlers based in Sheffield; the Corporation of Doncaster obtained an Act in the following year for improvements to the lower river. Locks and lock cuts were built, and, by 1751, the river was navigable to Tinsley.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{nonlinear}} problems {{cannot be}} posed {{in general and}} thus not solved within distribution theory alone. In the context of quantum field theory, however, solutions can be found. In more than two spacetime dimensions the problem {{is related to the}} regularization of divergences. Here Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser developed the mathematically rigorous (but extremely technical) causal perturbation theory. This does <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> in other situations. Many other interesting theories are non linear, like for example the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. It {{has been suggested that}} a problem with Monbiot's approach is that economic drivers may be required in order to push through the development of more sustainable second-generation biofuel processes: it is possible that these could be stalled if biofuel production decreases. Some environmentalists are suspicious that second-generation biofuels may <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of a potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E
25|$|Morris {{suffered}} {{a reduction in}} his majority to 3,665 at the 1950 general election. He pressed in the new Parliament for increased charges or subsidy to the railways {{in order to have}} industrial peace. In 1951 he criticised an opposition motion which called for increased railway charges to be annulled, arguing that the new charges on their own would <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> He stated that if the increased charges were rejected, then Labour members would recast the entire financial structure of the railway industry. At this time he was reckoned an ally of Herbert Morrison in the Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|When {{dentures}} {{no longer}} fit well, the correct action {{is to seek}} follow-up care. Using denture adhesive may improve the fit, but it tends to work better when {{only a small amount}} is used as covering the denture fitting surface in adhesive makes it stay in less well. Adhesives may compensate for gradual loosening of a denture, but it is only a temporary solution; it does <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> Fortunately, dentures can often be relined with relining materials to restore the proper fit, and this process costs less than creation of new dentures. Overall, a well-made denture should last about 5 years or more.|$|E

25|$|In Australia, several protests {{took place}} in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. Over a {{thousand}} protested during Sri Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama's visit to Australia on 14 October 2008. The protest {{took place in}} Canberra outside the National Press Club. The protesters accused the Sri Lankan government alleging attack on civilians and the prevention of aid by the United Nations reaching affected areas. In response to the protests, Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith stated that he raised the concern of the violence amid the civil war. He also assured that Australia insists that military means will <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> and that a political solution can only result in {{the ending of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that it's not clear that the first {{objection}} really provides a challenge to Girard's theory, as even in repressive societies men are still desired (albeit by women). However, such a response leaves unexplained why homosexuals would imitate the desires of heterosexual members of the opposite sex. One might also argue that the last objection ignores the influence of an original sin from which all others follow, which Girard clearly affirms. However, original sin, on Girard's interpretation, explains only our propensity to imitate, not the specific content of our imitated desires. Thus, the doctrine of original sin does <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of how the original model first acquires the desire that is subsequently imitated by others.|$|E
25|$|The Beverley and Barmston Drain was straighter {{and larger}} than the Holderness Drain, and only carried lowland water. It was {{therefore}} more efficient at draining the Beverley and Barmston level, but it still did <b>not</b> <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of flooding entirely. One factor was the limits placed on {{the height of the}} banks, and in particular the overfall. Another was the difficulties of embanking the tributaries on the Hull, several of which were fed by powerful springs. A third factor was the development of the Driffield Navigation. Its enabling Act specified the maximum water level above the lock at Hempholme, but this was frequently exceeded, resulting in flooding and the surrounding ground becoming waterlogged. Despite the risks, much of the level was ploughed and used to grow crops of barley, oats and wheat, although some of the lowest parts were retained as parture. In common with other drainage schemes, the land levels fell as the peat soils dried out, resulting in increasing difficulties in keeping the carrs free from water. However, opposition from the Port of Hull to making cuts to the Humber waned after 1810, as additional docks were constructed, and the importance of the Old Harbour declined, while a period of agricultural decline from 1815 to 1830 resulted in there being no funds for any improvements to the drainage scheme during this period.|$|E
