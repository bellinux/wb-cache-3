40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issue of how the {{possibility}} for areements among <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> about building joint facilities affects their networks qualities, their profits and social welfare. We show that allowing the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to build joint facilities can make the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to increase their network qualities when they decide so simultaneously. When we analyze entry, only the incumbent increases his network quality. The main result is that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> and the regulator coincide in thier decisions about how much the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> should build jointly when the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> decide simultaneously their network qualities. The same result arises when we analyze entry and the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> are sufficiently differentiated. But, if there is entry and the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> are not sufficiently differentiated, a regulator is hended to force the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> to build joint facilities, what is very surprising from the current National Regulatory point of vie w. ...|$|R

In comparing the two regions, this study analyzes how the MVNO market has changed and what opportunities and/or threats <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> and potential MVNO entrants are likely to face. The essential question in next generation MVNO's is how the roles of mobile <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> service providers and content producers will change current and future value chains...|$|R

40|$|The Digital Marketplace is a market-based {{framework}} where <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> offer {{communications services}} with {{competition at the}} call level. It strives to address a tussle between the actors involved in a heterogeneous wireless access network. However, as with any market-like institution, {{it is vital to}} analyze the Digital Marketplace from the strategic perspective to ensure that all shortcomings are removed prior to implementation. In this paper, we analyze the selling mechanism proposed in the Digital Marketplace. The mechanism is based on a procurement ﬁrst-price sealed-bid auction where the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> represent the sellers/bidders, and the end-user of a wireless service is the buyer. However, this auction format is somewhat unusual as the winning bid is a composition of both the <b>network</b> <b>operator’s</b> monetary bid and their reputation rating. We create a simple economic model of the auction, and we show that it is mathematically intractable to derive the equilibrium bidding behavior when there are N <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> and we make only generic assumptions about the structure of the bidding strategies. We then move on to consider a scenario with only two <b>network</b> <b>operators,</b> and assume that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> use bidding strategies which are linear functions of their costs. This results in the derivation of the equilibrium bidding behavior in that scenario...|$|R
