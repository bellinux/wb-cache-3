5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> to designate a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E

[...] Said a man accused of genocide who said he had paid a bribe to gacaca judges. The lack of legal representation is, in majority, a result of the genocide itself wherein {{the vast majority of people}} of such professions were casualties. This brings, perhaps, the biggest issue of gacaca: the lack of legal representation. Gacaca functions using [...] "peoples of integrity" [...] as judges, lawyers, and the jury. Not only are some of these people perpetrators themselves, but the lack of financial compensation for the position and the lack of training make them susceptible to bribe and to leading unfair trials.|$|R

Originally the Mariners were allowed to use the Newcastle Knights home ground Marathon Stadium by the Showground Trust, but the Supreme Court found that they had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> to play there. The club {{eventually}} played at Topper Stadium, sharing {{the ground with the}} National Soccer League's Newcastle Breakers, and used over $1 million to upgrade facilities at the stadium.

5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The Lithuanians claimed to be defending their borders, while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the Lithuanians had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> to these territories. Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s {{and early}} 2000s, several city councils and {{autonomous}} communities had opened registers for civil unions that allowed benefits for unmarried couples of any sex, although {{the effect was}} mainly symbolic. Registries were created in 16 out of 17 of Spain's autonomous communities; Catalonia (1998), Aragon (1999), Navarre (2000), Castile-La Mancha (2000), Valencia (2001), Balearic Islands (2001), Madrid (2001), Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002), Castile and León (2002), Extremadura (2003), Basque Country (2003), Canary Islands (2003), Cantabria (2005), Galicia (2008) and La Rioja (2010), and in both autonomous cities; Ceuta (1998) and Melilla (2008) Spanish law already allowed single people to adopt children; thus, a same-sex couple could undertake a de facto adoption, but the partner who was not the legal parent had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> if the relationship ended or the legal parent died. Same-sex marriages were not legal in the autonomous communities, because the Spanish Constitution gives the State sole power to legislate marriage.|$|E

5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during Whitsuntide in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E
5|$|Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo, Co., Ltd. {{was heard}} at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Robert W. Sweet. The trial lasted seven days, during which Universal, {{represented}} by the New York firm Townley & Updike, argued that the name Donkey Kong could be confused with King Kong and that {{the plot of the}} game was an infringement on that of the film. Kirby showed key differences between Donkey Kong and King Kong. He also alleged that Universal had <b>no</b> <b>rights</b> to the King Kong characters and that they had in fact successfully sued RKO Pictures in 1975 in Universal City Studios, Inc. v. RKO General, Inc., wherein they proved that the plot of King Kong was in the public domain and thus opened the way for Dino De Laurentiis's remake.|$|E
