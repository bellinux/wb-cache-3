25|$|Announcements of Red Cloud's {{death and}} {{recognition}} of his achievements were printed in major newspapers across the country. As had been typical of the US perception during Red Cloud's prominence in war, the article in The New York Times mistakenly described him as leader of all the Sioux bands and tribes, but noted his abilities as a leader and diplomat. While he was a prominent leader, the Lakota were highly decentralized and <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> overall leader, especially of the major divisions, such as Oglala and Brulé.|$|E
500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, a period free of {{official}} team practices, Young and his receivers spent extra practice time working on their timing and team-work. The fall Orange and White intra-team scrimmage was held on August 21, 2005, as an event open to the public. Running back Ramonce Taylor returned the opening kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. Young completed five of seven passing attempts for 68yards and one touchdown. Senior Richmond McGee made two 33-yard field goals and emerged as the top candidate to handle field goals, kickoffs and punts. Brown said of McGee, [...] "We've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> person do all three, so it's a concern, but right now, {{he would be the}} guy." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{period of}} hard work for Verdi—with the {{creation}} of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in Un ballo in maschera. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything." [...] In 1858 Verdi complained: [...] "Since Nabucco, you may say, I have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] was the sorrowful reply. [...] "She {{knew from}} the first my opinion of him, and we <b>never</b> <b>have</b> any talks now. We <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> since she was first engaged." ...|$|R

500|$|Travis Fickett in IGN said Creed, Kevin, Meredith and Toby {{were all}} in top form in [...] "Casual Friday", and said he enjoyed the changes that {{resulted}} in Michael's departure from {{and return to the}} company. However, Fickett questioned what direction the show would go now that so many questions have been resolved. Jay Black of TV Squad said the conflict between Michael and his co-workers was very good, and he enjoys the way Phyllis revealed how hurt she was by Michael's departure from the company; however, Black said he did not like that the episode included a [...] "Casual Friday" [...] even though the office had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> before. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the supporting characters {{were all in}} top form and that the episode demonstrated how Michael, in offering a genuine apology, has grown this season. Porter also praised the scenes with Jim and Creed, and described Kate Flannery as [...] "one of the most fearless actresses on TV" [...] for her scene with the short bathing suit. Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune called the episode [...] "yet another winner in what's shaping up to be a terrific last third of the season".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil that Verdi was to {{describe}} the previous sixteen years of his composing life: in a letter to Countess Clara Maffei, he states: [...] "From Nabucco, you may say, I have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix responded on 27 November 1916: [...] "Your {{presence}} by {{the middle}} of December is essential. The plan I'm writing you about has been worked out in detail and is three quarters done, and only the finale is left, and for that your arrival is awaited. It (the murder) is the only way of saving a situation that is almost hopeless.... You will serve as the lure.... Of course, not a word to anyone." [...] A frightened Irina suddenly backed out of the plan on 3 December 1916: [...] "I know that if I come, I shall certainly get sick... You don't know how things are with me. I want to cry all the time. My mood is terrible. I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> like it before... I don't know myself what's happening to me. Don't drag me to Petrograd. Come down here instead. Forgive me, my dear one, for writing such things to you. But I can't go on any more, I don't know what's the matter with me. Neurasthenia, I think. Don't be angry with me, please don't be angry. I love you terribly. I can't live without you. May the Lord protect you." ...|$|E
