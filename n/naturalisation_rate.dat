30|$|Instrumental reasons include {{economic}} and pragmatic reasons that facilitate everyday life. On the one hand, immigrants from Western European countries are {{citizens of the}} European Union (EU) 12 and thus have almost {{the same rights as}} German citizens. 13 That means that these immigrants only have small additional benefits from naturalisation. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} only 3  % of immigrants from Western European countries are naturalised (Appendix: Tables 6 and 7). These immigrants tend to naturalise for emotional reasons (Worbs 2008). On the other hand, the <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rate</b> is highest for immigrants from other countries (57  %) and Eastern Europe (25  %). 14 Most of these immigrants come from non-EU member states or from countries that have only recently become member states, such as Poland or the Czech Republic in 2004.15 Therefore, these immigrants have greater benefits from naturalisation than immigrants from Western European countries and naturalise mainly for instrumental reasons. The <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rate</b> for immigrants from Turkey is 10  % in the estimation sample. Although they are not EU citizens, Sauer (2012) found that emotional ties to Germany are important motives for acquiring German citizenship for them as well.|$|E
30|$|The worker-level data {{cover all}} years since 1986, except 1990 and 2001, but {{information}} on the nationality of the worker only starts in 2000, so our sample period starts in 2002 and ends in 2008. The exact nationality at the country level is the only information available to identify immigrant workers in QP, as neither the place of birth nor the year of arrival in Portugal are recorded. Nevertheless, given the low <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rate,</b> the sample of immigrants covered in the QP database {{seems to be a}} good approximation of the target population.|$|E
30|$|Language {{proficiency}} and naturalisation status {{cannot be}} controlled for simultaneously. Until 1995, language proficiency was only {{asked in the}} foreigner subsample. This sample consists of households with a foreign head of the household, with <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> thus being very low per definition. After 1997, language proficiency was only asked in odd years.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{focus of}} biosecurity is anticipating future risks, but time lags between introduction, naturalisation, and (ultimately) impact mean that future risks can be {{strongly influenced by}} history. We conduct a comprehensive historical analysis of tropical grasses (n = 155) that have naturalised in Australia since European settlement (1788) to determine what factors shaped historical patterns of naturalisation and future risks, including for the 21 species that cause serious negative impacts. Most naturalised species were from the Old World (78 %), were introduced for use in pasture (64. 5 %), were first recorded prior to 1940 (84. 5 %) and naturalised before 1980 (90. 3 %). Patterns for high-impact species were similar, with all being first recorded in Australia by 1940, and only seven naturalised since then-five intentionally introduced as pasture species. Counter to expectations, we found no evidence for increased naturalisation with increasing trade, including for species introduced unintentionally for which the link {{was expected to be}} strongest. New pathways have not emerged since the 1930 s despite substantial shifts in trading patterns. Furthermore, introduction and <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> are now at or approaching historically low levels. Three reasons were identified: (1) the often long lag phase between introduction and reported <b>naturalisation</b> means <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> reflect historical trends in introduction rates; (2) important introduction pathways are not directly related to trade volume and globalisation; and (3) that species pools may become depleted. The last of these appears to be the case for the most important pathway for tropical grasses, i. e. the intentional introduction of useful pasture species. Assuming that new pathways don't arise that might result in increased <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates,</b> and that current at-border biosecurity practices remain in place, we conclude that most future high-impact tropical grass species are already present in Australia. Our results highlight the need to continually test underlying assumptions regarding future <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> of high-impact invasive species, as conclusions have important implications for how best to manage future biosecurity risks...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{a simple}} relationship: the {{influence}} of citizenship regulations on citizenship acquisitions by comparing citizenship policies and <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> in European countries. The analysis looks at the statistical relationship on the cross-national level. As a quantitative indicator for citizenship policies, the MIPEX Nationality is used, including its different sub-indexes, which measure conditions for access to citizenship, eligibility criteria, security of status as well as regulations concerning dual nationality. The analysis includes a transparent discussion of {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the approach taken in the paper. It can be shown that restricting access to citizenship indeed is related to lower <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates,</b> and that restricted access to dual citizenship appears to have the most significant impact in EU- 25 countries, Norway and Switzerland. However, the analysis shows that such a simple statistical comparison is prone to errors due to, amongst other things, the small number of observations for statistical analyses (i. e. countries), whereby outliers strongly influence the correlation...|$|R
30|$|Table  1 {{illustrates}} that {{the share of}} women is larger among naturalised than among non-naturalised immigrants. Estimation results confirm this observation: women are overall 2 percentage points more likely to naturalise than men when other characteristics are held constant (Table  2). This is in accordance with other studies finding that <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> of women are larger than those of men in OECD countries (e.g. Liebig et al. 2010; Zimmermann et al. 2009; Yang 1994). According to Alvarez (1987), females are more vulnerable and may {{have an incentive to}} acquire citizenship in order to escape from disadvantageous situations such as repressive marriages or jobs.|$|R
40|$|For {{foreign-born}} {{residents and}} their children, attaining citizenship {{in the host}} country confers membership, rights and participation opportunities, and encourages {{a sense of belonging}} (Bloemraad 2006). From a destination country perspective, naturalisation is increasingly seen as {{an important part of the}} process of integrating immigrants. In order to optimise the use of what is sometimes termed the 'citizenship premium', actors in destination countries often advocate public policies that are aimed at increasing <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> among immigrants (OECD 2011; Sumption and Flamm 2012). The acquisition of citizenship is associated with better employment probability, higher earnings and higher occupational positions (Liebig and Von Haaren 2011). Politically, in a democratic context, citizenship normally qualifies immigrants to take an active part in the electoral politics of the destination country (Pikkov 2011; De Rooij 2012) ...|$|R
30|$|These {{empirical}} {{results provide}} support for the ‘complementary’ view on extending membership and rights to immigrants. No contradiction emerges between facilitated naturalisation and residence-based citizenship. For example, there is generally no trade-off between facilitating naturalisation and political participation policies for foreigners. This {{is important because it}} has been shown that inclusive naturalisation policies positively affect <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> among immigrants (Vink, Prokic-Breuer and Dronkers, 2013). Overall, the empirical results largely debunk the ‘alternative’ view as overall the 29 European states included in this study consistently do not facilitate equal rights without also facilitating naturalisation. In other words, naturalisation policies are not simply one of several integration policy alternatives. On the contrary, an inclusive naturalisation policy is part of a comprehensive integration policy promoting equal rights and opportunities for all residents, including both naturalised and non-naturalised immigrants. In contrast, a restrictive naturalisation policy usually reflects a weak state commitment to equal treatment and rights for immigrants, whether naturalised or non-naturalised. While, perhaps, it is intuitive to many that inclusive (or exclusive) naturalisation and integration policies often go together, so far this has not been tested empirically in a systematic manner.|$|R
40|$|INTERACT - Researching Third Country Nationals’ Integration as a Three-way Process - Immigrants, Countries of Emigration and Countries of Immigration as Actors of IntegrationThe fulltext pdfs are {{available}} upon request to migration@EUI. eu during the embargo period (until 6 October 2019) This position paper addresses {{the following research}} question: “How do actors in sending countries influence the integration of immigrants in the European Union, {{with regard to the}} access to citizenship?” The paper argues that the access to citizenship can be viewed as an important factor in the process of integration of immigrants in the destination country. The role of actors in third countries, while only one of the factors that determine citizenship take-up among integration, is crucial as particularly by allowing dual citizenship, countries of origin can take away a major constraint for immigrants in the naturalisation process. Research shows that <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> are positively impacted by tolerant policies towards dual citizenship. The report discusses the state-of-the-art on the propensity to naturalise among immigrants, {{as well as on the}} relation between citizenship and integration. It also presents some key findings from the literature and outlines the relevant questions for further research.

30|$|The growing {{literature}} on citizenship policy, which {{has taken off}} in recent decades, refers explicitly to discussions about immigrant integration and issues of belonging as a prime motivation for studying cross-country variation (e.g. Ersanilli & Koopmans, 2010; Goodman & Wright, 2015; Hainmueller, Hangartner, & Pietrantuono, 2015; Yang, 1994). Studying the rules governing citizenship acquisition is important, is the premise, because ‘the different possibilities to acquire citizenship will have lasting implications for the long-term integration of immigrants’ (Howard, 2009, p. 8). Most often, however, ‘integration’ is looked at in terms of objective measures of incorporation (e.g. <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> or socio-economic parity with the native majority population) 5 rather than immigrants’ subjective experience of citizenship. As Goodman and Wright (2015) argue, {{there is a lack}} of studies of ‘the larger questions of effects of civic integration [requirements] on societal integration generally’. 6 This article contributes to the discussion about the importance of citizenship and citizenship policy by turning to the issue of immigrants’ host national belonging across Western democracies. Belonging is here understood in terms of identification with and feeling of attachment to the nation (Skey, 2013). It is thus both tied to ideas of membership and the feelings of community evoked from this membership (Kannabiran, Vieten, & Yuval-Davis, 2006). Importantly, this notion of belonging underscores that it is something which must be subjectively experienced; it cannot be determined from one’s objective status.|$|R

40|$|Immigrant {{mothers in}} {{developed}} countries often experience worse pregnancy outcomes than native women. Several epidemiological studies have described the pregnancy outcome of immigrant women in European receiving countries, with conflicting results. The present systematic review makes a quanti- tative synthesis of available evidence on the association between pregnancy outcomes and integration policies. We reviewed all epidemiological studies comparing the pregnancy outcome of native versus immigrant women in European countries from 1966 to 2004 and retained 65 for analysis, from 12 host countries. Overall, as compared to native women, immigrant women showed a clear disadvantage for all the outcomes considered: 43 % higher risk of low birth weight, 24 % of pre-term delivery, 50 % of perinatal mortality, and 61 % of congenital malformations. The risks were clearly and significantly reduced in countries with a strong integration policy. This trend was maintained even after adjustment for age at delivery and parity. On {{the basis of an}} analysis of <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates,</b> five countries in our sample could be categorised as having a strong policies promoting the integration of immigrant communities. The mechanisms through which integration policies may be protective include the increased participation of immigrant communities {{in the life of the}} receiving society, and the decreased stress and discrimination they may face. The results of this study highlight a serious problem of equity in perinatal health across European countries. Immigrant women clearly need targeted attention to improve the health of their newborn, but a deep societal change is also necessary to integrate and respect immigrant communities in receiving societies. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a comparative, cross-local and cross-national {{analysis}} of the involvement of migrants and ethnic minorities in public debates and mobilisation (claims-making) in their countries of residence. Local and national integration and citizenship regimes are seen as political opportunity structures that may stimulate, constrain, or channel the degrees and types of migrants' political involvement. Empirically, the paper draws on media content data for Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, {{as well as on}} extra-medial indicators of opportunity structures such as <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> and the relative strength of conservative parties. In a first round of analysis, 16 German regions and cities are compared. This analysis reveals important intra-local differences that are in line with the expectations drawn from the opportunity structure model. The results show a strong and consistent positive relation between the inclusiveness of local incorporation regimes {{and the degree to which}} immigrants participate proactively in public debates on issues concerning them. By contrast, we find political orientations on the countries of origin of immigrants to be most prevalent in localities that offer immigrants few channels of access to the decision-making process and grant them little legitimacy in the public domain. In a second step, this analysis is extended to the Netherlands and the UK, showing that the magnitude of cross-national differences is much more important than that of local variation within each of the countries. Thus, the results contradict recently popular views that the nation-state has become largely irrelevant for the incorporation of immigrants and that postnational and local contexts have become decisive. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd...|$|R
30|$|From this {{perspective}} the rights framework for immigrants should be furthered through normative claims {{under the banner}} of a residence-based citizenship or rights-based approach. The best example is provided by free-moving EU citizens who generally have low <b>naturalisation</b> <b>rates</b> in their country of residence. Their situation underlines, on the one hand, the effectiveness of EU citizenship and the rights framework in Europe and, on the other, the insignificance of national citizenship in the lives of most people, including immigrants. In lieu of naturalisation, some advocate for the extension of all citizenship rights, including national voting rights, to all legal residents. As we will see, this approach to equal rights for foreigners as an ‘alternative’ to naturalisation is similar to the so-called ‘denizenship’ model, where states grant equal economic, social, and certain –but not full– political rights to foreigners, but without facilitated naturalisation. The most radical proposal in this camp is the automatic civic registration for all law-abiding legal residents (Kostakopoulou, 2006, 2010). According to such proposals, citizenship rights would be collective for all legal residents and membership would be self-declared by those who wish to claim it. National citizenship would be a legally inconsequential form of membership. As a result, naturalisation is seen as neither a means nor end of the integration process, since all legal residents should have the legal means for societal integration. Such a view also chimes with those who observe that stricter naturalisation requirements and the introduction of civic integration tests increasingly impose illiberal conditions for naturalisation where immigrants are expected to act as the ‘ideal citizen’ (Carrera, 2009; Van Oers, Erboll and Kostakopoulou, 2010; Anderson, 2013).|$|R
40|$|The Polish {{diaspora}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the world. Australia's 2011 census identifies 48 611 born in Poland and 170 000 claiming Polish ancestry. Using the census, we assess the structural (socio-economic) and spatial integration of the first (Poles who arrived in the post-World War II period as largely displaced persons and refugees), second (their children) and third (grandchildren) generations, and compare the first generation with another cohort: the skilled first-generation ('Solidarity') immigrants who arrived in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. Key OECD indicators of integration — education attainment, proficiency in English, employment status and occupational progression, home ownership, <b>naturalisation,</b> return <b>rates</b> and patterns of residential distribution — are examined. Results point to their successful integration, with high levels of labour market participation, earnings, and naturalisation, levels of spatial integration as exemplified in a Melbourne case study (where the highest proportions of those of Polish birth or ancestry reside), return migration and language retention, and levels of owner-occupied housing (the 'middle-class dream') higher than among Australians generally. 16 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} study of citizenship regimes has reached a new stage. Several authors and research teams have constructed indicators and compound indices that allow comparing larger numbers of countries in more systematic ways. In his kickoff contribution for the EUDO CITIZENSHIP forum debate, Marc Helbling asks whether indicators that are constructed independently from each other, but often measure similar phenomena, are really useful. He suggests to distinguish between policy outputs and outcomes, <b>naturalisation</b> and rejection <b>rates</b> as well as simple and complex indicators. Nine authors respond to this challenge. Several among them propose that citizenship indicators serve different research purposes and some challenge {{the very idea of}} indicator-based evaluation of citizenship policies. Although this debate certainly does not concluded in consensus, Helbling’s rejoinder shows that the link between research purposes and methods has been clarified to a certain extent. By social science standards, this is not insignificant progress. ...|$|R
