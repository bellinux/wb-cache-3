How a manufacturing firm has managed to achieve a high value added competitive advantage?

This paper contains the interesting idea that marketing strategy choice of members of a franchise network {{may be related to}} their structural position in that network. It develops a potentially valuable metric of proximity to network resources and deploys the somewhat novel CRT technique to test some propositions.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} {{database}} of preserving agents for the treatment of farming machinery {{on the basis of a}} comparison to evaluate anticorrosive efficiency of these preservatives in the laboratory and atmospheric tests. Another objective was to determine amounts of individual preservatives required per a square meter and to define costs of their use. In addition to the determination of the protective efficiency of the preservatives, another goal of the work was to demonstrate the influence of environment on the corrosion rate and extent. A database of preserving agents available on the market which are designed for temporary protection of materials, machines and equipment was developed for this dissertation. The database contains 230 preservatives including their <b>name,</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> type, method of application and term of use. The database is available on the attached CD in the file marked as Table of preservatives. Within the framework of the thesis, 12 preserving agents made by eight manufacturers were tested in 6 environments.

40|$|A pay-for-delay drug settlement, {{also called}} a reverse payment settlement, {{occurs when a}} brand name {{pharmaceutical}} company agrees to pay the maker of a similar generic drug to delay {{the release of the}} generic drug into the stream of commerce, thereby allowing the brand name pharmaceutical company to eliminate competition {{for an extended period of}} time. These agreements allow both the brand <b>name</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and the generic manufacturer to profit immensely. These settlements cost the American public an estimated $ 3. 5 billion per year. Further, reverse payment settlements on average prevent generic drugs from entering the stream of commerce for an additional seventeen months. As a result, the public is missing out on generic drugs that could be up to ninety percent cheaper than the brand name version. This Comment intends to show that reverse payment settlements are unduly burdensome on interstate commerce, and thus it is within the purview of Congress to regulate these types of agreements. First, this Comment will explore the statutory framework through which pay-for-delay settlements became prominent. Next, this Comment discusses the history of pay-for-delay litigation and the underlying patent and antitrust laws that courts have focused on in making their decisions. After the necessary background is established, this Comment explores the commerce clause of the United States Constitution and argues that pay-for-delay settlements are unduly burdensome on interstate commerce, and therefore, either Congress should illegalize the settlements through legislation or the Supreme Court should find them unconstitutional. Finally, the possible benefits of such legislation are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{two issues}} in {{operations}} management. The {{first one is}} the impact of counterfeits and strategies of fighting counterfeits for brand name companies, which includes two parts, and the second one is the effect of timing of payments in a joint replenishment and pricing control problem. Counterfeiting is a widely spread phenomenon and has seen rapid growth in recent years. All counterfeits can be divided into two categories, non-deceptive and deceptive, depending on whether consumers can recognize them when making a purchase. In the first part, we focus on how non-deceptive counterfeits affect the price, market share and profitability of brand name products. We also consider the strategies for brand name companies to fight non-deceptive counterfeits, compare different fighting strategies in a market with one brand name product and its counterfeit, and derive equilibrium fighting strategies in a market with two competing brand name products and a counterfeit under general conditions. In the second part, we focus on how deceptive counterfeits affect a brand name manufacturer’s profit and supply chain structure. In a market with deceptive counterfeits, the brand <b>name</b> <b>manufacturer</b> should consider protective strategies on its supply chain to avoid being penetrated by counterfeits. We analyze a brand name manufacturer’s optimal decision on whether to establish a reliable distribution channel, decentralized or centralized, to guarantee 100 % authenticity, and whether to sell through the general channel having been penetrated by counterfeits. We also compare the profit from a centralized reliable channel to the one from a decentralized one. In the third part, we consider the joint replenishment and pricing control problem in a periodic review system in which consumers pay upon receiving their goods and unmet demand is lost if not filled in the following period, referred to as conditional backlogging. We show that a base-stock list price policy is optimal in the case without a fixed ordering cost, and provide a sufficient condition for an (st, St, pt) policy to be optimal in the case with a positive fixed ordering cost. We also compare this system to the one where customers pay upon arrival analytically and numerically...|$|E
