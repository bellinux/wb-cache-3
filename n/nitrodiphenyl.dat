40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} myosin in muscle fibers of the diaphragm in experimental congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: Fetuses of pregnant rats were divided into four groups: External Control (EC), composed of non-manipulated rats; Nitrofen, composed of pregnant rats that received 100 mg of nitrofen (2, 4 -dichloro- 4 ' <b>nitrodiphenyl</b> ether) diluted in olive oil on gestational day (GD) 9. 5, whose fetuses developed CDH (N+) or not (N-), and Olive Oil Placebo (OO), composed of pregnant rats that received the oil on the same GD. The fetuses were collected on GD 18. 5, 19. 5, 20. 5 and 21. 5 (term = 22 days). We obtained body weight (BW) and photographed the diaphragm area (DA), hernia area (HA) and subsequent calculated the HA/DA ratio in N+ group. Samples of Diaphragm muscle were processed for histological staining with H/E and immunohistochemistry (IHQ) for myosin. RESULTS: The fetuses of N- and N+ groups had decreased BW and DA compared to EC and OO groups (p < 0. 001). HA was decreased on GD 18. 5 compared to 21. 5 (p < 0. 001) and the HA/DA ratio showed no difference. IHQ showed decreased expression of myosin in nitrofen groups. CONCLUSION: CDH induced by nitrofen model contributes {{to the understanding of}} muscularization {{in the formation of the}} diaphragm where the myosin expression is decreased...|$|E
40|$|Background & Objective: Tyrosinase is a {{key enzyme}} in pigment synthesis. Overproduction of melanin {{in parts of the}} skin results in {{hyperpigmentation}} diseases. Thus, its inhibitors are highly important in the medical, cosmetic and agricultural fields. The aim of this research is the bioinformatical study of tyrosinase inhibition by a number of hydroxy <b>nitrodiphenyl</b> ether derivatives. Material & Methods: This is a descriptive-analytic study. In order to investigate the mode of interaction of the compounds with tyrosinase active site, the chemical structures of all compounds were designed using ChemDraw program, then transferred into Hyperchem software for energy minimization. Docking study was performed by AutoDock 4. 2 program and the resulting docking poses were analyzed in AutoDockTools, DS Visualizer 3. 5 and Ligplot software. Results: Among the all studied compounds, the best docking results were related to 4 -Hydroxy- 2 '-nitrodiphenyl etherdisplayed. In fact, this compound had the most negative ΔGbind (- 12. 79 Kcal/mol) that indicated favorable interactions with the key amino acid residues at active site of tyrosinase. Docking results for this compound are in accordance with those of co-crystallized ligand (tropolone). In this compound, the oxygen of nitro group has an efficient metal-ligand interaction with the Cu 2 + ions in the active site. Conclusion: Finally, in respect to  high effectiveness and docking results, we can conclude that the compound 4 -Hydroxy- 2 '-nitrodiphenyl ether may be regarded as an effective anti-tyrosinase inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|The <b>nitrodiphenyl</b> ether {{herbicide}} 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 -nitroacetophenone oxime-o-(acetic acid, methyl ester) (DPEI) induces light- and O 2 -dependent {{lipid peroxidation}} and chlorophyll (Chl) bleaching {{in the green}} alga Scenedesmus obliquus. Under conditions of O 2 -limitation, these effects are diminished by prometyne and 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 1 -dimethylurea (DCMU), both inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport. Mutants in which photosynthetic electron transport is blocked are also resistant to DPEI under conditions of O 2 -limitation. Light- and O 2 -dependent lipid peroxidation and Chl bleaching are also induced by 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 3 -methoxyphthalide (DPEII), a diphenyl ether whose redox properties preclude reduction by photosystem I. However, these effects of DPEII are also inhibited by DCMU. Under conditions of high aeration, DCMU does not protect Scenedesmus cells from Chl bleaching induced by DPEI, but does protect against paraquat. DPEI, but not paraquat, induces tetrapyrrole formation in treated cells in the dark. This is also observed in a mutant lacking photosystem I but is suppressed under conditions {{likely to lead to}} O 2 limitation. Our results indicate that, in contrast to paraquat, the role of photosynthetic electron transport in diphenyl ether toxicity in Scenedesmus is not to reduce the herbicide to a radical species which initiates lipid peroxidation. Its role is probably to maintain a sufficiently high O 2 concentration, through water-splitting, in the algal suspension...|$|E
40|$|The <b>nitrodiphenyl</b> ether {{herbicide}} 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 2 -nitroacetophenone oxime-O-(acetic acid, methyl ester) (DPEI) induced {{an abnormal}} accumulation of protoporphyrin IX in darkness {{in the green}} alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrofluorimetry. It also inhibited the increase in cell density of the alga in light-grown cultures with an I 50 (concentration required to decrease cell density increase to 50 % of the noninhibited control value) of 0. 16 μm. The relative ability of four peroxidizing diphenyl ether herbicides to cause tetrapyrrole accumulation in C. reinhardtii correlated qualitatively with their ability to inhibit the increase in cell density in light-grown cultures. The purified S(−) enantiomer of the optically active phthalide DPE 5 -[2 -chloro- 4 -(trifluoromethyl) phenoxy]- 3 -methylphthalide (DPEIII), which has greater herbicidal activity than the R(+) isomer, induces a 4 - to 5 -fold greater tetrapyrrole accumulation than the R(+) isomer. The I 50 for inhibition of increase in cell density in light-grown cultures of C. reinhardtii by the S(−) isomer (0. 019 μm) is less than 25 % of that for the R(+) isomer. DPEIII inhibits protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase activity in pea (Pisum sativum) etioplast lysates, with the S(−) enantiomer showing considerably greater potency than the R(+) isomer and the racemic mixture showing a potency intermediate between the two. The {{results indicate that the}} site at which DPEs inhibit protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase shows chiral discrimination and provide further evidence for the link between inhibition of this enzyme, protoporphyrin IX accumulation, and the phytotoxicity of DPE herbicides...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nitrodiphenyl</b> ether (NDPE) {{and related}} {{herbicides}} cause light and oxygen-dependent lipid peroxidation in susceptible green plants and algae. The exact {{mode of action}} of these herbicides {{has not yet been}} clearly established. Experiments with the alga Scenedesmus obliquus indicate that the role of photosynthetic electron transport is principally to generate the oxygen required for NDPE toxicity, rather than having a more direct involvement. DPE I an experimental NDPE, did not induce lipid peroxidation or chlorophyll bleaching in the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii but the herbicide did inhibit growth of the algal cultures. The toxic effects of DPE I on chrysanthemum petals containing a mixture of carotenoids but no chlorophyll appeared to support the hypothesis that carotenoids are the photosensitisers in NDPE action. The bleaching of chromoplast fractions isolated from chrysanthemum petals, when incubated under light, was enhanced by DPE I. Experiments suggested that the NDPE-enhanced bleaching does not involve singlet oxygen or Fenton chemistry. Structure activity studies suggested that the mechanism of NDPE-induced bleaching of chromoplasts is different to that of the toxic effects induced by these herbicides in leaves. DPE I treatment caused the abnormal accumulation of photodynamic tetrapyrrole compounds in cucumber, barley, Scenedesmus and Chlamydomonas. In C. reinhardtii the major tetrapyrrole accumulating was identified as protoporphyrin IX. Experiments with enantiomers of a phthalide DPE, phthalide DPE III showed that the S(-) isomer induced greater accumulation of tetrapyrroles than the R(+) isomer. This difference was reflected in the herbicidal activities of the S(-) and R(+) isomers and suggests the likely involvement of an enzymic binding process, possibly within the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway, in the mode of action of the DPE herbicides. <p...|$|E
