25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a <b>negative</b> <b>potential</b> (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E

Both films displayed changes in their absorption spectra consistent with reduction of the oxidised form of polypyrrole (PPy), when subjected to <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> after immersion in acetonitrile solutions containing tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). Surprisingly, at even more <b>negative</b> <b>potentials,</b> both films showed a further set of spectral changes including the reappearance of a free carrier tail at wavelengths beyond 600 nm. These spectral changes suggest that the conductivity of the films was increasing at very <b>negative</b> <b>potentials,</b> a conclusion supported by in situ resistometry experiments performed using PPy/pTS films. These additional spectral changes were not observed during spectroelectrochemistry experiments performed using PPy films immersed in aqueous solutions, or organic solvents {{that had previously been}} de-aerated. These observations, as well as other evidence, suggest that molecular oxygen {{plays an important role in}} the occurrence of the additional spectral changes observed at very <b>negative</b> <b>potentials.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

25|$|In the {{electron}} gun, monochromatic electrons are emitted by a cathode filament {{which is at}} a <b>negative</b> <b>potential,</b> typically 10-600 V, {{with respect to the}} sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of {{the electron}}s incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface as wide as the electron beam, although sometimes polycrystalline surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The <b>negative</b> <b>potential</b> opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E
25|$|Willard Gardner and Walter Gardner {{developed}} a negative head permeameter {{as early as}} 1939. Dixon (1975) {{developed a}} closed-top ring infiltrometer to quantify macropores. Water is applied to a closed-top system, which permits the imposition of negative head or pressure on the ponded water surface. Negative tension {{can be considered as}} simulating a positive soil air pressure, created by a negative air pressure above ponded surface water. A simplification was made by Topp and Zebchuk (1985). The limitation of this device is the infiltration has to be started by ponding the closed-top infiltrometer (applying a positive head), then adjusted to a negative pressure. Little research effort was continued in this area, instead attention has been given mainly to the sorptivity apparatus of Dirksen (1975) which used a ceramic plate as a base. Based on this design, Brent Clothier and Ian White (1981) developed the sorptivity tube which can provide a constant <b>negative</b> <b>potential</b> (tension) on the soil surface. However, the sorptivity tube had many shortcomings, hence modifications to the design {{led to the development of}} the disc permeameter by Perroux and White (1988) from CSIRO. In the US it is known as the tension infiltrometer.|$|E

Large (approximately 60 percent) increases in predicted <b>negative</b> shaded-side <b>potentials</b> are obtained. To investigate effective potential barrier or angular momentum selection effects due {{to the presence of}} less negative sunlit-side or adjacent surface potentials, these expressions were replaced by the ion random current, which is a lower bound for convex surfaces when such effects become very severe. Further large increases in predicted <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> were obtained, amounting to a doubling in some cases...|$|R

25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) <b>negative</b> <b>potential</b> created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave oven or a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSperm entry was {{monitored}} in voltage-clamped {{sea urchin}} eggs following insemination {{in a variety}} of artificial seawaters. In regular seawater, maintaining the membrane <b>potential</b> at increasingly <b>negative</b> values progressively inhibits sperm entry. Reducing [Ca 2 +]o relieves the inhibition, shifting the sperm entry vs voltage relationship toward more <b>negative</b> <b>potentials.</b> Raising [Ca 2 +]o shifts the relationship in the other direction. Large changes in [Na+]o or [Mg 2 +]o do not affect sperm entry although changing [Na+]o dramatically changes the currents following sperm attachment. Applying one of seven different calcium channel blockers or replacing Ca 2 + with Ba 2 + or Sr 2 + or microinjecting calcium chelators into the cytoplasm relieves the block to sperm entry at <b>negative</b> <b>potentials.</b> We conclude that the block to sperm entry at <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> is mediated by calcium which crosses the membrane and acts at an intracellular site...|$|R

With 250 and 500 nm [Ca 2 +]i bath application of NFA (100 μm) increased inward current at <b>negative</b> <b>potentials,</b> but inhibited outward current at positive potentials. On wash out of NFA, ICl(Ca) was greatly enhanced at all potentials. When external Na+ ions were replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+) NFA still enhanced ICl(Ca) at <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> but the increase of ICl(Ca) on wash out was blocked. When the mean reversal potential (Er) of ICl(Ca) was shifted to <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> by replacing external Cl− with SCN−, NFA increased inward current but blocked outward current suggesting {{that the effect of}} NFA is dependent on current flow. Inclusion of NFA in the pipette solution had no effect on ICl(Ca).

DCDPC (100 μm) produced similar effects to NFA but 1 mm DIDS produced inhibition of ICl(Ca) at both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>potentials</b> and there was no increase in current on wash out of DIDS.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} a lipid bilayer, {{diphtheria}} toxin binds to it and forms transmembrane, voltage-dependent, anion-selective channels. The mean (+/- SD) conductance of these channels in asolectin membranes is 6. 2 +/- 0. 7 pmho (pS) in 0. 2 M NaCl and 20 +/- 2 pmho in 1. 0 M NaCl. The rate of channel formation depends on the pH in the toxin-containing compartment; it is very low at pH greater than 5. 0 and increases abruptly as the pH decreases from 4. 9 to 4. 0. Binding of toxin to the membrane is also pH dependent, being unmeasurable at pH 7 and increasing monotonically with decreasing pH. The rate of channel formation depends upon membrane potential as well; channels form only at <b>negative</b> <b>potentials.</b> These channels are permanent in the time scale of the experiments (about 1 hr).
