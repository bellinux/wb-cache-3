In particular, the main contribution of this work arises from the explicit introduction in the modeling framework of external power exchanges from other surrounding networks and <b>network</b> <b>peripheral</b> hubs. Also, the impact of hydrogen storage in a network including electricity, natural gas and wind is studied {{by means of the}} proposed general network formulation, showing its high flexibility in terms of modeling detail and accuracy.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein domains are {{globular}} {{structures of}} independently folded polypeptides that exert catalytic or binding activities. Their sequences {{are recognized as}} evolutionary units that, through genome recombination, constitute protein repertoires of linkage patterns. Via mutations, domains acquire modified functions {{that contribute to the}} fitness of cells and organisms. Recent studies have addressed the evolutionary selection that may have shaped the functions of individual domains and the emergence of particular domain combinations, which led to new cellular functions in multi-cellular animals. This study focuses on modeling domain linkage globally and investigates evolutionary implications that may be revealed by novel computational analysis. Results A survey of 77 completely sequenced eukaryotic genomes implies a potential hierarchical and modular organization of biological functions in most living organisms. Domains in a genome or multiple genomes are modeled as a network of hetero-duplex covalent linkages, termed bigrams. A novel computational technique is introduced to decompose such networks, whereby the notion of domain "networking versatility" is derived and measured. The most and least "versatile" domains (termed "core domains" and "peripheral domains" respectively) are examined both computationally via sequence conservation measures and experimentally using selected domains. Our study suggests that such a versatility measure extracted from the bigram networks correlates with the adaptivity of domains during evolution, where the network core domains are highly adaptive, significantly contrasting the <b>network</b> <b>peripheral</b> domains. Conclusions Domain recombination has played a major part in the evolution of eukaryotes attributing to genome complexity. From a system point of view, as the results of selection and constant refinement, networks of domain linkage are structured in a hierarchical modular fashion. Domains with high degree of networking versatility appear to be evolutionary adaptive, potentially through functional innovations. Domain bigram networks are informative as a model of biological functions. The networking versatility indices extracted from such networks for individual domains reflect the strength of evolutionary selection that the domains have experienced. </p...|$|E

50|$|In {{relation}} to post-MS Windows 2000 / NT, client-server based networks, NetBIOS is effectively becoming a legacy protocol. NetBIOS was also developed for non-routable LANs. In most post year 2000 networks operating Windows 2000 or later, NetBIOS effectively offers backwards compatibility for network devices that predate compatibility with DNS. A {{central role of}} NetBIOS in Client-Server networks (and also those networks that have <b>networked</b> <b>peripheral</b> hardware that also predates DNS compatibility) is to provide name resolution to computers and <b>networked</b> <b>peripherals.</b> Further, it allows for such networked hardware to be accessed and shared and also enables the mapping and browsing of network folders, shares and shared printers, faxes, etc. In its primary capacity, it acts as a session-layer protocol transported over TCP/IP to provide name resolution to a computer and shared folders. To that end, Windows 2000-based, Client-Server networks - and later - do not require this insecure means of name resolving and addressing or navigating of network shares.|$|R

40|$|Background: Increasing {{numbers of}} older people are {{requiring}} residential care and there are high levels of depression in such settings. Existing literature suggests that social support can help maintain psychological wellbeing. This study aimed to examine perceived changes in social support following a move into residential care. The key theories drawn upon were socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen et al., 1999) and the convoy model (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980). Method: Forty care home residents were interviewed using a structured interview. A hierarchical network mapping technique {{was used to measure}} perceptions of total network, inner <b>network</b> and <b>peripheral</b> <b>network</b> size. Functional support from a key significant other was measured using the Significant Others Scale. Contact with network members, depression and demographic information were also examined. Retrospective ratings were obtained by asking participants to think back to before they moved into care. Current and retrospective ratings on all measures were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results: Total network size was perceived to have decreased following a move into residential care. There {{was no significant difference between}} current and retrospective ratings of inner <b>network</b> size. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>network</b> size decreased but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no perceived change in emotional and practical social support received from a key significant other following the move. Discussion: The results suggest that an individual‟s social network is compacted following a move into care but that membership of the inner network remains stable. These findings are discussed in terms of socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen et al., 1999) and the convoy model (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980). Strengths and weaknesses of the study are discussed and clinical implications of the findings explored. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Families {{are social}} units that expand in time (across generations) and space (as a {{geographically}} distributed substructures of wider kinship networks). Understanding of intergenerational family relations thus requires conceptualization of communication processes {{that take place}} within a small collective of persons linked with one another by a flexible social network. Within such <b>networks,</b> <b>Peripheral</b> Communication Patterns {{set the stage for}} direct everyday life activities within the family context. Peripheral Communication Patterns are conditions where one family network member (A) communicates manifestly with another member (B) with the aim of bringing the communicative message to the third member (C) who is present but is not explicitly designated as the manifest addressee of the intended message. Inclusion of physically non-present members of the family network (elders living elsewhere, deceased relatives, ancestors’ spirits, etc.) in efforts that use Peripheral Communication Patterns creates a highly redundant social context for human development over life course which is the basis for family members’ resilience during critical life events. Examples from the social contexts of Greenland, Italy and India will be analyzed to arrive at a general model of the role of peripheral communication as the core of intergenerational value transfer processes...|$|R
