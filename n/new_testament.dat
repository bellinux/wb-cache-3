5|$|Along with Codex Vaticanus, the Codex Sinaiticus is {{considered}} one of the most valuable manuscripts for establishing the original text (textual criticism) of the Greek <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> as well as the Septuagint. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> and the only ancient manuscript of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating the Codex Sinaiticus and the proposed lifetime of Jesus, it {{is considered}} to be more accurate than most later <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> copies in preserving superior readings where many later manuscripts are in error.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{and medieval}} Christian writers treated {{this as a}} miracle, and {{believed}} it {{to be one of}} the few episodes from the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> which were confirmed by non-Christian sources; modern scholars, however, have found no contemporary references to it outside the <b>New</b> <b>Testament.</b>|$|E
5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic {{text in the}} <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> more often than not agree with Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E

5|$|In May 1975, during {{restoration}} work, {{the monks}} of Saint Catherine's Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland {{and his team}} from the Institute for <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> Textual Research were the first scholars who exclusively were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new fragments of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete leaves from the Sinaiticus, 11 leaves of the Pentateuch and 1 leaf of the Shepherd of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> have been found (uncials 0278 – 0296 and some minuscules).|$|E

5|$|Most current {{scholars}} {{consider the}} Codex Vaticanus {{to be one}} of the best Greek texts of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> with the Codex Sinaiticus as its only competitor. Until the discovery by Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex was unrivaled. It was extensively used by Westcott and Hort in their edition of The <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> in the Original Greek in 1881. The most widely sold editions of the Greek <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> are largely based on the text of the Codex Vaticanus.|$|E

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek <b>New</b> <b>Testament.</b> It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type.

All critical editions of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the basis for the translation.|$|E

A typographical facsimile appeared between 1868 and 1872. In 1889–1890 a photographic facsimile of the entire manuscript was made and published by Cozza-Luzi, in three volumes. Another facsimile of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> text was published in 1904–1907 in Milan. As a result, the Codex became widely available.|$|E

5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the <b>New</b> <b>Testament)</b> (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the first}} {{manuscript}} of great importance and antiquity of which any extensive use was made by textual critics, but {{the value of the}} codex was differently appreciated by different writers in the past. Wettstein created a modern system of catalogization of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> manuscripts. Codex Alexandrinus received symbol A and opened the list of the NT uncial manuscripts. Wettstein announced in his Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci (1730) that Codex A is the oldest and the best manuscript of <b>New</b> <b>Testament,</b> and should be the basis in every reconstruction of the <b>New</b> <b>Testament</b> text. Codex Alexandrinus became a basis for criticizing the Textus Receptus (Wettstein, Woide, Griesbach).|$|E
