40|$|A new {{stereoscopic}} {{road network}} extraction framework {{based on the}} decision-level fusion of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is proposed in this paper. Three steps are included in this framework: 1) road segment extraction and structure optimization through SAR imagery, 2) road segment extraction and stereoscopic information collection through optical imagery, and 3) fusion of the SAR result with the optical image and the stereoscopic information. In this study, our new road <b>network</b> <b>grouping</b> algorithm called road <b>network</b> <b>grouping</b> based on the multi-scale geometric analysis of detector Response is used, with the improved footprint method, and the stereoscopic inversion algorithm. The most important finding of our work lies in the fusion step, by which a stereoscopic road network can be acquired after going through the three aforementioned processes and by fusing the stereoscopic information obtained from optical imagery and road network extracted from SAR imagery. Our algorithm is tested on the real TerraSAR-X and QuickBird data. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

This was reflected in the <b>network</b> <b>grouping.</b> Bayesian inference showed that haplotype distribution may have its origins in C. externa divergence into two distinct clades, which dispersed to various locations, and their subsequent diversification. The evolutionary history of C. externa may include multiple ancestral haplotypes differentiating within the same geographic area to generate the current broad genetic diversity, so that the earlier geographical history has been erased, and now we have highlighted its more recent genetic history...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a road <b>network</b> <b>grouping</b> {{algorithm}} for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{images is}} proposed by exploiting multiscal e geometric analysis of detector responses. Before running the algorithm, a response map {{made up of}} responses, which is binarized, skeletonized, and vectorized to generate road candidates, is obtained by applying a local detector to a SAR image first. Then the proposed method identifies real road segments among the candidates and fills gaps between them. It works in three steps. 1) Guidance segments are extracted at different resolutions from the response map using multiscale techniques and merged to get a more appropriate approximation. 2) Segments are labeled “road” or “noise” using relaxation labeling techniques, among which “road” ones are grouped as they may lie on different roads. 3) Connection points between can didates are acquired by mapping candidates to grouped “road” guidance segments. Those connection points are linked with straight lines or curvilinear segments after a segmentation process. The experiments on TerraSAR images show {{the effectiveness of this}} new method.

30|$|The {{financing}} trust {{network is}} long-term and persistent. The validity period {{of an official}} guarantee agreement between public companies is generally over 1  year. Agreements of shareholding and joint ventures have an even longer validity period. The classifications of financing trust network in which a focal firm was located in cross-sections of 2010 and 2013 is auto-correlated. Moreover, open networks {{and a part of}} transitional networks contain multiple focal firms; the variable values of focal firms within the same financing trust network may have an intrinsic correlation. To control for potential endogeneity, this paper generates a group dummy variable and a classification dummy variable. The cross-sectional data from 2010 includes 93 sectarian networks with 93 focal firms, 29 transitional networks with 58 focal firms, and 7 open financing trust networks with 67 focal firms. This paper generates seven group dummy variables to identify the seven largest open networks so as to control for the most of endogeneity brought in by <b>network</b> <b>grouping.</b> This paper also generates two dummy classification variables to identify sectarian and transitional networks, so as to control for the endogeneity brought in by network classification.|$|E

This study examines a digital social network – an earthquake disaster information reporting network – for rapid collection of earthquake disaster information. Based on the network, the disaster information rapid collection method is expounded in this paper. The structure and components of the reporting network are introduced. Then the work principles of the reporting network are discussed, in which the rapid collection of disaster information is realised by using Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) messages to report the disaster information and Geographic information system (GIS) to analyse and extract useful disaster information.

40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are {{observed}} to be {{a class of}} infrastructure less network architecture that are formed by a collection of mobile nodes, {{communicate with each other}} using multihop wireless links. The reason for preferring MANETs is that they eliminate the requirement for central management, so that each node must operate cooperatively to successfully maintain the network. Each node performs as a source, a sink and a router. Wireless ad hoc networks have diverse applications spanning several domains, including military, commercial, medical, and home networks. From the review, it is observed that (i) there are many challenges {{in the creation of a}} MANET, such as routing challenges, wireless medium challenges, scalability challenges and portability challenges (ii) large groups of mobile nodes located over a large geographical area belonging to the same <b>network</b> <b>grouping</b> can benefit from this system (iii) MANETs are expected to be based on all-IP architecture, carrying a multitude of real-time multimedia applications such as voice, video and data (iv) MANETs should have an efficient routing and quality of service (QoS) mechanism to support diverse applications and (iv) to cope with the unpredictable nature of this highly dynamic environment, wireless ad hoc networks need to be able to adapt to changes in resource availability (i. e., energy, bandwidth, processing power, network density, and topology changes) and overcome any unanticipated networking problems while satisfying a wide range of application requirements...|$|E
30|$|The {{clustering}} {{coefficient of}} the individual nodes and of the entire network {{can be used to}} obtain important information about the type of <b>network,</b> <b>grouping</b> (or classification) of nodes, and identification of the most significant nodes. For instance, a very high clustering coefficient (close to 1.0) indicates a regular network, since in a regular network, every node is connected to every other node in the same manner. A very low clustering coefficient (close to zero), with C[*]=[*]p (where p is the probability of any two nodes in the network being connected), indicates a (classical) random network, since the connections between the nodes are purely random in nature. For a small-world network (e.g., Watts and Strogatz 1998), the clustering coefficient is generally smaller than that of the regular network but also considerably larger than that of a comparable random network (i.e., having the same number of nodes and links). A scale-free network (e.g., Barabási and Albert 1999) may also have such a clustering coefficient value. Therefore, it is often not easy to distinguish between small-world networks and scale-free networks based on the clustering coefficient alone (both small-world networks and scale-free networks essentially belong to the category of random networks, but their properties are different from that of classical random networks). However, other network-based measures, such as the shortest path length (e.g., Watts and Strogatz 1998) and the degree distribution (e.g., Barabási and Albert 1999), can provide reliable information to identify/distinguish between small-world networks and scale-free networks, or even some other type. It is relevant to note, at this point, that for a number of real-world networks studied in the literature, including hydrologic networks, the clustering coefficient is reported to be above 0.5 (e.g., Watts and Strogatz 1998; Jeong et al. 2000; Newman 2001; Newman et al. 2001; Tsonis and Roebber 2004; Suweis et al. 2011; Scarsoglio et al. 2013; Sivakumar and Woldemeskel 2014, 2015; Halverson and Fleming 2015), suggesting that such networks are not classical random networks, but may be small-world networks or scale-free networks or some other types.|$|E

40|$|Sensor nodes are {{deployed}} over sensing fields {{for the purpose}} of monitoring certain phenomena of interest. The sensor nodes perform specific measurements, process the sensed data, and send the data to a base station over a wireless channel. The base station collects data from the sensor nodes, analyses this data, and reports it to the users. Wireless sensor networks are different from traditional networks, because of the following constraints. Typically, a large number of sensor nodes need to be randomly deployed and, in most cases, they {{are deployed}} in unreachable environments; however, the sensor nodes may fail, and they are subject to power constraints. Energy {{is one of the most}} important design constraints of wireless sensor networks. Energy consumption, in a sensor node, occurs due to many factors, such as: sensing the environment, transmitting and receiving data, processing data, and communication overheads. Since the sensor nodes behave as router nodes for data propagation, of the other sensor nodes to the base station, network connectivity decreases gradually. This may result in disconnected sub networks of sensor nodes. In order to prolong the network¿s lifetime, energy efficient protocols should be designed for the characteristics of the wireless sensor network. Sensor nodes in different regions of the sensing field can collaborate to aggregate the data that they gathered. Data aggregation is defined as the process of aggregating the data from sensor nodes to reduce redundant transmissions. It reduces a large amount of the data traffic on the network, it requires less energy, and it avoids information overheads by not sending all of the unprocessed data throughout the sensor <b>network.</b> <b>Grouping</b> sensor nodes into clusters is useful because it reduces the energy consumption. The clustering technique can be used to perform data aggregation. The clustering procedure involves the selection of cluster heads in each of the cluster, in order to coordinate the member nodes. The cluster head is responsible for: gathering the sensed data from its cluster¿s nodes, aggregating the data, and then sending the aggregated data to the base station. An adaptive clustering protocol was introduced to select the heads in the wireless sensor network. The proposed clustering protocol will dynamically change the cluster heads to obtain the best possible performance, based on the remaining energy level of sensor nodes and the average energy of clusters. The OMNET simulator will be used to present the design and implementation of the adaptive clustering protocol and then to evaluate it. This research has conducted extensive simulation experiments, in order to fully study and analyse the proposed energy efficient clustering protocol. It is necessary for all of the sensor nodes to remain alive for as long as possible, since network quality decreases as soon as a set of sensor nodes die. The goal of the energy efficient clustering protocol is to increase the lifetime and stability period of the sensor network. This research also introduces a new bidirectional data gathering protocol. This protocol aims to form a bidirectional ring structure among the sensor nodes, within the cluster, in order to reduce the overall energy consumption and enhance the network¿s lifetime. A bidirectional data gathering protocol uses a source node to transmit data to the base station, via one or more multiple intermediate cluster heads. It sends data through energy efficient paths to ensure the total energy, needed to route the data, is kept to a minimum. Performance results reveal that the proposed protocol is better in terms of: its network lifetime, energy dissipation, and communication overheads...|$|E
