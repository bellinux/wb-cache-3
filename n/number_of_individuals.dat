5|$|Based on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals,</b> Waptia fieldensis {{constitutes}} about 2.55% of {{the total}} number of organisms recovered from the Burgess Shale, and 0.86% of the Greater Phyllopod bed. This makes them the third most abundant arthropods of the Burgess Shale (after Marrella and Canadaspis). The National Museum of Natural History alone houses more than a thousand specimens of the species from the Burgess Shale. Waptia fieldensis are often found disarticulated, with parts remaining in close proximity to each other.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Convention on Human Rights {{established}} an unprecedented system <b>of</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> {{rights and freedoms}} applicable in the present, in almost all European countries. The creation of a Permanent Court in 1988, was motivated essentially by the increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> complaints the settlement of which was not possible under the old procedure. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> complaints continued to increase on an accelerated rhythm and therefore the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases in which settlement was required has increased considerably. The growing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> applications impose Community Justice System permanent reform and consideration of issues raised in {{the findings of this}} paper...|$|R

5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals,</b> around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also quite small.|$|E

If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1808, the Portuguese {{were the}} only European people to settle Brazil in {{significant}} numbers. Although British, Germans, Italians and Spanish had previously immigrated to Brazil, they had only done so as a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> or in very small groups.

5|$|Since {{the time}} of its {{discovery}} in 1905, there have been many attempts to estimate the population size of this species. Results varied greatly, but the more recent ones suggest a very reduced <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals.</b> This coupled with a very restricted distribution have led to the listing of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis as an endangered or threatened species. Humans frequently invade its habitat, though such disturbances have been greatly reduced by preventive measures. Recent efforts in conservation include perpetuating the extant population at a baseline size as well as maintaining captive populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E

This was rejected by Evans and Reisz (2007), though.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, as {{elsewhere}} in the world of European colonies, the frontier of European exploration and settlement tended to be a linguistically diverse and fluid place, as cultures using different languages met and interacted. The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade, and (in some cases) intermarriage, {{led to the development of}} Mixed languages. Languages like Michif, Chinook Jargon and Bungi creole tended to be highly localized and were often spoken by only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> who were frequently capable of speaking another language. Plains Sign Talk, which functioned originally as a trade language used to communicate internationally and across linguistic borders, reached across Canada, the United States and into Mexico.|$|E

Animals that lived in the sediment made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers. Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of individuals and 8.3% of species.|$|E
