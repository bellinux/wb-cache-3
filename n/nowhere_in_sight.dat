5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E

40|$|The Helsinki {{agreement}} of 2005 marks the historic peace process for Indonesia’s west-ernmost province Aceh. After {{three decades of}} violence and repression, the long self-determination conflict {{is in the process}} of being resolved. Both the Free Aceh Move-ment and the Indonesian government have made substantial concessions for this to happen. However, for the second most burning and long lasting self-determination conflict, concerning Indonesia’s easternmost region Papua, formerly called Irian Jaya, such steps are <b>nowhere</b> near <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> But they need to be undertaken, and soon, lest the volatile situation escalates and Papua sinks deeper into the downward spiral of violence and ‘counter-violence’. This paper will describe the developments in and concerning Papua over the course of the past eight years and will seek to explain key problems that need to be addressed in order to reach a sustainable resolution of the conflict. Indonesia’s reformasi in Papua During the first months after the fall of Suharto in May 1998, the spirit of the reform era or reformasi that had gripped the country could not at all be felt in its easternmost province.

25|$|On {{that morning}} Allen sighted three vessels, {{the largest of}} which seemed the most suspicious. Echo gave chase and at 7p.m. the quarry raised French colours and fired a shot. Echo {{caught up with her}} at 9p.m., and after a few shots from Echo, and a few broadsides from the French vessel, she struck. She was the letter of marque barque Amazon(e), armed with ten 6-pounder guns and {{carrying}} a crew of 60. She was sailing from Jacquemel to Bordeaux with a cargo of coffee. When Echo took her prisoners out of Amazon they proved to be quite unwell. Allen and his officers decided to put the prisoners on a Spanish sloop that Echo had taken a few days earlier and they then directed the sloop to the nearest Spanish port. Echos sails needed a complete overhaul, and with the squadron <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight,</b> Allen escorted Amazon to Port Royal.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port where he might find a return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight,</b> Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the journey, the duo {{encounter}} numerous mishaps: first, SpongeBob tries {{a pioneer}} trick {{he claims to}} have seen in a movie where he listens to the ground and hears a truck coming. But when he tries to get the driver's attention by doing a bizarre dance {{in the middle of the}} road, the driver speeds up and nearly runs over SpongeBob. Then, the duo are caught up in a storm that eventually turns into a tornado, and Squidward tells SpongeBob to let the pizza go as it causes them to get sucked into the tornado. However, the pizza saves their lives after SpongeBob turns it into a parachute. Upon landing, Squidward panics when he realizes the road they were following is <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> SpongeBob then notices some moss on a rock and claims that they should go in the direction the moss is pointing (another one of SpongeBob's [...] "pioneer tricks"), but Squidward refuses and goes in the other direction, despite there actually being civilization where the moss was pointing.|$|E
