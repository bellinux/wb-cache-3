500|$|The {{second book}} {{to use the}} name Unearthed Arcana was written by Andy Collins, Jesse Decker, David Noonan, and Rich Redman, and {{published}} in February 2004 by Wizards of the Coast, for use with the Dungeons & Dragons third edition rules. Cover art was by Matt Cavotta, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Wayne England, Emily Fiegenschuh, David Hudnut, Jeremy Jarvis, Doug Kovacs, John and Laura Lakey, David Martin, Dennis Crabapple McClain, Mark Nelson, James Pavelec, Steve Prescott, David Roach, Richard Sardinha, Ron Spencer, Stephen Tappin, Joel Thomas, and Ben Thompson. The designers aimed the book at experienced players and DMs looking for something new, encouraging them to customize the game's rules. The designers {{did not want the}} third edition book to be like the original Unearthed Arcana mechanically, because according to Andy Collins: [...] "Every book on the market looks like the original Unearthed Arcana. New classes, new spells, new magic items - that's the default [...] "recipe" [...] for a d20 product these days. We saw no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with this book." [...] Where the original Unearthed Arcana had simply expanded the rules and options of the core game, this 224-page supplement was aimed at providing an extensive list of variant rules and options to change the standard game itself. The volume of options added was intentionally excessive; according to the designers, a Dungeon Master who reads the book must be prepared to [...] "Drink from the fire hose" [...] and to think before using options that may radically imbalance the game. [...] The book ends with a checklist of the included variants, preceded by a short chapter discussing ways of transitioning among multiple games using different rulesets (one of which explicitly emulates the [...] "Eternal Champion" [...] stories of Michael Moorcock).|$|E

Seeds should be sown immediately after removing from the fruit free of pulp. Besides taking care of productive and phytosanitary aspects, the stocks must be heterogeneous, due to incompatibility problems with future generations. The same purpose must be applied to cuttings stocks that even may need only artificial pollination. The choice of right containers, growing medium, preventive pest and disease management, irrigation system, adequate and cleaned facilities, are important factors that must be taken in consideration for successful quality plant production. 200...|$|R
