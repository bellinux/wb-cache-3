5|$|Relatively rare amongst fighter aircraft, the RB.199 is {{fitted with}} thrust reversers to {{decrease}} the distance required to safely land. To fully deploy the thrust reverser during landings, the yaw damper {{is connected to the}} steering of the <b>nosewheel</b> to provide greater stability.|$|E
5|$|Fuel {{was carried}} in 14 bag tanks, {{four in the}} centre {{fuselage}} above and {{to the rear of}} the <b>nosewheel</b> bay and five in each outer wing. The tanks were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on the tanks. B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; <b>nosewheel</b> centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
50|$|Conversion of a Yak-27R, with {{a single}} {{retractable}} ski under the centre fuselage and enlarged <b>nosewheels.</b>|$|R
25|$|The series {{all share}} similar {{construction}} featuring a bolted aluminium tube structure with the flying surfaces covered in pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. All models are open-cockpit, but some have optional streamlined pods available. All models use {{tricycle landing gear}} and steerable <b>nosewheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 11 July 1965, Avro 748-101 Series 1 of Skyways Coach-Air (registration: G-ARMV) {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its <b>nosewheels</b> dug into soft {{ground on the}} grass runway following a heavy landing. The aircraft flipped over, losing its port wing in the process. Aided by the flight attendant, all 48 passengers managed to escape unhurt.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the delay}} of the 707 programme, the {{contribution}} of the 707B and 707A towards the basic design of the 698 was not considered significant, though it did highlight a need to increase the length of the <b>nosewheel</b> to give a ground incidence of 3.5 degrees, the optimum take-off attitude. The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the <b>nosewheel.</b> The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|Amphibian {{version of}} PBM-5, with {{retractable}} <b>nosewheel</b> undercarriage; 36 built plus four conversions.|$|E
50|$|The An-180 was a {{conventionally}} designed low-wing cantilever monoplane with {{a conventional}} tail unit. The unusual feature was the mounting of a Ivenchko Progress D-27 propfan mounted {{at the end}} of each tailplane. Each propfan was to have a coaxial contra-rotating tractor propeller, and the An-180 was also designed with a retractable landing gear with twin <b>nosewheels,</b> and tandem pairs of mainwheels.|$|R
50|$|On September 21, 2005, JetBlue Airways Flight 292 {{successfully}} {{landed with}} its nose gear turned 90 degrees sideways, {{resulting in a}} shower of sparks and flame after touchdown. This type of incident is very uncommon as the nose oleo struts are designed with centering cams to hold the <b>nosewheels</b> straight until they are compressed by the weight of the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} uses retractable tricycle type {{landing gear}} by Messier-Dowty, with twin <b>nosewheels</b> {{and a single}} wheel on each main gear. A runway tailhook or a fairing for a brake parachute can be fitted under the tail, which can operate {{in conjunction with the}} landing gear's carbon brakes to shorten landing distances. A removable refueling probe can be attached in front of the cockpit, offset slightly to the right of centre.|$|R
25|$|As {{completed}} the Dyott Bomber was a four-bay tractor biplane with equal-span wings. It was powered by two Beardmore 120 hp water-cooled six-cylinder engines which were mounted, without cowlings, between the wings. The aircraft had a fixed <b>nosewheel</b> undercarriage, with the <b>nosewheel</b> balanced {{by a large}} tailskid. It carried a crew of three, with a pilot and two gunners, in nose and dorsal positions.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{called for}} the F.B.25 to mount a small {{searchlight}} in the nacelles nose, have a <b>nosewheel</b> to reduce the chance of the aircraft turning over during night landings, and use the same 200-horsepower (149-kilowatt) Hispano-Suiza 8 planned for the F.B.23. As design and construction progressed, Vickers made changes; the searchlight and <b>nosewheel</b> were deleted, and as the 200-horsepower engine was unavailable, Vickers substituted a 150-horsepower (112-kilowatt) Hispano-Suiza.|$|E
25|$|The Merville D.63 was a {{modification}} of the Druine D.62 Condor with a <b>nosewheel</b> undercarriage, modified fin and French engine. It flew in 1962.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable <b>nosewheels,</b> allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground-handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|R
2500|$|With {{its failure}} as a combat aircraft, a {{dedicated}} trainer variant was developed, the Nieuport 14 École with dual controls, <b>nosewheels</b> {{to guard against}} nose-over accidents, and an [...] Le Rhone 9C rotary engine {{in the place of}} the original V-8. It is possible that these airframes had been left over from the original production. When further refined, the trainer version was redesignated the Nieuport 82 E.2 and nicknamed Grosse Julie ("Big Julie").|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable <b>nosewheels,</b> allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross wind landing. The reverse pitch control that the aircraft is {{fitted with a}}llows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent ground handling characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|R
25|$|On 30 April 2016, MU-2D (MU-2B-10) landed safely {{without a}} <b>nosewheel</b> in Airport Eelde, Netherlands. It came from Airport Emden, Germany. All three {{people on board}} survived.|$|E
25|$|Ship No.1A: (c/n 1A) Ship No.1, rebuilt {{after the}} crash with a {{strutted}} tricycle undercarriage with <b>nosewheel,</b> and semi-enclosed cockpit, rejoined the test programme by March 1944.|$|E
25|$|Model 1600 : A {{strengthened}} {{version of}} the F-16 Block 10 with carrier arrestor hook and revised <b>nosewheel.</b> It was powered by the Pratt & Whitney F401 (JTF22A-26C) afterburning turbofan.|$|E
5000|$|The XC-120 Packplane {{began as}} a C-119B {{fuselage}} (48-330, c/n 10312) which was cut off at a point just below the flight deck. The wings were angled upwards between the engines and the fuselage, raising the fuselage by several feet and giving the plane an inverted gull wing appearance. Smaller diameter [...] "twinned" [...] wheels were installed forward {{of each of the}} main landing gear struts to serve as <b>nosewheels,</b> while the main struts were extended backwards.|$|R
5000|$|The Beechcraft Model 18 (or [...] "Twin Beech", {{as it is}} also known) is a 6- to 11-seat, twin-engined, low-wing, {{tailwheel}} {{light aircraft}} manufactured by the Beech Aircraft Corporation of Wichita, Kansas. Continuously produced from 1937 to November 1969 (over 32 years, a world record at the time), over 9,000 were produced, {{making it one of}} the world's most widely used light aircraft. Sold worldwide as a civilian executive, utility, cargo aircraft, and passenger airliner on tailwheels, <b>nosewheels,</b> skis or floats, it was also used as a military aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The ASL {{monoplane}} No.2 {{appeared in}} the spring of 1910. Also of canard design, it had a 42 ft wing-span and was powered by a rear-mounted [...] Green D.4 engine mounted above the trailing edge of the wing and driving an 8 ft diameter two-bladed pusher propeller. The pilot sat immediately in front of the wing's leading edge: in front of him a square-section fuselage of uncovered wire-braced wooden construction carried the 12 ft span foreplane, a small rudder and a pair of <b>nosewheels.</b> Woodrow flew it on many test flights, eventually crashing it when the foreplane was experimentally set at too steep an angle.|$|R
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration. Earlier models {{did not have}} a steerable <b>nosewheel,</b> but the SS and RX 550 Plus include this feature. Most models have independent mechanical or hydraulic brakes.|$|E
25|$|If a {{tailwheel}} fails on landing, {{the damage}} to the aircraft will be minimal. This is not the case {{in the event of a}} <b>nosewheel</b> failure, which usually results in a prop strike.|$|E
25|$|Hawk 67 – Export {{version for}} the Republic of Korea Air Force. Fitted with {{extended}} nose of Hawk 100 to accommodate avionics and a steerable <b>nosewheel.</b> Twenty ordered in July 1991, with delivery by November 1993.|$|E
25|$|With four {{direct-drive}} {{engines in}} a tandem push-pull arrangement, and a fully enclosed cockpit, the R.VI design required {{none of the}} complex gearboxes of other R-types. Each R.VI bomber cost 557,000 marks and required {{the support of a}} 50-man ground crew. The R.VI required a complex 18-wheel undercarriage consisting of twin <b>nosewheels</b> and a quartet of four-wheeled groupings for its main gear to support its weight, and carried two mechanics in flight, seated between the engines in open niches cut {{in the center of each}} nacelle. The bombs were carried in an internal bomb bay located under the central fuel tanks, with three racks each capable of holding seven bombs. The R.VI was capable of carrying the 1000kg PuW bomb.|$|R
50|$|The Ju 287 was {{intended}} to provide the Luftwaffe with a bomber that could avoid interception by outrunning enemy fighters. The swept-forward wing was suggested by the project's head designer, Dr. Hans Wocke {{as a way of}} providing extra lift at low airspeeds - necessary because of the poor responsiveness of early turbojets at the vulnerable times of takeoff and landing. A further structural advantage of the forward-swept wing was that it would allow for a single massive weapons bay forward of the main wing spar. Prior to the assembly of the first Ju 287, an He 177 A-5 (designated as a 177 prototype, V38) was modified at the Letov plant in Prague to examine the technical characteristics of this single large bomb bay design.The first prototype {{was intended}} to evaluate the concept, and was assembled from the fuselage of an He 177 A-5, the tail of a Ju 388, main undercarriage from a Ju 352, and <b>nosewheels</b> taken from crashed B-24 Liberators, all of which were fixed to lower weight and complexity, and equipped with spats to reduce drag. Two of the Jumo 004 engines were hung in nacelles (pods) under the wings, with the other two mounted in nacelles added to the sides of the forward fuselage.|$|R
50|$|In November 1916, the Gothaer Waggonfabrik {{received}} a production order for 35 aircraft; this was subsequently increased to 50 in February 1917. A further 80 aircraft were ordered from the Siemens-Schuckert Werke (SSW) and 100 from Luft-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (LVG). Compared to the Gothaer aircraft, these license-built aircraft were slightly heavier and slower because Idflieg specified {{the use of}} a strengthened airframe. In order to counteract this, SSW built a number of highly modified examples, including one driven by tractor instead of pusher engines, one with an extra bay added to its wing cellule, two with a new airfoil section for the wings, and one with a supercharger. None of these modifications had been fully evaluated {{by the end of the}} war. Late-production SSW G.IVs also usually incorporated the Stossfahrgestell auxiliary <b>nosewheels</b> and Flettner servo tabs developed for the G.V. Responding to a different performance issue, LVG overcame the tail heaviness of its machines by increasing the sweepback of the wings. Late production by SSW and LVG became obsolete, hence many aircraft were finished as trainers with lower performance engines (Argus As.III or NAG C.III). The SSW-built trainers relocated the fuel tanks from the engine nacelles to within the fuselage, as on the G.V.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is type {{certified to}} European Aviation Safety Agency CS22 standards. It features a cantilever mid-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed cockpit under a large bubble canopy and fixed monowheel gear {{with a small}} <b>nosewheel</b> and a tail caster.|$|E
25|$|A-4: Seventeen BT-2BRs and BT-2BGs {{converted}} in 1940 as radio-controlled aerial target drones. These had tricycle gear (a steerable <b>nosewheel</b> was added) with main gear moved aft, faired-over rear cockpit, and single controls, allowing the aircraft to be test-flown.|$|E
25|$|The Wassmer WA-40 Super 4 Sancy is a French single-engined light {{aircraft}} of the 1960s and 70s. A single-engined low-winged monoplane with retractable <b>nosewheel</b> undercarriage, variants include {{the more powerful}} WA 4/21 Prestige and the WA-41 Baladou with a fixed undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|Definitive prototypes of the Ka-25 {{incorporated}} {{mission equipment}} and corrosion {{protection for the}} structure. The rotor system introduced aluminium alloy blades pressurised with nitrogen for crack detection, lubricated hinges, hydraulic powered controls, alcohol de-icing and automatic blade folding. Power was supplied by two free-turbine engines sat atop the cabin, with electrically de-iced inlets, plain lateral exhausts with no Infra-Red countermeasures, driving the main gearbox directly and a cooling fan for the gearbox and hydraulic oil coolers aft of the main gearbox. Construction was of stressed skin duralumin throughout with flush-riveting, {{as well as some}} bonding and honeycomb sandwich panels. The 1.5m × 1,25m × 3.94m cabin had a sliding door to port flight deck forward of the cabin and fuel tanks underfloor filled using a pressure refueling nozzle on the port side. A short boom {{at the rear of the}} cabin had a central fin and twin toed in fins at the ends of the tailplane mainly for use during auto-rotation. The undercarriage consisted of two noncastoring mainwheels with sprag brakes attached to the fuselage by parallel 'V' struts with a single angled shock absorber to dissipate landing loads, and two castoring <b>nosewheels</b> on straight shock absorbing legs attached directly to the fuselage either side of the cockpit which folded rearwards to reduce interference with the RADAR, all wheels were fitted with emergency rapid inflation flotation collars. Flying controls all act on the co-axial rotors with pitch, roll and collective similar to a conventional single rotor helicopter. Yaw was through differential collective which has a secondary effect of torque, an automatic mixer box ensured that total lift on the rotors remained constant during yaw maneuvers, to improve handling during deck landings. Optional extras included fold up seats for 12 passengers, rescue hoist, external auxiliary fuel tanks or containers for cameras, flares, smoke floats or beacons.|$|R
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all three}} wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The <b>nosewheel</b> is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the rudder pedal toes.|$|E
25|$|Current {{pre-production}} aircraft are powered by 580kW (778hp) Walter M601F turboprop engines, later production models will have 596kW (800hp) General Electric H80 turboprops a {{development of the}} M601. The Rysachok has a tricycle undercarriage with inward retracting single mainwheels and a forward retracting twin <b>nosewheel.</b>|$|E
