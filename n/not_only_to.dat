5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is shrouded in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} {{in the years following}} the failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula {{was called}} wallum by the Kabi {{people of the}} Sunshine Coast, giving rise <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> its common name of wallum banksia {{but also to the}} name of the {{ecological}} community it grows in. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with what he found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, al-Masjid al-Aqsa {{referred}} <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> the mosque, but to {{the entire}} sacred sanctuary, while al-Jami' al-Aqsa referred to the specific site of the mosque.

5|$|For {{the next}} hundred years the Grimaldi defended their {{territory}} from attacks by other states which included Genoa, Pisa, Venice, Naples, France, Spain, Germany, England and Provence.

Now more secure, the Grimaldi lords of Monaco now began to recognise the need <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> defend their territory, but also to have a home reflecting their power and prestige.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation. He delivered {{the opinion of the}} court in Everson v.

5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's vertical position cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E
5|$|Leoš Janáček's {{literary}} legacy {{represents an}} important illustration of his life, public work and art between 1875 and 1928.

His writing changed over time, and appeared in many genres. Nevertheless, the critical and theoretical sphere remained his main area of interest.|$|E

5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning the Justices of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, the justices {{had been given the}} power <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E
5|$|Poetic diction {{treats the}} manner in which {{language}} is used, and refers <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> the sound but also to the underlying meaning and its interaction with sound and form. Many languages and poetic forms have very specific poetic dictions, to the point where distinct grammars and dialects are used specifically for poetry. Registers in poetry can range from strict employment of ordinary speech patterns, as favoured in much late-20th-century prosody, through to highly ornate uses of language, as in medieval and Renaissance poetry.|$|E
