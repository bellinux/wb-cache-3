5|$|On August 26, Czesław Kiszczak, the Minister of Internal Affairs, {{declared}} {{on television}} {{that the government}} was willing to <b>negotiate,</b> <b>and</b> five days later he met with Wałęsa. The strikes ended the following day, and on November 30, during a televised debate between Wałęsa and Alfred Miodowicz (leader of the pro-government trade union, the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions), Wałęsa scored a public-relations victory.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Prerogative {{includes}} the powers to appoint and dismiss ministers, regulate the civil service, issue passports, declare war, make peace, direct {{the actions of}} the military, and <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> ratify treaties, alliances, and international agreements. However, a treaty cannot alter the domestic laws of the United Kingdom; an Act of Parliament is necessary in such cases. The monarch is commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces (the Royal Navy, the British Army, and the Royal Air Force), accredits British High Commissioners and ambassadors, and receives diplomats from foreign states.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E

5|$|Following her husband's {{death in}} 1461, Catherine's role receded {{to that of}} queen dowager at the court of her stepson, King Stephen Tomašević. Two years later, forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia {{and put an end}} to the {{independent}} kingdom. Catherine's stepson was executed, while Sigismund and Catherine, her son and daughter by Thomas, were captured and taken to Constantinople, where they converted to Islam. Queen Catherine escaped, taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome, where she received a pension from the papacy. From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children. Her efforts to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> offer a ransom proved futile. She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome, having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne, should they ever return to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|Governor Harrison had wide-ranging {{powers in}} the new territory, {{including}} authority to appoint territorial officials and the legislature, as well as authority to divide the territory into smaller political districts and counties. One of his primary responsibilities was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. Harrison was eager to expand the territory for personal reasons as well; his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood. On February 8, 1803, when President Jefferson reappointed Harrison as the Indiana territorial governor, he also granted Harrison the authority to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> conclude treaties with the Indians.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, an {{expedition}} of five warships commanded by Rear Admiral John Rodgers {{was sent to}} Korea to obtain an apology for the murders of several shipwrecked American sailors and secure a treaty to protect shipwrecked foreigners in the future. After a small skirmish, Rodgers launched an amphibious assault of approximately 650 men on the forts protecting Seoul. Despite the capture of the forts, the Koreans refused to <b>negotiate,</b> <b>and</b> the expedition {{was forced to leave}} before the start of typhoon season. Nine sailors and six marines received Medals of Honor for their acts of heroism during the Korean campaign; the first for actions in a foreign conflict.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} {{sovereignty}} movement became on what terms sovereignty would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside sovereignty, as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|When Muhammad Ali was in Palestine, he {{requested}} military assistance from Emir Bashir Shihab II of Mount Lebanon, via an emissary, Emir Shihab's son Amin. In late July, Emir Bashir led his forces toward Galilee, but before advancing further southward, {{he made a}} number of proclamations advising that the rebels of Safad surrender. The rebel leadership in Safad agreed to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> sent Sheikh Salih al-Tarshihi as an emissary to Bashir to arrange a meeting. Bashir invited the leaders of Safad to the village of Bint Jbeil where they agreed to surrender and submit to Egyptian authority. Afterward, Bashir arrived in Safad where he arranged for rebel leaders from nearby areas to surrender as well.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, {{especially in light of}} the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially undermined by the destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E

5|$|On 28 August 1827, {{the canal}} company {{announced}} that they were taking over the River Tone Navigation, {{under the terms of}} their acts of parliament of 1811 and 1824. This they did in November, when William Goodland, the river superintendent, was evicted from his cottage, the tolls were raised again, and maintenance ceased. This action was ruled to be illegal by the Court of King's Bench, as the canal company had not complied with the time limits enshrined in the act, but the canal company held on to the river despite the order to give it back to the conservators. Both sides took their case to the High Court, which ruled that the Conservators should have the river in February 1830. A further series of legal actions followed, after which the canal company attempted to obtain a new act of parliament to obtain the Tone by compulsory purchase. The Conservators then decided to <b>negotiate,</b> <b>and</b> an act of parliament passed in July 1832 authorised the takeover.|$|E
5|$|The French monarchy {{asserted}} its {{rights to}} encroach on Edward's legal rights in Gascony. Resistance to one judgement in Saint-Sardos resulted in Charles IV declaring the duchy forfeit. Charles's sister, Queen Isabella, {{was sent to}} <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles. Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son Edward, who travelled to France to give homage in his stead. With the English heir in her power, Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites, and she became the mistress of Roger Mortimer. The couple invaded England and, with Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, captured the king. Edward II abdicated on condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer. Although there is no historical record of the cause of death, he is popularly {{believed to have been}} murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a red-hot poker thrust into his bowels. A coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer. Mortimer was executed. Though removed from power, Isabella was treated well, and lived in luxury for the next 27 years.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{served the}} king as an envoy to Pope Urban II in 1095, when {{the king was}} seeking to have the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, Gerard, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, {{at least according to}} Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two clerks travelled very quickly, as they did not leave before 28February 1095 and were back in England by 13May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably willing to <b>negotiate</b> <b>and</b> to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. It may well be that the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.|$|E

5|$|On 1 May 1669 Morgan and his {{flotilla}} {{attacked the}} Spanish squadron. The fire ship plan worked, and Magdalen was shortly aflame; Espinosa abandoned his flagship {{and made his}} way to the fort, where he continued to direct events. The second-largest Spanish ship, Soledad, tried to move away from the burning vessel, but a problem with the rigging meant they drifted aimlessly; privateers boarded the ship, fixed the rigging and claimed the craft as plunder. The third Spanish vessel was also sunk by the privateers. Morgan still needed to pass the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress, but was still out-gunned by the stronghold, which had the ability to destroy the privateer fleet if it tried to pass. The privateer decided to <b>negotiate,</b> <b>and</b> threatened to sack and burn Maracaibo if he was not allowed to pass. Although Espinosa refused to negotiate, the citizens of Maracaibo entered into talks with Morgan, and agreed to pay him 20,000 pesos and 500 head of cattle if he agreed to leave the city intact. During the course of the negotiations with the Maracaibos, Morgan had undertaken salvage operations on Magdalen, and secured 15,000 pesos from the wreck. Before taking any action, Morgan tallied his takings and divided it equally between his ships, to ensure that it was not all lost if one ship was sunk; it totalled 250,000 pesos, and a huge quantity of merchandise and a number of local slaves.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{conversation}} {{occurs when}} beliefs are <b>negotiated</b> through interaction <b>and</b> evolve in {{a framework of}} goals. Concurrently, goals are <b>negotiated</b> <b>and</b> evolve through interaction. Such conversations are processes of design. Similarly, design—where proposed constructions are <b>negotiated</b> <b>and</b> evolve toward goals, while goals for the design are <b>negotiated</b> <b>and</b> evolve—is a process of conversation. Outcomes from such activities are greatly facilitated, in my view, from an understanding of Pask’s two main frameworks from conversation theory: a structure for the architecture of conversations and a schema for modeling the evolution of conversations. My conviction is that these {{can be used to}} mirror how design happens. This begs the question, can it help designers design? Yes, I believe it can. This paper offers a review of Pask’s frameworks and discusses their application in theory and practice...|$|R
