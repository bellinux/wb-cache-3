2500|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed <b>neutral,</b> <b>line</b> and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the service entrance (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|E
50|$|K-factor is a {{ratio of}} {{location}} of the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> to the material thickness as defined by t/T where t = location of the <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> and T = material thickness. The K-Factor formulation does not take the forming stresses into account but is simply a geometric calculation of {{the location of the}} <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> after the forces are applied and is thus the roll-up of all the unknown (error) factors for a given setup. The K-factor depends on many factors including the material, the type of bending operation (coining, bottoming, air-bending, etc.) the tools, etc. and is typically between 0.3 and 0.5.|$|E

In short-day photoperiodic cycle disposition of dynamics of sugar and starch content over a day-light period, their runoff over a moon-light period and also activity of enzymes of photoperiodically <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> change similar to it of short-day lines. At short day <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> more intensively accumulate monosugar and sucrose. At long day, amylose is accumulated in content of starch comparing to short-day lines. Runoff tenseness over night period of short-day photoperiodic cycle in both groups is higher than over the same period of long-day cycle. Capability of photoperiodically <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> to change disposition of carbohydrate exchange over a short-day period similar to its disposition of short-day lines is one of the considerable factors in favor of the fact that under the given conditions process of growth and development, this is provided with sufficient amount of substance and energy. As a result morphogenetic processes run at the same speed over both short-day and long-day periods. It allows photoperiodically <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> to transit to blooming at the same term over different duration period of the day...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} density {{structure of}} the white-light solar corona is compared to {{the organization of the}} solar magnetic field as identified by the appearance of <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> in the photosphere to examine whether any consistent relationship exists between the two. During the period covering Carrington rotations 1717 to 1736 brightness enhancements in the low corona tend to lie over the global neutral sheet identified in the photospheric magnetic field. The brightest of these enhancements are associated with <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> throguh active regions. These associations are not 1 - 1, but do hold both in stable and evolving conditions of the corona.

An examination of the associated solar activity of the seven white light coronal transients observed by Skyklab indicates that regardless of where the prominences were formed, their eruptions can cause observable coronal mass ejections. The present results suggest that a prominence model is needed in which the evolution begins at the boundary of two adjacent bipolar regions...|$|R

Prominences associated with young (up to three solar rotations) and old (greater than eight) magnetic <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> are significantly less stable than those associated with middle-aged <b>neutral</b> <b>lines.</b> Downward bending of the top of the inner magnetic loop, necessary in some models of prominences, is not detected in these X-ray observations.

50|$|The second problem, the {{inadequacy}} of fuses to act as the sole safety device in most power systems, is probably best resolved {{by the use of}} residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> A residual current device works by monitoring the active and neutral lines and tripping the active line if it notices a difference. Residual current devices require a separate <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> for each phase {{and to be able to}} trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues do limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove lethal.|$|E
50|$|In North America and {{countries}} that use their system, the 120/240 V split phase system is used. A pole-mounted distribution transformer usually provides power {{for one or}} two residences. The service drop is made up of two 120 V lines and a <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> When these lines are insulated and twisted together, they are referred to as a triplex cable which may contain a supporting messenger cable {{in the middle of the}} neutral conductor to provide strength for long spans. The <b>neutral</b> <b>line</b> from the pole is connected to a ground near the service panel; often a conductive rod driven into the earth. The service drop provides the building with two 120 V lines of opposite phase, so 240 V can be obtained by connecting a load between the two 120 V conductors, while 120 V loads are connected between either of the two 120 V lines and the <b>neutral</b> <b>line.</b> 240 V circuits are used for high-power devices, such as air conditioners, clothes dryers, ovens and boilers, while 120 V circuits are used for lighter loads such as lighting and ordinary small appliance outlets.|$|E
30|$|In Section 4 we {{discussed}} the magnetic field line topology and cutoff latitudes of particle impacting on the Earth for different kind of multipole configuration, which can occur during reversals, turned dipoles as well as quadrupoles. Another interesting case is the quadrupole moment with <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> (Vogt et al., 2004). This configuration posses several poles, but the most interesting behavior is the existence of low field regimes in the polar regions and of <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> where the magnetic field is zero. Of course, several combinations of dipoles and quadrupoles are possible. In some dipole-quadrupole configurations the situation appears that field lines of the dipole and the quadrupole are antiparallel, so that the resulting field vanishes. These locations are called neutral points.|$|R

Combining data from the X-ray CCD camera (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), the AGN intrinsic nuclear emission and its reprocessed signals were observed simultaneously. The intrinsic emission is highly obscured with an absorbing column of ∼ 5 × 10 ^ 24 cm^- 2, and was detectable only above ∼ 10 keV.

The expression does not require the use of a computer. The formula has been applied to a limited number of <b>neutral</b> <b>lines</b> of interest, and the width obtained is compared with the much more complete calculations of Bennett and Griem (1971). The agreement generally is well within 50 % of the published value for the lines investigated. Comparisons with other formulas are also made.

His diplomacy was both strong and yet not rigid, and he maintained the economic position of the Danish merchants and in spite of problems with both France and England. All the while, made his course respected. Among other things, he firmly avoided a politics of convoy while he clearly refused to take any part in the intervention in France.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{short-term}} evolution of magnetic fields associated with five flares in δ sunspots. We {{concentrate on the}} analysis of magnetic gradient along the flaring <b>neutral</b> <b>lines.</b> Obvious changes of magnetic gradient occurred immediately and rapidly following the onset of each flare. Rapid gradient increase {{was found to be}} associated with three events, while decrease was found with the other two. The changes were permanent, therefore, not likely due to the effect of flare emissions. In addition, we evaluated the mean relative motions between two magnetic polarities in these δ regions, in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the flaring <b>neutral</b> <b>lines,</b> respectively. We derived the mean positions of two magnetic polarities using the method of Center-of-Mass (CoM) calculation, and found that: (1) Converging motions correspond to the gradient increase; diverging motion, the decrease; (2) For all the events, there appeared a sudden release of magnetic shear associated with each flare, signified by a decrease of CoM separation between 500 and 1, 200 km in the direction parallel to the <b>neutral</b> <b>lines.</b> Combining the findings presented here with those in previous papers, we propose that these are evidences of magnetic reconnection at or close to the photosphere. When an active region is away from the solar disk center, the reconnected transverse fields would cause an apparent increase of the flux in the polarity toward the limb, a decrease for the polarity closer to the disk center. This observational pattern was indeed found for all 10 available events that have been studied in the literatures or in this paper. Finally, we offer some predictions for future observations when high-quality vector magnetogram sequences become available...|$|R

These results are consistent with the locations of hot (greater than 1, 000, 000 K) plasmas in active regions expected from generalization based on optical photographs. Given the sizes of the radio sources, the volume emission measures of soft X-rays observed from OSO- 8 rule out the possibility of thermal bremsstrahlung being of any significance, as far as the 6 cm emission is concerned.
