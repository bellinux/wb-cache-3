The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Aldea went to Adrianople to do {{homage to}} the Ottoman Sultan, Murad II, in 1432. Vlad wanted to invade Wallachia {{with the support of}} Wallachian boyars (or noblemen) who had fled to Transylvania, but Alexander Aldea's {{principal}} official, Albu, prevented the invasion. Sigismund authorized Vlad to buy weapons and muster an army of exiled boyars only in 1434. In 1435, Alexander Aldea fell seriously ill and <b>never</b> <b>recovered.</b> Taking advantage of his brother's illness, Vlad broke into Wallachia, but Alexander Aldea and his Ottoman allies forced him to retreat.|$|E

Their deaths occurred only weeks after that of Seward's wife Frances, who <b>never</b> <b>recovered</b> from the shock of the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Australian National Airways (ANA) <b>never</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from the}} crash of the Amana. Since the {{beginning}} of 1945, 77 people had been killed in accidents in aircraft operated by ANA. In late 1948, ANA suffered 4 crashes in 4 months. The loss of ANA's reputation as a safe airline, together with the unblemished safety record and growing commercial success of its rival Trans Australia Airlines, sent ANA into decline. In 1957 ANA was taken over by Ansett Transport Industries Limited and merged with Ansett Airways to form the domestic airline Ansett-ANA.|$|E

5|$|He signed seven {{players in}} {{preparation}} for the 2013–14 season, and further strengthened by signing striker François Zoko in September. However Stevenage <b>never</b> <b>recovered</b> from a poor start to the season, and despite a late run of six undefeated games ended the campaign in last-place and were therefore relegated into League Two, finishing eight points shy of safety. Westley responded by releasing nine players, whilst a further four were sold on.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims {{that his son}} Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed {{permanently}} out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Within a decade of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia <b>never</b> <b>recovered</b> its former position of power.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Smith for {{the first}} time {{dominated}} the league in strikeouts as a relief pitcher.

There were also large groups of bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside {{in the last years of}} the Tang, who smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E

These little girls, any one of whom could be my daughter, came into the restaurant weeping, and they were weeping when they were led away. I knew that, condemned to everlasting darkness, hunger and loss, they would weep on incessantly. They would <b>never</b> <b>recover</b> from their pain, and I would <b>never</b> <b>recover</b> from the memory of it.|$|R
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and <b>never</b> <b>recovered,</b> dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished the death penalty in all circumstances.|$|E
