In this Florence’s HomeStyle Cha-Cha study, aspartame, acesulfame K, sodium saccharin, and neotame were evaluated {{as a substitute for}} sucrose in the formulation. These sweeteners were used at their recommended equivalency levels to match the sweetness potency level to that of sucrose. Because they are more potent than sucrose, minimum amounts were needed to replace sucrose, and the remaining amounts were filled with maltodextrin. Using maltodextrin as bulk filler is common practice in the industry when replacing sucrose with a <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sweetener.</b> This study evaluated the quality of the finished product in determining which <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sweetener</b> had similar taste, aroma, and density qualities as the control, which was Cha-Cha sweetened with sucrose. The results of the evaluations indicated that Cha-Cha sweetened with acesulfame K was more similar to the control than the other non-nutritive sweeteners. Of the three taste characteristics evaluated for their degree of intensity, sweetness, saltiness, and bitterness, the acesulfame K sweetened treatment was closer to the control. In the GC/MS analysis in characterizing the volatile aroma compounds, acesulfame K contained all the aroma compounds with smaller differences in concentration than the other experimental treatments.

The aim of this thesis was to 1) investigate the effects of micronutrients and sugar, alone and in combination, in a beverage, on growth and cognition in South African children and 2) review recent evidence on iron status and anaemia prevalence in South African children since the National Food Consumption Survey-Fortification Baseline- 2005 (NFCS-FB- 2005). Children (n = 408, 6 − 11 years) were randomly allocated to a beverage containing 1) micronutrients with sugar, 2) micronutrients with <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sweetener,</b> 3) no micronutrients with sugar, or 4) no micronutrients with <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sweetener</b> for 8. 5 months.

Relevant internet search engines identified studies reporting iron status of South African children after 2005. Secondary analysis was conducted on NFCS-FB- 2005 provincial data for children 7 − 9 years old. Positive intervention effects were observed for micronutrients (0. 76; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 1. 42) and sugar (0. 71; 95 % CI: 0. 05, 1. 37) on Atlantis (measure learning ability), and sugar on Rover (measure simultaneous processing) (0. 72; 96 % CI: 0. 08, 1. 35) test scores. Attenuating micronutrient x sugar interactions were observed on Atlantis, Number Recall (measure sequential processing) and Rover test performance. Micronutrients or sugar alone lowered WAZ.

Some mechanisms underlying NNS adverse metabolic effects have been proposed, such as an increase in intestinal glucose absorption, alterations in intestinal microbiota, induction of oxidative stress and a dysregulation of appetite and reward responses.

40|$|Post-ingestive signals {{related to}} {{nutrient}} metabolism {{are thought to}} be the primary drivers of reinforcement potency of energy sources. Here, in a series of neuroimaging and indirect calorimetry human studies, we examine the relative roles of caloric load and perceived sweetness in driving metabolic, perceptual and brain responses to sugared beverages. Whereas caloric load was manipulated using the tasteless carbohydrate maltodextrin, sweetness levels were manipulated using the <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sweetener</b> sucralose. By formulating beverages that contain different amounts of maltodextrin+sucralose, we demonstrate a non-linear association between caloric load, metabolic response and reinforcement potency, which is driven in part by the extent to which sweetness is proportional to caloric load. In particular, we show that (1) lower calorie beverages can produce greater metabolic response and condition greater brain response and liking than higher calorie beverages and (2) when sweetness is proportional to caloric load greater metabolic responses are observed. These results demonstrate a non-linear association between caloric load and reward and describe an unanticipated role for sweet taste in regulating carbohydrate metabolism, revealing a novel mechanism by which sugar-sweetened beverages influence physiological responses to carbohydrate ingestion...|$|E
