5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
25|$|Tomić was {{the editor}} of Srpsko kolo and Zastava {{magazines}} {{and founder of the}} People's Freethinker Party (Narodna slobodoumna stranka), which in 1891 became the Radical Party (Radikalna stranka). In 1889, following a drawn-out series of provocations regarding the honour of his wife, Tomić stabbed to death a liberal political rival, Miša Dimitrijević, {{the editor of}} Branik magazine, in Novi Sad. He served seven years in prison for murder, emerging in 1896 with no loss of political zeal. Not only political but economic issues had far reaching importance to him. Tomić, then the most vociferous opponent of the hierarchy, the leader of the Serbian radical party and son-in-law of Svetozar Miletić, blamed the clergy for driving people away from churches because of its insistence on controlling church and autonomous finances: Whoever has to worry about how to spend so much money has <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> to care for the church and people.|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} few months, Pedro {{attempted}} to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the Cortes would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. [...] "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he [...] "required <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> for decision than {{the reading of the}} letters demanded." [...] Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wished to enslave and persecute us. As of today our bonds are ended. By my blood, by my honor, by my God, I swear to bring about the independence of Brazil. Brazilians, let our watchword from this day forth be 'Independence or Death! ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{battle was}} a {{stalemate}} {{at the cost}} of about 1,500 casualties on both sides, plus 2,500 previously wounded Union soldiers who were left to be captured when their field hospital was evacuated. Stonewall Jackson eventually crossed the river by about 2:30a.m. on June 30, {{but it was too late}} to crush the Union Army, as Lee had hoped. Most of the Army of the Potomac crossed White Oak Swamp Creek unmolested by noon on June 30. General Lee reprimanded Magruder in a dispatch: [...] "I regret much that you have made so little progress today in the pursuit of the enemy. In order to reap the fruits of our victory that pursuit should be most vigorous. ... We must lose <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> or he will escape us entirely." [...] However, the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee's own headquarters and a less than aggressive performance by Jackson. The Seven Days continued with the much larger Battle of Glendale and the Battle of White Oak Swamp on June 30.|$|E
