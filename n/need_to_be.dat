5|$|The Department for Transport (DfT) is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} extending the M54 westward to Shrewsbury, thereby placing the county town on the UK motorway map for the first time. Currently traffic has to continue onto the dual carriageway A5 when the M54 ends at Wellington although the road surface or speed limits do not change at all but the road. It is not motorway standard from the M54 J7 to the Shrewsbury ring road, because laybys would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> removed and a hard shoulder would also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built which could cause delays to traffic.|$|E

5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and gallium in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive gallium, which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used.
