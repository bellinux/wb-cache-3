40|$|BACKGROUND. <b>Rates</b> of <b>night</b> visiting {{by general}} {{practitioners}} have increased steadily {{over the last}} 30 years and vary widely between general practices. AIM. An ecological study was carried out to examine <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> by general practices in one family health services authority, and {{to determine the extent}} to which differences in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> between practices could be explained by patient and practice characteristics. METHOD. The study examined the variation in annual <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates,</b> based on <b>night</b> visit fees claimed between April 1993 and March 1994, among 129 general practices in Merton, Sutton and Wandsworth Family Health Services Authority, London. RESULTS. Practices' annual <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> varied from three per 1000 to 75 per 1000 patients. The percentages of the practice population aged under five years and aged five to 14 years were both positively correlated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 38 and r = 0. 35, respectively), as were variables associated with social deprivation such as the estimated percentage of the practice population living in one-parent households (r = 0. 24) and in households where the head of household was classified as unskilled (r = 0. 20). The percentage of the practice population reporting chronic illness was also positively associated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = 0. 26). The percentages of the practice population aged 35 to 44 years and 45 to 54 years were both negatively associated with <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> (r = - 0. 34 and r = - 0. 31, respectively) as was the estimated list inflation for a practice (r = - 0. 31). There was no significant correlation between <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> and the distance of the main practice surgery from the nearest hospital accident and emergency department. There was also no association between <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> and permission to use a deputizing service. In a stepwise multiple regression model, the multiple correlation coefficient was 0. 56 with four factors (percentage of the practice population aged under five years, percentage aged 35 - 44 years, percentage who were chronically ill and estimated list inflation) explaining 32 % of the variation in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates.</b> CONCLUSION. Only about one third of the variation in <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> between practices could be explained by patient and practice variables derived from routine data. Population-based research using data collected on individual patients and practices is required to improve current understanding of the patient and practice characteristics that influence the demand for night visits and of why <b>night</b> visiting <b>rates</b> vary so widely between practices...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To compare <b>night</b> visit <b>rates</b> in {{different}} electoral wards of one general {{practice with the}} Jarman and Townsend deprivation scores and unemployment rates. DESIGN [...] Analysis of computerised workload data. SETTING [...] General practice in centre of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Visits made in 588 nights to the 11, 998 patients on the practice list. RESULTS [...] <b>Night</b> visit <b>rates</b> in 15 electoral wards varied from 19. 6 to 55. 3 visits per 1000 patients per year. The rates {{showed a significant association}} with the Townsend score (p = 0. 004) and the unemployment rate (p = 0. 03) but not with the Jarman score (p = 0. 3). The Townsend score explained 49 % of the variability; unemployment explained 31 % and the Jarman score explained 9 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] Even in a general practice not eligible for deprivation payments there was a 2. 8 -fold variation in <b>night</b> visit <b>rates</b> between wards. In this practice the Townsend score was significantly better at predicting <b>night</b> visit <b>rates</b> than the Jarman score. This method of looking at internal variation in workloads in computerised practices could give more direct data on the relation between deprivation and general practice workload than has previously been available...|$|R
