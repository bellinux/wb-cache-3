40|$|Polyaniline {{exists in}} various forms {{distinguished}} {{by the number of}} protons bonded to nitrogen, which determines the degree of oxidation of the polymer. At a macroscopic scale, doping involves electron transfer as well as protonation of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>hetero-atom,</b> which stabilises localised bound states to impart electronic conductivity to the system. However, it has been observed that the processability of this intractablepolymer is greatly infuenced by the anion associated with the protonating agent. Here we briefy summarise the infuence of the anion on the behaviour of polyaniline...|$|E
