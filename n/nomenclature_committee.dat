5|$|CASS4 (Crk {{associated}} substrate 4) is {{the fourth}} and last described member of the CAS protein family. CASS4 was detected by Singh et al. in 2008 following in silico screening of databases describing expressed sequence tags from an evolutionarily diverse group of organisms, using the CAS-related proteins (p130Cas, NEDD9/HEF1 and EFS) mRNAs as templates. Singh et al. subsequently cloned and characterized the CASS4 gene, originally assigning the name HEPL (HEF1-EFS-p130Cas-like) for similarity to the other three defined CAS genes. The official name was subsequently changed to CASS4 by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene <b>Nomenclature</b> <b>Committee</b> (HGNC).|$|E

It was originally described as Agaricus gloiocephalus by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1815 and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821.

The GeneCards database provides access to free Web resources about more than 7000 all known human genes that integrated from >90 data resources, such as HGNC, Ensembl, and NCBI. The core gene list is based on approved gene symbols published by the HUGO Gene <b>Nomenclature</b> <b>Committee</b> (HGNC). The information are carefully gathered and selected from these databases by the powerful and user-friendly engine.

Over time, the GeneCards database has developed a suite of tools (GeneDecks, GeneLoc, GeneALaCart) that has more specialised capability. Since 1998, the GeneCards database has been widely used by bioinformatics, genomics and medical communities for more than 15 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{thought that}} the {{mammalian}} body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign particles first arose during World War II. Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that {{the first of these}} identifying proteins was found. The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the WHO <b>Nomenclature</b> <b>Committee</b> for Factors of the HLA System. HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins). Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system. It started with a plane crash in the height of the London Blitz. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts. However, at the time skin grafts were a risky business, often being rejected for unknown reasons.

500|$|Several {{molecular}} studies {{published in}} the 2000s demonstrated that Psilocybe, as it was defined then, was polyphyletic. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades, one consisting of the bluing, hallucinogenic species in the family Hymenogastraceae, and the other the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the family Strophariaceae. However, the generally accepted lectotype (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type) of the genus {{as a whole was}} Psilocybe montana, which is a non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. If the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated, it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name. To resolve this dilemma, several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to conserve the name Psilocybe, with P.semilanceata as the type. As they explained, conserving the name Psilocybe in this way would prevent nomenclatural changes to a well-known group of fungi, many species of which are [...] "linked to archaeology, anthropology, religion, alternate life styles, forensic science, law enforcement, laws and regulation". Further, the name P.semilanceata had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938–68. The proposal to conserve the name Psilocybe, with P.semilanceata as the type was accepted unanimously by the <b>Nomenclature</b> <b>Committee</b> for Fungi in 2009.|$|E
