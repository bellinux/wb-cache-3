5|$|In Canada, CFMT-TV in Toronto {{broadcast}} <b>Neighbours</b> on weeknights at 11:00 pm, {{starting in}} September 1990. From 20 May 1991, CFMT moved {{the show to}} 4:00pm. After announcing its cancellation, CFMT decided to keep <b>Neighbours</b> on its schedule throughout September 1994, following numerous letters and telephone calls. From April 2017, <b>Neighbours</b> began airing on OutTV. Episodes are broadcast on weekdays at 2:30pm ET and 5:30pm ET, with an omnibus on Saturdays. Episodes air {{on the same day}} as the Australian broadcast, and they are also available for streaming.|$|E

5|$|Moving rightward {{across the}} {{standard}} {{form of the}} periodic table, nonmetals adopt structures that have progressively fewer nearest <b>neighbours.</b> Polyatomic nonmetals have structures with either three nearest <b>neighbours,</b> {{as is the case}} (for example) with carbon (in its standard state of graphite), or two nearest <b>neighbours</b> (for example) in the case of sulfur. Diatomic nonmetals, such as hydrogen, have one nearest neighbour, and the monatomic noble gases, such as helium, have none. This gradual fall in the number of nearest <b>neighbours</b> is associated with a reduction in metallic character and an increase in nonmetallic character. The distinction between the three categories of nonmetals, in terms of receding metallicity is not absolute. Boundary overlaps occur as outlying elements in each category show (or begin to show) less-distinct, hybrid-like or atypical properties.|$|E
30|$|Currently, we {{have three}} {{different}} access levels: Monitored, Enabled and Activated. A <b>neighbour</b> is always added in the monitored state by the <b>Neighbour</b> Controller. If a <b>neighbour</b> passes the <b>neighbour</b> filter checks, the <b>Neighbour</b> Controller changes its state to enabled. Note that a filter can also enable a <b>neighbour</b> by default (this will be the common case for most MAC protocols). A MAC protocol activates a <b>neighbour</b> when it has negotiated a communication strategy (e.g. assigned a slot {{for it in the}} previous example).|$|R

5|$|<b>Neighbours</b> has {{released}} several internet webisode series via their YouTube channel. The first series was titled Steph in Prison and coincided with Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) return to <b>Neighbours</b> in April 2013. The following year, Brennan on the Run focusing on Mark Brennan's (Scott McGregor) time in witness protection was released. <b>Neighbours</b> vs Zombies {{was launched in}} October 2014 and featured the returns of many former characters who had previously died in the show.|$|E
5|$|<b>Neighbours</b> is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} a show that focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, <b>Neighbours</b> underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening <b>Neighbours</b> on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. <b>Neighbours</b> has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, <b>Neighbours</b> moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.|$|E

30|$|Each ZigBee device {{maintains}} a <b>neighbour</b> table which has all its neighbours' {{information in the}} one-hop transmission range. The contents for a <b>neighbour</b> entry are the network's personal area network (PAN) identifier; node's extended address, network address, device type, relationship, LQI, etc. Optionally, additional information such as the depth can be included. Entries in the table are created when the node joins an existing network. Conversely, the <b>neighbour</b> entry is removed when the <b>neighbour</b> node leaves the network. Since {{the information on the}} <b>neighbour</b> table is updated every time a device receives any frame from the some <b>neighbour</b> node, the information of the <b>neighbour</b> table can be said to be up-to-date all the time.|$|R
3000|$|In the {{analysis}} that follows we apply the hierarchical cluster analysis (Hierarchical Clustering) {{in two different}} ways.

5|$|From left {{to right}} across the {{standard}} form of periodic table, as metallic character decreases, nonmetals therefore adopt structures that show a gradual reduction {{in the numbers of}} nearest neighbours—three or two for the polyatomic nonmetals, through one for the diatomic nonmetals, to zero for the monatomic noble gases. A similar pattern occurs more generally, {{at the level of the}} entire periodic table, in comparing metals and nonmetals. There is a transition from metallic bonding among the metals on the left of the table through to covalent or Van der Waals (electrostatic) bonding among the nonmetals on the right of the table. Metallic bonding tends to involve close-packed centrosymmetric structures with a high number of nearest <b>neighbours.</b> Post-transition metals and metalloids, sandwiched between the true metals and the nonmetals, tend to have more complex structures with an intermediate number of nearest <b>neighbours.</b> Nonmetallic bonding, towards the right of the table, features open-packed directional (or disordered) structures with fewer or zero nearest <b>neighbours.</b> As noted, this steady reduction in the number of nearest <b>neighbours,</b> as metallic character decreases and nonmetallic character increases, is mirrored among the nonmetals, the structures of which gradually change from polyatomic, to diatomic, to monatomic.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, new {{executive}} producer, Susan Bower, {{announced that}} she would be implementing further changes to the programme. Bower promised to retain the return to traditional <b>Neighbours</b> values, but with an injection of drama that remains recognisable and relevant. Ratings rose to almost 900,000 in mid-2008, but generally ratings begin to fall towards the end of each year, usually averaging around 700,000. On 17 July 2009, during the aftermath of the Parker family's car accident and the dramatic death of Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), <b>Neighbours</b> achieved higher ratings than Home And Away. <b>Neighbours</b> achieved 998,000 viewers and placed 6th for the night, Home And Away placed 7th.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, rival {{soap opera}} Home and Away emerged as {{more popular than}} <b>Neighbours</b> in Australia. As of 2004, <b>Neighbours</b> was {{regularly}} attracting just under a million viewers per episode. In 2007, Home and Away was averaging 1.4million viewers in Australia to <b>Neighbours</b> 700,000. During the revamp of 2007, the episode broadcast on 23 July 2007 saw {{the introduction of a}} new family, updated sets, new theme music and graphics. Ratings for that episode averaged 1.05million viewers in the 6:30pm. slot. It {{was the first time the}} programme's viewing figures had topped 1million in 2007. By the end of 2007 it was reported that producers had hoped the <b>Neighbours</b> revamp would push the ratings up to between 900,000 to 1million an episode. It had, however, resulted in a more modest boost, with ratings hovering at about 800,000 a night.

5|$|<b>Neighbours</b> {{executive}} producer Susan Bower said {{the creation of}} the character and his storyline was a result of requests from young viewers in the <b>Neighbours</b> website forums.

40|$|A {{distributed}} {{method for}} {{determining whether a}} node can represent or be represented by other nodes within a network comprises receiving at a node (vn), respective sets of observations (kl) for each <b>neighbour</b> node (N(vn)) of the node across respective links ({vn,vk})) within the network. For each link, a measure (Dn,k) of dis-similarly between the observations for a <b>neighbour</b> node (kl) and the corresponding observations (nl) for the node is determined. Respective inequality measures (Ek) for each <b>neighbour</b> node (N(vn)) of the node are determined, each inequality measure being a function of respective dissimilarity measures (Dn,k) and weights (pn,k) for each link between a <b>neighbour</b> node (vk) and its <b>neighbour</b> nodes. For each link ({vn,vk}) between the node and a respective <b>neighbour</b> node, a weight (pn,k) is updated {{as a function of}} the dissimilarity measure (Dn,k) and a previous weight for the link. For each link between the node and a respective <b>neighbour</b> node, the node determines as a function of an inequality measure for the node (En) and the determined inequality measure for the <b>neighbour</b> node (Ek) whether a link between the node and the <b>neighbour</b> node should be maintained. The node then determines, based on the links maintained by the node, if the node can represent <b>neighbour</b> nodes within the network...|$|R

5|$|<b>Neighbours</b> {{has proved}} to be more popular in the United Kingdom than in Australia. It was {{screened}} on BBC One from 1986 until 2008. The series started airing on 27 October 1986, as part of BBC1's revamped daytime schedules. <b>Neighbours</b> went out twice a day, with a morning broadcast and then a showing at lunchtime. Michael Grade, the channel's then controller, was advised by his daughter to move the series to 5:35pm, as she and her friends kept missing it due to them being at school, which took place from January 1988. The show then started attracting larger audiences, peaking in 1990 at over 21 million. Towards the late 2000s, <b>Neighbours</b> was normally attracting an average of 3million viewers for its lunchtime showing and 2.6million viewers for its early-evening repeat. It was frequently the highest-rating daytime programme in the UK, outside of news bulletins.|$|E

Ten began screening the series with episode 171 on 20 January 1986. In 1986, the series was bought by the BBC {{as part of their}} new daytime schedule in the United Kingdom. <b>Neighbours</b> made its debut on BBC1 on 27 October 1986 starting with the pilot episode. It soon gained a loyal audience and the show became particularly popular with younger viewers, and before long was watched by up to 16million viewers - more than the entire population of Australia at the time. In 1988 <b>Neighbours</b> became the only television show to have its entire cast flown over to the UK to make an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance in front of the Queen. <b>Neighbours</b> has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and the seventh longest running serial drama still on the air in the world. In 2005, <b>Neighbours</b> celebrated its 20th anniversary and over twenty former cast members returned for a special episode, which saw them sitting down to watch a documentary about Ramsay Street. At the Logie Award ceremony that year, the show was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.|$|E
