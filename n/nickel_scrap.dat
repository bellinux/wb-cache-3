40|$|Purification of the 70, 000 to 245, 000 tons of {{diffusion}} plant <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap</b> permit {{its use in}} {{a variety}} of DOE and, with establishment of de minimus standards, foreign and domestic industrial applications. Nickel recycle would also substantially decrease DOE legacy wastes. This report presents data on electrolytes and separations which could be used in electrolytic purification of radiologically contaminated <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap</b> from first generation diffusion plants. Potentiometric scans and plating tests indicate that both industrial electrolytes, buffered nickel sulfate-sodium chloride and nickel chloride, provide good current densities. Electrolytes which contain ammonium thiocyanate or ammonium chloride also perform well. Nickel does not plate appreciably from nitrate solutions because the nitrate was preferentially reduced to nitrite. Solvent extractions of cobalt, a common contaminant in commercial nickel, and pertechnate, a radiological contaminant expected in DOE <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap,</b> are also successful...|$|E
40|$|The DOE {{will soon}} choose between {{treating}} contaminated <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap</b> as a legacy waste and developing high-volume nickel decontamination processes. In addition to reducing {{the volume of}} legacy wastes, a decontamination process could make 200, 000 tons of this strategic metal available for domestic use. Contaminants in DOE <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap</b> include {sup 234 }Th, {sup 234 }Pa, {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 239 }Pu (trace), {sup 60 }Co, U, {sup 99 }Tc, and {sup 237 }Np (trace). This report reviews several industrial-scale processes [...] electrorefining, electrowinning, vapormetallurgy, and leaching [...] used for the purification of nickel. Conventional nickel electrolysis processes are particularly attractive because they use side-stream purification of process solutions to improve the purity of nickel metal. Additionally, nickel purification by electrolysis is effective {{in a variety of}} electrolyte systems, including sulfate, chloride, and nitrate. Conventional electrorefining processes typically use a mixed electrolyte which includes sulfate, chloride, and borate. The use of an electrorefining or electrowinning system for scrap nickel recovery could be combined effectively with a variety of processes, including cementation, solvent extraction, ion exchange, complex-formation, and surface sorption, developed for uranium and transuranic purification. Selected processes were reviewed and evaluated for use in nickel side-stream purification. 80 refs...|$|E
40|$|Anodic {{dissolution}} of nickel {{is a technique}} adopted for the electrolytic preparation of nickel salts. This electrochemical route is attractive from the points of view of product purity, ease of preparation and use of <b>nickel</b> <b>scrap</b> as the starting material. Studies on the anodic {{dissolution of}} nickel in sulphuric acid solution are reported with respect to current efficiency and anode potential. The effects of current density, concentration of sulphuric acid and temperature have also been examined. Addition of chloride ion inhibits anode passivation {{and its role in}} aiding the dissolution process has been discussed...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{a new project}} of neutron {{analyzer}} was launched, the Continuous Neutron Analyzer (CNA) {{for the analysis of}} cements. The principle of material analysis by neutron interrogation was then extended for a vast range of applications: coal, ores (copper, <b>nickel,</b> bauxite, iron), <b>scrap</b> and waste. In 2010, about 70 of those devices had been sold, mostly to cement makers. These CNAs are marketed by another company, PANalytical.|$|R
40|$|Recycle of {{radioactive}} scrap metals (RSM) from decommissioning of DOE uranium enrichment {{and nuclear weapons}} manufacturing facilities is mandatory to recapture {{the value of these}} metals and avoid the high cost of disposal by burial. The scrap metals conversion project detailed below focuses on the contaminated nickel associated with the gaseous diffusion plants. Stainless steel can be produced in MSC`s vacuum induction melting process (VIM) to the S 30400 specification using nickel as an alloy constituent. Further the case alloy can be rolled in MSC`s rolling mill to the mechanical property specification for S 30400 demonstrating the capability to manufacture the contaminated nickel into valuable end products at a facility licensed to handle radioactive materials. Bulk removal of Technetium from <b>scrap</b> <b>nickel</b> is theoretically possible in a reasonable length of time with the high calcium fluoride flux, however the need for the high temperature creates a practical problem due to flux volatility. Bulk decontamination is possible and perhaps more desirable if nickel is alloyed with copper to lower the melting point of the alloy allowing the use of the high calcium fluoride flux. Slag decontamination processes have been suggested which have been proven technically viable at the Colorado School of Mines...|$|R
