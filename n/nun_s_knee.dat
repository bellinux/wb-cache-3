40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the pathologic changes of jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> before and after jumping and effects of icing after jumping. Sixteen healthy college students and sixteen collegiate volleyball players with jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> were divided into two groups by eight, without icing group and with icing group after jumping exercise. Without icing groups rested for 20 minutes, while with icing groups were treated with ice for 20 minutes after eighty times of jumping. Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and sectional area of patellar tendon with Magnetic Resonance Imaging and the tenderness of patellar tendon with visual analog scale were measured before and after exercise, following with or without icing and 24 and 48 hours later from the treatment. In jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> group, significant increase was found in the SNR, sectional area of patellar tendon, and tenderness of patellar tendon after exercise compared to before exercise.

40|$|Patellar tendon {{ultrasound}} {{appearance is}} commonly used in clinical practice to diagnose patellar tendinopathy and guide management. Using a longitudinal study design we examined {{whether or not the}} presence of a hypoechoic ultrasonographic lesion in an asymptomatic patellar tendon conferred a risk for developing jumper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> compared with a tendon that was ultrasonographically normal. Ultrasonographic, symptomatic and anthropometric assessment was completed at baseline and followup. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on four tendons that resolved ultrasonographically in the study period. Forty-six patellar tendons were followed over 47 ± 11. 8 months. Eighteen tendons were hypoechoic at baseline and 28 were ultrasonographically normal. Five tendons resolved ultrasonographically in the study period. Magnetic resonance imaging in four of these tendons was normal. Seven normal patellar tendons at baseline developed a hypoechoic area but only two became symptomatic. Analysis of ultrasonography at baseline and clinical outcome with Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact test shows there is no association between baseline ultrasound changes and symptoms at followup. In this study there is no statistically significant relationship between ultrasonographic patellar tendon abnormalities and clinical outcome in elite male athletes.

40|$|The {{majority}} of {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) injuries for soccer players are non-contact. Women have {{a higher incidence of}} non-contact ACL injury than men. One of the five most important factors associated with these non-contact injuries is when the plant leg knee flexes to less than 30 °. Women soccer players have also been reported to flex the knee less than men when planting to take a shot. While soccer is mainly played on natural grass (NG) fields, playing on artificial turf (AT) surfaces is becoming increasingly popular because of the many benefits including low maintenance. Recently some data has suggested that knee injury incidence rates are higher on artificial turf than natural grass. Purpose: To determine if playing surface has an effect on men and women soccer players’ plant leg knee angle when performing maximal effort power (PS) and finesse (FS) shots. Methods: Sixteen collegiate soccer players (8 female, 8 male, age = 20. 17 ± yrs, mass = 73. 67 ± kg, height = 162. 41 ± cm) performed four different shooting conditions (3 PS on artificial turf, 3 PS on natural grass, 3 FS on artificial turf, 3 FS natural grass). Participants performed a 15 yd maximal effort dribble into a 5 yd x 5 yd cone box to complete the shot. A wireless electrogoniometer and accelerometer were attached to each participant in order to collect plant leg knee angle kinematics as well as tibial acceleration at 200 Hz. Separate 2 x 2 (field surface x gender) Repeated Measures ANOVAs were used to analyze data collected from each shot type. Results: The mean (<b>sd)</b> <b>knee</b> angle (degrees) for men, on grass and turf fields during the power shot were 29. 3 °(11. 4 °) and, 28. 6 °(8. 1 °), respectively. The knee angle for women on grass and turf fields for the power shot were 26. 8 °(3. 8 °), and 31. 9 ° (18. 7 °), respectively. The mean (<b>sd)</b> <b>knee</b> angle (degrees) for men on grass and turf fields during the finesse shot were 30. 8 ° (13. 1 °) and 28. 7 ° (8. 6 °), respectively. The knee angle for women on grass and turf fields for the finesse shot were 24. 0 ° (6. 5 °), and 24. 3 ° (6. 3 °), respectively. Field surface had no significant effect on knee angle of the plant leg during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 251, p = 0. 624) or finesse (F(1, 14) = 0. 082, p = 0. 779) shots. Furthermore, plant leg knee angle were similar between genders during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 012, p = 0. 913) and finesse (F(1, 14) = 3. 128, p = 0. 099) shots. Lastly, there was no significant interaction between field condition and sex on the plant leg knee angle during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 431, p = 0. 522) and finesse (F(1, 14) = 0. 141, p = 0. 713) shots. Conclusion: A more extended knee on the plant leg {{has been shown to be}} one factor that is associated with knee injuries in soccer. Data from this study suggests that playing surface had no effect on plant leg knee kinematics for either men or women suggesting that either surface is acceptable for play with respect to plant leg knee kinematics...|$|R

Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of a newly developed eccentric training program for patellar tendinopathy in volleyball players during the competitive season. Study Design: Randomized clinical trial. Methods: Patients were recruited from male and female elite volleyball teams in Norway, and the diagnosis was based on clinical examination alone. Of 51 players diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy, 29 could be included in the study. The training group (n = 13) performed squats on a 25 ° decline board as a home exercise program (3 × 15 repetitions twice daily) for a 12 -week intervention period during the final half of the competitive season. The eccentric (downward) component was done on the affected leg. The control group (n = 16) trained as usual. The primary outcome was a symptom-based questionnaire developed specifically for patellar tendinopathy (Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment score), and patients were followed up before and after the intervention period, as well as after 6 and 30 weeks.

Numerous {{measures have been}} developed to study knee osteoarthritis (OA); however, many of these surveys are long, disruptive to clinic flow, and result in incomplete data capture and/or low followup rates. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome (KOOS) physical function short-form (KOOS-PS), while shorter, ignores pain, which is a primary concern of patients with advanced knee OA. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Our objective was to derive and validate a short-form survey focused on the patient with end-stage knee OA undergoing TKA. METHODS: Using our hospital 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> replacement registry, we retrospectively identified 2291 patients with knee OA who underwent primary unilateral TKA and had completed preoperative and 2 -year postoperative PROMs. We assessed 30 items from the 42 -item KOOS that were quantitatively most difficult for patients to perform before TKA and qualitatively most relevant to patients with end-stage knee OA. Rasch analysis identified the KOOS, JR, a seven-item instrument, representing a single dimension, which we define as 2 ̆ 2 knee health 2 ̆ 2 because it reflects aspects of pain, symptom severity, and activities of daily living (ADL) including movements or activities that are directly relevant and difficult for patients with advanced knee OA. We assessed the internal consistency, external validity (versus KOOS and WOMAC domains), responsiveness, and floor and ceiling effects of the KOOS, JR. External validation was performed using calculated KOOS, JR scores in collaboration with a nationally representative joint replacement registry, the Function and Outcomes Research for Comparative Effectiveness in Total Joint Replacement (FORCE-TJR).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if the Hughston Visual Analog Scale Knee (VAS) Questionnaire and clinical measurements could provide valuable information concerning a patient 2 ̆ 7 s functional outcome. The study also compared scores of the Hughston VAS knee questionnaire to pain, range of motion, and perceived improvements for knee patients who required physical therapy interventions. Paired t-tests showed significant (p 3 ̆c. 05) improvements in all variables between the patient 2 ̆ 7 s initial and discharge evaluations. Extension ROM showed a positive relationship with function, while the flexion ROM showed only a minor relationship to function. Correlation coefficients revealed range of motion and pain to be unrelated. Pain exhibited the strongest relationship to the patient 2 ̆ 7 s perceived improvement and function. In an attempt to determine if a shortened questionnaire could be used clinically, we looked at the correlations between the questions and the patient 2 ̆ 7 s overall functional score.

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Academy soccer clubs Patients or other participants: 400 elite male youth soccer players aged between 10 - 18 years, categorized by chronological age and stage of maturation (pre, circa or post puberty) based on their years from peak height velocity (PHV). Main outcome measures: Knee valgus was evaluated during the tuck jump assessment via two-dimensional analysis. Participants were subjectively classified as minor (20 °) and using these classifications, scored as follows: 0 = no valgus; 1 = minor; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe. Results: A trend of higher valgus scores were shown in the younger age groups and pre-PHV players. The lowest frequency of “no valgus” were in the U 18 s and post-PHV players. The highest percentage of “severe” scores were in the U 13 <b>s.</b> <b>Knee</b> valgus scores were significantly lower in the U 18 s on both legs than all other age groups (p < 0. 001), except for the U 16 s.

40|$|Dancers spend {{many years}} {{practicing}} repetitive movements {{in order for}} their bodies to gain flexibility, strength and muscle memory. This thesis investigated the biomechanics of a dance student 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>knee</b> motion during a tendu to the front in first, third, and fifth positions. A dancer will often perform 75 or more tendu closing actions during one technique class - particularly in ballet technique. During a tendu the moving foot moves along the floor but the toes never leave the floor. The tendu is used to strengthen the leg muscles, particularly the quadriceps and gluteal muscles. Flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and rotation angles of the knees during a traditional flat footed closing were compared to the knee angles during pli# 233; and relev# 233; closing. These movements were performed by 10 healthy dance students from USF. The dancers 2 ̆ 7 movements were tracked using the VICON Nexus motion analysis system and 27 passive reflective markers placed on bony landmarks. Visual 3 D software was {{used to calculate the}} knee angles. There were statistically significant the differences between knee angles during the traditional and pli# 233; closings and between the relev# 233; and pli# 233; closings for all positions. There were only 4 conditions in which there was statistical significance between traditional and relev# 233; closings. Knee flexion difference between the traditional and relev# 233; closings was unanticipated, as the expectation of the tendu movement is to maintain a fully straight knee throughout the full range. This result suggests that the students may be bending the knees to achieve greater outward rotation, particularly in the third and fifth positions. The pli# 233; had the largest range of motion (ROM) for all of the angles tested including abduction/adduction in which the subjects used the abduction at the knee to hold the feet in a turned out position.

The plasma levels of IL- 6 and TNF-α will be assessed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with high sensitivity kits (Quantikine ® HS, R&D Systems Minneapolis, MN, U. <b>S.).</b> <b>Knee</b> extensor muscle strength will be assessed using the Byodex System 3 Pro ® isokinetic dynamometer at angular speeds of 60 and 180 °/s. The intervention will consist of strengthening exercises of the lower extremities at 50 to 70 % of 1 RM (maximal resistance) three times per week for ten weeks. The volunteers will be randomized into two groups: group E, the intervention group, and group C, the control group that did not initiate any new activities during the initial study period (ten weeks). After the initial period, group C will begin the intervention and group E will maintain everyday activities without exercising. At the end of the total study period, all volunteers will be reassessed. Discussion To demonstrate and discuss possible influences of load-bearing exercises on the modification of plasma levels of IL- 6 and TNF-α and in the functional performance of pre-frail elderly women.

The position of the tibia {{in relation to the}} femur at a given degree of flexion also may vary because of the normal play in a relaxed knee. Factors which can not be completely controlled during the test, such as tension in the muscles and the femoral clamping, are probably of importance. If tibial transla-tions are measured in the ‘entre of the joint, the tibial position before the loads are applied is probably more influenced by the testing situation than by the presence of an intact cruciate ligament. However, if tibial rotations are measured at 20 to 30 #{ 176 }of flexion and in the Table Ill.

These movements probably occurred because the tibial insertion of the ACL is situated slightly medial of the centre of the knee and close to the screw axis for longitudinal rotations (van Dijk 1983). When the tension in the ACL was released and the tibia was pulled anteriorly, both the lateral and the medial condyle displaced anteriorly (Fig. 6) indicating a medial shift of the screw axis as previously suggested by Lipke et al. (1981). The anatomical configuration of the lateral tibial condyle, with a slight convexity in the sagittal plane (Jakob et al. 1981), may also explain why this condyle had a more anterior position also in the intact knee. In all positions of the knee which were investigated a tendency to decreased adduction was noted on the ACL-deficient side (Table II), but a significant differ-Number of patients Displacement in mm Injured <b>knee</b> <b>s.</b> d.

40|$|Background: In {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} total knee {{replacements}} performed annually in the United States has doubled, with disproportionate increases among younger adults. While total knee replacement is a highly effective treatment for end-stage knee osteoarthritis, total knee replacement recipients can experience persistent pain and severe complications. We are aware of no current estimates of the prevalence of total knee replacement among adults in the U. S. Methods: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated computer simulation model of knee osteoarthritis, and data on annual total knee replacement utilization to estimate the prevalence of primary and revision total knee replacement amongadults fifty {{years of age or}} older in the U. S. We combined these prevalence estimates with U. S. Census data to estimate the number of adults in the U. S. currently living with total knee replacement. The annual incidence of total knee replacement was derived from two longitudinal knee osteoarthritis cohorts and ranged from 1. 6 % to 11. 9 % in males and from 2. 0 % to 10. 9 % in females. Results: We estimated that 4. 0 million (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 6 million to 4. 4 million) adults in the U. S. currently live with a total knee replacement, representing 4. 2 % (95 % CI: 3. 7 % to 4. 6 %) of the population fifty years of age or older. The prevalencewas higher among females (4. 8 %) than amongmales (3. 4 %) and increasedwith age. The lifetime risk of primary total knee replacement from the age of twenty-five years was 7. 0 % (95 % CI: 6. 1 % to 7. 8 %) for males and 9. 5 % (95 % CI: 8. 5 % to 10. 5 %) for females.

To date, no published research has studied the football knee pad 2 ̆ 7 s effect on athletic performance, and no ergonomic evaluation of the design has been completed. This research first created a new knee pad design based on survey feedback from 138 collegiate and high school football athletes. This new design, called the Vastus And Patella Protection with Range of motion (VAPPR) pad, was then tested for effectiveness. During testing, 10 collegiate athletes performed standardized football drills (Pro-Agility, L-Drill, Broad-Jump) under three padded conditions: unpadded, standard knee pad, VAPPR pad. Results were based on three padded comparisons. First, athletes performed at a higher level unpadded than wearing standard knee pads. Second, no difference in performance existed between testing unpadded and with VAPPR pads. Third, VAPPR pads resulted in superior performance, provided equal protection, and were preferred by athletes when compared to standard knee pads...|$|R

40|$|Higginson, Jill <b>S.</b> <b>Knee</b> {{osteoarthritis}} is a degenerative {{joint disease}} {{and is one}} of the leading causes of disability in the United States. While the etiology is not fully understood, mechanics have been implicated in the disease initiation and progression. Previous research has found that individuals with knee osteoarthritis exhibit abnormal kinematic and kinetic gait patterns. These studies, however, have focused on the symptomatic limb in comparison with healthy individuals leaving the mechanics of the contralateral limb largely unknown. Furthermore, there has been evidence suggesting that alterations on the symptomatic limb may result in an increased risk of osteoarthritis on the contralateral limb. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanics of the contralateral limb and associated symmetry of individuals with knee osteoarthritis during gait. Seventeen subjects with knee osteoarthritis were evaluated. Three-dimensional motion capture data was collected as each subject walked at self-selected speed on an instrumented split-belt treadmill. The symptomatic limb was selected as each subject???s self-described more painful knee and was verified radiographically to possess more severe osteoarthritis than the contralateral knee. Kinematic and kinetic analysis focused on sagittal plane knee motion during initial contact and early stance, peak vertical ground reaction force, and loading rate. In order to assess interlimb symmetry on a more global limb level, various total support moment parameters were investigated. Interlimb differences for all variables were assessed using paired t-tests. The results revealed that the symptomatic knee contacted the ground with more flexion, exhibited less excursion during stance and displayed less total excursion than the contralateral limb. In comparison with the contralateral limb, the symptomatic limb also experienced a reduced peak vertical ground reaction force and vertical loading rate. Additionally, there were no interlimb differences for peak or angular impulse of total support moment; however the symptomatic limb displayed a decreased knee contribution and an increased ankle contribution to peak total support moment when compared with the contralateral limb. The presence of interlimb asymmetries at the joint and limb levels suggests that individuals with knee osteoarthritis are using their symptomatic and contralateral limbs differently during gait. These asymmetries could represent compensation by the contralateral limb to decrease joint loading and limit knee motion for the more painful limb. Future research should focus on comparing the contralateral limb to limbs of healthy individuals in order to determine if clinical interventions should target one or both limbs to restore gait symmetry.

40|$|After active {{lengthening}} contractions, a given {{amount of}} force can be maintained with less muscle activation compared to pure isometric contractions at the same muscle length and intensity. This increase in neuromuscular efficiency is associated with mechanisms of stretch-induced residual force enhancement. We hypothesized that stretch-related increase in neuromuscular efficiency reduces fatigability of a muscle during submaximal contractions. 13 subjects performed 60 <b>s</b> isometric <b>knee</b> extensions at 60 % of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with and without prior stretch (60 °/s, 20 °). Each 60 s trial was preceded and followed by neuromuscular tests consisting of MVCs, voluntary activation (VA) and resting twitches (RT), and there was 4 h rest between sets. We found a significant (p = 0. 036) 10 % reduction of quadriceps net-EMG after lengthening compared to pure isometric trials. However, increase in neuromuscular efficiency did not influence the development of fatigue. Albeit we found severe reduction of MVC (30 %), RT (30 %) and VA (5 %) after fatiguing trials, {{there were no differences}} between conditions with and without lengthening. As the number of subjects showing no activation reduction increased with increasing contraction time, intensity may have been too strenuous in both types of contractions, such that a distinction between different states of fatigue was not possible anymore...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Individuals {{following}} {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with concomitant meniscal pathology have {{a higher risk of}} developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared to those with isolated ACLR. Knee extensor weakness and altered dynamic knee joint biomechanics have been suggested {{to play a role in}} the development of knee OA following ACLR. This study investigated whether these factors differ in people following ACLR who have concomitant meniscal pathology compared to patients with isolated ACLR. Methods: Thirty-three patients with isolated ACLR and 34 patients with ACLR and meniscal pathology underwent strength and gait assessment 12 – 24 months post-operatively. Primary measures were peak isometric knee extensor torque and knee adduction moment (peak and impulse). Secondary measures included peak knee flexion moment and knee kinematics (sagittal and transverse). Results: There were no between-group differences in knee extensor strength [mean difference (95 % CI) 0. 09 (− 0. 23 to 0. 42) Nm/kg, n. <b>s.</b> ], peak <b>knee</b> adduction moment [− 0. 02 (− 0. 54 to 0. 49) Nm/(BW × HT) %, n. <b>s.</b> ] or <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse [0. 01 (− 0. 15 to 0. 17) Nm/(BW × HT) %, p = n. s. ]. No between-group differences were found for any secondary measures. Conclusions: No evidence was found to suggest that the higher prevalence of OA in patients with ACLR and meniscal pathology compared to patients with isolated ACLR is attributed to reduced knee muscle strength or altered knee joint biomechanics assessed 1 – 2 years post-surgery. Given that there is a higher incidence of knee OA in patients with concomitant meniscal pathology and ACLR, further investigation is needed so that population-specific rehabilitation protocols can be developed.
