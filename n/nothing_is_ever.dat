5|$|Various wuxia {{novels and}} folk legends have endowed Zhou with {{different}} kinds of martial and supernatural skills. These range from mastery of the bow, double broadswords, and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong and even x-ray vision. Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. He is also linked to Northern Praying Mantis boxing via Lin Chong and Yan Qing. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. However, the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to Yue Fei. <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of Chinese martial arts.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization {{stated that}} a 2013 thyroid {{ultrasound}} screening program was, {{due to the}} screening effect, {{likely to lead to}} an increase in recorded thyroid cases due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. The overwhelming majority of thyroid growths are benign growths that will never cause symptoms, illness, or death, even if <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> done about the growth. Autopsy studies on people who died from other causes show that more than one third of adults technically have a thyroid growth/cancer. As a precedent, in 1999 in South Korea, the introduction of advanced ultrasound thyroid examinations resulted in an explosion in the rate of benign thyroid cancers being detected and needless surgeries occurring. Despite this, the death rate from thyroid cancer has remained the same.|$|E

This screening programme is, due to the screening effect, likely, according to the WHO, to lead to an increase in the incidence of the diagnosis of thyroid disease due to early detection of non-symptomatic disease cases. For example, the overwhelming majority of thyroid growths prior to the accident, and {{in other parts of the}} world, are overdiagnosed (that is, a benign growth that will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> done about the growth) with autopsy studies, again done prior to the accident and in other parts of the world, on people who died from other causes showing that more than one third (33%+), of adults technically has a thyroid growth/cancer, but it is benign/never caused them any harm.|$|E

The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by a crack in the universe during the events of [...] "Cold Blood" [...] and erased from existence. When Amy comes around after being knocked out by a damaged Cyberman, she does not remember Rory, which upsets him greatly. The Doctor assures Rory that Amy will remember in time, and hands him the engagement ring.|$|E

500|$|Naomi first storyline {{focused on}} her {{unexpected}} arrival in Erinsborough and her reconciliation with her mother Sheila (Mann), who she had not spoken to in five years. They fell out when Sheila discovered Naomi's affair with a married man and told his wife, which Naomi had never forgiven her for. Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her. Mann commented, [...] "Sheila has learned the hard way that there is always an agenda with Naomi. <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> as it seems." [...] When Sheila found a discarded SIM card, she hoped to find some clues as to why her daughter has reappeared in her life. After seeing a lot of number and messages stored on the card, Sheila believed Naomi was having another affair. She then accused Naomi of repeating her past mistakes and [...] "a fierce war of words" [...] erupted between the two, which resulted in Naomi deciding to leave. Sheila then promised not to interfere in her life and [...] "reluctantly" [...] offered Naomi a place to stay, until she got back on her feet.|$|E

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I owe it to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I owe it to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter {{referred}} to the film as [...] "a respectful origin story for the long-running Texas Chainsaw Massacre horror franchise" [...] and also complemented the performances of Stephen Dorff and Lili Taylor. Variety reflected that [...] "This Texas Chainsaw 'origin story' is a somewhat mixed bag, but it's also an earnest and well-crafted attempt at franchise course-correction. There's plenty of graphic violence here, but Leatherface is plot-driven rather than merely kill-driven. But that, too, is a useful re-direction: <b>Nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> going to fully recapture the berserker mood that made Hooper's original so terrifying, despite its deceptive lack of actual on-screen gore." [...] Bloody Disgusting gave it a 3.5/5 score, saying that [...] "Bustillo and Maury have made the best TCM film in quite some while. The fact that Leatherface avoids the slasher playbook in its road movie set-up may alone be enough to explain {{the lack of a}} wide theatrical release, but this is an entertaining splatter film well worth a digital rental." ...|$|E

[...] Soliquisto may be lost in memories but he's still canny. [...] (What My Public Wants) [...] The plot is fairly simple and endearingly odd, but the underlying ideas are more complex. [...] Basically, Stinkfoot is a portrait of the artist’s creative heart and mind. [...] Soliquisto believes what he has made must remain in his control or his art is lost. [...] By the end of Stinkfoot he realizes <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> lost, that he can let his creations go, that once he (or she) has created something it takes {{on a life of its}} own, and that the artist can always make more. [...] (Only Being Myself) [...] With this lesson learned, Soliquisto, who has made nothing new since Stinkfoot disappeared, sees Elma the Electrifying Elver dancing on the beach. [...] (Drowned Sailor's Dream) [...] Ah! [...] Here is his new creation, his latest work of art. [...] He will make her a star! [...] The act of creation is forever…it goes on and on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} against early {{diagnosis and treatment}} {{is based on the}} logic that many small thyroid cancers (mostly papillary) will not grow or metastasize. This viewpoint holds the overwhelming majority of thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed (that is, will never cause any symptoms, illness, or death for the patient, even if <b>nothing</b> <b>is</b> <b>ever</b> done about the cancer). [...] Including these overdiagnosed cases skews the statistics by lumping clinically significant cases in with apparently harmless cancers. [...] Thyroid cancer is incredibly common, with autopsy studies of people dying from other causes showing that more than one-third of older adults technically have thyroid cancer, which is causing them no harm. [...] It is easy to detect nodules that might be cancerous, simply by feeling the throat, which contributes to the level of overdiagnosis. Benign (non-cancerous) nodules frequently co-exist with thyroid cancer; sometimes, it is a benign nodule that is discovered but surgery uncovers an incidental small thyroid cancer. Increasingly, small thyroid nodules are discovered as incidental findings on imaging (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound) performed for another purpose very few of these people with accidentally discovered, symptom-free thyroid cancers will ever have any symptoms, and treatment in such patients has the potential to cause harm to them, not to help them.|$|E
