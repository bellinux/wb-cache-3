50|$|In recent years, micro- and <b>nanotribology</b> {{have been}} gaining ground.

50|$|<b>Nano{{tribology}}</b> is {{the branch}} of tribology that studies friction, wear, adhesion and lubrication phenomena at the nanoscale, where atomic interactions and quantum effects are not negligible. The aim of this discipline is characterizing and modifying surfaces for both scientific and technological purposes.|$|E
50|$|SPM {{techniques}} such as AFM and STM are widely used in <b>nanotribology</b> studies. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope is used mostly for morphological topological investigation of a clean conductive sample, because {{it is able to}} give an image of its surface with atomic resolution.The Atomic Force Microscope is a powerful tool in order to study tribology at a fundamental level. It provides an ultra-fine surface-tip contact with a high refined control over motion and atomic-level precision of measure. The microscope consists, basically, in a high flexible cantilever with a sharp tip, which is the part in contact with the sample and therefore the crossing section must be ideally atomic-size, but actually nanometric (radius of the section varies from 10 to 100 nm). In <b>nanotribology</b> AFM is commonly used for measuring normal and friction forces with a resolution of pico-Newtons.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1990s, {{new areas}} of {{tribology}} have emerged, including the <b>nanotribology,</b> biotribology, and green tribology. These interdisciplinary areas study the friction, wear and lubrication at the nanoscale (including the Atomic force microscopy and micro/nanoelectromechanical systems, MEMS/NEMS), {{in biomedical applications}} (e.g., human joint prosthetics, dental materials), and ecological aspects of friction, lubrication and wear (tribology of clean energy sources, green lubricants, biomimetic tribology).|$|E

50|$|Friction {{and wear}} have been {{technological}} issues since ancient periods. On the one hand, the scientific {{approach of the}} last centuries towards the comprehension of the underlying mechanisms was focused on macroscopic aspects of tribology. On the other hand, in <b>nanotribology,</b> the systems studied are composed of nanometric structures, where volume forces (such as those related to mass and gravity) can often be considered negligible compared to surface forces. Scientific equipment to study such systems have been developed only {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. In 1969 the very first method to study the behavior of a molecularly thin liquid film sandwiched between two smooth surfaces through the SFA was developed. From this starting point, in 1980s researchers would employ other techniques to investigate solid state surfaces at the atomic scale.|$|E
50|$|Computational {{methods are}} {{particularly}} useful in <b>nanotribology</b> for studying various phenomena, such as nanoindentation, friction, wear or lubrication. In an atomistic simulation, every single atom’s motion and trajectory can be tracked {{with a very}} high precision and so this information {{can be related to}} experimental results, in order to interpret them, to confirm a theory or to have access to phenomena, that are invisible to a direct study. Moreover, many experimental difficulties do not exist in an atomistic simulation, such as sample preparation and instrument calibration. Theoretically every surface can be created from a flawless one to the most disordered. As well as in the other fields where atomistic simulations are used, the main limitations of these techniques relies on the lack of accurate interatomic potentials and the limited computing power. For this reason, simulation time is very often small (femtoseconds) and the time step is limited to 1 fs for fundamental simulations up to 5 fs for coarse-grained models.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} study, {{we found that}} metaphase chromosomes are formed by thin plates, {{and here we have}} applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) and friction force measurements at the nanoscale (<b>nanotribology)</b> to analyze the properties of these planar structures in aqueous media at room temperature. Our results show that high concentrations of NaCl and EDTA and extensive digestion with protease and nuclease enzymes cause plate denaturation. <b>Nanotribology</b> studies show that native plates under structuring conditions (5  mM Mg 2 +) have a relatively high friction coefficient (μ ≈ 0. 3), which is markedly reduced when high concentrations of NaCl or EDTA are added (μ ≈ 0. 1). This lubricant effect can be interpreted considering the electrostatic repulsion between DNA phosphate groups and the AFM tip. Protease digestion increases the friction coefficient (μ ≈  0. 5), but the highest friction is observed when DNA is cleaved by micrococcal nuclease (μ ≈ 0. 9), indicating that DNA is the main structural element of plates. Whereas nuclease-digested plates are irreversibly damaged after the friction measurement, native plates can absorb kinetic energy from the AFM tip without suffering any damage. These results suggest that plates are formed by a flexible and mechanically resistant two-dimensional network which allows the safe storage of DNA during mitosis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) and {{nanotechnology}} {{are important}} directions {{on the development}} of the science in twenty-first century. Some of the effects, such as viscous force, surface force, electrostatic force, friction etc., which can be usually ignored on the traditional scale, have become noticeable when the scale has turn to micro or nano scale. <b>Nanotribology</b> is one of the main areas of the indispensable researches on the basic theory and methodology of the effects. The micro/nano adhesive contact which is the foundation of <b>nanotribology</b> is studied in this paper. The earliest study on adhesive contact was done by Bradley. He presented an expression of adhesive force of two contacting rigid spheres. Derjaguin, Muller and Toprov (DMT) gave the relation of the contact area and the applied load of the adhesive contact of two spheres, but they did not consider the elastic deformation due to the adhesive force of the bodies. Johnson, Keudall and Roberts (JKR) provided a theory of the adhesive contact of two elastic spheres. Tabor gave a parameter (Tabor parameter) to interpret the ratio of the elastic deformation with the adhesive force of two contacting bodies. That is to say the DMT model corresponding to small Tabor parameter( 5). Maguis gave a DMT-JKR transition using the Dugdale model in fracture mechanics (M-D model) in the intermediate regio...|$|E
30|$|Atoms, molecules, and {{nanoparticles}} are {{the basic}} building blocks for many applications in <b>nanotribology</b> and nanomachines including nano-electro-mechanical systems [1 – 5]. When a bottom-up approach is used, one often has to manipulate these blocks through positioning, packing, and moving them on a surface. Meanwhile, at finite temperature, a building block on a surface may undergo thermally-driven diffusive motion [6], in which it interacts with its surrounding atoms and experiences kinetic friction. Therefore, there is an intrinsic connection between kinetic friction and surface diffusion at the atomic scale, which has recently attracted considerable attention [7, 8].|$|E
