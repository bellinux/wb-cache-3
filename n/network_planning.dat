5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected and communicate with the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to <b>network</b> <b>planning,</b> customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E

The {{evaluation}} of urban rail transit <b>plan</b> <b>network</b> {{is the key}} link of rail transit plan, {{it is very important}} for determining optimal plans or satisfying plans which are advanced in technology, reasonable in economy, and feasible in implementation. Based on the analysis of present evaluation index systems and evaluation methods of urban rail transit <b>plan</b> <b>network,</b> the index system is optimized, and the evaluation model of urban rail transit <b>plan</b> <b>network</b> is established by applying DEA method with its solution method is given. Finally, a case is applied to show the feasibility of the method, which can provide basis for determining the optimal scheme of urban rail transit <b>network</b> <b>plan.</b> The research shows that there are many advantages by DEA method to evaluate urban rail transit <b>network</b> <b>plan,</b> which can provide reference for decision-maker to choose schemes...|$|R

50|$|Network-based plans may {{be either}} closed or open. With a closed network, enrollees' {{expenses}} are generally only covered {{when they go}} to network providers. Only limited services are covered outside the network—typically only emergency and out-of-area care.

Most preferred provider organization plans are open-network (those that are not are often described as exclusive provider organizations, or EPOs), as are point of service (POS) plans.|$|R
