5|$|A {{far-reaching}} {{generalization of}} addition of natural <b>numbers</b> is {{the addition of}} ordinal <b>numbers</b> and cardinal <b>numbers</b> in set theory. These give two different generalizations of addition of natural <b>numbers</b> to the transfinite. Unlike most addition operations, addition of ordinal <b>numbers</b> is not commutative. Addition of cardinal <b>numbers,</b> however, is a commutative operation {{closely related to the}} disjoint union operation.|$|E
5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by <b>numbers,</b> called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real <b>numbers,</b> but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex <b>numbers,</b> rational <b>numbers,</b> or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E

5|$|Although the Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is used to}} find the greatest common divisor of two natural <b>numbers</b> (positive integers), it may be generalized to the real <b>numbers,</b> and to other mathematical objects, such as polynomials, quadratic integers and Hurwitz quaternions. In the latter cases, the Euclidean {{algorithm is}} used to demonstrate the crucial property of unique factorization, i.e., that such <b>numbers</b> can be factored uniquely into irreducible elements, the counterparts of prime <b>numbers.</b> Unique factorization is essential to many proofs of number theory.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of <b>numbers</b> showed that participants disproportionately preferred <b>numbers</b> in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher <b>numbers,</b> over 12, than for lower <b>numbers.</b> The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from the mean), and strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the <b>numbers</b> in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, <b>numbers</b> are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd <b>numbers</b> and east–west highways have even <b>numbers.</b> Lower <b>numbers</b> are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E
