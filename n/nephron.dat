5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the <b>nephron</b> to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E
25|$|Distal RTA (dRTA) is the {{classical}} form of RTA, {{being the first}} described. Distal RTA {{is characterized by a}} failure of H+ secretion into lumen of <b>nephron</b> by the alpha intercalated cells of the medullary collecting duct of the distal <b>nephron.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone further {{increases}} the Na+ and H2O reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule of the <b>nephron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{two general}} classes of <b>nephrons</b> are {{cortical}} <b>nephrons</b> and juxtamedullary <b>nephrons,</b> {{both of which}} are classified according to the length of their associated Loop of Henle and location of their renal corpuscle. All <b>nephrons</b> have their renal corpuscles in the cortex. Cortical <b>nephrons</b> have their Loop of Henle in the renal medulla near its junction with the renal cortex, while the Loop of Henle of juxtamedullary <b>nephrons</b> is located deep in the renal medulla; they are called juxtamedullary because their renal corpuscle is located near the medulla (but still in the cortex). The nomenclature for cortical <b>nephrons</b> varies, with some sources distinguishing between superficial cortical <b>nephrons</b> and midcortical <b>nephrons,</b> depending on where their corpuscle is located within the cortex.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>nephrons</b> are cortical. Cortical <b>nephrons</b> have a shorter loop of Henle compared to juxtamedullary <b>nephrons.</b> The longer loop of Henle in juxtamedullary <b>nephrons</b> create a hyperosmolar gradient {{that allows for}} the creation of concentrated urine.|$|R
5000|$|The peritubular {{capillaries}} {{surround the}} proximal and distal tubules in both classes of <b>nephrons.</b> However, they surround the loop of Henle, forming the vasa recta, only in juxtamedullary <b>nephrons</b> {{and not in}} cortical <b>nephrons.</b>|$|R

25|$|In normal individuals, free light {{chains are}} rapidly cleared {{from the blood}} and catabolised by the kidneys. Monomeric free light chains are cleared in 2–4 hours, and dimeric light chains in 3–6 hours. Removal may be {{prolonged}} to 2–3 days in people with complete renal failure. Human kidneys are composed of approximately half a million nephrons. Each <b>nephron</b> contains a glomerulus with basement membrane pores that allow filtration of immunoglobulin light chains and other small molecules from the blood into the proximal tubule of the <b>nephron.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary {{target of}} all thiazide diuretics, {{including}} metolazone, is the distal convoluted tubule, {{part of the}} <b>nephron</b> in the kidney, where they inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter.|$|E
40|$|Irregular {{flow and}} {{pressure}} {{have been observed}} in the <b>nephrons</b> of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Coupling of <b>nephrons</b> through their tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) systems {{may be one of}} the factors involved in this phenomenon. To increase understanding of the effects due to coupling, a mathematical model was created for bifurcation analysis. This study was inspired by previous models that investigated coupled <b>nephrons</b> in the case of a rigid thick ascending limb (TAL) and single <b>nephrons</b> in the case of a compliant TAL. In the present study, a model of coupled <b>nephrons</b> with compliant TALs is developed. From this model, we have derived a characteristic equation for a system of coupled <b>nephrons.</b> Analysis of the solutions to this characteristic equation for the case of two identical coupled <b>nephrons</b> has revealed that TGF systems with coupling are more prone to oscillate, which could lead to the complex behavior found in SHR...|$|R
50|$|The way {{the kidneys}} {{do this is}} with <b>nephrons.</b> There are over 1 million <b>nephrons</b> in each kidney; these <b>nephrons</b> act as filters inside the kidneys. The kidneys filter needed {{materials}} and waste, the needed materials {{go back into the}} bloodstream, and unneeded materials becomes urine and is gotten rid of.|$|R
50|$|These vessels branch off the efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary <b>nephrons</b> (those <b>nephrons</b> {{closest to}} the medulla), enter the medulla, and {{surround}} the loop of Henle. The straight arterioles are peritubular capillaries, specifically those that surround the loop of Henle.|$|R
25|$|Note 4: The efferent arterioles do not {{directly}} drain into the interlobular vein, but rather {{they go to}} the peritubular capillaries first. The efferent arterioles of the juxtamedullary <b>nephron</b> drain into the vasa recta.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{can also}} have {{numerous}} other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole {{increases the likelihood of}} hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the <b>nephron.</b>|$|E
25|$|Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) {{is not a}} single entity, but rather a collection of different types of tumours, each derived from the various parts of the <b>nephron</b> (epithelium or renal tubules) and possessing distinct genetic characteristics, histological features, and, to some extent, clinical phenotypes.|$|E
5000|$|Proximal {{convoluted}} tubule: It then may reabsorb urea in {{the thick}} descending limb. Water {{is removed from the}} <b>nephrons</b> by osmosis (and glucose and other ions are pumped out with active transport), gradually raising the concentration in the <b>nephrons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mesonephros}} {{as a whole}} produces urine {{from the}} 6th through the 10th week of development. Despite the similarity in structure, function, and terminology, however, the mesonephric <b>nephrons</b> do not form {{any part of the}} mature kidney or <b>nephrons.</b> As the more caudal <b>nephrons</b> form, the more cranial <b>nephrons</b> are already degenerating. In females the mesonephros degenerates entirely, though vestigial structures such as Gartner's ducts, the epoophoron, and paroophoron are common. In males, a few of the more caudal tubules will survive and give rise to the efferent ductules of the testis, the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, as well as vestigial structures such as the appendix testis, appendix epididymis, and paradidymis.|$|R
40|$|Creation of a {{functioning}} chimeric mammalian kidney. The possibility of adding new <b>nephrons</b> to the mammalian kidney was studied. Embryonic metanephric tissue was implanted into the renal cortex of neonatal mice less than 24 hours old, {{and the development}} of the chimeric kidney was followed over the following two to four weeks. Donor tissue was obtained from the homozygous beige mouse and a mouse line transgenic for the β-globin gene, which provided distinct cellular and nuclear markers which were used to distinguish donor from recipient <b>nephrons.</b> Differentiation and growth of donor <b>nephrons</b> occurred in the host kidney and included vascularized glomeruli, mature proximal tubules, and tubular extensions into the renal medulla. Glomerular filtration was demonstrable in donor <b>nephrons</b> using FITC-dextran as a marker of filtration into the proximal tubules. Transplantation of metanephric tissue into adult mouse kidneys did not lead to glomerular or tubular differentiation. This study demonstrates the feasibility of adding functioning <b>nephrons</b> to mammalian kidneys in species in which there is ongoing nephrogenesis post-natally...|$|R
25|$|Urea {{is usually}} {{excreted}} as a waste product from the kidneys. However, when plasma blood volume {{is low and}} ADH is released the aquaporins that are opened are also permeable to urea. This allows urea to leave the collecting duct into the medulla creating a hyperosmotic solution that 'attracts' water. Urea can then re-enter the <b>nephron</b> and be excreted or recycled again depending on whether ADH is still present or not.|$|E
25|$|The hormone vasopressin, {{stimulates the}} {{activity}} of NKCC2. Vasopressin stimulates sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the <b>nephron</b> by activating signaling pathways. Vasopressin increases the traffic of NKCC2 to the membrane and phosphorylates some serine and threonine sites on the cytoplasmic N-terminal of the NKCC2 located in the membrane, increasing its activity. Increased NKCC2 activity aids in water reabsorption in the collecting duct through aquaporin 2 channels by creating a hypo-osmotic filtrate.|$|E
25|$|The metanephros is the definite, permanent, but yet {{immature}} kidney. It {{arises from}} two directions. On one hand, the precursor of the ureter buds from the Wolffian duct, {{while on the}} other hand, the precursor of the renal tubules develop from the metanephrogenic blastema. The ureteric bud subsequently grows into the latter mass, forming {{the parts of the}} <b>nephron.</b> Other changes include e.g. the translocation of the ureteric opening directly into the cloaca.|$|E
50|$|Efferent arterioles of juxtamedullary <b>nephrons,</b> the 15% of <b>nephrons</b> {{closest to}} the medulla, send {{straight}} capillary branches that deliver isotonic blood to the renal medulla. Along with the loop of Henle, these vasa recta {{play a crucial role}} in the establishment of the nephron's countercurrent exchange system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mesonephros}} acts as {{a structure}} similar to the kidney that, in humans, functions between the sixth and tenth weeks of embryological life. Despite the similarity in structure, function, and terminology, however, the mesonephric <b>nephrons</b> do not form {{any part of the}} mature kidney or <b>nephrons.</b>|$|R
40|$|Standard micropuncture and microdissection {{techniques}} {{were used to}} examine the function and structure of <b>nephrons</b> in rats whose kidneys were made cystic by dietary exposure to diphenylamine. Heterogeneity characterized the lesion, with dilation and frank cyst formation occurring in 5 - 30 % of <b>nephrons.</b> Elevated intraluminal hydrostatic pressures, occurring in the absence of increased glomerular filtration or decreased net water reabsorption, were recorded in dilated, but not in nondilated <b>nephrons.</b> Structural studies demonstrated communication of dilated <b>nephrons</b> with cysts, concretions of debris within tubular lumens, evidence of extrinsic pressure by cysts on adjacent tubules, and apparent luminal narrowing of some proximal tubules. These observations were used to explain prolonged loop of Henle transit times and occasional failure to detect [3 H]inulin excretion after microperfusion into dilated tubules. It was concluded that the elevated hydrostatic pressures in the dilated <b>nephrons</b> of diphenylamine-exposed kidneys were the consequence of variably severe and frequently incomplete tubular occlusion. These findings support the hypothesis that cyst formation is a consequence of partial obstruction and elevated intratubular pressure in this model and perhaps in other susceptible mammalian kidneys...|$|R
25|$|Spironolactone is used {{primarily}} to treat heart failure, edematous {{conditions such as}} nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, hypokalemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with hepatic cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal <b>nephron</b> (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, {{but it can be}} combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy.|$|E
25|$|In the kidney, {{blood is}} {{filtered}} into the lumen, or open space, of the <b>nephron</b> tubule. Whatever {{remains in the}} tubule will travel to the bladder as urine and eventually be excreted. The cells lining the tubule modify the fluid inside, absorbing some material and excreting others. One side of the cell (the apical side) faces the lumen; the opposite side (the basolateral side) faces the interstitial space near blood vessels. The other sides are tightly joined to neighboring cells.|$|E
25|$|Acting on {{the nuclear}} {{mineralocorticoid}} receptors (MR) within the principal cells of the distal tubule and the collecting duct of the kidney <b>nephron,</b> it upregulates and activates the basolateral Na+/K+ pumps, which pumps three sodium ions out of the cell, into the interstitial fluid and two potassium ions into the cell from the interstitial fluid. This creates a concentration gradient which results in reabsorption of sodium (Na+) ions and water (which follows sodium) into the blood, and secreting potassium (K+) ions into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).|$|E
40|$|Unilateral {{nephrectomy}} performed {{during the}} first days or weeks of life {{may or may not}} induce the development of new <b>nephrons</b> in the remaining kidney. Such an increase has been reported to occur, as discussed in this review, in newborn rats and mice, but not in guinea pigs. These observations are consistent with other data suggesting different patterns of compensatory adaptation in young and in old animals. In the present article, we review the evidence which supports our belief that unilateral nephrectomy, under certain conditions, induces the development of additional <b>nephrons</b> in the remaining hypertrophied kidney, so that the number of <b>nephrons</b> becomes greater in these kidneys than in control kidneys from intact animals of the same age. All investigators agree in the conclusion that, in adult animals, the number of <b>nephrons</b> does not increase after contralateral nephrectomy. There are, however, discrepancies concerning the possibility of the appearance of new <b>nephrons</b> after contralateral nephrectomy in young and growing animals. Some investigators, including ourselves, obtained experimental results which favor this possibility whereas others did not find any evidence of such a phenomenon...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{a number}} of other bird species which have the salt gland as the primary osmoregulatory organ, Columba livia does not use its salt gland. Columba livia uses the {{function}} of their kidneys to maintain homeostatic balance of ions such as sodium and potassium while preserving water quantity in the body. Filtration of the blood, reabsorption of ions and water, and secretion of uric acid are all components of the kidney's process. The kidneys of Columba livia are located in its pelvic region. Columba livia has two kidneys that are coupled, each having three partially separate lobes; the posterior lobe is the largest in size. Like mammalian kidneys, the avian kidney contains a medullary region and a cortical region. Peripherally located around the cortical region, the collecting ducts gather into cone-like ducts, medullary cones, which converge into the ureters. There are two types of <b>nephrons</b> in the kidney: <b>nephrons</b> that are located in the cortex and do not contain the loop of Henle are called loopless <b>nephrons,</b> the other type is called looped or mammalian <b>nephrons.</b> Looped <b>nephrons</b> contain the loop of Henle that continue down into the medulla then enter the distal tubule drain towards the ureter. Mammals generally have a more-vascularised glomeruli than the <b>nephrons</b> in birds. The <b>nephrons</b> of avian species can not produce urine that is hyperosmotic to the blood, but the loop of Henle utilises countercurrent multiplication which allows it to become hyperosmotic in the collecting duct. This alternation of permeability between different sections of the ascending and descending loop allows for urine osmotic pressure to be elevated 2.5 times above the blood osmotic pressure.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{parallel}} algorithm {{for solving}} the multinephron {{model of the}} renal inner medulla is developed. The intrinsic nature of this problem supplies sufficient symmetry for a high-level parallelism on distributed-memory parallel machines such as the iPSC/ 860, Paragon, and CM- 5. Parallelization makes it feasible to study interesting models such as the rat kidney with 30, 000 <b>nephrons.</b> On a high-end work station, one can study systems with 100 <b>nephrons,</b> while on a 32 -node iPSC/ 860 or Paragon we can handle more than 1000 <b>nephrons.</b> A nearly perfect speedup is achieved by even distribution of load and minimizing the cost of communication...|$|R
25|$|ADPKD, {{together}} {{with many other}} diseases that present with renal cysts, can be classified into a family of diseases known as ciliopathies. Epithelial cells of the renal tubules, including all the segments of the <b>nephron</b> and the collecting ducts (with the exception of intercalated cells) show {{the presence of a}} single primary apical cilium. Polycystin-1, the protein encoded by the PKD1 gene, is present on these cilia and is thought to sense the flow with its large extracellular domains, activating the calcium channels associated with polycystin-2, the product of gene PKD2, {{as a result of the}} genetic setting of ADPKD as explained in the genetics sub-section below.|$|E
25|$|The substance, or parenchyma, of {{the kidney}} {{is divided into}} two major {{structures}}: the outer renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. Grossly, these structures take the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. Between the renal pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns. Nephrons, the urine-producing functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a <b>nephron</b> is the renal corpuscle which is located in the cortex. This is followed by a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep into the medullary pyramids. Part of the renal cortex, a medullary ray is a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single collecting duct.|$|E
25|$|Targeted {{deletion}} of Dicer in the FoxD1-derived renal progenitor {{cells in}} a murine model {{resulted in a}} complex renal phenotype including expansion of <b>nephron</b> progenitors, fewer renin cells, smooth muscle arterioles, progressive mesangial loss and glomerular aneurysms. High throughput whole transcriptome profiling of the FoxD1-Dicer knockout mouse model revealed ectopic upregulation of pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2L11 (Bim) and dysregulation of the p53 pathway with increase in p53 effector genes including Bax, Trp53inp1, Jun, Cdkn1a, Mmp2, and Arid3a. p53 protein levels remained unchanged, suggesting that FoxD1 stromal miRNAs directly repress p53-effector genes. Using a lineage tracing approach followed by Fluorescent-activated cell sorting, miRNA profiling of the FoxD1-derived cells not only comprehensively defined the transcriptional landscape of miRNAs that are critical for vascular development, but also identified key miRNAs {{that are likely to}} modulate the renal phenotype in its absence. These miRNAs include miRs‐10a, 18a, 19b, 24, 30c, 92a, 106a, 130a, 152, 181a, 214, 222, 302a, 370, and 381 that regulate Bcl2L11 (Bim) and miRs‐15b, 18a, 21, 30c, 92a, 106a, 125b‐5p, 145, 214, 222, 296‐5p and 302a that regulate p53-effector genes. Consistent with the profiling results, ectopic apoptosis was observed in the cellular derivatives of the FoxD1 derived progenitor lineage and reiterates the importance of renal stromal miRNAs in cellular homeostasis.|$|E
