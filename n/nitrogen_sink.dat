40|$|Estuaries {{are often}} seen as natural filters of {{riverine}} nitrate, but knowledge of this <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> in oligotrophic systems is limited. We measured spring and summer dinitrogen production (denitrification, anammox) in muddy and non-permeable sandy sediments of an oligotrophic estuary in the northern Baltic Sea, to estimate its function in mitigating the riverine nitrate load. Both sediment types had similar denitrification rates, and no anammox was detected. In spring at high nitrate loading, denitrification was limited by likely low availability of labile organic carbon. In summer, the average denitrification rate was similar to 138 mu mol N m(- 2) d(- 1). The corresponding estuarine nitrogen removal for August was similar to 1. 2 t, of which similar to 93 % was removed by coupled nitrification-denitrification. Particulate matter in the estuary was mainly phytoplankton derived (> 70 % in surface waters) and likely based on the riverine nitrate which was not removed by direct denitrification due to water column stratification. Subsequently settling particles served as a link be tween the otherwise uncoupled nitrate in surface waters and benthic nitrogen removal. We suggest that the riverine nitrate brought into the oligotrophic estuary during the spring flood is gradually, and with a time delay, removed by benthic denitrification after being temporarily ` trapped' in phytoplankton particulate matter. The oligotrophic system {{is not likely to}} face eutrophication from increasing nitrogen loading due to phosphorus limitation. In response, coupled nitrification-denitrification rates are likely to stay constant, which might increase the future export of nitrate to the open sea and decrease the estuary's function as a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> relative to the load...|$|E
40|$|Most {{flowering}} plant seeds {{are composed of}} the embryo and endosperm surrounded by maternal tissue, in particular the seed coat. Whereas the embryo represents the dormant progeny, the endosperm is a terminal organ for storage of sugars and amino acids in proteins and carbohydrates, respectively. Produced in maternal leaves during photosynthesis, they are transported to developing seeds during flowering so that during germination they nourish early seedlings growth. Maize endosperm usually contains around 10 % protein and 70 % starch, and their composition ratio is rather stable, because it is strictly regulated through a pre-set genetic program, which is woven by networks of many interacting or counteracting genes and pathways. Protein, however, is lower in nutritional value mainly due to the high expression of the α-zein gene family encoding lysine-free proteins. Reduced levels {{of those in the}} opaque 2 (o 2) mutant and α-zein RNAi (RNA interference) transgenic seed is compensated by an increase of non-zein proteins, leading to the rebalancing of the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> and therefore producing constant levels of total proteins in the seed. The same rebalancing of zeins and non-zeins has been observed for maize seeds bred for 30 % protein. In contrast to the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink,</b> storage of sulfur is controlled through the accumulation of specialized sulfur-rich proteins in maize endosperm. However, silencing the synthesis of α-zeins through RNAi fails to raise sulfur-rich proteins. Although overexpression of the methionine-rich δ-zein can increase the methionine level in seeds, it occurs at least in part {{at the expense of the}} cysteine-rich β- and γ-zeins, demonstrating a balance between cysteine and methionine in sulfur storage. Therefore, we propose that the throttle for the flow of sulfur is placed before the synthesis of sulfur amino acids when sulfur is taken up and reduced during photosynthesis...|$|E

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} of denitrification in sediments with benthic microphytes was investigated by a 15 N isotope-pairing technique {{in order to}} distinguish between coupled nitrification-denitrification and deni-trification of nitrate supplied from the water column. Sediments were incubated in a continuous flow-through system and exposed to diurnal light and dark cycles. Illumination of both limnetic and estuarine sediments doubled the rate of coupled nitrification-denitrification but reduced the rate of denitrification of nitrate supplied from the water column by- 50 %. Photosynthesis in the uppermost sediment layers during illumination led to deeper oxygen penetration and a resultant stimulation of nitrification. This stimulation may explain the increased rate of coupled nitrification-denitrification during illumination. The rate of denitrification of nitrate supplied from the water column was reduced during illumination due to a longer diffusion path between water and the anoxic denitrification zone.

40|$|Nitrogen {{mobilization}} and {{the pattern}} of proteolytic enzymes were investigated in leaves and glumes of field-grown winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during maturation. Source/sink relations were changed by removal of the ear, the flag leaf or the lower leaves shortly after anthesis. Removal of the ear was most effective, resulting in delayed senescence of the flag leaf with the chlorophyll, aminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities remaining high {{in contrast to the}} control, whereas neutral endopeptidase activity increased more slowly. No major changes were observed in the second leaf from the top in plants with either ears or flag leaves removed. Nitrogen mobilization and proteolytic activities in glumes and the remaining leaves were influenced only slightly by leaf removal. In earless plants, nitrogen was transported from the second leaf into the leaf sheath and stem, but in the flag leaf the total reduced nitrogen remained high and free amino groups increased. The increase in endopeptidase activity was influenced by the source/sink relations. However, the accumulation of amino groups and the increasing endopeptidase activity in the flag leaf of earless plants suggest that the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> capacity did not greatly control protein degradation; {{it remains to be seen}} whether phytohormones, accumulated amino acids or other factors delayed the increase in endopeptidase activit...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 A {{mass balance}} for {{nitrogen}} {{was developed for}} the water column of Toolik Lake and the isotope tracers 15 N and 14 C were {{used to examine the}} phytoplankton ecology with respect to dissolved in organic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate). The nutrient budget showed an oligotrophic ecosystem with important flux terms few and small in magnitude. Nitrogen input was primarily from inflowing rivers and was dominated by the dissolved organic fraction. Ammonium release from sediment provided the only other major source of nitrogen to the lake water. Toolik acted as a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink,</b> trapping 18 % of the annual input. Retention was almost exclusively (98 %) as dissolved organic nitrogen. Tracer experiments suggested chronic nitrogen deficiency in the phytoplankton, but indigenous populations were well-adapted for utilizing characteristically low levels of nutrient. Phytoplankton showed a high affinity for both nitrate and ammonium as well as a lack of discrimination between the two forms of inorganic nutrient. The ambient concentration was the most important factor regulating uptake, with light and temperature of secondary importance. More than 66 % of the dissolved in organic nitrogen supporting phytoplankton productivity was derived from local recycling, with the remainder from sediment efflux and riverine input.

Since pollen cells are symplasmically isolated during maturation and germination, membrane transporters {{are required for}} nitrogen import across the pollen plasma membrane. This study describes the characterization of the ammonium transporter AtAMT 1; 4, a so far uncharacterized member of the Arabidopsis AMT 1 family, which is suggested {{to be involved in}} transporting ammonium into pollen. The AtAMT 1; 4 gene encodes a functional ammonium transporter when heterologously expressed in yeast or when overexpressed in Arabidopsis roots. Concentration-dependent analysis of 15 N-labeled ammonium influx into roots of AtAMT 1; 4 -transformed plants allowed characterization of AtAMT 1; 4 as a high-affinity transporter with a Km of 17 [*]μM. RNA and protein gel blot analysis showed expression of AtAMT 1; 4 in flowers, and promoter–gene fusions to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) further defined its exclusive expression in pollen grains and pollen tubes. The AtAMT 1; 4 protein appeared to be localized to the plasma membrane as indicated by protein gel blot analysis of plasma membrane-enriched membrane fractions and by visualization of GFP-tagged AtAMT 1; 4 protein in pollen grains and pollen tubes. However, no phenotype related to pollen function could be observed in a transposon-tagged line, in which AtAMT 1; 4 expression is disrupted.

Further evidence that vsp 94 is a lipoxygenase was obtained by demonstrating that vsp 94 cross-reacted with a lipoxygenase antibody. Also, a lipoxygenase cDNA coding region was able to detect changes in an mRNA that closely parallel changes in vsp 94 protein levels resulting from alteration of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sinks.</b> Extensive immunocytochemical data indicate that this vsp 94 /lipoxygenase is primarily expressed in the paraveinal mesophyll cells and is subcellularly localized in the vacuole.

40|$|Nitrogen cycling is an {{important}} aspect of forest ecosystem functioning. Pristine temperate rainforests have been shown to produce large amounts of bioavailable nitrogen, but despite high nitrogen turnover rates, loss of bioavailable nitrogen is minimal in these ecosystems. This tight nitrogen coupling is achieved through fierce competition for bioavailable nitrogen by abiotic processes, soil microbes and plant roots, all of which transfer bioavailable nitrogen to stable <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sinks,</b> such as soil organic matter and above-ground forest vegetation. Here, we use a combination of in situ 15 N isotope dilution and 15 N tracer techniques in volcanic soils of a temperate evergreen rainforest in southern Chile to further unravel retention mechanisms for bioavailable nitrogen. We find three processes that contribute significantly to nitrogen bioavailability in rainforest soils: heterotrophic nitrate production, nitrate turnover into ammonium and into a pool of dissolved organic nitrogen that is not prone to leaching loss, and finally, the decoupling of dissolved inorganic nitrogen turnover and leaching losses of dissolved organic nitrogen.

During base flow, mean total nitrogen concentrations at the inflow of final lakes were significantly related to relative upstream lake area, increasing from 34 to 103 μg N L- 1 as upstream lake cover in the watersheds increased from 0 % to 4 %. Forest cover was not significantly correlated with total nitrogen concentrations exported from the watersheds. However, similar to other studies, inflow nitrate concentrations were negatively correlated with relative forest cover.

A population of 146 recombinant inbred barley lines (F 8 and F 9 plants, grown in 2000 and 2001), derived from a cross between two varieties differing markedly in grain protein concentration, was used to compare the location of QTL associated with nitrogen uptake, storage and remobilization in ¯ag leaves relative to QTL controlling developmental parameters and grain protein accumulation. Overlaps of support intervals for such QTL were found on several chromosomes, with chromosomes 3 and 6 being especially important. For QTL on these chromosomes, alleles associated with inef®cient N remobilization were associated with depressed yield and higher levels of total or soluble organic nitrogen during grain ®lling and vice versa; therefore, genes directly involved in N recycling or genes regulating N recycling may be located on these chromosomes. Interestingly, the most prominent QTL for grain protein concentration (on chromosome 6) did not co-localize with QTL for nitrogen remobilization. However, QTL peaks for nitrate and soluble organic nitrogen were detected at this locus for plants grown in 2001 (but not in 2000).

However, the effects of severe, stand-replacing wildfires are poorly understood. We studied inorganic nitrogen pools and mineralization rates after stand-replacing wildfires in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming. After fires that burned in summer 2000, soil ammonium concentration peaked in 2001 (33 mg NH 4 -N· kgsoil− 1); soil nitrate increased subsequently (2. 7 mg NO 3 -N·kgsoil− 1 in 2003) but was still low. However, annual net ammonification rates were largely negative from 2001 to 2004, indicating ammonium depletion. Thus, although net nitrification rates were positive, annual net nitrogen mineralization (net ammonification plus net nitrification) remained low. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased from 0. 25 to 1. 6 Mg·ha− 1 ·yr− 1 from 2001 to 2004, but variation in ANPP among stands was not related to net nitrogen mineralization rates. Across a broader temporal gradient (stand age zero to > 250 yr), negative rates of net annual ammonification were especially pronounced in the first postfire year. Laboratory incubations using 15 N isotope pool dilution revealed that gross production of ammonium was reduced and ammonium consumption greatly exceeded gross production during the initial postfire years. Our results suggest a microbial <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> for several years after severe, stand-replacing fire, confirming earlier hypotheses about postdisturbance succession and nutrient cycling in cold, fire-dominated coniferous forests.

The model explores different parameterizations of organic matter sinking speed, oxidant affinity of oxic and suboxic remineralization, and regulation of nitrogen fixation by temperature and different stoichiometric ratios. Examination of the initial transient behavior of different model setups initialized from observed biogeochemical tracer distributions reveal changes in simulated nitrogen inventories and fluxes particularly during the first centuries. Millennial timescales have to be resolved in order to bring all biogeochemical and physical processes into a dynamically consistent steady state. Analysis of global properties suggests that not only particularly particle sinking speed but also the parameterization of denitrification determine the extent of oxygen minimum zones, global nitrogen fluxes, and hence the oceanic nitrogen inventory. However, the ways and directions in which different parameterizations of particle <b>sinking,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> fixation, and denitrification affect the global diagnostics are different suggesting that these may, in principle, be constrained independently from each other. Analysis of the model misfit with respect to observed biogeochemical tracer distributions and fluxes suggests a particle flux profile close to the one suggested by Martin et al. (1987). Simulated pelagic denitrification best agrees with the lower values between 59 and 84 Tg N yr − 1 recently estimated by other authors...|$|R
40|$|Conference oral presentationConstructed {{wetlands}} (CW) act as <b>nitrogen</b> (N) <b>sinks</b> and reactors facilitating {{a number}} of physical, chemical and biological processes. The N removal efficiency of through-flowing water in such systems when used to treat municipal wastewater is variable. Their overall removal efficiencies do not specifically explain which N species have been removed by physical attenuation, and by biological assimilation or transformation to other forms. A wider understanding of how N removal occurs would help elucidate how losses of N and associated gases from CW impact on water and air quality. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the C and N cycling processes in the porewater of soils immediately adjacent, up-gradient and down- gradient to helophyte —vegetated CW cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} for limiting amounts of ammonium between the chemolithotrophic ammonium-oxidizing species Nitrosomonas europaea, the heterotrophic species Arthrobacter globiformis and roots of Plantago lanceolata (Ribwort plantain) was studied {{in a series}} of model systems of increasing complexity, i. e. energy-limited continuous cultures, non-water-saturated continuously percolated soil columns and pots with gamma- sterilized soil planted with axenic P. lanceolata seedlings. The effects of bacterial grazing by the flagellate species Adriamonas peritocrescens on the {{competition for}} ammonium were also investigated in the three model systems. It was found that N. europaea was a weaker competitor for ammonium than either A. globiformis or plant roots of P. lanceolata. It is assumed that the heterotrophic bacteria have a higher affinity for ammonium than the nitrifying bacteria, whereas growing plant roots have a greater capacity to exploit the soil for ammonium than the immobile nitrifying bacteria. It is not very likely that allelochemicals were involved in suppressing the nitrification process. Four reasons are given for this assumption. Presence of the flagellates strongly stimulated the potential nitrification rate in all model systems. It is assumed that there is a more even distribution over the soil of either nitrifying bacteria or their substrate ammonium in the presence of flagellates. In addition to the distribution effect, there is a stimulation of the potential ammonium oxidation rate. The results are discussed {{in the light of the}} function of nitrate as <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.

40|$|Eutrophication {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} threats for the Baltic Sea, and one of its more critical consequences is bottom water hypoxia. Nutrient enrichment and oxygen-depletion affect both the deep central basins and a number of coastal areas, even though strategies for nutrient reduction have lately been implemented. In order to better understand why those threats are expanding and formulate more effective remediation strategies two main achievements are needed: (1) new data on benthic nutrient dynamics should be available in order to develop updated budgets for sensitive Baltic areas; (2) the main transformation processes and their regulation mechanisms (i. e. oxygen availability, presence of macrofauna, different organic loading scenarios) should be better constrained. Paper I was able to demonstrate that re-oxygenation of previously anoxic sediment has a positive effect on the ecosystem because of better retention of nutrients and efficient conversion of fixed nitrogen to nitrogen gas. Sediment colonization by the invasive genus Marenzelleria counteracts some of the positive aspects provided by benthic oxygenation (in particular, nutrient retention, N 2 loss). A possible explanation for this reversal can be that Marenzelleria does stimulate anaerobic more that aerobic metabolism. Results from Paper II suggest that at the outermost stations of Himmerfjärden denitrification follows a pronounced seasonal pattern, primarily regulated by bottom water temperatures. At the innermost and impacted site oxygen level in the bottom water varies considerably during the year and causes denitrification/DNRA predominance to be the main nitrate reduction pathway. On an annual scale, the net amount of lost N 2 is comparable at the four sampling sites and accounts for 96 % of the total DIN discharged from the sewage treatment plant, suggesting that denitrification in the estuarine sediment acts as a major <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> for external N inputs...|$|E
40|$|Two small (0. 22 and 0. 48 ha) alpine {{watersheds}} in the Sierra Nevada of California {{were studied}} during the 1992 and 1993 snowmelt seasons {{to evaluate the}} importance of soil properties and processes on chemical concentrations in- the discharges from each watershed. Watershed 1 was surveyed as having 26 % soil cover, whereas watershed 2 was 10 % soil covered. Watershed 2 had greater H + and nitrogen consumption than watershed 1 but similar cation and sulfate concentrations despite having one fourth the surveyed soil volume per unit area as watershed 1. Daily stream concentrations simulated with the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM) matched the data well, after a systematic model calibration with {{a subset of the}} data. We found that the structure of the AHM and the hydrologic parameters developed for the nearby 1. 2 km 2 Emerald Lake watershed could be applied to these watersheds with only small adjustments; chemical parameters required considerably more adjustment, reflecting a greater degree of chemical versus physical heterogeneity at this scale. Calibration for watershed 2 gave a higher percent base saturation (19 versus 4 %) and lower stream P(CO 2) (10 - 3. 1 versus 10 - 2. 6 atm) than for watershed 1 and three times the soil reactivity (expected) of a field survey. Areas mapped as exposed bedrock in the catchments apparently contributed cations and alkalinity to stream water {{to a greater extent than}} did neighboring areas of soil. Areas of exposed bedrock were a larger <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sink</b> than the adjoining areas of soil. The pH and acid-neutralizing capacity of surface runoff in both catchments were less sensitive to changes in atmospheric deposition than at the nearby Emerald Lake watershed. This decreased sensitivity was due to (1) a less pronounced ionic pulse, (2) less retention of sulfate in the soil, and (3) greater nitrate retention...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of in-situ push pull tests and a flow through reactor trial {{were used to}} quantify the inorganic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sinks</b> in the permeable carbonate sands of a tropical coral cay (Heron Island – Great Barrier Reef). Addition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN {{in the form of}} nitrate – NO 3 −, and ammonium – NH 4 +) directly into sediment porewater resulted in uptake of up to 97 % and 60 % of added DIN respectively. The initial push pull experiment qualitatively showed that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA), denitrification and nitrification were all active in the sediments. A flow through reactor experiment provided a more detailed approach to quantify these processes and showed that both denitrification and DNRA occurred within the sands at rates of 7. 3 and 5. 5 µmol N cm− 3 d− 1, respectively. Unexpectedly the addition of labile organic material (fresh coral spawn) to the permeable sands did not result in the release of DIN from the reactors, on the contrary it resulted in the increased uptake of bothNO 3 − andNH 4 +. This was most likely because of the stimulated N uptake associated with the addition of high C:N coral spawn material. The bulk ofNH 4 + produced via DNRA was found to be adsorbed to sediments within the reactor and was not released with the outlet water. A mass balance over the entire experimental period showed that more inorganic N was retained within the sediments than lost as gaseous products. Our results point to permeable carbonate sands acting as reservoirs of N under the influence of advective flow, even during sudden enrichment periods such as those following coral mass spawning. This implies that permeable carbonate sands may help to buffer coral reefs during periods of extreme oligotrophy...|$|R
40|$|Much of the Bangalore sewage {{is treated}} in three streams namely Bellandur (K&C Valley), Vrishabhavati and Hebbal-Nagavara stream systems. Among these it is {{estimated}} that {{out of a total of}} about 500 MLD of partially treated sewage is let into the Bellandur tank. We estimate that a total of about 77 t N non-industrial anthropogenic nitrogen efflux (mainly urine and excreta) in Bangalore city. This is distributed between that handled by the three sewage streams, soak-pits and land deposition. About 17 - 24. 5 t N enters the Bellandur tank daily. This has been happening over few decades and our observations suggest that this approximately 380 ha tank is functioning as a C and N removal system with reasonable efficiency. The ammoniacal and nitrate nitrogen content of the water at the discharge points were estimated and found that over 80 % of the nitrogen influx and over 75 % of the C influx is removed by this tank system. We observed that there are three <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sinks</b> namely bacterial, micro-algal and macrophytes. The micro-algal fraction is dominated by Microcystis and Euglenophyceae members and they appear to constitute a significant fraction. Water hyacinth represents the single largest representative of the macrophytes. This tank has been functioning in this manner for over three decades. We attempt to study this phenomenon from a material balance approach and show that it is functioning with a reasonable degree of satisfaction as a natural wetland. As the population served and concomitant influx into this wetland increases, there is a potential for the system to be overloaded and to collapse. Therefore a better understanding of its function and the need for maintenance is discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate-nitrogen is a {{pollutant}} {{that threatens}} ecosystem and human health. Floodplains are critical habitats that support elevated nitrogen retention, particularly denitrification. Restoring hydrologic connectivity can enhance denitrification {{and the overall}} ecological condition of nitrogen-polluted stream and river ecosystems, including {{but not limited to}} the Willamette River floodplain. Identifying and connecting biogeochemical hot spots hydrologically can create large <b>nitrogen</b> <b>sinks</b> because denitrification increases when flooding connects river and the floodplain. Previous research shows that geomorphic structures and habitats, such as floodplain water-bodies (Forshay and Stanley 2005) and inchannel macrophyte beds (Forshay 2007), are capable of supporting elevated denitrification rates due to elevated organic carbon. Identifying geomorphic structures and improving connectivity with these hotspots should be a goal of restoration in nitrogen-polluted systems. Research Objectives For the Willamette Ecosystem Services Project, the research objectives are to: • Identify floodplain habitats that enhance nitrogen-retention ecosystem services through denitrification and quantify nitrogen retention • Assess biogeochemical benefits of restoring floodplains • Develop ecological guidelines for stream and river floodplain restoration Proposed Approach The Willamette River floodplain contains diverse habitats and land use that includes agriculture, forests, and ongoing restoration to reconnect the floodplain to the river hydrologically. These factors are likely to have diverse effects on the patterns and drivers of biogeochemical nitrogen processing. To determine the pattern and drivers of nitrogen retention and denitrification in the floodplains and ultimately in the riparian corridors of the Willamette, researchers measure denitrification in habitats common to the Willamette floodplain that can potentially be promoted to improve and enhance naturally occurring nitrogen-retention ecosystem services.
