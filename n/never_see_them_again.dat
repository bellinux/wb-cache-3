25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{left the}} Pine Ridge Reservation to attend Carlisle. His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|Captain James Hingston Tuckey {{visited in}} 1816. He {{said that the}} local people thought the falls were the {{residence}} of an evil spirit, and that anyone who saw them would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Visiting in the dry season, he was disappointed by the falls. He described the site as comprising a large hill of syenite, a course-grained igneous rock, on the south side. The northern side, made of the same material, was not as high, but steeper than the south. He described the river as having forced its course and within {{the middle of the}} river an island of slate [...] "still defies its power, and breaks the current into two narrow channels; that near the south side gives vent to a great mass of water, over which the torrent rushes with great fury and noise, as may easily be conceived".|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, 1891, Martí's essay [...] "Nuestra America" [...] was {{published}} in New York's Revista Ilustrada, and on the 30th of that month in Mexico's El Partido Liberal. He actively participated in the Conferencia Monetaria Internacional (The International Monetary Conference) in New York during that time as well. On June 30 {{his wife and son}} arrived in New York. After a short time, in which Carmen Zayas Bazán realized that Martí's dedication to Cuban independence surpassed that of supporting his family, she returned to Havana with her son on August 27. Martí would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> The fact that his wife never shared the convictions central to his life was an enormous personal tragedy for Martí. He turned for solace to Carmen Miyares de Mantilla, a Venezuelan who ran a boarding house in New York, and he is presumed to be the father of her daughter María Mantilla, who was in turn the mother of the actor Cesar Romero, who proudly claimed to be Martí's grandson. In September Martí became sick again. He intervened in the commemorative acts of The Independents, causing the Spanish consul in New York to complain to the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. Consequently, Martí resigned from the Argentinean, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan consulates. In October he published his book Versos Sencillos.|$|E
50|$|Later on, Major Major Major Major begins signing {{those names}} to {{official}} documents, after he discovers {{that when he}} does, he <b>never</b> <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Before they would always return with more attached documents to deal with.|$|R
50|$|Alejandra's aunt frees Cole and Rawlins, on the {{condition}} that she <b>never</b> <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> While Rawlins returns to his parents' ranch in Texas, Cole attempts to reunite with Alejandra over her family's objections. Her aunt is confident that Alejandra will keep her word and not get back together with Cole - so much so that she even gives Cole her niece's phone number. Cole urges Alejandra to come to Texas with him. She, however, decides she must keep her word and though she loves him, she will not go with him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a silent}} kitchen after that, though the lamp burned long in Jess's window. By its meagre light you {{may take a}} final glance at the little family; you will <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> {{together}} <b>again.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Luther was {{a school}} {{recruiter}} for Captain Richard Henry Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He was sincere in his desire to show what we had learned, and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills. [...] However, many children died in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. [...] Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. It was not the negligence of Captain Pratt, but rather lax Indian agents who would set aside letters from Carlisle until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Luther got mixed reception home on the reservation. Some were proud of his achievements while others lamented that he had, in effect, become a white man. He was happy to be home and some of his relatives aid that he “looked like a white boy dressed in eastern clothes.” Luther felt proud to be compared to a white boy. But others would not shake his hand because some returning Carlisle students were ashamed of their culture, and a few even tried to pretend that they did not speak Lakota. The difficulties of returning Carlisle students disturbed white educators. Returning Carlisle students found themselves stranded between two cultures, and not accepted by either. Some rejected their educational experiences and “returned to the blanket”, casting off white ways. Others found it more convenient and satisfying to remain in white society. Most were able to adjust at least partially to both worlds.|$|E
60|$|My only desire {{was to get}} out of {{the house}} and <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's coming now!" [...] shouted old Benson suddenly. [...] "Hold fast to your hats, boys, or you'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> And {{sit down}} on the traps!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Being unreported puts {{a person}} at {{a higher risk of}} {{exploitation}} than a person who is reported missing. There are many different outcomes or ways in which a person can be lost or [...] "off the grid". These outcomes include situations like being mentally ill and lost among the homeless. When this happens, a person could very well be mentally ill or have a drug problem, go into the streets, cannot be reported missing by their family because they have a history of disappearing and then be the victim of murder or human trafficking. The family <b>never</b> <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> and even if their body is found, the police have no way of tracking the person to their family as they are not listed in any formal missing database.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, {{he told a}} {{reporter}} of the British political weekly New Statesman, regarding the way the CIA deals with terrorism suspects, [...] "If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If {{you want them to}} be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear - <b>never</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> - you send them to Egypt." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to a 2013 {{report by}} the Open Society Foundation, Syria {{was one of the}} [...] "most common {{destinations}} for rendered suspects" [...] under the program. Former CIA agent Robert Baer described the policy to the New Statesman: [...] "If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want someone to disappear - <b>never</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> - you send them to Egypt".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but it isn't much," [...] came in {{a rather}} hopeless tone from Ben. [...] "I'm afraid they've got away and we'll <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> or the miniatures either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{argue the}} point," [...] {{returned}} our hero, briefly. He was disgusted with both Merwell and Haskers, and he wished they might both {{go away and}} that he would <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|His manner {{made our}} hero {{feel that the}} papers would not be safe in his hands. If he gave them up he might <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> and without the {{documents}} the claim on the land in California would fall flat.|$|E
5000|$|In 1863, only a {{few years}} after his wife's death, Kelley took his two {{youngest}} children, the eight-year-old Delia Josephine and six-year-old Honora, to the Boston Female Asylum, an orphanage for indigent female children founded in 1799 by Mrs. Hannah Stillman. Kelley surrendered the two young girls, <b>never</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Documents from the asylum note that the two girls were [...] "rescued from a very miserable home".|$|R
5000|$|Thousands of {{refugees}} began to flee across the Eastern Bloc. Many {{ended up in}} the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and across the Eastern Bloc. Thousands more left for Australia, the United States and Canada. [...] This process separated many families permanently with brothers and sisters often separated from each other. It was common for mothers to lose contact with their children and <b>never</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> The most visible effect of the Civil War was the mass emigration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak to {{whom you}} will," [...] he replied, and I {{noted that the}} {{throbbing}} vein upon his forehead indicated a rising temper. [...] "But <b>never</b> let me <b>see</b> those diamonds <b>again.</b> Throw <b>them</b> into the gutter if you wish, but <b>never</b> let me <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> or there will be trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{there they}} go--orf! And we <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again!</b> And {{so it goes}} on! So it goes on! We don't know nobody and we shan't know anybody! And you won't put {{yourself}} out not a little bit, or take the trouble to find out anything 'ow {{it ought to be}} done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here they are, all of them,' she cried; 'they {{belong to}} you. Let me <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> but I {{have learned the}} lesson that they taught me. Others may have riches, beauty and wit, but as for me I desire nothing but to be the poor peasant girl I always was, working hard for those she loves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, my child," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "and {{enable you}} to be an affectionate and dutiful wife to your husband." [...] Then Linda went forth from the room and from the house, and as she went she cast her eyes around, {{thinking}} {{that it might be}} possible that she should <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} a Pied Piper of London Town who steals them all away. They disappear. One <b>never</b> <b>sees</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> or {{anything}} that suggests them. You may look for them in vain amongst the generation of grown-ups. Here you will find stunted forms, ugly faces, and blunt and stolid minds. Grace, beauty, imagination, all the resiliency of mind and muscle, are gone. Sometimes, however, you may see a woman, not necessarily old, but twisted and deformed out of all womanhood, bloated and drunken, lift her draggled skirts and execute a few grotesque and lumbering steps upon the pavement. It is a hint that she was once one of those children who danced to the organ-grinder. Those grotesque and lumbering steps are {{all that is left}} of the promise of childhood. In the befogged recesses of her brain has arisen a fleeting memory that she was once a girl. The crowd closes in. Little girls are dancing beside her, about her, with all the pretty graces she dimly recollects, but can no more than parody with her body. Then she pants for breath, exhausted, and stumbles out through the circle. But the little girls dance on.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, word {{reaches the}} family that Aaron has gone missing and sends search parties out to find him. Reuven, Leah, and his sisters assume the worst- that he and Zlateh have frozen to death {{and that they will}} <b>never</b> <b>see</b> either of <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{house is}} quite {{cluttered}} up with pictures," [...] Lord Badgery complained. [...] "I {{had a whole}} wagon-load taken away to the country last week; {{but there are still}} far too many. My ancestors would have their portraits painted by Romney. Such a shocking artist, don't you think? Why couldn't they have chosen Gainsborough, or even Reynolds? I've had all the Romneys hung in the servants' hall now. It's such a comfort to know that one can <b>never</b> possibly <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> I suppose you know all about the ancient Hittites?" ...|$|R
60|$|All day we tramped, {{absorbing}} {{everything that}} went on in the open. Having explored the park, viewed the obelisk and visited the zoo, we wandered up and down Broadway, mooning upon the life of the streets. Curbstone fights, police manoeuvres, shop-window comedies, building operations--everything we saw instructed us. We soaked ourselves in the turbulent rivers of the town with a feeling that we should <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{thought of}} his parents and his sister, who were {{probably}} going farther away from him each moment, grieving quite as much, if not more, because of his absence than he did himself; and {{when he realized that}} he might <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> the tears would roll from beneath his eyelids. But he brushed them away very quickly, as if ashamed to have his companions see them, honest though they were.|$|E
6000|$|He strolls {{about and}} about, {{to pass the}} time until the dinner-hour. It somehow happens that Cloisterham seems reproachful to him to-day; has fault to find with him, as if he had not used it well; but is far more pensive with him than angry. His wonted {{carelessness}} is replaced by a wistful looking at, and dwelling upon, all the old landmarks. He will soon be far away, and may <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> he thinks. Poor youth! Poor youth! ...|$|E
60|$|The ex-king {{bowed and}} issued some orders, in {{obedience}} {{to which the}} sullen priests fell back murmuring. Then they all passed the gates, crossed the courtyard, and presently stood in the torch-lit throne-room, where Juanna had slept on the previous night. Here food had been prepared for them by Soa, who looked at them curiously, especially at Leonard and Francisco, as though, indeed, she had <b>never</b> expected to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|So Peter {{waited for}} a dark night, not too dark, you know, but a night {{when there was no}} moon to make great patches of light, but only the kindly little Stars looking down and {{twinkling}} in the friendly way they have. At last there was just such a night. All the afternoon little Miss Fuzzytail went about in the Old Pasture saying good-by to her friends and visiting each one of her favorite little paths and hiding-places, and I suspect that in each one she dropped a tear or two, for you see she felt sure that she <b>never</b> would <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again,</b> although Peter had promised that he would bring her back to the Old Pasture for a visit whenever she wanted to come.|$|R
6000|$|Nurse Joan {{had fought}} their battles, {{but with the}} sore heart of one who was parting with her darlings <b>never</b> to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> She bade <b>them</b> doff their suits of {{mourning}} that she might make up their fardels, as they would travel in their Lincoln-green suits. To take these she repaired to the little rough shed-like chamber where the two brothers lay {{for the last time}} on their pallet bed, awake, and watching for her, with Spring at their feet. The poor old woman stood over them, as over the motherless nurslings whom she had tended, and she should probably <b>never</b> <b>see</b> more, but she was a woman of shrewd sense, and perceived that [...] "with the new madam in the hall" [...] it was better that they should be gone before worse ensued.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a strange}} mixture. Here are {{many of the best}} blood in France, {{together}} with deputies, advocates, and writers. We may talk together as much as we like, and sometimes even a joke and a laugh are heard. Every day some names are called out, and these go and we <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Do not fret about me, my dear sisters, we are all in God's hands. If it is his will, we shall be saved; if not, we must face bravely whatever comes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, this is {{my second}} journey. I hope I shall come no more. We get a little extra pay and are better fed than we are with the regiment, {{and we have no}} drill; but then it is sad. Last time I had one with me who had left his wife and family behind; he was always sad, he talked to me {{sometimes}} of them, {{there was no one else}} to talk to. He was here for life, and he knew he should <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> She was young and would marry again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's so detestable in this country," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "is the blue--always {{blue sky}} and blue sea. It's like a curtain--all the things one wants are {{on the other side}} of that. I want to know what's going on behind it. I hate these divisions, don't you, Terence? One person all in the dark about another person. Now I liked the Dalloways," [...] she continued, [...] "and they're gone. I shall <b>never</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Just by going on a ship we cut {{ourselves}} off entirely from the rest of the world. I want to see England there--London there--all sorts of people--why shouldn't one? why should one be shut up all by oneself in a room?" ...|$|E
60|$|The day was delightful, {{the park}} {{extensive}} and picturesque, the Ambassadress sparkling with anecdote, and occasionally, {{in a low}} voice, breathing a diplomatic hint to Lord Monmouth, who bowed his graceful consciousness of her distinguished confidence. Coningsby occasionally took advantage {{of one of those}} moments, when the conversation ceased to be general, to address Lucretia, who replied in calm, fine smiles, and in affable monosyllables. She indeed generally succeeded in conveying an impression to those she addressed, that she had <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> before, did not care to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now, and <b>never</b> wished to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> And all this, too, with an air of great courtesy.|$|R
50|$|Offered {{the choice}} of being {{admitted}} to the detox unit, Payton said, “I'd rather drink and die.” Following her brief hospitalization, she was driven by a county social worker to her parents’ home in San Diego. She told her family's neighbor, “I {{never wanted to be}} with them, I <b>never</b> wanted to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> But here I am, and I got all the booze I want.” Her father, Flip Redfield, and her mother, Mabel, were both heavy drinkers, and engaged with Payton in unabated drinking binges.|$|R
60|$|I {{had cried}} half the night, and {{when in the}} morning little Nan wanted to hear about my ball, I only {{answered}} that I hated the thought of it. I {{was going to be}} married to a hideous old man, and be carried to France, and should <b>never</b> <b>see</b> any of <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> I made Nan cry too, and we both came down to breakfast with such mournful faces that my mother chid me sharply for making myself such a fright.|$|R
