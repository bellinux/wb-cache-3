50|$|Demand {{for labor}} is an {{important}} reason for migration. Despite the difficulty in researching immigrant populations, {{there is evidence that}} occupational health is an area in which immigrants face disparities. Many migrant or foreign-born workers fill low-wage, temporary or seasonal work in industries and jobs that may pose greater risks for worker health and safety such as agriculture, construction and services. In the United States, agriculture sector occupational risks such as asthma are more likely to affect immigrant workers. Overall, immigrants have higher rates of occupational morbidity and mortality than those who are native born, including higher rates of fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury.</b> Evidence from Southern Europe points to higher rates of occupational risks such as working many hours per day and extreme temperatures and greater exposure to poor employment conditions and job precariousness. Health prevention and training programs related to occupational safety and health may not reach immigrants due to language, cultural and/or economic barriers. An emerging occupational health issue for immigrants relates to the health risks faced by people who are trafficked into situations of forced labor and debt bondage.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Construction {{workers are}} {{frequently}} exposed to {{various types of}} injury-inducing hazards. A number of injury prevention interventions have been proposed, yet {{the effectiveness of these}} is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing injuries among workers at construction sites. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, OSH-ROM (including NIOSHTIC and HSELINE), EI Compendex. The reference lists of relevant papers, reviews and websites were also searched. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. All databases were searched up to June 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series of all types of interventions for preventing fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> among workers at construction sites. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. For interrupted time series, we reanalysed the studies and used an initial effect, measured as the change in injury-rate in the year after the intervention, as well as a sustained effect, measured as the change in time trend before and after the intervention. MAIN RESULTS: Five interrupted time series studies met the inclusion criteria. Three studies evaluated the effect of regulations, one evaluated a safety campaign, and one a drug-free workplace program on fatal or <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> compared to no drug-free workplace program. The overall methodological quality was low. The regulatory interventions did not show either an initial or sustained effect on fatal or <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries,</b> with effect sizes of 0. 69 (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 1. 70 to 3. 09) and 0. 28 (95 % CI 0. 05 to 0. 51). The safety campaign did have an initial and sustained effect, reducing <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> with effect sizes of - 1. 82 (95 % CI - 2. 90 to - 0. 75) and - 1. 30 (95 % CI - 1. 79 to - 0. 80) respectively. The drug-free workplace program did have an initial and sustained effect, reducing <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> compared to no intervention, with effect sizes of - 6. 74 (95 % CI - 10. 02 to - 3. 54) and - 1. 76 (95 % CI - 3. 11 to - 0. 41) respectively. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of technical, human factors and organisational interventions which are recommended by standard texts of safety, consultants and safety courses, have not been adequately evaluated. There is no evidence that regulations for reducing fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> are effective. There is limited evidence that a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug program can reduce <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> in the construction industr...|$|R

50|$|Hedonic damages, {{the loss}} of the value of life, are allowed in almost every state in a <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> case. Based on William Daubert et al. v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and other {{admissibility}} tests, many but not all jurisdictions allow economic expert witness testimony on hedonic damages. For example, the Nevada Supreme Court unanimously approved of such testimony in Banks v. Sunrise Hospital, 120 Nev. 822, 102 P.3d 52 (2004). Similarly, the 4th Appellate District in Ohio allowed such testimony based on Daubert in Lewis v. Alfa Leval,128 Ohio App.3d.200 (1998). The Court of appeals in the Lewis case held that the trial judge properly ruled that the testimony met the Daubert Standards, and that it was within the discretion of the trial court to have admitted hedonic damages testimony. The measurement of hedonic damages is based on some 40 years of extensive, well-accepted, peer-reviewed, economic research on the value of a statistical life (VSL). This measurement is controversial among forensic economists. The Value of Statistical Life literature is accepted by most forensic economists, including those economists few who oppose the admission of hedonic damages testimony. Many courts nationwide have allowed such testimony but judges have significant discretion as to its admissibility. Economists generally agree that the VSL is in the $4 million to $5 million range. This value is an average of many published results based on economic research using the Willingness-to-Pay model(WTP). Hedonic damages are not allowed in death cases in the great majority of the states. Some states do allow recovery in wrongful death cases, including New Hampshire, New Mexico, Georgia, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, and in Federal Section 1983 civil rights violation actions.|$|E
40|$|Background/aims: This paper {{focuses on}} the methods used to develop {{indicators}} for "all injury" incidence for the New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS), launched in June 2003. Existing and previously proposed New Zealand national <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> indicators exhibited threats to validity. Population/setting: The total population of New Zealand. Methods: The authors proposed fatal and new <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> indicators for "all injury" based on national mortality and hospitalizations data. All of the candidate indicators were subjected to a systematic assessment of validity, using the International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) criteria. Based {{on the results of}} that validation, the authors identified four proposed NZIPS indicators. Results: The proposed "all injury" indicators were as follows: age standardized injury mortality rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; number of injury deaths; age standardized serious <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rate per 100 000 person-years at risk; and number of cases of serious <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury.</b> The authors identified no threat-to-validity when assessed against the ICE criteria. The estimated numbers and rates of serious <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> increased over the period, in contrast to the numbers and rates of fatal injury. Conclusion: The authors have proposed serious <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> indicators that they judge suffer substantially less bias than traditional <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> indicators. This approach to indicator development is consistent with the view that before newly proposed indicators are promulgated, they should be subjected to formal validation. The authors are encouraged that the New Zealand Government has accepted these arguments and proposed indicators, and are starting to act on some of their recommendations, including the development of complementary indicators...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In England, {{there is}} no {{reliable}} indicator for measuring the occurrence of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury.</b> As a consequence, {{we do not know}} whether the rates of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> are increasing or decreasing. Purpose This paper addresses two questions: what criteria should an indicator of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> satisfy, and can we identify an indicator that satisfies these criteria? Method Criteria for a good indicator of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> are postulated, and an indicator based on serious long-bone fractures is proposed. Inferences from the literature and the various <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> data to which we have access are used to justify the criteria, and to test the proposed indicator of serious injury against the criteria. Findings There is significant evidence to justify the use of the following criteria to assess indicators of non-fatal injury: the indicator should reflect the occurrence of injury satisfying some case definition of anatomical damage; the injury cases ascertained should be important in terms of incapacity, impairment, disability, quality of life, cost, and/or threat-to-life; cases should be completely ascertained from routinely or easily collected data; and the probability of a case being ascertained should be independent of social, health services supply and access factors. Our analysis indicates that an indicator based on serious long-bone fracture admitted to hospital is likely to satisfy each of these criteria for a good indicator. Conclusion An indicator of <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> occurrence based on serious long-bone fractures exhibits favourable characteristics when judged against our criteria for a good indicator...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{construction}} industry {{is one of}} the employment sectors with the highest risk of injuries. Aims To evaluate the injury trend in the {{construction industry}} from data published from 1987 to 2010. Methods All papers with at least two measurements of injuries within a medium- to long-term period were included. The numbers of fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> were examined in two separate groups: 100   000 workers per year and 200   000 worked hours per year. Results All injuries significantly decreased between the first and the second measurement, with fatal injuries decreasing by 35 % and non-fatal ones by 33 % in workers/year and by 22 % in worked hours/year. There was high heterogeneity among the sources of data for workers/year index (I 2 = 49 % for fatal injuries, 99 % for <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries)</b> but no heterogeneity for worked hours/year index (I 2 = 0). Meta-regression analysis showed a significant linear relationship between time and risk reduction for fatal injuries (r = 0. 63; P < 0. 001; a 6 % reduction per year); trend reduction for <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> was not related to the time taken between the measurements.

Methods A cross-sectional study and time trend analysis using data on fire casualties in England between 1995 and 2004 {{obtained from the}} Department for Communities and Local Government. Injury rates were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated to compare changes in deprivation gradients over time. Results There were significant reductions in fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> fire <b>injuries</b> in children (fatal injuries IRR χ 21 = 11. 18, P < 0. 001; <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> IRR χ 22 = 61. 44, P < 0. 001), adults (fatal injuries IRR χ 21 = 15. 99, P < 0. 001; <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> IRR χ 22 = 183. 25, P < 0. 001) and older people (fatal injuries IRR χ 21 = 56. 88, P < 0. 001; <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> IRR χ 22 = 54. 09, P < 0. 001) between 1995 and 2004. Adult and child fire deaths were most commonly caused by smokers' materials (e. g. cigarettes, cigars and tobacco), and cigarette lighters and matches, respectively. Cooking appliances caused most <b>non-fatal</b> fire <b>injuries.</b> Injury rates increased with increasing levels of deprivation and deprivation gradients did not change over 10 years.

40|$|Objectives: The {{occupational}} accident rate was offi cially {{reported to be}} 0. 77 per 100 workers in 2001 and 0. 70 in 2009. The stag-nant decrease in accident rate raises {{a question about the}} effectiveness of prevention activity because there have been active prevention efforts in the past 10 years. It is also necessary to know the exact status of occupational injuries to direct a prevention strategy. Methods: The author re-analyzed occupational injury statistics to fi nd the reason for stagnant decreases in occupational injuries. Compensated occupational injuries cases were used to calculate fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rates. Injuries from commuting ac-cidents and sports activities were excluded as well as occupational diseases. The number of workers was adjusted to that of full time equivalent employees. Results: The fatal injury rate excluding injuries associated with commuting accidents, sports activities, and occupational diseases decreased from 12. 59 in 2001 to 8. 20 in 2009. In 2007, 67. 5 % of accidents that involved being caught in objects, which are mostly caused by machines and equipment, occurred in the manufacturing industry; this type of incident has decreased since 2001. The fatal and <b>non-fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rates in the manufacturing industry have continuously decreased while the rates in the service industry have not changed from 2001 to 2009.
