The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice, but <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> calendar year. Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year (0–1–0–2–2–1). One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005, {{at the start of}} the Aki Basho when he dropped his first Shonichi (Day 1) bout during his tenure as yokozuna. On 26 November 2005, a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty-third bout of the year, (surpassing Kitanoumi's record set in 1978) and clinching the tournament at the same time. The six championships of 2005 (including two more 15–0 wins in January and May) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004, meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships.|$|E

25|$|Compton {{also played}} football, {{beginning}} {{his career at}} non-league Nunhead during the 1934–35 season before joining Arsenal. Whilst playing as a winger, he made his debut in 1936, taking up the number 11 jersey at the club. Compton was eventually successful at Highbury, winning the League title in 1948 and the FA Cup in 1950. With Arsenal Compton also won the old First Division in 1937–38, making seven league appearances in all that season. However, {{the latter part of}} his sporting career was dogged by knee trouble when his right knee was damaged in a collision with the goalkeeper of club Charlton Athletic. He was thus limited to 60 official i.e. non-wartime appearances, scoring 16 goals altogether. He represented England in wartime games on 12 occasions, but <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> full official match.|$|E

25|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the RAF how their white phosphorus {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers– this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.|$|E
500|$|Whether based ashore or on board, the men's duties during Bounty's five-month stay in Tahiti were {{relatively}} light. Many led promiscuous lives among the native women—altogether, 18 officers and men, including Christian, received treatment for venereal infections—while others took regular partners. Christian formed {{a close relationship}} with a Polynesian woman named Mauatua, to whom he gave the name [...] "Isabella" [...] after a former sweetheart from Cumberland. Bligh remained chaste himself, but was tolerant of his men's activities, unsurprised that they should succumb to temptation when [...] "the allurements of dissipation are beyond any thing that can be conceived". Nevertheless, he expected them to do their duty efficiently, and was disappointed to find increasing instances of neglect and slackness on the part of his officers. Infuriated, he wrote: [...] "Such neglectful and worthless petty officers I believe were <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ship such as are in this".|$|E
500|$|Calcium isotope {{fractionation}} during mineral formation {{has led to}} several applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate {{is the basis of}} analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine {{have been shown to be}} related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the 44Ca/40Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis. A similar system exists in seawater, where 44Ca/40Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca2+ by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44Ca/40Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca2+ concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "steady state" [...] with respect to calcium input and output. This has important climatological implications, as the marine calcium cycle is closely tied to the carbon cycle.(aq)–calcite equilibrium fractionation factor and calcite recrystallization rates in Pleistocene sediments|journal=Geochim Cosmochim Acta|date=2007|volume=71|pages=2524–2546|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2007.03.006|issue=10|bibcode=2007GeCoA..71.2524F}} ...|$|E

500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s the thing that I felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Given his {{brilliance}} in {{home games}} in 1962, {{it was no}} surprise that Pierce was chosen to start the Giants' home opener in 1963, and he responded with the last shutout of his career – a 7–0 win over the Houston Colt [...]45s. He achieved his Candlestick success despite often discarding one of his primary pitches, the low curve, saying, [...] "How many left-handers come into this park and win with that pitch on a windy afternoon?" [...] He instead altered the location of his pitches, throwing outside to left-handers to get them to hit to left field, taking advantage of the wind which kept the ball in the air longer; two-time AL batting champion Pete Runnels observed that Pierce pitched to him completely differently upon changing leagues. His home win streak ended in his next start on April 20, a 4–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs; he gradually moved to the bullpen {{over the course of the}} 1963 season, and was used almost exclusively in relief in 1964. On September 10, 1964 against the Dodgers, in what was later called [...] "Billy the Kid's last fight," [...] he made his first start in over a year and the last of his career, pitching 7⅔ innings and gaining a 5–1 win. He made one more appearance in relief on October 3, falling one strikeout short of 2,000, and announced his retirement the next day as the season came to an end. In an 18-season career, Pierce posted a 211–169 record with a 3.27 ERA in 3,306⅔ innings; only twice (1948 and 1963) did he post an ERA of 4.00 or higher, and <b>never</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season of at least 100 innings. He completed 193 of his 432 starts, including 38 shutouts, and also had 32 saves among his 585 total games pitched. His 186 career victories with the White Sox rank fourth on the club's all-time list, behind Hall of Famers Ted Lyons, Red Faber and Ed Walsh. His White Sox record of 456 career games by a left-hander was broken by Wilbur Wood in 1974.|$|E
