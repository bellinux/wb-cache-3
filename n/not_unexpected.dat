5|$|On 23 February 1908, {{less than}} six weeks after the inquiry closed, the Local Government Board issued a draft {{provisional}} bill for the federation of the six towns. This was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected</b> but the rating scheme proposed differed from the schemes discussed during the inquiry and included a complicated valuation of the properties belonging to each municipality, something {{that none of the}} towns wished to carry out. Nevertheless, Hanley, Longton and Tunstall all supported the draft order while Stoke, Fenton and Burslem opposed it.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected,</b> as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected,</b> {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in the corridors of Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E

5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose {{a time when he}} knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators off-balance and thwarted coup attempts. The raids were <b>not</b> <b>unexpected,</b> as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E
25|$|Koestler had stated {{more than}} once that he was afraid, not of being dead, but {{of the process of}} dying. His suicide was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected</b> among his close friends.

25|$|Amtrak began {{operations}} in May 1971 {{with a mixture}} of equipment from its predecessor railroads, much of which was painted in a variety of railroad-specific paint schemes. This era was later referred to as the Rainbow Era, due to the mix-matched colorful trains Amtrak used. Amtrak elected not to keep the same rolling stock on the same routes and it was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected</b> to find rolling stock from anywhere in the US on any train. To build the brand of Amtrak as a unified passenger railroad, the equipment was gradually repainted into system-wide Phases starting around 1972 with Phase I.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fifth}} year of Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, king of Egypt, brought a huge army and took many cities. According to Joshua, son of Nadav, the mention in 2 Chronicles 11, 6 sqq., that Rehoboam built fifteen {{fortified}} cities, indicates that the attack was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected.</b> The account in Chronicles states that Shishaq marched with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and troops who came with him from Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Kushites. Shishaq's armies captured all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon. When they laid siege to Jerusalem, Rehoboam gave Shishaq all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute. The Egyptian campaign cut off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev that had been established during Solomon's reign. Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{took time}} to rally more men and prepare. By the {{following}} spring, Charles had attracted enough support to invade Neustria. Charles sent an envoy who proposed a secession of hostilities if Chilperic would recognize his rights as mayor of the palace in Austrasia. The refusal was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected</b> but served to impress upon Martel's forces the unreasonableness of the Neustrians. They met near Cambrai at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. The victorious Martel pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris, but as he was not yet prepared to hold the city, {{he turned back to}} deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude was allowed to retire to a convent; Theudoald lived to 741 under his uncle's protection, a kindness—unusual for those times, when mercy to a former gaoler, or a potential rival, was rare.|$|E
25|$|There was no tour in 1969–70 and no {{tourists}} in 1970 as the series with South Africa were cancelled {{due to the}} Basil d'Oliveira Affair and concerns over anti-apartheid demonstrations that had led to barbed wire at Lord's. Rather than send an unprepared team to Australia the Rest of the World XI under Garry Sobers was created from the overseas cricketers playing in the County Championship, including the South Africans Graeme Pollock, Mike Procter, Barry Richards and Eddie Barlow. They could not {{be regarded as a}} national Test team and the matches were given the status of 'unofficial Tests', but the runs scored and wickets taken were added to official Test statistics until it was decided by the I.C.C. that they should not count. England were beaten by a superior team, but this was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected.</b> The only surprise was that they managed to win one game and almost won two others against what was arguably the strongest Test team ever assembled.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, two white-spotted bamboo sharks {{were born}} at the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit. They hatched 15 weeks after being laid. The births baffled experts as the mother shared an {{aquarium}} with only one other shark, which was female. The female bamboo sharks had laid eggs in the past. This is <b>not</b> <b>unexpected,</b> as many animals will lay eggs {{even if there is}} not a male to fertilize them. Normally, the eggs are assumed to be inviable and are discarded. This batch of eggs was left undisturbed by the curator as he had heard about the previous birth in 2001 in Nebraska and wanted to observe whether they would hatch. Other possibilities had been considered for the birth of the Detroit bamboo sharks including thoughts that the sharks had been fertilized by a male and stored the sperm for a period of time, as well as the possibility that the Belle Isle bamboo shark is a hermaphrodite, harboring both male and female sex organs, and capable of fertilizing its own eggs, but that is not confirmed.|$|E
25|$|The {{journey was}} a series of {{straight}} single-carriageway roads across foggy moors interrupted by predictable bottlenecks for most of the journey to Blyth, Nottinghamshire, where it met the A1. The accident rate was consequently high, and the journey of most of Hull's traffic was similar to that faced by much of Lincolnshire's drivers today. Debates in Parliament were held on the low standard of the windy route across the wind-swept plains around Goole. It was <b>not</b> <b>unexpected</b> that under these conditions, a Humber Bridge, with connecting dual-carriageway approach roads, and grade-separated junctions, would seem worthwhile. By the time the bridge opened, much of this well-below-standard route had been transformed by dualling of the A63 and its bypasses, the extension of the M62, and the much-needed connecting of the M18 from Thorne to Wadworth. The obvious need for a Humber Bridge had largely been tempered by the late 1970s with the much-improved motorway infrastructure of the region. Although welcome, the timing of these improvements would detract any significant levels of traffic needing to cross a bridge from Hessle to Barton. The Humber Bridge would be a victim of the M62's success, before opening.|$|E

One explanation of the anomaly attributed the amplification to path effects and a separate theory put forth described supershear effects that generated a focused pulse directly at the station. A later proposal stated that both multipath and focusing effects due to a [...] "lens like effect" [...] produced by a sedimentary wedge at the junction of the Imperial and Brawley faults (under the station) may have been the cause of the high reading.|$|E
