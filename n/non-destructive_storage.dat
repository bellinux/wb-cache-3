The image array {{is based on}} time domain digital pixel sensor technology equipped with <b>non-destructive</b> <b>storage</b> capability using 8 -bit Static-RAM device embedded at the pixel level. An adaptive quantization scheme based on Fast Boundary Adaptation Rule (FBAR) and Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) procedure followed by an on-line Quadrant Tree Decomposition (QTD) processing is proposed enabling a robust and compact image compression processor. A prototype chip including 64 x 64 pixels, read-out and control circuitry {{as well as the}} compression processor was implemented in 0. 35 um CMOS technology with a silicon area of 3. 2 x 3. 0 mm 2. Simulation results show compression figures corresponding to 0. 6 - 0. 8 Bit-per-Pixel (BPP), while maintaining reasonable PSNR levels...|$|E

We show that the generic c(4 × 2) reconstruction of Ge(001) can be easily reinstated in the Ba/Ge(001) sample, stored for more than 40 days under UHV and room temperature conditions, just by thermal annealing at 1070 K under UHV. Our data implies that this process occurs predominantly via temperature assisted desorption of Ba adatoms from the on-top phase formed as an intermediate during annealing process and known to preserve the c(4 × 2) reconstruction of Ge(001). The reported {{results indicate that the}} Ba-induced incorporated phase on Ge(001) is very effective in protecting the Ge(001) substrate against destructive adsorption of residual gases and can be utilized for long-term, <b>non-destructive</b> Ge sample <b>storage</b> under UHV conditions...|$|R

Holography ad numerous other applications. Although large amount of information is rapidly availabe to inform Scientist of the theoretical aspects of holography, very little has been written to counsel the engineer or technician {{to build up the}} system and conduct experiments with ease. here to offer description of brief details of Holography system procured with the assistance of UNDP and the procedure he adopted in assembling of work table, tuning of laser, arranging of optical elements for making holograms and processing of holographic plates. The reports ends with a few recommendations offered by the author for construction holograms. The information contained in the report will be immensely useful for the practising engineer who attempts to build his own system and make holograms with no serious knowledge of mathematics of laser light. 13...|$|R

The goal of the proposed model {{is to determine the}} best combination of the number of each product type to be taken back from the last user and/or collectors. The EOL products are then disassembled for the retrieval of reusable components and materials and resold in order to meet a certain level of demand under a variety of physical, financial and environmental constraints. The surplus components are recycled, stored for usage in subsequent periods or properly disposed. The problem is modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem under uncertainty, where the aspiration levels for various goals {{are more likely to be}} in the "approximately more (less) than" and/or "more (less) is better" form. We employ fuzzy goal programming technique to solve the problem. When solved, the model provides the number of EOL products to be taken back as well as the number of items reused, recycled, stored and disposed. The values of a host of other performance measures are also obtained, including total profit, materials and items sales revenues, take back cost, transportation costs as well as costs of preparation of EOL products, destructive disassembly, <b>non-destructive</b> disassembly, recycling, <b>storage</b> and disposal. A case example is presented to illustrate the model's implementation.
