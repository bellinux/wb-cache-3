5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a <b>new</b> <b>biography</b> about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author felt {{she would not be}} able to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Boycott would be awarded a role amongst the England coaching staff, pertaining {{in particular to}} the coaching of Andrew Flintoff back from injury. On 8 May 2008, however, the ECB revealed that Boycott would not hold such a position. The two {{had been involved in}} the past, and while Flintoff is an admirer of Boycott, the ECB stressed any coaching relationship would only be informal. Boycott, however, used to give informal talks to younger cricket players during his career, and the media speculated that he might find a place coaching the England U19s. Boycott continued in his commentating career for TMS, criticising the England team's approach to the ODI matches under Pietersen in India in November 2008. Also in November, Daily Mail contributor Leo McKinstry published a <b>new</b> <b>biography</b> on Boycott.|$|E
5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a <b>new</b> <b>biography</b> of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 and 1978 {{in eight}} auctions at Christie's, a major {{surviving}} portion of Evelyn's library was sold and dispersed. The British Library holds a large archive of Evelyn's personal papers including the manuscript of his Diary.

25|$|Several {{detailed}} {{studies of}} Pepys' life are available. Arthur Bryant published his three-volume study in 1933–1938, {{long before the}} definitive edition of the diary, but, thanks to Bryant's lively style, it is still of interest. In 1974 Richard Ollard produced a <b>new</b> <b>biography</b> that drew on Latham's and Matthew's work on the text, benefitting from the author's deep knowledge of Restoration politics. Other biographies include: Samuel Pepys : a life, by Stephen Coote (London : Hodder & Stoughton, 2000) and, Samuel Pepys and his world, by Geoffrey Trease (London : Thames and Hudson, 1972).|$|E
