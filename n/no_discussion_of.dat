Today, there is a statue of Juan Morel Campos that adorns the Plaza Las Delicias city square, and the home where Paoli was born and raised functions as the Puerto Rico Center for Folkloric Research, a research center for Puerto Rican culture.|$|E
25|$|The final {{argument}} {{was that the}} principle of stare decisis bound the Appellate Division to follow the precedent of the Ndlwana case, in which it had ruled that Parliament can adopt any procedure it sees fit and the courts have no power to question the validity of its acts. The court ruled that it was entitled to overrule its own previous decisions if they were clearly wrong. In Ndlwana there had been <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the Statute of Westminster nor any argument for or against the conclusion drawn by the court, and the court therefore felt free to overrule it.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the title}} {{states that it}} is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does {{introduce}} all the axioms of ZFC set theory (except the Axiom of Foundation), and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects. [...] Where it differs from a [...] "true" [...] axiomatic set theory book is its character: there are <b>no</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about advanced topics like large cardinals. Instead, it tries to be intelligible {{to someone who has}} never thought about set theory before.|$|R
40|$|Child prostitutes {{are often}} portrayed as pitiful victims about whom {{there can be}} <b>no</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> force or choice, agency or empowerment. Detailed ethnographic research, however, paints a very {{different}} picture. This article employs findings from several ethnographic accounts, including my own, of Thai children, who, while admitting to exchanging sex for money and other services, utterly reject the term “prostitution’ and saw themselves primarily as dutiful daughters, sisters and children. By focusing on their daily lives, as much as intermittent periods of prostitution, {{it is possible to}} present a more rounded picture of the everyday lives of such children...|$|R
25|$|The {{nationalisation}} surprised Britain and its Commonwealth. There {{had been}} <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the canal at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London in late June and early July. Egypt's action, however, threatened British {{economic and military}} interests in the region. Prime Minister Eden was under immense domestic pressure from Conservative MPs who drew direct comparisons between the events of 1956 {{and those of the}} Munich Agreement in 1938. Since the U.S. government did not support the British protests, the British government decided in favour of military intervention against Egypt to avoid the complete collapse of British prestige in the region.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> how they have changed over the decades. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had not focused on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E
25|$|The Rigveda {{offers no}} direct {{evidence}} of social or {{political system in}} Vedic era, whether ordinary or elite. Only hints such as cattle raising and horse racing are discernible, and the text offers very general ideas about the ancient Indian society. There is no evidence, state Jamison and Brereton, of any elaborate, pervasive or structured caste system. Social stratification seems embryonic, then and later a social ideal rather than a social reality. The society was pastoral with evidence of agriculture since hymns mention plow and celebrate agricultural divinities. There was division of labor, and complementary relationship between kings and poet-priests but <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> relative status of social classes. Women in Rigveda appear disproportionately as speakers in dialogue hymns, both as mythical or divine Indrani, Apsaras Urvasi, or Yami, as well as Apāla Ātreyī (RV 8.91), Godhā (RV 10.134.6), Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī (RV 10.39.40), Romaśā (RV 1.126.7), Lopāmudrā (RV 1.179.1-2), Viśvavārā Ātreyī (RV 5.28), Śacī Paulomī (RV 10.159), Śaśvatī Āṅgirasī (RV 8.1.34). The women of Rigveda are quite outspoken and appear more sexually confident than men, in the text. Elaborate and esthetic hymns on wedding suggest rites of passage had developed during the Rigvedic period. There is little evidence of dowry and no evidence of sati in it or related Vedic texts.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, the political and economic turmoil in the People's Republic of Poland had seriously eroded the authority of the Polish United Workers' Party. Suslov's position on this matter carried particular weight as he chaired a Politburo Commission, established on 25 August 1980, {{on how to deal with}} the Polish crisis. Members of the commission included such high-ranking Soviets as Andropov, Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov, Andrei Gromyko, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Brezhnev's long-time associate Konstantin Chernenko. On 28 August, the Commission considered Soviet military intervention to stabilize the region. Wojciech Jaruzelski, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, was able to persuade the Commission that a Soviet military intervention would only aggravate the situation. Suslov agreed with Jaruzelski's argument, stating that [...] "if troops are introduced, that will mean a catastrophe. I think that we all share the unanimous opinion here that there can be <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> any introduction of troops". Suslov was able to persuade Jaruzelski and the Polish leadership to establish martial law in Poland.|$|E
500|$|In a July 2009 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Cornell shot down {{rumors of a}} reunion, saying that conversations between the band members had been limited to discussion about {{the release of a}} box set or B-sides album of Soundgarden rarities, and that there had been <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> a reunion at all. The band's interest in new releases emerged from a 2008 meeting about their shared properties, both financial and legal, where they realized Soundgarden lacked online presence such as a website or a Facebook page. As Thayil summed up, [...] "we kind of had neglected our merchandise over the last decade". Eventually the musicians decided to create an official site handled by Pearl Jam's Ten Club, relaunch their catalog, and according to Cameron, seek [...] "a bunch of unreleased stuff we wanted to try to put out". On March 2009, Thayil, Shepherd and Cameron got onstage during a concert by Tad Doyle in Seattle and played some Soundgarden songs. Cornell stated that the moment [...] "sort of sparked the idea: If Matt, Kim, and Ben can get in a room, rehearse a couple songs, and play, maybe we all could do that as Soundgarden." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, {{the lack}} of {{progress}} {{of the peace process}} led to new negotiations which produced the Wye River Memorandum in 1998 which detailed the steps to be taken by the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority to implement the earlier Interim Agreement of 1995.

Dohrn {{called for a}} meeting in late April 1970 of all of Weatherman's top leadership at the collective safe house in Mendocino, California, north of San Francisco. Exhausted from months on the run, consumed by fear, and depressed by the deaths of Robbins, Oughton and Gold, the leadership agreed to lay some ground rules for the Mendocino debates. There would be no shouting, and <b>no</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> theory or philosophy in the evenings. Jacobs vehemently disagreed, and was largely excluded from the ensuing discussions. Over the next several days, {{the leaders of the}} Weather Underground discussed how to respond to the townhouse blast. After several days, the group concluded that Jacobs and Robbins had committed [...] "the military error" [...] by advocating armed revolution. As leader of the group, Dohrn had the power to expel Jacobs. She did so, and Jacobs left quietly. He never participated in radical activities again.|$|E
