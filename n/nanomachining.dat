40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes to}} explore the {{possibility}} of molecular communication as a solution for communication between <b>nanomachines.</b> <b>Nanomachines</b> are artificial or biological nano-scale devices that perform simple computation, sensing, or actuation. Molecular communication provides a mechanism for <b>nanomachines</b> to communicate over a short distance (adjacent <b>nanomachines</b> to tens of micrometers) using molecules as a communication carrier. Current research focuses on understanding biological <b>nanomachines</b> and also on artificially creating counterparts of biological <b>nanomachines.</b> No current research focuses on communication aspects of <b>nanomachines.</b> Communicating nano machines can spur the creation of entirely new applications. The class of molecular communication systems considered in this paper consists of sender <b>nanomachines,</b> receiver <b>nanomachines,</b> carrier molecules, and the environment that these operate in. Senders and receivers include biological (such as cells) and biologically derived (such as molecular motors or sensors taken from biological systems) <b>nanomachines</b> {{that are capable of}} emitting and capturing carrier molecules (such as proteins, ions, or DNA). The environment is the aqueous solution that is typically found within and between cells.

Interconnections of the <b>nanomachines</b> with molecular {{communication is}} envisioned as a nanonetwork.

In this paper, we develop and present models for the molecular multiple-access, broadcast, and relay channels in a nanonetwork and derive their capacity expressions.

Distinct from the current telecommunication paradigm, molecular communication uses molecules as the carriers of information; sender biological <b>nanomachines</b> encode information on molecules and release the molecules in the environment, the molecules then propagate in the environment to receiver biological <b>nanomachines,</b> and the receiver biological <b>nanomachines</b> biochemically react with the molecules to decode information.
