5|$|In August 1912 Massenet went to Paris {{from his}} house at Égreville to see his doctor. The {{composer}} had been suffering from abdominal cancer for some months, but his symptoms did not seem imminently life-threatening. Within a few days his condition deteriorated sharply. His wife and family hastened to Paris, and were {{with him when he}} died, aged seventy. By his own wish his funeral, with <b>no</b> <b>music,</b> was held privately at Égreville, where he is buried in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>music</b> {{that can}} be {{definitively}} traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars have speculated that some of {{it may have been}} used in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing <b>no</b> <b>music</b> or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E

5|$|In March 2010, {{record label}} Def Jam held a writing camp in Los Angeles for songwriters and {{producers}} to compose material for possible inclusion on Rihanna's then-untitled fifth studio album, Loud.

Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo Rock City (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during the sessions, and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day.

5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game and ruin the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have <b>no</b> <b>music</b> at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} away from TV, Ziggler {{returned}} on the August 22 edition of SmackDown Live to declare that he would undergo a gimmick change on the following week's edition. He later started mocking, week after week, the entrances of current and former wrestlers such as John Cena, Naomi, Shawn Michaels and Randy Savage. Ziggler believed that fans only cared about elaborated entrances, and not about the in-ring performances, where he claimed he was the best. However, after mocking The Undertaker's entrance, Ziggler was interrupted by Bobby Roode, who challenged Ziggler to a match at Hell in a Cell, which Ziggler accepted. At the event Ziggler, who had promised a never seen before entrance but ended up being an entrance with <b>no</b> <b>music,</b> lights and titantron, was defeated by Roode after a Roll Up; right after that, Ziggler attacked Roode from behind with a Zig Zag. On the October 17 edition of SmackDown Live, Ziggler defeated Roode in a rematch by a roll up, similar to how Roode defeated him. On 31st October's edition of Smackdown, Ziggler failed to earn a spot in Team Smackdown for Survivor Series 5 on 5 elimination match vs Raw after being defeated by Roode in a 2 out of 3 falls match and thus ending their feud.|$|E
