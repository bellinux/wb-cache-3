50|$|As <b>nocodazole</b> {{affects the}} cytoskeleton, {{it is often}} used in cell biology {{experiments}} as a control: for example, some dominant negative Rho small GTPases cause a similar effect as <b>nocodazole,</b> and constitutively activated mutants often reverse or negate the effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocodazole</b> is {{frequently}} used in cell biology laboratories to synchronize the cell division cycle. Cells treated with <b>nocodazole</b> arrest with a G2- or M-phase DNA content when analyzed by flow cytometry. Microscopy of nocodazole-treated cells {{shows that they}} do enter mitosis but cannot form metaphase spindles because microtubules (of which the spindles are made) cannot polymerise. The absence of microtubule attachment to kinetochores activates the spindle assembly checkpoint, causing the cell to arrest in prometaphase. For cell synchronization experiments, <b>nocodazole</b> is usually used at a concentration of 40-100 ng/mL of culture medium for a duration of 12-18 hours. Prolonged arrest of cells in mitosis due to <b>nocodazole</b> treatment typically results in cell death by apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, <b>nocodazole</b> {{has been}} shown to {{decrease}} the oncogenic potential of cancer cells via another microtubules-independent mechanisms. <b>Nocodazole</b> stimulates the expression of LATS2 which potently inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by abrogating the interaction between the Wnt-dependent transcriptional co-factors beta-catenin and BCL9.|$|E
50|$|Another {{standard}} cell biological application of <b>nocodazole</b> is to induce {{the formation of}} Golgi ministacks in eukaryotic cells. The perinuclear structural organization of the Golgi apparatus in eukaryotes is dependent on microtubule trafficking, but disrupting the trafficking of Golgi elements from the endoplasmic reticulum treatment with <b>nocodazole</b> (33 μM for 3 hours) induces numerous Golgi elements to form adjacent to ER exit sites. These functional Golgi ministacks remain distributed about the cell, unable to track forward to form a perinuclear Golgi since <b>nocodazole</b> has depolymerized the microtubules.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nocodazole</b> is an antineoplastic agent which exerts {{its effect}} in cells by {{interfering with the}} {{polymerization}} of microtubules. Microtubules are one type of fibre which constitutes the cytoskeleton, and the dynamic microtubule network has several important roles in the cell, including vesicular transport, forming the mitotic spindle and in cytokinesis. Several drugs including vincristine and colcemid are similar to <b>nocodazole</b> in that they interfere with microtubule polymerization.|$|E
50|$|Various {{chemical}} reagents {{are used to}} increase cloning efficiency. Microtubule inhibitors, such as <b>nocodazole,</b> are used to arrest the oocyte in M phase, during which its nuclear membrane is dissolved. Chemicals are also used to stimulate oocyte activation. When applied the membrane is completely dissolved.|$|E
5000|$|Inhibition of {{microtubule}} polymerization with <b>nocodazole</b> blocks {{formation of}} the purinosome macrobodies, and reduces the flux of de novo purine biosynthesis. [...] However, <b>nocodazole</b> also blocks formation of aggresomes, complicating interpretation of these observations. Partial inhibition of casein kinase 2 by small molecule inhibitors -4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TBI), 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT), tetrabromocinammic acid (TBCA) or ellagic acid - was found to induce purinosome macrobody formation, while another inhibitor, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) induced purinosome macrobody formation at low concentration but not at high concentration, and caused the dissociation of the bodies formed in response to DMAT. [...] Complicating the interpretation of these data, inhibition of casein kinase 2 is also known to disrupt hundreds of cellular processes, among them being protein homeostasis which regulates protein aggregation.|$|E
5000|$|Cell {{growth can}} also be arrested using {{chemical}} growth inhibitors. After growth has completely stopped for all cells, the inhibitor can be easily removed from the culture and the cells then begin to grow synchronously. <b>Nocodazole,</b> for example, is often used in biological research for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|Microtubule-disruptive {{drugs like}} vinblastine, colcemid, and <b>nocodazole</b> have been {{reported}} to act by two mechanisms. At very low concentrations they suppress microtubule dynamics and at higher concentrations they reduce microtubule polymer mass. Recent findings indicate that they also produce microtubule fragments by stimulating microtubule minus-end detachment from their organizing centers. Dose-response studies further indicate that enhanced microtubule detachment from spindle poles correlate best with cytotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|Without Cdc20, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) cannot become {{activated}} and anaphase is not triggered. Mad2 {{was shown}} to inhibit {{the activity of the}} APC by direct physical interaction in a ternary complex with Cdc20. Kinetochores that remain unattached to microtubules catalyze the sequestration of Cdc20 by Mad2. In fact, when metaphase mammalian cells are treated with the spindle-depolymerizing agent <b>nocodazole,</b> Mad2 proteins become localized at the kinetochores of all sister-chromatid pairs.|$|E
5000|$|Helobdella robusta: The leech Helobdella robusta {{exhibits}} a similar asymmetry {{in the first}} embryonic division as C. elegans and tubifex, but relies on a modified mechanism. Compression experiments on the robusta embryo do not affect asymmetric division, suggesting the mechanism, like tubifex, uses a cortical independent molecular pathway. In robusta, antibody staining reveals that the mitotic spindle forms symmetrically until metaphase and stems from two biastral centrosomes. [...] At the onset of metaphase, asymmetry becomes apparent as the centrosome of the prospective larger CD cell lengthens cortical asters while the asters of the prospective smaller AB cell become downregulated. Experiments using <b>nocodazole</b> and taxol support this observation. Taxol, which stabilized microtubules, forced {{a significant number of}} embryos to cleave symmetrically when used at a moderate concentration. Moreover, embryos treated with <b>nocodazole,</b> which sequesters tubulin dimers and promotes microtubule depolymerization, similarly forced symmetric division in a significant number of embryos. Treatment with either drug at these concentrations fails to disrupt normal centrosome dynamics, suggesting that a balance of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization represents another mechanism for establishing asymmetric cell division in spilarian development.|$|E
50|$|Unlike cingulin, paracingulin {{associates}} with actin filaments {{in different types}} of culture cells and its localization at the apical junctional complex is perturbed by treatment with the microtubule drug <b>nocodazole.</b> Paracingulin regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases like RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 by interacting with their respective GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), GEF-H1, Tiam1 and GAPs to the epithelial junction during the formation of cell-cell junction. The regulation of these GTPases is crucial for cell growth, activation of kinases and cytoskeletal organization.|$|E
50|$|Zirkle (in 1970) {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{researchers}} to observe that, when just one chromosome is retarded to arrive at the metaphase plate, anaphase onset is postponed until some minutes after its arrival. This observation, together with similar ones, suggested that a control mechanism exists at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using drugs such as <b>nocodazole</b> and colchicine, the mitotic spindle disassembles and the cell cycle is blocked at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Using these drugs (see the review from Rieder and Palazzo in 1992), the putative control mechanism was named Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). This regulatory mechanism has been intensively studied since(see the review from Burke and Stukenberg in 2008).|$|E
50|$|Environmental stress {{triggers}} {{a series of}} signals which eventually lead to formation of stress granules. Early on, it involves phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α. Further downstream, prion-like aggregation of the protein TIA-1 leads {{to the formation of}} stress granules. The term prion-like is used because aggregation of TIA-1 is concentration dependent, inhibited by chaperones, and because the aggregates are resistant to proteases. It has also been proposed that microtubules {{play a role in the}} formation of stress granules, maybe by transporting granule components. This hypothesis is based on the fact that disruption of microtubules with the chemical <b>nocodazole</b> blocks the appearance of the granules. Furthermore, many signaling molecules were shown to regulate the formation or dynamics of stress granules; these include the master energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the O-GlcNAc transferase enzyme (OGT), and the pro-apoptotic kinase ROCK1.|$|E
50|$|Mad2 (mitotic arrest {{deficient}} 2) is {{an essential}} spindle checkpoint protein. The spindle checkpoint system is a regulatory system that restrains progression through the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. The Mad2 gene was first identified in the yeast S. cerevisiae in a screen for genes which when mutated would confer sensitivity to microtubule poisons. The human orthologues of Mad2 (MAD2L1 and MAD2L2) were first cloned {{in a search for}} human cDNAs that would rescue the microtubule poison-sensitivity of a yeast strain in which a kinetochore binding protein was missing. The protein was shown to be present at unattached kinetochores and antibody inhibition studies demonstrated it was essential to execute a block in the metaphase-to-anaphase transition in response to the microtubule poison <b>nocodazole.</b> Subsequent cloning of the Xenopus laevis orthologue, facilitated by the sharing of the human sequence, allowed for the characterization of the mitotic checkpoint in egg extracts.|$|E
5000|$|Ilyanasa obsoleta: A third, less {{traditional}} mechanism {{contributing to}} asymmetric cell division in spiralian {{development has been}} discovered in the mollusk Ilyanasa obsoleta. In situ hybridization and immunofluorescence experiments show that mRNA transcripts co-localize with centrosomes during early cleavage. [...] Consequently, these transcripts are inherited in a stereotypical fashion to distinct cells. All mRNA transcripts followed have been implicated in body axis patterning, and in situ hybridization for transcripts associated with other functions fail to exhibit such a localization. Moreover, disruption of microtubule polymerization with <b>nocodazole,</b> and of actin polymerization with cytochalisin B, shows the cytoskeleton is also important in this asymmetry. It appears that microtubules are required to recruit the mRNA to the centrosome, and that actin is required to attach the centrosome to the cortex. Finally, introducing multiple centrosomes into one cell by inhibiting cytokinesis shows that mRNA dependably localizes on the correct centrosome, suggesting intrinsic differences between each centrosomal composition. It {{is important to note}} that these results reflect experiments performed after the first two divisions, yet still demonstrate a different molecular means of establishing asymmetry in a dividing cell.|$|E
5000|$|Completion of epiboly {{requires}} {{the coordination of}} cytoskeletal changes across the embryo. The YSL appears to play {{a prominent role in}} this process. Studies on Fundulus demonstrated that the YSL is capable of undergoing epiboly even when the blastoderm has been removed, but that the blastoderm cannot undergo epiboly {{in the absence of the}} YSL. In zebrafish, there is a microtubule array in the yolk that extends from the animal to the vegetal pole of the embryo, and that contracts as epiboly progresses. Treating embryos with the microtubule depolymerizing agent <b>nocodazole</b> completely blocks epiboly of the YSL and partially blocks epiboly of the blastoderm, while treating with the microtubule stabilizing agent taxol blocks epiboly of all cell layers. There is also evidence for the importance of actin-based structures in epiboly. Ring-like structures of filamentous actin have been observed at the leading edge of the enveloping layer, where it contacts the yolk cell. It is thought that a network of filamentous actin in the yolk might constrict in a myosin-II dependent manner to close the blastopore at the end of epiboly, via a [...] "purse-string mechanism". Treating embryos with the actin destabilizer cytochalasin b results in delayed or arrested epiboly.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation for the MCC is unclear {{and there are}} competing theories for both kinetochore-dependent and kinetochore-independent formation. In support of the kinetochore-independent theory, MCC is detectable in S. cerevisiae cells in which core kinetocore assembly proteins have been mutated and cells in which the SAC has been deactivated, {{which suggests that the}} MCC could be assembled during mitosis without kinetochore localization. In one model, unattached prometaphase kinetochores can 'sensitize' APC to inhibition of MCC by recruiting the APC to kinetochores via a functioning SAC. Furthermore, depletions of various SAC proteins have revealed that MAD2 and BUBR1 depletions affect the timing of mitosis independently of kinetochores, while depletions of other SAC proteins result in a dysfunctional SAC without altering the duration of mitosis. Thus {{it is possible that the}} SAC functions through a two-stage timer where MAD2 and BUBR1 control the duration of mitosis in the first stage, which may be extended in the second stage if there are unattached kinetochores as well as other SAC proteins. However, there are lines of evidence which are in disfavor of the kinetochore-independent assembly. MCC has yet to be found during interphase, while MCC does not form from its constituents in X. laevis meiosis II extracts without the addition of sperm of nuclei and <b>nocodazole</b> to prevent spindle assembly.|$|E

30|$|To {{determine}} whether the increased ER-mitochondria interaction contributes to the reprogramming of mitochondrial metabolism, we {{examined the effects of}} <b>nocodazole</b> on Hcy-mediated mitochondrial ROS level and calcium signal as well as mitochondrial membrane potential. <b>Nocodazole</b> greatly attenuated the Hcy-induced mitochondrial membrane potential, as indicated by relative rhodamine 123 MFI, from 2.60 ± 0.33 to 0.95 ± 0.10, comparable to the 1.26 ± 0.22 MFI in untreated control cells (Fig.  5 F).

40|$|Insulin stimulates glucose {{transport}} in adipocytes {{and muscle}} cells by triggering redistribution of the GLUT 4 glucose transporter from an intracellular perinuclear location {{to the cell}} surface. Recent reports {{have shown that the}} microtubule-depolymerizing agent <b>nocodazole</b> inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport, implicating an important role for microtubules in this process. In the present study we show that 2 µM <b>nocodazole</b> completely depolymerized microtubules in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, as determined morphologically and biochemically, resulting in dispersal of the perinuclear GLUT 4 compartment and the Golgi apparatus. However, 2 µM <b>nocodazole</b> did not significantly effect either the kinetics or magnitude of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Consistent with previous studies, higher concentrations of <b>nocodazole</b> (10 - 33 µM) significantly inhibited basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. This effect was not likely the result of microtubule depolymerization because in the presence of taxol, which blocked nocodazole-induced depolymerization of microtubules as well as the dispersal of the perinuclear GLUT 4 compartment, the inhibitory effect of 10 - 33 µM <b>nocodazole</b> on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake prevailed. Despite the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport with 33 µM <b>nocodazole</b> we did not observe inhibition of insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation to the cell surface under these conditions.

40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that nanomolar concentrations of <b>nocodazole</b> can block cells in mitosis without net microtubule disassembly {{and resulted in}} the hypothesis that this block was due to a nocodazole-induced stabilization of microtubules. We tested this hypothesis by examining the effects of nanomolar concentrations of <b>nocodazole</b> on microtubule dynamic instability in interphase cells and in vitro with purified brain tubulin. Newt lung epithelial cell microtubules were visualized by video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy and cells were perfused with solutions of <b>nocodazole</b> ranging in concentration from 4 to 400 nM. Microtubules showed a loss of the two-state behavior typical of dynamic instability {{as evidenced by the}} addition of a third state where they exhibited little net change in length (a paused state). <b>Nocodazole</b> perfusion also resulted in slower elongation and shortening velocities, increased catastrophe, and an overall decrease in microtubule turnover. Experiments performed on BSC- 1 cells that were microinjected with rhodamine-labeled tubulin, incubated in <b>nocodazole</b> for 1 h, and visualized by using low-light-level fluorescence microscopy showed similar results except that nocodazole-treated BSC- 1 cells showed a decrease in catastrophe. To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for changes in dynamic instability, we examined the effects of 4 nM to 12 microM <b>nocodazole</b> on the assembly of purified tubulin from axoneme seeds. At both microtubule plus and minus ends, perfusion with <b>nocodazole</b> resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in elongation and shortening velocities, increase in pause duration and catastrophe frequency, and decrease in rescue frequency. These effects, which result in an overall decrease in microtubule turnover after <b>nocodazole</b> treatment, suggest that the mitotic block observed is due to a reduction in microtubule dynamic turnover. In addition, the in vitro results are similar to the effects of increasing concentrations of GDP-tubulin (TuD) subunits on microtubule assembly. Given that <b>nocodazole</b> increases tubulin GTPase activity, we propose that <b>nocodazole</b> acts by generating TuD subunits that then alter dynamic instability...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{microtubule}} assembly inhibitor <b>nocodazole</b> {{has been}} shown to trigger caspase-independent mitotic death and caspase dependent apoptosis. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may undergo eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Stimulators of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), oxidative stress and ceramide. The present study explored, whether and how <b>nocodazole</b> induces eryptosis. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to determine phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, the abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) diacetate dependent fluorescence as well as ceramide surface abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Tubulin abundance was quantified by TubulinTracker™ Green reagent and visualized by confocal microscopy. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>nocodazole</b> (≥ 30 µg/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells without significantly modifying average forward scatter. <b>Nocodazole</b> significantly increased Fluo 3 -fluorescence, significantly increased DCF fluorescence and significantly increased ceramide surface abundance.

40|$|Hypertonic {{activation}} of the renal betaine/GABA transporter is microtubule dependent. BackgroundEpithelial cells in the renal inner medulla accumulate osmolytes such as betaine to maintain normal cell volume during prolonged extracellular hypertonic stress. Betaine accumulation {{is the result of}} {{activation of}} transcription of the BGT 1 transporter gene followed by increased betaine transport. MethodsWe studied the possible role of microtubules in this adaptive mechanism using renal cells in culture. ResultsIn cultured renal cell lines [Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMCD- 3) ], up-regulation of BGT 1 activity was maximal after 24 to 30 hours in growth medium made hypertonic (510 mOsm/kg) by the addition of sucrose or NaCl. Up-regulation was reversed within 24 to 36 hours after returning cells to isotonic medium. Both cycloheximide (20 μmol/L) and <b>nocodazole</b> (20 μmol/L) blocked the hypertonic up-regulation of BGT 1. <b>Nocodazole</b> was partially effective even when added 16 to 20 hours after the switch to hypertonic medium. Recovery from <b>nocodazole</b> action was rapid, and there was full activation of BGT 1 transport within three to six hours after <b>nocodazole</b> removal, suggesting rapid trafficking to the cell surface once microtubules repolymerized. Hypertonic activation of BGT 1 transport was detected in an isolated membrane fraction and was blocked by cycloheximide but not by <b>nocodazole.</b> Confocal microscopy confirmed the increased abundance of BGT 1 proteins in the plasma membrane of hypertonic cells and showed that BGT 1 remained intracellular during <b>nocodazole</b> treatment. ConclusionsHypertonic activation of BGT 1 in renal cells requires de novo protein synthesis and microtubule-dependent trafficking of additional transporters to the cell surface. The apparent resistance of membrane BGT 1 to <b>nocodazole</b> blockade is likely due to the presence in the membrane fraction of an increased intracellular pool of active BGT 1 transporters...|$|E

The biosynthetic and transcytotic pathways to the apical surface are dramatically altered by <b>nocodazole</b> in that a portion of the protein traffic on each of these two pathways is misdirected to the basolateral surface. The apical recycling pathway is slowed in the presence of <b>nocodazole</b> but targeting is not disrupted. In contrast, the biosynthetic and recycling pathways to the basolateral surface are less affected by <b>nocodazole</b> and therefore appear to be more resistant to microtubule disruption...|$|E
40|$|<b>Nocodazole</b> is a known destabiliser of {{microtubule}} {{dynamics and}} arrests cell-cycle at the G 2 /M phase. In {{the context of}} the human embryonic stem cell (hESC) {{it is important to understand}} how this arrest influences the pluripotency of cells. Here we report for the first time the changes in the expression of transcription markers Nanog and Oct 4 as well as SSEA- 3 and SSEA- 4 in human embryonic cells after their treatment with <b>nocodazole.</b> Multivariate permeabilised-cell flow cytometry was applied for characterising the expression of Nanog and Oct 4 during different cell cycle phases. Among untreated hESC we detected Nanog-expressing cells, which also expressed Oct 4, SSEA- 3 and SSEA- 4. We also found another population expressing SSEA- 4, but without Nanog, Oct 4 and SSEA- 3 expression. <b>Nocodazole</b> treatment resulted in a decrease of cell population positive for all four markers Nanog, Oct 4, SSEA- 3, SSEA- 4. Nocodazole-mediated cell-cycle arrest was accompanied by higher rate of apoptosis and upregulation of p 53. Twenty-four hours after the release from <b>nocodazole</b> block, the cell cycle of hESC normalised, but no increase in the expression of transcription markers Nanog and Oct 4 was detected. In addition, the presence of ROCK- 2 inhibitor Y- 27632 in the medium had no effect on increasing the expression of pluripotency markers Nanog and Oct 4 or decreasing apoptosis or the level of p 53. The expression of SSEA- 3 and SSEA- 4 increased in Nanog-positive cells after wash-out of <b>nocodazole</b> in the presence and in the absence of Y- 27632. Our data show that in hESC <b>nocodazole</b> reversible blocks cell cycle, which is accompanied by irreversible loss of expression o...|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of protein}} kinase C (PKC) {{increases}} microtubule (MT) growth lifetimes, resulting in extension of a nocodazole-sensitive population of MTs in Aplysia growth cones. We examined whether the two phorbol ester-activated PKCs in Aplysia, the Ca 2 �-activated PKC Apl I and the Ca 2 �-independent PKC Apl II, {{are associated with}} these MTs. Phorbol esters translocated PKC to the Triton X- 100 -insoluble fraction, and {{a significant portion of}} this translocated pool was sensitive to low concentrations of <b>nocodazole.</b> Low doses of <b>nocodazole</b> had no effect on the amount of PKC in the Triton X- 100 insoluble fraction in the absence of phorbol esters, whereas higher doses of <b>nocodazole</b> reduced basal levels of PKC Apl II. The F-actin cytoskeletal disrupter, latrunculin A, removed both PKCs from the Triton X- 100 -insolubl...|$|E
