40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the behavioral characteristics of foreign children in an unauthorized nursery school using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and to confirm the effectiveness of SDQ for multicultural childcare. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was assessed by <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> and parents of 23 children aged 4 – 6 years, including 18 Brazilians and 5 Japanese. Based on this survey, the following points became clear. (1) The results of Brazilian parents matched less than those of Japanese parents with those of <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers.</b> (2) In the case of support required, the recognition of <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> is likely to match with the result of parents. There are two types of deviation of the evaluation between the <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> and Brazilian parents. In this study, SDQ functions effectively for promoting a common understanding about the state of the child between parents and the <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to elucidate what students learn from on-site <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> in <b>nursery</b> school practice, to investigate what should be improved in nursery school practice, and to examine the coordination with <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> in the training system of students. The study method involved content analysis of reports of 51 students who were trained in nursery school practice. The students learned from <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> about the support necessary for children s growth and development and they learned about relationships and communication with a group of children. After receiving training from the <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers,</b> the students changed the way they interacted with children. There were {{only a small number of}} nursery teachers'reports on the direct training of students, and there was no report on nursing employment in the nursery school. This study enabled the review of goals in nursery school practice and made evident what needed to be improved in past training. Further study is necessary to examine the effect of nursery school practice on students' understanding of roles of other professionals in their future nursing practice. 本研究の目的は、保育所実習で学生が現場の保育士から学ぶ点を明らかにし、今後の保育所実習の改善点や、学生指導体制における保育士との連携を検討することである。研究方法は、保育所実習を実施した学生 51 名の報告書を内容分析の手法を用いて分析した。その結果、学生は保育士から子どもの成長発達に必要な援助や子ども集団との関係およびコミュニケーションを学習していたことが明らかとなった。また、保育士の指導から子どもとの関わり方を変化させていたが、保育士の学生への直接指導の報告は少なく、保育所看護職についての報告はゼロであった。さらに、保育所実習の目標の見直しや事前学習の改善点が見出せた。今後は、保育所実習を経験したことが将来の看護実践において、他職種の役割理解にどう影響するか検討する必要がある...|$|R

40|$|The {{preschool}} and school periods {{are the most}} important time for intensive music education. In order to successfully enhance a child’s musical development, <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> should ensure that music activities are equally represented within the programme (singing, playing musical instruments, listening to music, listening to music during creative activities, creating music itself, didactic music games). One of the principles that should be followed by <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> and is set out in the Slovene Kindergarten Curriculum (1999) is the principle of a balanced programme. The main purpose of this thesis was to establish if the <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> from kindergartens (“Vrtec Martin Krpan Cerknica”, “Vrtec Postojna”, nursery unit at “Tone Šraj’s Elementary School Nova vas” and from kindergarten “Polhek at Janez Hribar’s Elementary School Stari trg pri Ložu”) follow the guidelines of a balanced programme for musical activities. In addition to that, the thesis’s main focus was to examine to what extent the level of education, additional musical training and years of service influence the implementation of a balanced musical programme. The findings from this thesis suggest that regardless of the level of education, additional musical training or years of service, <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> observed during the research do not follow the principle of a balanced programme of musical activities. Activities which combine creativity while listening to music and creating music itself are the least implemented. ...|$|R

Infants weren’t interested in tap or sink at all before <b>nursery</b> <b>teachers</b> introduced washing-hands habit, but infants were interested in and started exploration of tap and sink thereafter.
