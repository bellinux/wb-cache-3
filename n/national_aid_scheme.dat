40|$|The {{pro bono}} {{activity}} of the private legal profession in a given society can best be understood {{as part of a}} partnership between the profession and government. The purpose of that partnership is for the profession, together with government, to take responsibility to try to ensure that, in theory, all citizens are equal before the law. The precise nature of that partnership varies widely between societies. Regan examines recent pro bono developments in Sweden and China. In the former country pro bono work by the profession had, until recently, disappeared but recent restrictions upon legal aid prompted the profession to re-establish a basic scheme. In China the recently established <b>national</b> legal <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> relies heavily upon the pro bono efforts of the emerging private profession...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is focused on evaluating NSFAS as student funding at South African Universities. Problem Investigated Public universities in South Africa witnessed student protests on campuses during 2015 and 2016. These were orchestrated by students demanding additional funding assistance from the <b>National</b> Student Financial <b>Aid</b> <b>Scheme</b> (NSFAS), zero-fee increases and the scrapping of student debt by universities. In 2012 a report for feefree university education for poor people was handed to the Minister of Higher Education and Training (DHET, 2012). It suggested that fee-free higher education would be possible if more funds were injected into the NSFAS (DHET, 2012 : 49). It is not currently known how much funding is required to fund both the poor students and the missing middle students who earn beyond the NSFAS eligibility threshold. Methodology A quantitative research method was used. Information on student funding at a specific period, was collected using different universities to corroborate the data received in order to solve the research problem. The approach assisted in identifying how student funding is allocated per university in a specific academic year. Value of the research The higher education sector is constantly evolving. The past struggle of universities was to ensure that they attracted the best academics and students. The focus has now changed to the student struggle on matters of academic exclusion, financial exclusion and the decolonising of universities. The study of student funding in South [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This study into {{understanding}} {{the dynamics of}} part-time studies at UWC is part of on-going institutional research that is required to improve the conditions of and services to part-time students at UWC. Approximately 23 % of UWC’s students are part-time in any one year. One of DLL’s mandates is to grow and develop the part-time programme. Through the DLL Board {{there has been an}} enquiry into financing part-time students through the <b>National</b> Student Financial <b>Aid</b> <b>Scheme</b> (NSFAS). This has lead the Board to pose questions about the dynamics of the part-time programme {{and what it means to}} be part-time at UWC 2. This paper is a preliminary report in progress and covers three of the following research aims. A subsequent paper will cover recommendations for improving the quality of part-time programme. The research aims of this documents are: (1) To help the institution think about the future of the part-time programme amidst the many shifts in national policy that affect the part-time programme, (2) to create clarity about the part-time terminology, (3) to get a better understanding of the actual dynamics of the part-time programme at UWC and the student profiles in terms of study patterns, class attendance (during the day or during after hours), payments records and need for financial aid, (4) To generate practical recommendations for quality enhancement of the part-time programme in terms of protocols for quality improvement and contractual obligations, staff development processes and student support.

However, NGOs and charities are ineligible to legal aid. This has prompted cases in which these NGOs and charities invited persons who lacked particular interests in the litigation but qualified for legal aid to stand as the applicant.
