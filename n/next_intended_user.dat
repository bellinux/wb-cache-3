We conceptualise the anticipation of <b>intended</b> <b>users</b> {{as a form of}} prospective sensemaking in technology development. Employing a narrative analytical approach and drawing on four key communities in the development of Grid computing, we reconstruct how each community anticipated the <b>intended</b> Grid <b>user.</b> Based on our findings, we conceptualise user anticipation in Terms of two key dimensions, namely the intended possibility to inscribe user needs into the technological artefact as well as the intended scope of the application domain. In turn, these dimensions allow us to develop an initial typology of <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> concepts that in turn might provide a key building block towards a generic typology of <b>intended</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

In this article, we draw on CTA’s experience with providing a broad range of targeted agricultural information products and services for the past 25 years to identify four guiding principles for designing and pro-viding agricultural information products and services that meet the specific information needs of the <b>intended</b> <b>users</b> or user groups. One principle stands out: “always put the stakeholders (i. e. <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> or user groups) before the product or serv-ice”. e other three principles relate to different aspects of the interrelationship between the <b>intended</b> <b>users</b> and service pro-viders, with the products or services themselves being of sec-ondary importance.

30|$|In Fig.  2, {{we compare}} the {{radiation}} beam patterns of robust and non-robust leakage-bounded angular beamforming for a user that {{is located at}} approximately (ϕ,θ)=(22 °, 95 °) (indicated with the green circle) and nine leakage areas corresponding to the other U− 1 users (indicated in black). In this example, we set the maximum tolerable interference level to Lmax=− 40 dB relative to the unit transmit power. In Fig.  2 (left), we observe that the radiation pattern of non-robust leakage-bounded angular beamforming shows very narrow valleys wherever interference leakage constraints are active. Therefore, the transmission to the <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> does not cause substantial interference to the other users, provided the angular CSIT is accurate. However, due to the narrow width of the valleys at the interference leakage constraints, the residual inter-user inference grows significantly if the angular CSIT is not accurate. To compensate for such angular uncertainty, we consider interference leakage uncertainty regions of width ψmax in the robust leakage-bounded angular beamformer. As shown in Fig.  2 (right), the interference leakage is then low over the entire uncertainty regions, thus improving the robustness with respect to imperfect angular CSIT. However, the maximum achievable gain of the <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> is slightly reduced, since {{it is not possible}} any more to perfectly steer the signal power towards the <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> while still satisfying all leakage constraints. Therefore, there exists a trade-off between the achievable signal gain of the <b>intended</b> <b>user</b> and the robustness of the interference leakage constraints.|$|R
