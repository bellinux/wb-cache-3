6000|$|Let me {{acknowledge}} with boundless pleasure the singularly {{generous and}} beautiful letter, signed by your great and dazzling array and reinforced by a correspondingly bright material gage, which reached {{me on my}} recent birthday, April 15th. It has moved me as brave gifts and benedictions can only do when they come as signal surprises. I seem {{to wake up to}} an air of breathing good will the full sweetness of which I had never yet tasted; though I ask myself <b>now,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> thought, how the large kindness and hospitality in which I have so long and so consciously lived among you could fail to act itself out according to its genial nature and by some inspired application. The perfect grace with which it has embraced the just-past occasion for its happy thought affects me, I ask you to believe, with an emotion too deep for stammering words. I was drawn to London long years ago as by the sense, felt from still earlier, of all the interest and association I should find here, and I now see how my faith was to sink deeper foundations than I could presume ever to measure--how my justification was both stoutly to grow and wisely to wait. It is so wonderful indeed to me as I count up your numerous and various, your dear and distinguished friendly names, taking in all they recall and represent, that I permit myself to feel at once highly successful and extremely proud. I had never in the least understood that I was the one or signified that I was the other, but you have made a great difference. You tell me together, making one rich tone of your many voices, almost the whole story of my social experience, which I have reached the right point for living over again, with all manner of old times and places renewed, old wonderments and pleasures reappeased and recaptured--so that there is scarce one of your ranged company but makes good the particular connection, quickens the excellent relation, lights some happy train and flushes with some individual colour. I pay you my very best respects while I receive from your two hundred and fifty pair of hands, and more, the admirable, the inestimable bowl, and while I engage to sit, with every accommodation to the so markedly indicated [...] "one of you," [...] my illustrious friend Sargent. With every accommodation, I say, but with this one condition that you yourselves, in your strength and goodness, remain guardians of the result of his labour--even as I remain all faithfully and gratefully yours, ...|$|E
50|$|However, {{the kingdom}} was not broken. Within {{a year of}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Mongols, the three westernmost counties (Moson, Sopron, and Vas) that were extorted as ransom by Duke Frederick of Austria were recaptured, and a local uprising in Slavonia was quashed. The threat of another Mongol invasion, this time taken seriously, was the source of national unity and provided the impetus for Béla IV's extensive expansion of Hungarian defenses, especially the building of new stone castles (forty-four in the first ten years) and the revitalization of the army, including expanding the number of heavily armoured cavalry and knights in the royal army. Béla IV is seen <b>now</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> founder of the nation, partly in recognition of all that was done during his reign to reconstruct and fortify the country against foreign invasion from the east. These improvements were to pay off in 1285 when Nogai Khan attempted an invasion of the country. In that event, the invasion was defeated quickly, as were a number of other attacks before and after.|$|E

It {{was built in}} Port Jefferson <b>as</b> <b>a</b> common meeting place for the town {{and at one point}} functioned as the high school gymnasium after a fire. The building that was built <b>as</b> basically <b>a</b> large cube was finally cut in half to produce the theatre upstairs with raked seating and lobbies and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> stage underneath. Athena Hall ultimately became a popular vaudeville house where a number of famous acts would pass through weekly. As vaudeville waned, Athena Hall became used more <b>as</b> <b>a</b> movie theatre.

Sharpe falls into a deep depression, worsened by {{conflict}} with other officers in the Rifles, who relegate him to the role of Quartermaster, and leave him in barracks when the regiment is posted to the Baltic in 1807. Sharpe, unable to sell his commission, plans to desert. He returns to Wapping to rob and kill Jem Hocking, the abusive master of the foundling home where Sharpe was raised. Before Sharpe can disappear with the stolen cash, he encounters General Baird, a former colleague from India, who recruits him to protect John Lavisser, a Foreign Office agent sent to negotiate with the Danish Crown Prince. Lavisser betrays Sharpe, and forces him into hiding in Copenhagen, where he witnesses the bombardment {{of the city and the}} British capture of the Danish fleet (Sharpe's Prey).

40|$|Tanah Merah is {{currently}} a new emerging urban area where it is <b>now</b> place <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> most urban area in Kelantan after Kota Bharu. Tanah Merah consists of 3 small districts namely are Kusial, Ulu Kusial and Jedok are divided into 15 smaller areas called mukim that cover by 867. 6 km² area. The latest statistics published by Ministry of Housing and Local Authorities, in 2010 total population of Tanah Merah is 116880 people. Although Kelantan is considered as undeveloped state but its major cities such as Kota Bharu and Tanah Merah is growing fast and experiencing rapid expansion. Level of urbanization can be measured by measuring the total urban area within the city, considering its parameters and an annual urban area growth rate. As the impact of urbanization, it should be take into consideration such {{as the need for}} better transportation system, efficient water supply system, the need of wider or extra residential, industrial and commercial area as well as better waste management system. Waste can be divided into many categories and compositions. Some of the categories are municipal solid waste, industrial waste, residential waste, agricultural waste, clinical waste etc. The most common composition of waste is food waste, plastics, metals, woods and papers. One {{of the most important things}} in managing solid waste is the landfill area where the wastes are disposed. The location and size of landfill area must be decided with certain considerations so that the wastes from landfill area will not cause pollution to the environment and give bad health effect to the people who reside in the nearest residential area. This study focuses on the impact of urban growth towards waste production in recently growing city in Kelantan which is Tanah Merah using data collected using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) as it is the most applicable and widely accepted methods to estimate the amount of waste that may be produced. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the problems faced by women who have to leave home because of violence; the helpfulness of the individuals and agencies to which they turn for assistance, and, in particular, the usefulness of the refuge <b>as</b> <b>a</b> response to the problems of battered women. The study involved carrying out semi-structured interviews with women at the refuge and then re-interviewing them after they had left. The follow-up interview took place between one and two years after the first interview. Interviews were also carried out with the women who were involved in setting up and running the refuge during the first two years of its existence. In-depth interviews were also carried out with a sub-sample of women. Quantitative material from the first wave of structured questionnaire interviews comprised an early edition of this collection. The National Social Policy and Social Change Archive (NSPSCA) at the University of Essex contains the second wave in-depth interviews in paper format. Digitised copies of this collection, along with the material deposited earlier is <b>now</b> available <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> edition. Main Topics : Variables The study had three main themes: (1) An analysis of each woman's perception of her problems and of her own evaluation of any 'solutions' which she had been offered by her family and friends, by agencies such as the social services, the housing department, the police and the medical profession, and by the refuge and those who lived and worked there. (2) An analysis of the changing institutional structure of the refuge, an evaluation of the extent to which the self-help principle seemed relevant to the needs of the women, and an attempt to assess the value to each woman of her stay at the refuge <b>as</b> <b>a</b> resource to help her cope with her difficulties. (3) An analysis of each woman's situation before, during, and after her stay at the refuge. This analysis involved a consideration of the domestic situation of each woman and of the pattern of structured constraints within which she had to make decisions about the future of herself and her children...|$|R
40|$|Custom {{genome editing}} {{has become an}} {{essential}} element of molecular biology. In particular, the generation of fusion constructs with epitope tags or fluorescent proteins at the genomic locus facilitates the analysis of protein expression, localization, and interaction partners at physiologic levels. Following up on our initial publication, we now describe a considerably simplified, more efficient, and readily scalable experimental workflow for PCR-based genome editing in cultured Drosophila melanogaster cells. Our analysis at the act 5 C locus suggests that PCR-based homology arms of 60 bp are sufficient to reach targeting efficiencies of up to 80 % after selection; extension to 80 bp (PCR) or 500 bp (targeting vector) did not further improve the yield. We have expanded our targeting system to N-terminal epitope tags; this also allows the generation of cell populations with heterologous expression control of the tagged locus via the copper-inducible mtnDE promoter. We present detailed, quantitative data on editing efficiencies for several genomic loci that may serve as positive controls or benchmarks in other laboratories. While our first PCR-based editing approach offered only blasticidin-resistance for selection, we <b>now</b> introduce puromycin-resistance <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> independent selection marker; it is thus possible to edit two loci (e. g., for coimmunoprecipitation) without marker removal. Finally, we describe a modified FLP recombinase expression plasmid that improves the efficiency of marker cassette FLP-out. In summary, our technique and reagents enable a flexible, robust, and cloning-free genome editing approach that can be parallelized for scale-up...|$|R
40|$|The pathogenetic {{relevance}} of Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin in humans has been debated because human cells have been thought {{to display a}} natural resistance toward the cytotoxic action of this cytolysin. Following our previous demonstration that human platelets represent sensitive targets for toxin attack, we have <b>now</b> identified monocytes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> highly vulnerable human cell species that succumb to attack by low doses (20 ng/ml) of alpha-toxin. The cytotoxic action of alpha-toxin is reflected in a rapid depletion of cellular ATP that is essentially complete within 30 min. The presence of human plasma proteins affords some protection of monocytes against {{the action of the}} toxin. In 10 % autologous serum, ATP depletion commences at 80 to 300 ng of toxin per ml. Subcytolytic doses stimulate the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, a process that is slightly accentuated in the presence of 50 % serum. Cytocidal toxin doses unfailingly cause the release of large amounts of interleukin- 1 beta from cultured cells, with levels of this monokine generally exceeding 10 ng/ml in the cell supernatants 60 min after application of toxin. Initial evidence suggests that this is due to processing of intracellular interleukin- 1 rather than to de novo synthesis of the cytokine. All noted effects are abrogated {{in the presence of a}} neutralizing monoclonal antibody against alpha-toxin. Through its capacity to provoke cytokine release from monocytes and its attack on platelets, alpha-toxin may initiate cellular events that are relevant to the pathogenesis of staphylococcal infection...|$|R
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} the University of Maine in 1971 Battiste went on {{to work at the}} Maine Indian Education Council where she {{introduced}} and developed an early childhood education program, Head Start, on three reservations and in multiple off reservation communities. Battiste spent twenty-five years in Cape Breton where she worked alongside James (Sakej) Youngblood Henderson with young Mi’kmaq students helping them become teacher and lawyers, as well as fighting for their admittance into universities. The work Battiste and Henderson did together grew the number of Mi’kmaq teachers from a few to sixty, and the addition of ten lawyers where there had previously been none. Battiste has worked in the field of Indian education for over thirty years with her most well known work being the revitalization of Mi'kmaq language in her home community in Chapel Island, Nova Scotia. She credits her doctoral dissertation as one of the many starting points interest in revitalizing the native language saying that a conversation with her advisor about the multiple writing systems of the Mi'kmaq language inspired her to research the histories of these writing systems. There are three different methods for writing with two still in use the first and most commonly used is the Pacifique system and the second and more controversial method being the Francis-Smith system. According to Battiste the Francis-Smith system of writing comes with more controversy for many reasons but the primary reason being, as she puts it, [...] "reflecting {{the fact that we are}} <b>now</b> using English <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> language in most of our communities," [...] and [...] "it seems to undercut the power of the old language for many." [...] Throughout her many years of work in education Battiste has taught a various schools in Nova Scotia including time spent as the Education Director and Principle on the Chapel Island reserve from 1984 to 1988. Battiste is sometimes called a “guru” of aboriginal education and serves as the academic director of the University of Saskatchewan’s aboriginal education research center. She has also served on a multitude of different boards <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> delegate to the United Nations' Workshop on Indigenous Peoples and Higher Education.|$|R
