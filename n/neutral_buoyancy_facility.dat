50|$|Fortunately, the Hubble {{telescope}} {{had been}} designed to allow in-space maintenance, and in December 1993, mission STS-61 carried astronauts to the Hubble to make corrections and change some components. A second repair mission, STS-82, was made in February 1997, and a third, STS-103, in December 1999. For these repair missions, the astronauts practiced the work in MSFC's <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> <b>Facility,</b> simulating the weightless environment of space.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force was {{pursuing}} the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL), {{a small space}} station with a two-man crew, primarily intended for photo reconnaissance. For five years, MOL competed with a NASA station for funding but was finally dropped.For testing and mission simulation, a 75 ft-diameter water-filled tank, the <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> <b>Facility,</b> was opened at MSFC in March 1968. Engineers and astronauts used this underwater facility to simulate the weightlessness (or zero-g) environment of space. This was particularly used in training astronauts in activities in zero-g work, especially spacewalks.|$|E
50|$|The NBRF {{is located}} at the University of Maryland in the US. The pool has a {{diameter}} of 50 ft and a depth of 25 ft. It was built in 1992, and is the only <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> <b>facility</b> on a college campus. The NBRF is part of the Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) which was originally located at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It split from MIT when the SSL was awarded a grant from NASA to build a dedicated neutral buoyancy pool. Since there was not enough space at MIT for the pool, it was decided to move the SSL to the University of Maryland.|$|E
40|$|Virtual reality (VR) {{provides}} a means to practice integrated extravehicular activities (EVA) /remote manipulator system (RMS) operations in the on-orbit configuration with no discomfort or risk to crewmembers. VR afforded the STS- 61 crew the luxury of practicing the integrated EVA/RMS operations in an on-orbit configuration prior to the actual flight. The VR simulation {{was developed by the}} Automation and Robotics Division's Telepresence/Virtual Reality Lab and Integrated Graphics, Operations, and Analysis Lab (IGOAL) at JSC. The RMS Part Task Trainer (PTT) was developed by the IGOAL for RMS training in 1988 as a fully functional, kinematic simulation of the shuttle RMS and served as the RMS portion of the integrated VR simulation. Because the EVA crewmember could get a realistic view of the shuttle and payload bay in the VR simulation, he/she could explore different positions and views to determine the best method for performing a specific task, thus greatly increasing the efficiency of use of the <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Various {{methods have}} been to {{simulate}} reduced gravity environments for space systems research and development. <b>Neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> {{has been the most}} universally used simulation of zero-g. This paper describes the facilities, personnel and experimental work that are associated with the <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> Test <b>Facility</b> (NBTF) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). This facility provides a unique underwater environment for the researcher to simulate reduced gravity activities and evaluate the performances of space-related equipment. The NBTF's small size gives it several advantages over larger water facilities. Second, the facility is used for research purposes only, eliminating any scheduling conflicts with astronaut training. Lastly, the small volume of water allows the researcher to more easily vary the water temperature. This feature is ideal for investigations of astronaut thermal comfort and regulation. Recent investigations have used the NBTF for reduced gravity simulation of locomotion and load-carrying, among other interesting research endeavors...|$|R
50|$|For China's Shenzhou astronauts, {{training}} {{begins with}} a year-long program {{of education in the}} basics of spaceflight. During this period, candidates are also introduced to human physiology and psychology. The second phase of training, lasting nearly 3 years involves extensive training in piloting the Shenzhou vehicle in nominal and emergency modes. The third and final stage of training is mission specific training, and lasts approximately 10 months. During this phase of training, astronauts are trained in the high fidelity Shenzhou trainer, as well as the <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> <b>Facility</b> located at the Astronaut Center of China (ACC), in Beijing. As well as time spent in the NBF, training for EVA takes place in a high vacuum, low temperature chamber that simulates the environmental conditions of space. At all stages of training, astronauts undergo physical conditioning, including time in a human centrifuge located at the ACC, and a program of microgravity flights, carried out in Russia.|$|E

40|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> <b>facilities</b> {{are used}} to prepare astronauts and cosmonauts for extra {{vehicular}} activities e. g. on-board of the International Space Station. While previous studies indicated a decrease in cognitive performance in an under water setting, they have only provided behavioural data. This study aimed to review whether recording of electro cortical activity {{by the use of}} electroencephalography (EEG) is possible in an under water setting and if so, to identify the influence of water immersion at a depth of 4 m on neurocognitive markers. Ten male subjects performed a cognitive choice-reaction times (RT) task that progressed through five levels of increasing difficulty on land and when submerged 4 m under water. N 200 latency and amplitude in the occipital and frontal areas were measured, and baseline cortical activity was measured during rest in both conditions. Neither RT nor amplitude or latency of the N 200 showed any significant changes between the land and the under water conditions. Also theta, alpha and beta frequencies showed no differences between the two conditions. The data provided in this study demonstrate the possibility of recording EEG even under the extreme conditions of full body water immersion. The lack of cognitive impairment in RT and N 200 in the under water condition may be {{explained by the fact that}} only experienced divers participated in the study. As a proof of principle, this study generates many new experimental possibilities that will improve our understanding of cognitive processes under water...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the challenges and}} discoveries arising from an ambitious workshop designed to introduce participants of the International Space University, Southern Hemisphere Summer Space Program to the rigors of EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity or spacewalk) and the complexities of working in <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> <b>facilities</b> (WET) and interdisciplinary networked environments (DRY). Conducted with two teams of 20 people, over two days, and across two-locations, the EVA simulation training exercise aimed at challenging and connecting the activities {{of participants in the}} water with those of a remote mission control. The mission objective was to perform a simulated EVA to complete the installation of the D&# 039;Underarm (an Australian response to the Canadarm). Under the supervision and remote control of a mission control centre, the space walkers, wearing regular SCUBA gear in a 3 -meter deep pool, were to egress through an airlock (simulated by hula hoops); transport hardware and tools to the work-site using specific tethering protocols; complete the hardware installation with semi-real time rudimentary instructions from mission control; attach a calibration tool {{to the end of the}} installation; manoeuvre the D&# 039;Underarm to perform an inspection, and translate back to the airlock with their tools. We highlight the activities to report on the lessons-learned and the recommendations for future low-cost educational EVA Simulations, covering aspects including operational design considerations for the systems installation, the configuration and operation of crew aids, tools, communications and operational protocols...|$|R
50|$|The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) {{is part of}} the Aerospace Engineering Department and A. James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. The Space Systems Laboratory is {{centered}} on the <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> Research <b>Facility,</b> a 50 ft, 25 ft <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> pool used to simulate the microgravity environment of space. The only such facility housed at a university, Maryland's <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> tank is used for undergraduate and graduate research at the Space Systems Lab. Research in Space Systems emphasizes space robotics, human factors, applications of artificial intelligence and the underlying fundamentals of space simulation. There are currently five robots being tested, including Ranger, a four-armed satellite repair robot, and SCAMP, a six-degree of freedom free-flying underwater camera platform. Ranger was funded by NASA starting in 1992, and was to be a technological demonstration of orbital satellite servicing. NASA was never able to manifest it for launch and the program was defunded circa 2006. For example, Ranger development work at the SSL continues, albeit at a slower pace; Ranger was used to demonstrate robotic servicing techniques for NASA's proposed robotic Hubble Servicing Mission.|$|R

40|$|Current {{economic}} constraints {{indicate the}} need for incorporating the satellite servicing philosophy of commonality within the design of spacecraft subsytems. This philosophy is essential for conserving resources including hardware/software development and implementation costs, on-orbit and ground-based manpower, crew training/testing time, and documentation. In addition, spacecraft subsystem commonality may be coupled with standardization of operation procedures, and test and verification techniques for spacecraft design. Several spacecraft have adopted this practice, including Hubble Space Telescope, Space Station Freedom, and the Explorer Platform. As these and other programs continue and if effective crew interfaces and procedures are clearly and consistently defined, crew retraining for similar spacecraft subsystems will lessen, and procurement efforts will diminish. A relatively high fidelity zero-gravity simulation using water immersion is available to establish crew interfaces economically. The flexibility and utility of this space simulation medium for planning and assisting on-orbit operations was exemplified by astronaut evaluations of potential EVA electrical connectors. The testing was conducted at a NASA underwater <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> training <b>facility...</b>|$|R
40|$|The International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> Simulation was {{conducted}} at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> Simulator <b>facility</b> during April and May 1992.

25|$|<b>Neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> is not {{identical}} to weightlessness.
