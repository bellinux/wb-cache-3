25|$|The {{incompressible}} <b>Navier–Stokes</b> <b>equation</b> is a differential algebraic equation, {{having the}} inconvenient feature {{that there is}} no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from {{all or part of the}} computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{velocity}} u {{is not a}} function of position x along the plate, the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x is also independent of x (but the pressure p varies linearly with x). Moreover, the <b>Navier–Stokes</b> <b>equation</b> for {{the velocity}} component perpendicular to the wall reduces to ∂p/∂z=0, so the pressure p and pressure gradient ∂p/∂x are also independent of {{the distance to the}} wall z. In conclusion, the pressure forcing ∂p/∂x can only be a function of time t.|$|E

The moving liquid droplet is modeled by the incompressible <b>Navier-Stokes</b> <b>equations,</b> the surrounding rarefied gas by the Boltzmann equation. The interface boundary conditions between the gas and liquid phases are derived.

2500|$|In some {{applications}} another rough broad division among fluids is made: {{ideal and}} non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a shearing force. [...] An ideal fluid really does not exist, {{but in some}} calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One {{example of this is}} the flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is negleted, the term containing the viscous stress tensor [...] in the <b>Navier–Stokes</b> <b>equation</b> vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called the Euler equation.|$|E
