40|$|We {{investigate}} the quantum versus classical dynamics of a microwave cavity-coupled-Cooper pair transistor (CPT) system, where an applied dc bias causes {{the system to}} self-oscillate via the ac Josephson effect. Varying the dc bias allows the self-oscillation frequency to be tuned. An unusual feature of the system design is that the dc bias does not significantly affect the high quality factor of the cavity mode to which the CPT predominantly couples. The CPT-cavity mode system has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled pendulum-oscillator system. The corresponding, nonlinear classical dynamical equations exhibit chaotic, as well as aperiodic motions depending on the initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping/noise forces. The quantum master equation exhibits such phenomena as dynamical tunneling and the generation of non-classical states from initial classical states. Obviating {{the need for an}} external ac-drive line, which typically is harder to noise filter than a dc bias line, the self-oscillating system described here has considerable promise for demonstrating macroscopic quantum dynamical behavior.

30|$|Third, {{technology}} has almost certainly played a pivotal role. Cameras have gotten lighter and smaller, enhancing {{the use of}} close-ups and of motion (Bordwell, 2006).

But perhaps most important are the effects of <b>nonlinear</b> (nondestructive) digital <b>editing.</b> This process, which began to be available in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, can be much faster than the old cut-and-paste method for analog film, and it more easily allows for “errors” and changes. One can create and then see the results of one’s pacemaking in scenes and larger film units more readily and quickly.|$|R
40|$|Software Copying One {{ideal of}} digital media {{production}} software and technology is open file compatibility and exchange. Unrestricted transfer and duplication facilitates professional production, {{but may also}} facilitate improper reuse. This paper describes several pedagogical concerns and curricular adaptations that have arisen in dealing with student plagiarism issues in digital photography, non-linear video editing, and other digital-file-based university courses. The paper notes that conflicts exist between the open nature of digital media {{and the need to}} control dishonesty, and that technical and pedagogical methods developed to flag or obstruct ease of transport and reuse may undermine both applications and instructional design. It first focuses on what the issue is in general, what the digital plagiarism issue is, and how to detect and discourage plagiarized text. The paper then considers the plagiarism potential in photography, desktop publishing, and Web design courses, discussing how a digital still image can be stolen and how to detect and discourage digital still image plagiarism. It covers potential plagiarism in digital video editing projects, discussing how to steal a <b>nonlinear</b> video <b>editing</b> project and suggesting that the most effective solution is to change the methods of teaching and evaluation.

50|$|The {{hardware}} {{component is}} again a card {{designed for the}} Amiga's Zorro II expansion slot, and was primarily designed by Charles Steinkuehler. The Flyer portion of the Video Toaster/Flyer combination is a complete computer of its own, having its own microprocessor and embedded software, which was written by Marty Flickinger. Its hardware includes three embedded SCSI controllers. Two of these SCSI buses are used to store video data, and the third to store audio. The hard drives are thus connected to the Flyer directly and use a proprietary filesystem layout, rather than being connected to the Amiga's buses and were available as regular devices using the included DOS driver. The Flyer uses a proprietary wavelet compression algorithm known as VTASC, which was well-regarded at the time for offering better visual quality than comparable motion-JPEG-based <b>nonlinear</b> <b>editing</b> systems.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the film}} is shot in Méliès's usual style, in which a {{stationary}} camera allows the viewer to watch the film as if it were being played in scenes on a theatre stage. However, the scene in which the airplane lands in the Arctic is notable for an advanced editing technique in which the point of view becomes mobile rather than stationary. First, the plane is first seen coming directly toward the camera; then, in the next shot, the motion of the plane continues seamlessly, but the viewpoint has been rotated ninety degrees. In previous films, Méliès had sometimes used <b>nonlinear</b> <b>editing</b> for such moments, such as in A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage, in which the space capsule and dirigible, respectively, are shown landing twice. This scene in The Conquest of the Pole marks the first time Méliès fluently uses the mobile point of view, which had been pioneered by the [...] "Brighton School" [...] of filmmakers in England. However, Méliès revealed in 1929 that he had never found mobile techniques to be natural or particularly useful and that he still preferred the stationary camera techniques he had used.|$|E

[...] Vadim Rizov of IndieWire/Spout published a very favorable review praising the editing structure, [...] "Yaghoobian lives for tangents, by-ways, one-offs, weird interview interruptions and non sequiturs; this is the most-edited documentary I've seen in a while, and one of the best-edited too. She's amped up the non-linear, multi-dialectical logic of Fast, Cheap & Out Of Control to a faster tempo (if not as strangely affecting, it has an equally eccentric score by Mark Greenberg)."

40|$|Graphene {{and carbon}} {{nanotubes}} represent the ultimate size limit {{of one and}} two-dimensional nanoelectromechanical resonators. Because of their reduced dimensionality, graphene and carbon nanotubes display unusual mechanical behavior; in particular, their dynamics is highly nonlinear. Here, we review several types of nonlinear behavior in resonators made from nanotubes and graphene. We first discuss an unprecedented scenario where damping is described by a nonlinear force. This scenario is supported by several experimental facts: (i) the quality factor varies with the amplitude of the motion as a power law whose exponent coincides with the value predicted by the nonlinear damping model, (ii) hysteretic behavior (of the motional amplitude {{as a function of}} driving frequency) is absent in some of our resonators even for large driving forces, as expected when nonlinear damping forces are large, and (iii) when we quantify the linear damping force (by performing parametric excitation measurements) we find that it is significantly smaller than the nonlinear damping force. We then review parametric excitation measurements, an alternative actuation method which is based on nonlinear dynamics. Finally, we discuss experiments where the mechanical motion is coupled to electron transport through a nanotube. The coupling can be made so strong that the associated force acting on the nanotube becomes highly nonlinear with displacement and velocity. Overall, graphene and nanotube resonators hold promise for future studies on classical and quantum nonlinear dynamics.

The station also converted its main [...] "Studio 25" [...] production studio at the Wilshire Boulevard facility into a [...] "working newsroom" [...] set, which was similar in design to the [...] "NewsPlex" [...] set used by ABC affiliate KETV in Omaha from 1996 to 2015 (production of channel 25's newscasts remained in the newsroom until it was moved to a dedicated HD-ready news set built by Devlin Design Group in a renovated production studio within the building on April 13, 2014, which features a dedicated weather center, several large widescreen monitors and a multi-purpose area used for interviews, and the morning and Sports Sunday broadcasts). As the market's first prime time newscast, KOKH held steady in the 9:00 p.m. timeslot, even with competition from network programs on KFOR, KOCO-TV and KWTV. Under the direction of Henry Chu (who replaced Schadel as news director in the late summer of 1998), KOKH expanded the weeknight editions of the newscast to one hour in August 1998; this was followed by the addition of hour-long Sunday edition on September 12, 1999 and an hour-long Saturday edition that premiered the following month on October 2 (the latter of which, along with the Friday editions, was originally co-anchored by Brad Wheelis and Colleen O'Quinn, who both resigned in 2000 after failing to reach renewal terms in their contract negotiations). Prior to the expansion, The Nine O'Clock News only aired as a one-hour broadcast to cover significant breaking news events (such as for the death penalty sentencing of Murrah bombing conspirator Timothy McVeigh on June 13, 1997). To further cement its status as an alternative for KFOR, KWTV and KOCO's half-hour 10:00 p.m. shows, Chu also intended to expand the number of stories included on each night's broadcast, incorporating more national and international coverage than that covered on the market's other late newscasts.|$|E
