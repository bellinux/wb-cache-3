40|$|This {{collection}} {{offers an}} exploration of the dynamics behind contemporary shifts in the orientation of <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> and movements with reference to Catalonia and the Basque Country in Spain. The volume {{is one of the first}} to focus comparatively on the rise of pro-sovereignty politics in mainstream <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties,</b> whose evolution has also featured more traditional impulses towards territorial accommodation within the wider state. Using the exceptionally rich laboratory provided by Spain, the book explores the dynamics behind shifts in the orientation of <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> and movements once they have established themselves as electorally successful at regional level. Dimensions to the analysis include: the interaction of <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> with central government; pressures from their support bases; competition between parties within the home region; and international influences...|$|R
40|$|From {{the late}} 1980 s, European {{integration}} {{has been seen}} to have benefits for minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> in terms of setting the political agenda, reinforcing the role of regional governments and providing second-order electoral opportunities at European elections. However, recent EU enlargements have produced a negative environment for minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties,</b> evident {{in the loss of}} support and MEPs in the 2004 European election. This article examines the development of minority <b>nationalist</b> <b>parties</b> at the European level since 1979, and evaluates different potential explanations for the demise of the party family since 2004...|$|R

5|$|Lebrón {{was born}} and raised in Lares, Puerto Rico, where she joined the Liberal Party. In her youth she met Francisco Matos Paoli, a Puerto Rican poet, with whom she had a relationship.

Within the organization she advocated socialist and feminist ideas.|$|E
5|$|Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{officers}} {{were members of}} other anti-communist nationalist groups that were opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (<b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party),</b> which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border {{with the assistance of}} their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained {{officers were}} denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable.|$|E

5|$|As the {{political}} climate in New South Wales became more volatile after Lang's attempts to abolish the Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party)</b> amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1940s, various pro-independence groups, {{such as the}} Puerto Rican Independence Party, which {{believed}} in gaining the island's independence through the electoral process, and the Puerto Rican <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party,</b> which {{believed in}} the concept of armed revolution, existed in Puerto Rico. On October 30, 1950, the nationalists, under the leadership of Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayagüez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt) and Jayuya.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Puerto Rican <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> {{issued a}} limited amount of {{banknotes}} commemorating the Jayuya Uprising. The series included pesos of six denominations, including $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The designs of all banknotes feature Pedro Albizu Campos in the front side while the reverses are adorned with the flags of Puerto Rico, Jayuya and the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b> Microprint with the names of Pedro Albizu Campos and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos are found throughout the pesos. On July 10, 2005, Liberty Dollar of Puerto Rico was created by Alfredo Pacheco Martínez. Silver ounces began circulating on October 8, 2005, marking {{the first time that a}} silver coin was distributed in more than a century. After an intervention with parent company Liberty Services concluded with its assets being confiscated, leading to a process that resulted in the indictment and conviction of founder Bernard von NotHaus, Pacheco Martínez continued to circulate the coins under the name of Dólar Boricua. In August 2010, he was also indicted on the same charges faced by Von NotHaus. Pacheco Martínez was found guilty on June 29, 2012, being subsequently sentenced to 19 years in prison.|$|E

5|$|In Puerto Rico, Albizu Campos {{used the}} Rhoads scandal {{as part of}} his anti-colonial campaign, {{attracting}} followers to the <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party.</b> In 1950, longtime Puerto Rican pro-independence activists Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola tried to assassinate President Truman to bring their cause to the world stage. When later interviewed, Collazo said that as a young man, in 1932 he heard Albizu Campos speak about the Rhoads letter and decided to devote his life to the Nationalist movement.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{declared}} {{martial law}} in Puerto Rico {{and sent the}} Puerto Rico National Guard to attack Jayuya. The town was attacked by U.S. bomber planes and ground artillery. Even though part of the town was destroyed, news of this military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. It was called an incident between Puerto Ricans. The top leaders of the <b>nationalist</b> <b>party,</b> including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, were arrested and sent to jail to serve long prison terms.|$|E
5|$|Vietnam was {{in chaos}} after the Japanese invaded {{the country during}} World War II and {{displaced}} the French colonial administration. At {{the end of the}} war, the Japanese left the country and France, severely weakened by political turmoil within the Vichy regime, was unable to exert control. Hồ Chí Minh's Viet Minh declared independence as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and battled other Vietnamese nationalist groups as well as French forces for control of the nation. During this time, Cẩn organised a clandestine support base for Diệm in central Vietnam. At the time, Diệm was one of many nationalists who were attempting to stake a claim to national leadership, having spent a decade in self-imposed exile from public affairs. Cẩn helped weaken other anti-communist nationalist groups, such as the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (Vietnamese <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party)</b> and the Đại Việt Quốc Dân Đảng (<b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party</b> of Greater Vietnam), which competed with Diệm for support. On 23 October 1955, Diệm toppled Bảo Đại in a fraud-ridden referendum orchestrated by Nhu. Diệm declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican <b>Nationalist</b> <b>Party),</b> under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act {{that would allow the}} transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act's approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, to serve as an emissary and bring Betances' remains from France.|$|E
