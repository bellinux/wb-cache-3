Although this property is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{musical instrument}} of the Toraja is a bamboo flute called a Pa'suling (suling is an Indonesian word for flute). This six-holed flute (<b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the Toraja) is played at many dances, such as the thanksgiving dance Ma'bondensan, where the flute accompanies a group of shirtless, dancing men with long fingernails. The Toraja have indigenous musical instruments, such as the Pa'pelle (made from palm leaves) and the Pa'karombi (the Torajan version of a jaw harp). The Pa'pelle is played during harvest time and at house inauguration ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E
5|$|In other tables, {{lutetium}} and lawrencium {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium end (or sometimes succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. However, this resemblance in <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are {{endothermic}} ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") reptiles and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also endothermic, so endothermy is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> mammals.|$|E

5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection.

These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible.

40|$|We {{consider}} isomorphism {{properties of}} infinite random geometric graphs defined over {{a variety of}} metrics. In previous work, it was shown that for R^n with the L_∞-metric, the infinite random geometric graph is, with probability 1, <b>unique</b> up <b>to</b> isomorphism. However, in the case n= 2 this is false with either of the L_ 2 -metric. We generalize this result to a large family of metrics induced by norms. Within this class of metric spaces, we show that the infinite geometric graph is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> up <b>to</b> isomorphism if it has the new property which we name truncating: each step-isometry from a dense set to itself is an isometry. As a corollary, we derive that the infinite random geometric graph defined in L_p space is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> up <b>to</b> isomorphism with probability 1 for all finite p> 1. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{theme of}} Shiva as a beggar is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the Bhikshatana icon and his legends. Shiva is often {{described}} as wandering the universe as a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's raison d'être being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} self-decapitation and the severed head is {{recurring}} in Indian mythology. Legends from the Simhasana Dvatrimsika and the Kathasaritsagara speak {{of how the}} hero offers blood from his throat as an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (jhumjharji or bhomiya) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints of Christianity and in Celtic culture.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E

5|$|The {{leaves of}} N. rajah are very {{distinctive}} and reach a large size. They are leathery in texture with a wavy outer margin. The leaves are characteristically peltate, whereby the tendril joins the lamina on the underside, before the apex. This characteristic is {{more pronounced in}} N. rajah {{than in any other}} Nepenthes species, with the exception of N. clipeata. However, it is <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> <b>to</b> these two taxa, as mature plants of many Nepenthes species display slightly peltate leaves. The tendrils are inserted ≤5cm below the leaf apex and reach a length of approximately 50cm. Three to five longitudinal veins run along each side of the lamina and pennate (branching) veins run towards the margin. The lamina is oblong to lanceolate-shaped, ≤80cm long and ≤15cm wide.|$|E
