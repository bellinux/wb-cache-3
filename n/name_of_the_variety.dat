50|$|More than 60 {{distinct}} {{types of}} Mango cultivars collected from {{different parts of}} India were planted in the orchard during the fifties. Varietal characteristics are described here as observed at the farm. Almost all varieties have a wide range of adaptability under south Indian conditions and the performance of flowering and fruiting vary significantly based on climatic and soil factors. Also there could be considerable confusion in the nomenclature of a few varieties due to many synonyms for a single cultivar. In such cases, <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> along with common synonyms have been furnished. Most of the varieties grown at the farm were collected years ago from growers and nursery men and the names signify size, shape, colour, name of a place or king and even local dialects. Hybridisation works were undertaken at the farm in the sixties and 225 hybrids were brought out at the farm. Of the various hybrids assessed only a few had been found promising. Even among the hybrids of same parentage enormous variation in fruit size, shape, quality and bearing behavior were observed. A number of hybrid seedlings of each parental combination were planted in the orchard to select the desirable ones. Consequently, 4 varieties, namely H 45, H 56, H 87, H 151 were released. Details of other hybrids are mentioned elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Many {{data mining}} {{algorithms}} require numeric, preferably normalized (scaled) data i. e. within specific ranges. Agriculture data by default is non-numeric or nominal in nature.

However, most (if not all) the techniques {{are based on the}} statistical properties of the data, and thus miss the intrinsic and natural relationship among the attributes of a plant. We propose a mechanism of performing the mapping from nominal to numeric values (actually ranking) based on the transmittance as well as the statistical properties of the plant. Spectral analysis (using chemical means) is a tedious and time consuming process, thus difficult to repeat, each and every time, for classification of (numerically) unclassified cotton varieties. So a supporting statistical method is proposed based on linear regression curve fitting using normalized nominal attributes. Subsequently a rank is assigned to the variety based on its R 2 value and slope of the plot. This rank thus becomes the numeric equivalent of the nominal alphanumeric <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> being considered...|$|E
40|$|This study uses PCR-derived marker {{systems to}} {{investigate}} the extent and distribution of genetic variability of 80 Italian Prosecco accessions coming from Prosecco DOC area (north-east area of Italy). The studied samples include genotypes from Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia region. In order to verify the varietal identity of the samples, analyses based on 22 SSR loci were performed, and two grape varieties were found: Prosecco tondo and Prosecco lungo. In addition to microsatellite analysis, intra-varietal variability study was performed using AFLP, SAMPL, ISSR, and M-AFLP molecular markers. This molecular approach could discriminate different Prosecco tondo accessions coming from Treviso hills, from Veneto plain, from Friuli Venezia Giulia region, and from Padua hills (Serprina samples). As concerning Prosecco lungo variety, {{it was possible to}} discriminate molecularly the accessions from Veneto region and those from Friuli Venezia Giulia region.

The aim of the paper is to analyze the effect of some search attributes on wine price variability applying the Hedonic Price Model. It allows explaining how the price of wine varies depending on its main quality attributes. The analysis has been based on a sample of wines made in Puglia, Italian region characterized by a tradition in wine production and consumption. Data have been collected from a wine guidebook considering the years 2008 – 2013. The study provided a measure of the market value of some search attributes for wines produced in Puglia. Attributes as alcoholic content, age and score given by experts, influence price variability allowing wines to obtain a premium price, such as the most known Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and some Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). The <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> seems not to have high influence with the exception of less known and locally grown varieties. Results may be of interest for marketers and policy makers of wine industry. Managerial implications could refer to the importance of differentiation strategies aimed to market segmentation and to the pricing strategy. Policymakers could also find interesting hints about the influence of the different appellations and the importance of minor autochthonous grape varieties...|$|E

Other Tangsa groups have {{different}} names for the Moshang and the 'general name' is Mossang. In the orthography developed by Rev. Gam Win and others, the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety</b> is spelled Muexshaungx (where-x stands for a mid (level) tone). Moshang recordings in this archive have the code nst-mos as the first element of their names. This coding contains the ISO 639 - 3 code for all Tangsa languages (nst), in combination with an informal code for the Tangsa variety. Prior to 16 th February 2012, our Moshang recordings were named with the code SDM 19. Tangsa is the name given in India to groups in both Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh and in Assam speaking languages of the Northern Naga also known as Konyak group within the Tibeto-Burman language family. There is very considerable linguistic variety within Tangsa., and some of the languages included within Tangsa are linguistically closer to Nocte than to other varieties within Tangsa. The ethnologue code for Tangsa is NST. It is termed Naga-Tase in the Ethnologue. The word Tase is the Chamchang (General name Kimsing) pronunciation of the word Tangsa and was adopted by ISO 639 - 3 because Chamchang was the first variety to have a Christian Bible translation and thus was listed in the Ethnologue. There are a large number of Moshang villages in Arunachal Pradesh: Renuk, Chumpan, Tengman, Hedman, Barsatam, Sasoon, Ranghill, Headlong, Lingok (near Manmau), Febiro I, Febiro II, Therangkan, Khamkhai (near Nampong), Namphuk (near Balinong) and Namphai (near Miao), as well as a few families at Kharangkong in Assam, where, however, most people now speak Singpho rather than Moshang. The Moshang variety is nearly the same as Lungphi. Moshang is the variety chosen as the church language by the Hawa Naga Revival Church, based in Burma (Myanmar) ...|$|E
40|$|Hops {{has been}} grown in Saaz region for 700 years. The first written mention about local hop garden comes from 1348, {{but it is}} certain that the hop gardens were owned by brewers and church dignitaries even earlier. First, hops was grown on the monastery grounds on a large scale. Czech, and thus Saaz hops, reached its peak in the 19 th century, mainly for its fragrance, color and kontent of lupulin, and became a {{benchmark}} for determining the quality and price of hops. Kazbek is the first variety of "flavour hops" bred in the Czech Republic. Its unique sensory properties were examined with numerous brewing tests in several breweries of different sizes. Breeding of "flavour hops" is a real challenge for hop breeders. The first hop in that category, for example Citra, Amarillo, Simcoe, Bravo, were bred in the United States. Variety Kazbek was obtained by selecting progeny of the hybrid material, which has origins in Russian wild hops. It was registered in 2008 due to high stability and efficiency. Robustness and stability is expressed in the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variety,</b> because Kazbek is the highest mountain of the middle Caucasus. From the brewing point of view, it belongs among the bitter types. Saaz Late variety was obtained by selecting F 1 offspring of parental combination of unfinished breeding material that is the origin of Saaz. It has a charakter of late variety. Saaz Late is an aromatic variety for the second and third hopping. Aroma is genuine, fine, hoppy. The most important quality aspect of hops is alpha acids content. Content of alpha acids has been reagularly assessed since 1981. The evaluation results show, that the alpha acids kontent in varieties Saaz Late and Kazbek is proven statistically different. Selection of suitable location is the key element for cultivation of hybrid varieties. It is very important to focus on the evaluation of natural conditions of each location. This paper shows that there is no statistically significant difference between locations Stekník and Blšany. Optimal temperature for growth and subsequent yield formation should not drop below + 7 °C in April, + 11 °C in May and from June to August should range between + 15 and + 18 °C. The stability and balance of temperature is also important. Precipitation has a bigger 7 impact on yield formation than temperature. This statement was confirmed in 2015, when tropical temperatures and drought during the flowering and cone formation caused significant decrease of yield. Low yield leve...|$|E

30|$|The Bahau {{river was}} {{originally}} selected for this collection trip to test if traditional landraces from a geographically isolated region also showed evidence <b>of</b> genetic isolation. <b>The</b> degree <b>of</b> genetic isolation would {{have implications for}} using this germplasm for association studies, since a higher amount of linkage disequilibrium (LD) would be predicted within an isolated group, making whole genome LD scans more feasible. The Bahau river region can be considered isolated due to <b>the</b> immense area <b>of</b> forested land in the surrounding area, the extremely low population density, and the difficulty in traveling between villages. <b>The</b> only mode <b>of</b> transportation is <b>the</b> river: the Kayan river is wide and easily navigable from the ocean up to Long Bia for large boats, relatively easy to travel to Long Pujungan using a longboat, but only passable with small river boats upstream along the Bahau river (Supplementary Fig. 1). In particular the upper Bahau river is especially difficult to pass due to several rapids and variable river depths and traveling between villages is rare for the local villagers due to <b>the</b> high cost <b>of</b> motor fuel in this remote area. However, a test for geographical differentiation using the SSR data did not show any overall differences in the genetic makeup when the accessions were grouped according to the Kayan river, lower Bahau river, and upper Bahau river regions (Table  2). Furthermore, when local farmers were asked about <b>the</b> origins <b>of</b> their <b>varieties,</b> {{a number of instances}} of seed exchange between villages and even between regions were noted. Often <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>varieties</b> themselves reflect their origin: for instance a variety collected in Apau Ping that was named after another village along the Bahau river (P. Pulut Long Tebulo), a <b>variety</b> collected along <b>the</b> Bahau river named after a village in another region (P. Long Liyo), and a variety that was named after another region (P. Krayan). This evidence suggests that even if seed exchanges of traditional varieties between regions are infrequent, over time they have prevented any significant genetic differentiation from occurring. Thus, while isolated natural populations might be useful for association mapping due to higher levels of LD, our evidence suggests that more caution is needed when dealing with cultivated varieties, where geographic isolation does not necessarily lead to genetic isolation.|$|R

40|$|Teaching English as {{a foreign}} {{language}} is rooted in <b>the</b> national interest <b>of</b> English-speaking countries that promote their own culture throughout the world. To some extent, ‘culture’ is a byword for {{what has come to}} be known as the modern nation. Mainly the UK and the US are in <b>the</b> spotlight <b>of</b> EFL teaching and learning. At <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> other, less ‘sought-after’ varieties of English, British and American English make the case for British and American cultures. Essentially, this is all about Britishness and Americanness, as <b>the</b> very <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English <b>variety</b> testifies to <b>the</b> British or <b>the</b> American standard. <b>Of</b> course, <b>the</b> other choice, i. e. not to make a choice, is a statement on its own. One way or another, the attempt to pick and choose shapes teaching and learning EFL. However, English is associated with teaching cultural diversity more than other prestige languages. Despite the fact that its status has everything to do with <b>the</b> colonial empire <b>of</b> Great Britain, English highlights the conflict between <b>the</b> use made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother tongue to stereotype <b>the</b> non-native speaker <b>of</b> English and current Anglo- American multiculturalism. Effectively, language-use is supposed to shed light on the self-identification patterns that run deep in <b>the</b> literary culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Content and language integrated learning (CLIL) encompasses the above-mentioned and, if possible, everything else from <b>the</b> popular culture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English-speaking world. It feels safe to say that <b>the</b> intractable issue <b>of</b> “language teaching as political action” (Cook, 2016 : 228) has yet to be resolved in <b>the</b> classrooms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian public schools too...|$|R
