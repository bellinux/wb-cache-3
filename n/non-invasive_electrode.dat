This stimulates the distal production of jasmonates, potent regulators of defence responses. Using <b>non-invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> we mapped surface potential changes in Arabidopsis thaliana after wounding leaf eight and found that membrane depolarizations correlated with jasmonate signalling domains in undamaged leaves. Furthermore, current injection elicited jasmonoyl-isoleucine accumulation, resulting in a transcriptome enriched in RNAs encoding key jasmonate signalling regulators. From among 34 screened membrane protein mutant lines, mutations in several clade 3 GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE genes (GLRs 3. 2, 3. 3 and 3. 6) attenuated wound-induced surface potential changes. Jasmonate-response gene expression in leaves distal to wounds was reduced in a glr 3. 3 glr 3. 6 double mutant.

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{electrical}} properties of skin {{have been investigated}} for more than 70 years, a better understanding is becoming ever more important for medical applications. This is because electronic and computational technology has advanced dramatically over the last decade, so there is much potential for creating improved prostheses for disabled patients. An improved understanding of the electrical properties of the skin will facilitate the design of <b>non-invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the associated electronics for improving the efficacy of signals sent into the body, for instance for (i) stimulation of muscles and neurons, as well as (ii) sensing neuron, muscle or other ion transport processes in the body. A popular approach for considering the electrical properties skin in a theoretical model has been to use circuit equivalent models, where the skin structure is considered as a combination of resistors and capacitors. This method leads to a low resolution model, ignoring the potential effects of structures such as sweat glands and hair follicles, as well as heterogeneity within the dermis, epidermis and subcutaneous regions.

A Fourier transform method was used, employing novel electronic techniques and four <b>non-invasive</b> <b>electrodes</b> on the subject to separately determine the properties of the stratum corneum and the deeper tissues. Both linear and non-linear, A. C. and D.

The main conclusions of this work are that: (a) The small-signal A. C. impedance properties of skin are extremely well fitted by a minor arc of a circle on the complex impedance plane, and the depression of the centre of the circle below the equivalent series resistance axis is very significantly greater in psoriatic skin and in hyper-hydrated normal skin. (b) This behaviour cannot be adequately interpreted by any extant physical model of skin, but can be adequately interpreted by considering the stratum corneum to be an inhomogeneous or amorphous semiconductor. (c) The semiconductivity of human skin has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, and was found to have activation enthalpies averaging 0. 46 eV (10. 63 kcal/mole). (d) These insights into the mechanisms of electrical charge transport through skin may suggest new ways of characterizing the properties of skin using methods developed for the semiconductor industry.

In this study, {{in order to control}} the degree of transdermal and topical drug delivery, EP at different amplitudes of electric pulses was evaluated. A new in vivo real-time monitoring system based on fluorescently labeled molecules was developed, for the quantification of transdermal and topical drug delivery. EP of the mouse skin was performed with new <b>non-invasive</b> multi-array <b>electrodes,</b> delivering different amplitudes of electric pulses ranging from 70 to 570 V, between the electrode pin pairs. Patches, soaked with 4 kDa fluorescein-isothiocyanate labeled dextran (FD), doxorubicin (DOX) or fentanyl (FEN), were applied to the skin before and after EP. The new monitoring system was developed based on the delivery of FD to and through the skin. FD relative quantity was determined with fluorescence microscopy imaging, in the treated region of the skin for topical delivery and in a segment of the mouse tail for transdermal delivery. The application of electric pulses for FD delivery resulted in enhanced transdermal delivery. Depending on the amplitude of electric pulses, it increased up to the amplitude of 360 V, and decreased at higher amplitudes (460 and 570 V). Topical delivery steadily enhanced with increasing the amplitude of the delivered electric pulses, being even higher than after tape stripping used as a positive control. The non-invasive monitoring of the delivery of DOX, a fluorescent chemotherapeutic drug, qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed the effects of EP at 360 and 570 V pulse amplitudes on topical and transdermal drug delivery. Delivery of FEN at 360 and 570 V pulse amplitudes verified the observed effects as obtained with FD and DOX, by the measured physiological responses of the mice as well as FEN plasma concentration. This study demonstrates that with the newly developed <b>non-invasive</b> multi-array <b>electrodes</b> and with the varying electric pulse amplitude, the amount of topical and transdermal drug delivery to the skin can be controlled.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2012 Brain computer interface systems based on electroencephalograph (EEG) signals have limitations which challenge their application {{as a practical}} device for general use. The signal features generated by the brain states we wish to detect possess {{a high degree of}} inter-subject and intra-subject variation. Additionally, these features usually exhibit a low variation across each of the target states. Collection of EEG signals using low resolution, <b>non-invasive</b> scalp <b>electrodes</b> further degrades the spatial resolution of these signals. The majority of brain computer interface systems to date require extensive training prior to use by each individual user. The discovery of subject invariant features could reduce or even eliminate individual training requirements. To obtain suitable subject invariant features requires search through a high dimension feature space consisting of combinations of spatial, spectral and temporal features. Poorly separable features can prevent the search from converging to a usable solution as a result of degenerate classifiers. In such instances the system must detect and compensate for degenerate classifier behavior. This dissertation presents a method to accomplish this search using a wrapper architecture comprised of a sequential forward floating search algorithm coupled with a support vector machine classifier. This is successfully achieved by the introduction of a scalar Quality (Q) -factor metric, calculated from the ratio of sensitivity to specificity of the confusion matrix. This method is successfully applied to a multiclass subject independent BCI using 10 untrained subjects performing 4 motor tasks.

Requirements to operate in pressurized suits are particularly problematic due to the increased bulk and stiffness of gloves. As a result, researchers are considering alternative methods to perform fine movement control, for example capitalizing on higher-order voice actuation commands to perform control tasks. This paper presents current research at NASA s Neuro Engineering Laboratory that explores one method-direct bioelectric interpretation-for handling some of these problems. In this type of control system, electromyographic (EMG) signals are used both to facilitate understanding of acoustic speech in pressure-regulated suits 2 nd to provide smooth analog control of a robotic platform, all without requiring fine-gained hand movement. This is accomplished through the use of <b>non-invasive</b> silver silver-chloride <b>electrodes</b> located on the forearm, throat, and lower chin, positioned so as to receive electrical activity originating from the muscles during contraction. For direct analog platform control, a small Personal Exploration Rover (PER) built by Carnegie Mellon University Robotics is controlled using forearm contraction duration and magnitudes, measured using several EMG channels. Signal processing is used to translate these signals into directional platform rotation rates and translational velocities. higher order commands were generated by differential contraction patterns called "clench codes. ...|$|R
40|$|Cotton fiber is {{a single}} cell that differentiates from the ovule {{epidermis}} and undergoes synchronous elongation with high secretion and growth rate. Apart from economic importance, cotton fiber provides an excellent single-celled model for studying mechanisms of cell-growth. Annexins are Ca²⁺⁻ and phospholipid-binding proteins that {{have been reported to}} be localized in multiple cellular compartments and involved in control of vesicle secretions. Although several annexins {{have been found to be}} highly expressed in elongating cotton fibers, their functional roles in fiber development remain unknown. Here, 14 annexin family members were identified from the fully sequenced diploid G. raimondii (D₅ genome), half of which were expressed in fibers of the cultivated tetraploid species G. hirsutum (cv. YZ 1). Among them, GhAnn 2 from the D genome of the tetraploid species displayed high expression level in elongating fiber. The expression of GhAnn 2 could be induced by some phytohormones that play important roles in fiber elongation, such as IAA and GA₃. RNAi-mediated down-regulation of GhAnn 2 inhibited fiber elongation and secondary cell wall synthesis, resulting in shorter and thinner mature fibers in the transgenic plants. Measurement with <b>non-invasive</b> scanning ion-selective <b>electrode</b> revealed that the rate of Ca²⁺ influx from extracellular to intracellular was decreased at the fiber cell apex of GhAnn 2 silencing lines, in comparison to that in the wild type. These results indicate that GhAnn 2 may regulate fiber development through modulating Ca²⁺ fluxes and signaling...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} presents {{my research}} investigating {{a number of}} microscale devices designed to interact with various biological systems. First, I describe the development of nanoscale electronic sensor devices for quantitative detection of biomolecule concentrations in liquids. Two sensor designs are discussed - one using semiconducting nanowires and another employing a novel fluid nanochannel layout. Microfabrication and sensor performance optimization methods are discussed, culminating with an overview of molecular sensing results. Second, I describe an effort undertaken {{in support of a}} project aimed at creating a contact lens based glucose sensor. A miniature version of the sensor was created and tested in-vivo, inside a rabbit's eye, using the intraocular fluid as an ersatz tear fluid. Also, described is an anatomically correct model of a human eye, complete with moving eyelids and working tear ducts, used for testing contact lens sensors in a life-like environment. This effort has helped focus further development of the contact lens sensor project on solving the issue of chemical interference in in-vivo environments. Lastly, I describe design, microfabrication and in-vivo testing of implantable, highly flexible, <b>non-invasive</b> active neural <b>electrode</b> arrays used in an effort to create a fully implantable and wirelessly powered brain-computer interface system. Multiple array geometries for both subcranial and intraspinal implantation as well as their in-vitro and in-vivo performance are discussed. Ultimately, I present an active electrode array assembled with four neural signal amplifiers, using a novel two-sided parylene process...|$|R
40|$|The Importance of gesture {{recognition}} has widely {{spread around}} the world. Many research strategies have been proposed to study and recognize gestures, especially facial and hand gestures. Distinguishing and recognizing hand gestures is vital in hotspot fields such as bionic parts, powered exoskeleton, diagnosing muscle disorders, etc. Recognizing such gesture patterns can also create a stress-free and fancy user interface for mobile phones, gaming consoles and other such devices. The objective is to design a simple yet efficient wearable hand gesture recognizing system. This thesis also shows that by taking both EMG and accelerometer data into account, can improve the system to recognize more patterns with higher accuracy levels. For this, a hand band embedded with a triple axis accelerometer and three surface EMG electrodes is employed to source the system. The <b>non-invasive</b> surface EMG <b>electrodes</b> senses muscle action while the accelerometer senses the hand motions. The EMG signal is passed through analog front-end module for noise filtering and signal amplification. An ARM Cortex processor converts the analog EMG and accelerometer signal into digital and transmits to a PC via Bluetooth protocol. On the receiver section, the raw EMG and acceleration data is further processed and decomposed offline using MATLAB tools to extract features such as root mean square, waveform length, threshold crossing, variance and mean. Extracted features are then fed through multi-class SVM (Support Vector Machine) process for pattern recognition. The chapters below discuss in greater detail on pattern recognition technique and other modules involved...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by the progressive death of brain cells over time. It represents the most frequent cause of dementia in the western world, and affects an individual’s cognitive ability and psychological capacity. While clinical diagnoses of AD are made primarily {{on the basis of}} clinical evaluation and mental health tests, diagnostic certainty is only possible through necropsy. One non-invasive approach to investigating AD is to use electroencephalograms (EEGs), which reflect brain electrical activity and so can be used to detect electrical abnormalities in brain signals with <b>non-invasive</b> cranial surface <b>electrodes.</b> Generally EEGs in AD patients show a shift to lower frequencies in spectral analysis and display less complexity and contain more regular patterns compared to those of control subjects. Here we present a method for differentiating AD patients from healthy ones based on their EEG signals using Benford’s law and support vector machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. EEG signals from eleven AD and eleven age-matched controls were divided into artefact-free 5 -sec epochs and used to train an SVM. 10 fold cross validation was performed at both the epochand subject-level to evaluate the importance of each electrode in discriminating between AD and healthy subjects. Substantive variability was seen across the different electrodes, with electrodes O 1, O 2 and C 4 particularly being important. Performance across the electrodes was reduced when subject-level cross validation was performed, but relative performance across the electrodes was consistent with that found using epoch-level cross validation...|$|R
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are characterized}} by abnormal electrical activity occurring in the brain. EEG records the seizures demonstrating changes in signal morphology. These signal characteristics, however, differ between patients {{as well as between}} different seizures in the same patient. Epilepsy is managed with anti-epileptic medications but in some extreme cases surgery might be necessary. <b>Non-invasive</b> surface <b>electrode</b> EEG measurement gives an estimate of the seizure onset but more invasive intra-cranial electrocorticogram (ECoG) are required at times for precise localization of the epileptogenic zone. The epileptogenic zone can be described as the cortical area targeted for resection to render the patient symptom free. Epileptologists use the “evolution” of aberrant signals for identifying epileptic seizures and the epileptogenic zone is identified by concentrating on the area contributing to the onset of seizure. This process is done by visually analyzing hours of ECoG data. The signal morphology during an epileptic seizure is not very different from abnormal discharges noticed in ECoG data thereby complicating signal analysis for the epileptologists. This thesis aims to classify the ECoG channel data as epileptic or non-epileptic using an automated machine learning algorithm called support vector machines (SVM). The data will be decomposed into various frequency bands identified by wavelet transform and will span the range of 0 - 30 Hz. Statistical measures will be applied to these frequency bands to identify features that will subsequently be used to train SVM. This thesis will further investigate feature reduction using multivariate analysis methods to train the SVM and compare it to the performance of classification when all the features were used to train SVM. Results show that channel data classification using trained SVM that did not undergo feature reduction performed better with 98 % sensitivity but needed more runtime than the SVM algorithms that was trained using reduced features. For high frequency analysis of frequencies between 60 - 500 Hz, the results show the same sensitivity yet less specificity when compared to the classification using lower frequency range of 0 - 30 Hz. The results seen in this thesis show that support vector machines classifiers can be trained to classify the data as epileptic or non-epileptic with good accuracy. Even though training the classifiers took almost two hours, it was still noticeably less than other machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural networks. The accuracy of this algorithm can be improved with changes to the data segment length, size of training matrix, accuracy of epileptic and nonepileptic data, and amount of data used for training...|$|R
40|$|Machine {{collaboration}} with the biological body/brain by sending electrical information back and forth {{is one of the}} leading research areas in neuro-engineering during the twenty-first century. Hence, Brain-Machine-Brain Interface (BMBI) is a powerful tool for achieving such machine-brain/body collaboration. BMBI generally is a smart device (usually invasive) that can record, store, and analyze neural activities, and generate corresponding responses in the form of electrical pulses to stimulate specific brain regions. The Smart Brain-Machine-Brain-Interface (SBMBI) is a step forward with compared to the traditional BMBI by including smart functions, such as in-electrode local computing capabilities, and availability of cloud connectivity in the system to take the advantage of powerful cloud computation in decision making. In this dissertation work, we designed and developed an innovative form of Smart Brain-Machine-Brain Interface (SBMBI) and studied its feasibility in different biomedical applications. With respect to power management, the SBMBI is a semi-passive platform. The communication module is fully passive—powered by RF harvested energy; whereas, the signal processing core is battery-assisted. The efficiency of the implemented RF energy harvester was measured to be 0. 005 %. One of potential applications of SBMBI is to configure a Smart Deep-Brain-Stimulator (SDBS) based on the general SBMBI platform. The SDBS consists of brain-implantable smart electrodes and a wireless-connected external controller. The SDBS electrodes operate as completely autonomous electronic implants that are capable of sensing and recording neural activities in real time, performing local processing, and generating arbitrary waveforms for neuro-stimulation. A bidirectional, secure, fully-passive wireless communication backbone was designed and integrated into this smart electrode to maintain contact between the smart electrodes and the controller. The standard EPC-Global protocol has been modified and adopted as the communication protocol in this design. The proposed SDBS, by using a SBMBI platform, was demonstrated and tested through a hardware prototype. Additionally the SBMBI was employed to develop a low-power wireless ECG data acquisition device. This device captures cardiac pulses through a <b>non-invasive</b> magnetic resonance <b>electrode,</b> processes the signal and sends it to the backend computer through the SBMBI interface. Analysis was performed to verify the integrity of received ECG data...|$|R
