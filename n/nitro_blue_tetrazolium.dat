50|$|<b>Nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> is a {{chemical}} compound {{composed of two}} tetrazole moieties. It is used in immunology for sensitive detection of alkaline phosphatase (with BCIP). NBT serves as the oxidant and BCIP is the AP-substrate (and gives also dark blue dye).|$|E
50|$|<b>Nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> {{is used in}} a {{diagnostic}} test, particularly for chronic granulomatous disease and other diseases of phagocyte function. When there is an NADPH oxidase defect, the phagocyte is unable to make reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing. As a result, bacteria may thrive within the phagocyte.

50|$|One study {{suggests}} {{a role for}} NADPH oxidase in ketamine-induced loss of neuronal parvalbumin and GAD67 expression. Similar loss is observed in schizophrenia, and the results may point at the NADPH oxidase as a possible player in the pathophysiology of the disease. <b>Nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> is used in a diagnostic test, in particular, for chronic granulomatous disease, a disease {{in which there is}} a defect in NADPH oxidase; therefore, the phagocyte is unable to make the reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing, resulting in bacteria thriving within the phagocyte.

40|$|The structure-activity {{relationship}} of steroid hormones were studied {{with respect to}} the carbohydrate synthesis in liver slices and the chemical reactivities of J 4 - 3 -ketone and C- 20, 21 -ketol groups of their molecules with isonicotinic acid hydrazide and <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium,</b> respectively. At the dose level of 10 ~ 4 M, glucocorticoids such as cortisol, prednisolone, triamcinolone, and triamcinolone acetonide enhanced 14 C in-corporation from [2 - 14 C] pyruvate and L[U- 14 C] alanine into glucose in rat liver slices. Triamcinolone acetonide was most potent of the steroids examined followed by triamcinolone. Prednisolone was less active than triamcinolone, but more potent than cortisol. This suggests that the double bond between C-l and C- 2, and the C- 16, 17 -acetonide play important roles in increased glucocorticoid activity. The J 4 - 3 -ketone group of ^M-S-ketosteroids such as prednisolone, triamcinolone, and triamcinolone acetonide reacted more slowly with isonicotinic acid hydrazide than the corresponding J 4 - 3 -ketosteroids. The rate of reaction of the C- 20, 21 -ketol with <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> to form formazan was increased by the 16 a-hydroxylation and decreased by the introduction of C- 16, 17 -acetonide. 16 a-Hydroxycortisol, 16 a-hydroxypredniso...|$|R

40|$|A {{spectrophotometric}} method for determining succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity assay in azide-sensitive yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been developed. The permeabilization of yeast cells by 0. 05 % digitonin permitted to study yeast enzymatic activity in situ. The reduction of <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> salt (BT) to <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> formazan (BTf) {{was conducted in}} the presence of phenazine methosulphate (PMS) as an exogenous electron carrier, and sodium azide (SA) as an inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase (Cyt) pathway. Various factors such as type of substrate, BT concentration, cell number, temperature and time of incubation, and different Cyt pathway blockers were optimized. In earlier studies, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) had been selected as the best solvent for extraction of BTf from yeast cells. The linear correlation between permeabilized yeast cell density and amount of formed formazan was evidenced in the range from 9 · 10 ^ 7 to 5 · 10 ^ 8 cells per sample solution. Below the yeast cell concentration of 10 ^ 7 the absorbance values were too low to detect formazans with good precision. This standarized procedure allows the estimation of SDH activity in whole cells, depending on vitality level of yeast populations. Significant increases of succinate dehydrogenase activities were observed in sequential passages {{as the result of the}} increase of activity of the strain and adaptation to cultivation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphonuclear {{leukocyte}} motility, both in vivo and in vitro, {{and reduction}} of <b>Nitro</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Tetrazolium</b> was studied in tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy patients {{and a group}} of lepromatous patients with erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL). A profound defect in random migration, chemotaxis, and chemokinesis was found in lepromatous patients with and without complicating ENL, and marked depletion of skin window migration confirmed these in vitro findings. Tuberculoid patients exhibited a mild defect in polymorphonuclear leukocyte motility. Serum inhibitors of normal polymorphonuclear leukocyte chemotaxis were found in all types of leprosy, but sera from lepromatous and ENL patients were most inhibitory.

The total number of leucocytes mobilised to the chambers after 12 hours {{did not differ from}} those in 21 healthy volunteers. After 24 and 48 hours reduced number of leucocytes were mobilised by patients with ulcerative colitis (p less than 0. 01). Correspondingly, the leucocyte migration rates were normal initially but were reduced after 18 hours Mobilisation in vivo was positively correlated to the blood neutrophil count (Rho: 0. 5549 po less than 0. 02) but unrelated to clinical activity. Blood leucocytes showed reduced random migration in vitro as well as chemotactic response to casein (p less than 0. 01). Serum independent and dependent phagocytosis did not differ from healthy volunteers. <b>Nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> reduction by resting leucocytes was increased (p less than 0. 01) in ulcerative colitis compared with controls. Our findings suggest altered in vivo mobilisation and in vitro migration of leucocytes in ulcerative colitis with increased spontaneous <b>nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> reduction reflecting increased generation of potentially tissue damaging agents.

40|$|Pulmonary {{washings}} from rabbits {{were freed}} of cells {{and added to}} the monolayers of homologous alveolar macrophages (AM). At 1 h after incubation with the pulmonary washings, many more cells adhered to glass, spread out, and showed enhanced <b>Nitro</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Tetrazolium</b> reduction. The maximal effect of the pulmonary washings on AM activation was obtained 12 h after incubation. The AM activated by the pulmonary washings showed a higher capacity to inhibit the growth of intracellular BCG, and that capacity was correlated with the intensity of <b>Nitro</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Tetrazolium</b> reduction by the AM. Gel filtration of the pulmonary washings through Sepharose 4 B yielded five fractions. The factor that activated the AM functions was in fraction 4. When the immunoglobulin G in the fraction was removed by an immunoadsorbent column, AM activity was abolished.

40|$|Resident peritoneal macrophages were {{obtained}} from untreated mice and were cultured in medium 199 with or without 5 % acid-treated fetal bovine serum.

After 1 hr, the cells were washed and culturing was continued in the absence of redox compounds. The effects of the redox compounds were tested by assaying for hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt activity and for plasminogen activator secretion, and the results were compared with the effects induced by phagocytic stimuli. Methylene blue caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of the HMP shunt, whereas methyl viologen and <b>nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> were ineffective. Shunt stimulation by methylene blue was followed, after a lag of 2 - 4 days, by plasminogen activator secretion. The rate of secretion was dependent on the methylene blue concentration used. Methyl viologen and <b>nitro</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> were again ineffective, whereas phagocytosis of zymosan or sheep erythrocytes, which stimulates the HMP shunt, induced plasminogen activator secretion at rates similar to those induced by methylene blue. These results add further evidence to our hypothesis that the HMP shunt-dependent metabolic burst is involved in macrophage activation. Because methylene blue mimics the action of zymosan it appears that shunt stimulation by itself initiates the activation process independently of phagocytosis...|$|E
