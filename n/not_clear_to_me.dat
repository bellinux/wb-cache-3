6000|$|... "Sperrit? Well, maybe," [...] he said. [...] "But there's {{one thing}} <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There was an echo. Now, no man {{ever seen a}} sperrit with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O'Moy," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I {{should tell}} you that you have played the knave in this were it <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that you have played the fool." [...] He spoke entirely without passion. He saw his way quite clearly. Things had reached a pass in which for the sake of all concerned, and perhaps for the sake of Miss Armytage more than any one, the whole truth must be spoken without regard to its {{consequences}} to Richard Butler.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{that you}} have {{explained}} to me," [...] I said, [...] "I understand perfectly. But I own I am puzzled on one point, which you have <b>not</b> made <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>not</b> quite <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how {{the horse}} came {{to fall on}} you. You were {{dismounted}} at the time?" [...] he said. [...] "Still, after all, that's not quite the question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Mr. Compton, [...] "that {{you have}} the right idea. Some of your points are <b>not</b> entirely <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as there are many modern methods that I have not, I am sorry to say, {{investigated}} sufficiently." ...|$|R
60|$|Zulime {{was living}} with her sister, and there I {{spent most of my}} evenings and some of my afternoons during the {{following}} week, scarcely able to realize my change of fortune except when alone with her, discussing our future. She agreed at last to a date for the wedding which would enable us to spend Thanksgiving at West Salem, and then for some reason, <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now, I suddenly took the train for Gallup, New Mexico, with the Navajo Indian Agency for final destination.|$|E
6000|$|... "I came to watch, {{but found}} work ready for me. It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> even now what I did, nor how I did it. One of my Berserker rages possessed me I fancy; my nerves and muscles seemed {{made of steel}} and gutta percha; the smell of powder intoxicated, {{and the sense of}} power was grand. The fire, the smoke, the din were all delicious, and I felt like a giant, as I wielded that great weapon, dealing many deaths with a single pair of hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|On Tuesday {{evening we}} drank tea at Sir Joshua's with Dr. Johnson. [...] Hannah is {{certainly}} a great favourite. She was placed next him, and [...] they had the entire conversation to themselves. They were both in [...] remarkably high spirits, and it was certainly her lucky night; I never [...] heard her say so many good things. The old genius was as jocular as [...] the young one was pleasant. You would have imagined we were at some [...] comedy had you heard our peals of laughter. They certainly tried [...] which could 'pepper the highest,' and it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the [...] lexicographer was really the highest seasoner.|$|E
50|$|On 5 March 2014, Libya {{announced}} that Gaddafi had been extradited by Niger {{and was in}} Tripoli. His lawyer, Nick Kaufman protested the move stating “extradition suggests {{that this was a}} legal process where Saadi Gadhafi was accorded a lawyer, a court hearing, and…it’s <b>not</b> even <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that that even took place”.|$|R
50|$|When I {{hear you}} talk about a lot of new names, it’s not always {{possible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> understand when I’ve seen absolutely nothing by them. And from what you said about ‘Impressionism’, I’ve grasped that it’s something different from what I thought it was, but it’s still <b>not</b> entirely <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> what one should understand by it.|$|R
6000|$|... [4] This {{phrase is}} <b>not</b> very <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> From the context ensuing, {{it might seem}} that the 'circumstance' which {{prevented}} Keats from staying with Shelley in Pisa was that his nerves were in so irritable a state as to prompt him to move {{from place to place}} in Italy rather than fix in any particular city or house.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{little of}} it. He is evidently of mixed blood, and partly educated, a trader by profession, with a mysterious inland connection. I {{was told that}} the {{authorities}} suspect him of trafficking in unlawful weapons, or even in black humanity. I have little doubt it was he who hired the man with the scar on his forehead to arrange for Niven's destruction; and, while several points are <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I fancy he is at least partly responsible for our own misfortunes. Seeing his efforts to circumvent us fail, he has decided to join us--for a time. Lastly, I am inclined to surmise that by reason of some unlawful speculation, jointly undertaken, he has a hold on Dom Pedro, and so obtained possession of the map you lost. Now, what are we to say to him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is true {{that there}} are black lichens enough, and {22} brown ones: nevertheless, the chief use of lichens is for silver and gold colour on rocks; {{and it is the}} dead moss which gives the leopard-like touches of black. And yet here again--as to a thing I have been looking at and {{painting}} all my life--I am brought to pause, the moment I think of it carefully. The black moss which gives the precious Velasquez touches, lies, much of it, flat on the rocks; radiating from its centres--powdering in the fingers, if one breaks it off, like dry tea. Is it a black species?--or a black-parched state of other species, perishing for the sake of Velasquez effects, instead of accumulation of earth? and, if so, does it die of drought, accidentally, or, in a sere old age, naturally? and how is it related to the rich green bosses that grow in deep velvet? And there again is another matter <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> One calls them 'velvet' because they are all brought to an even surface at the top. Our own velvet is reduced to such trimness by cutting. But how is the moss trimmed? By what scissors? Carefullest Elizabethan gardener never shaped his yew hedge more daintily than the moss fairies smooth these soft rounded surfaces of green and gold. And just fancy the difference, if they were ragged! If the fibres had every one of them leave to grow at their own sweet will, and to be long or short as they liked, or, worse still, urged by fairy prizes into laboriously and agonizingly trying which could grow longest. Fancy the surface of a spot of competitive moss! ...|$|E
5000|$|Touted as the [...] "Barack Obama of Brooklyn” {{during his}} {{run for the}} congressional seat, Jeffries has said he doesn’t see the Obama comparison. “Other {{than the fact that}} we were both born on August 4, it’s <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that there’s much of a {{professional}} resemblance,” ...|$|E
60|$|War, war! It {{is terrible}} certainly. But {{there are worse}} plagues, deeper griefs, dreader wounds than the physical. What of the forty {{thousand}} wretched women in this city? The silent writhing of them is <b>to</b> <b>me</b> more appalling than {{the roar of the}} cannons. Then this war is necessary on our sides. Is that wrong necessary? It is <b>not</b> so <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|As to the {{deriving}} his Gift of Prophesy {{from the}} Devil, by that pretended Generation, I shall omit that Part, because, as I have all along insisted upon it, that Satan himself has no prophetic or predicting Powers of his own, it is <b>not</b> very <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that he could}} convey it to his Posterity, nil dat quod not habet.|$|R
50|$|Responding {{to these}} criticisms, Rusnok {{insisted that it}} was {{perfectly}} valid for his government to consider repealing the limits and making changes to the Czech Republic’s energy plan. “We will still deal with it - we consider it a matter that can’t be delayed. Political governments {{for reasons that are}} <b>not</b> completely <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> have a fear of symbolic issues like the mining limits,” said Rusnok.|$|R
5000|$|Magician {{and author}} Richard Wiseman {{performing}} at the 2009 conference explained {{in answer to}} a question by an attendee, people believe in the paranormal for many reasons, they might need to believe and it's possible that they have had [...] "personal experiences" [...] that convinced them. '“It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that by robbing people of their beliefs, we always {{make the world a better}} place.”' ...|$|E
5000|$|Russell {{described}} the pilot script as [...] "interesting", continuing, [...] "It {{was so far}} from a procedural. And originally, I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. Laughs. But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it... and I kept {{trying to figure it}} out, because it's so not clear. It's still <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But there's so many different levels to it." ...|$|E
50|$|In Umueze Anam Otite Mba is {{celebrate}}d {{a month before}} Otite Anam reason and why is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Some school of thought said that one Mba Nwinya who was a renowned farmer and harvests yam quite early ahead of others {{and for this reason}} will celebrate his otite to enable him eat the fruit of his labour as at then it is not honorable to eat yam if otite has not been celebrated. This is practice later was popularized and celebrated in Umueze Anam the Mba family holds this tradition till date.|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} then that I {{perceived}} that the pilgrim ship episode was a good starting-point for a free and wandering tale; that it was an event, too, which could conceivably colour the whole 'sentiment of existence' in a simple and sensitive character. But all these preliminary moods and stirrings of spirit were rather obscure at the time, and they do <b>not</b> appear <b>clearer</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now after the lapse of so many years.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} a melodrama visiting a country town where I was staying. The heroine and child were sleeping peacefully in the customary attic. For some reason <b>not</b> quite <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the villain had {{set fire to}} the house. He had been complaining through the three preceding acts of the heroine's coldness; maybe it was with some idea of warming her. Escape by way of the staircase was impossible. Each time the poor girl opened the door a flame came in and nearly burned her hair off. It seemed to have been waiting for her.|$|R
5000|$|I suppose {{this article}} could be titled [...] "The Conquest of El Capitan". However, as I {{hammered}} {{in the last}} bolt and staggered over the rim, it was <b>not</b> at all <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> who was conqueror and who was conquered: I do recall that El Cap {{seemed to be in}} much better condition than I was.|$|R
5000|$|Former Felicity star Russell {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to work on another television series: [...] "I thought the pilot script was just so interesting. It was so far from a procedural. And originally, I didn't know that I wanted to do it. I always say no to everything. I never want to do anything. Laughs. But I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I read it...and I kept {{trying to figure it}} out, because it's so not clear. It's still <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But there's so many different levels to it." ...|$|E
50|$|Lord Templeman stated:It is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} {{activities}} of the appellants were exercises of rights in respect of private and family life. But assuming that the appellants are claiming to exercise those rights I do not consider that Article 8 invalidates a law which forbids violence which is intentionally harmful to body and mind. Society is entitled and bound to protect itself against a cult of violence. Pleasure derived from the infliction of pain is an evil thing. Cruelty is uncivilised. I would answer the certified question in the negative and dismiss the appeals of the appellants against conviction.|$|E
5000|$|Much of Shields's {{work is a}} {{critique}} of categories in art and culture, such as the boundary between fiction and nonfiction.. In Reality Hunger, he argues for abandoning the traditional novel form because of its inability {{to deal with what}} he views as a fragmented culture.. Shields writes, [...] "I find it very nearly impossible to read a contemporary novel that presents itself unselfconsciously as a novel, since it's <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how such a book could convey {{what it feels like to}} be alive right now." [...] He advocates collage forms such as the lyric essay, prose poetry, and the antinovel.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{knows it}} already. When I had cleared {{it all up}} I had an {{interview}} with him, and finding {{that he would not}} tell me the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were <b>not</b> yet quite <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{tried to}} point out that this was {{dangerous}} for some reason that was <b>not</b> perfectly <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but the word [...] "dangerous" [...] had somehow got mixed with [...] "indiscreet," [...] and came out rather more like [...] "injurious" [...] than either; and after an attempt to disentangle them, I resumed my argument, addressing myself principally to the unfamiliar but attentive coralline growths on either side. I felt that it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> up this confusion between the moon and a potato at once--I wandered into a long parenthesis on the importance of precision of definition in argument. I did my best to ignore the fact that my bodily sensations were no longer agreeable.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{in effect}} the {{plaintiff}} has said is this 'I {{give you a}} free hand to complete these decorations, provided that you keep within a total cost <b>to</b> <b>me</b> of twelve thousand pounds. If you exceed that sum {{by as much as}} fifty pounds, I will not hold you responsible; beyond that point you are no agent of mine, and I shall repudiate liability.' It is <b>not</b> quite <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> whether, had the plaintiff in fact repudiated liability under his agent's contracts, he would, under all the circumstances, have been successful in so doing; but he has not adopted this course. He has accepted liability, and fallen back upon his rights against the defendant {{under the terms of the}} latter's engagement.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{it is not}} at {{all clear}} to me that the {{important}} constitutional question decided today should be resolved in a case such as this. Although Welsh argues vigorously that the State violated his federal constitutional rights, he at no point relied on the exclusionary rule, and he does not contend that the Federal Constitution or federal law provides the remedy he seeks. As a general rule, this Court [...] "reviews judgments, not statements in opinions." [...] Black v. Cutter Laboratories, 351 U. S. 292, 351 U. S. 297 (1956). Because the Court does not purport tc hold that federal law requires the conclusion that Welsh's refusal to submit to a sobriety test was reasonable, it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> how the judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin offends federal law.|$|E
5000|$|Keohane {{was born}} at the University of Chicago Hospitals. His {{education}} through the fifth grade was at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When he was 10, {{the family moved to}} Mount Carroll, Illinois, where he attended public school and his parents taught at Shimer College. After the 10th grade, Keohane enrolled at Shimer through the school's early entrance program, which since 1950 has allowed selected high school students to enter college before completing high school. [...] When later asked to compare his undergraduate education as an early entrant at Shimer with his graduate work at Harvard, Keohane remarked [...] "it is <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I have ever been with a brighter set of people than those early entrants." [...] Keohane currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Shimer College.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} the Federal Vision theology is the denial of the [...] imputation of Christ’s active obedience in His earthly life. Theologians involved with the Federal Vision are not agreed on the denial of imputation. James Jordan has denied that any part of Christ’s earthly works are imparted to believers. Norman Shepherd is in agreement with him. [...] Peter Leithart has publicly {{said in a letter}} to PCA Pacific Northwest Presbytery that [...] This is an issue I am still thinking about, and on which I don’t have a settled position. I affirm that Christ’s obedience was necessary for our salvation, and affirm too that Christ’s history of obedience becomes the life story of those who are in Christ. I’m not sure that ‘imputation’ {{is the best way to}} express this. It’s <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the Westminster Standards require belief in the imputation of Christ’s active obedience.|$|E
5000|$|... 2001 - September 19 - Speculator George Soros, {{put forward}} a {{different}} proposal, special drawing rights or SDRs that the rich countries would pledge {{for the purpose of}} providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea.
