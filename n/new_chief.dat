5|$|According to a post-war {{account by}} Karl Strölin, the Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart at that time, {{he and two}} other conspirators, Alexander von Falkenhausen and Carl Heinrich von Stülpnagel, began efforts to bring Rommel into the anti-Hitler {{conspiracy}} in early 1944. On 15 April 1944 Rommel's <b>new</b> <b>chief</b> of staff, Hans Speidel, arrived in Normandy and reintroduced Rommel to Stülpnagel. Speidel had previously been connected to Carl Goerdeler, the civilian leader of the resistance, {{but not to the}} plotters led by Stauffenberg, and only {{came to the attention of}} Stauffenberg due to his appointment to Rommel's headquarters. The conspirators felt they needed the support of a field marshal on active duty, and gave instructions to Speidel to bring Rommel into their circle.|$|E
5|$|English was the {{official}} language of Sarawak from 1963 to 1974 due to opposition from First Chief Minister of Sarawak Stephen Kalong Ningkan {{to the use of}} the Malay language in Sarawak. In 1974 the <b>new</b> <b>Chief</b> Minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub recognised Malay alongside English as an official language of Sarawak. This new status given to the Malay language was further reinforced by new education standards transitioning curriculum to Malay. In 1985 English lost the status of an official language, leaving only Malay. Despite official policy, Sarawak opposition members argue that English remained the de facto official language of Sarawak. English is still spoken in the legal courts, and state legislative assembly. In 2015, Chief Minister Adenan Satem announced that English will be reinstated as an official language.|$|E

5|$|In 1894 the {{authorities}} decided {{to abolish the}} position of bailiff and {{it was decided that}} some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs. This resulted in 26 <b>new</b> <b>chief</b> of police positions, largely corresponding to the old bailiwicks. Some received jurisdiction over both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual bailiff were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some bailiwick in place until 1919. The reform eliminated the difference between the rural and city police forces; yet the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.|$|E

On November 19, 1999, Taylor named General Kpenkpah Konah as the <b>new</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff of the AFL (where he would stay until 2006) and John Tarnue as head of the army. Tarnue was later implicated in a land dispute in 1999, while acting as AFL commander.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{established}} Army Ground Forces headquarters at the Army War College campus, where Devers lived, but Stilwell had moved the headquarters into the Pentagon. Eisenhower, as the <b>new</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff of the Army, {{decided that the}} Army Ground Forces headquarters should be co-located with the Army Air Forces' Tactical Air Command, so it was moved to Fort Monroe, Virginia, not far from Langley Field. Devers opened his headquarters there on 1 October 1946. Further reorganization occurred on 10 March 1948, when Army Ground Forces was renamed Army Field Forces. Control of the armies {{was transferred to the}} Department of the Army, and Army Field Forces was reduced to a coordinating staff agency.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1937, Newall was {{appointed}} as Chief of the Air Staff, the military {{head of the}} RAF, in succession to Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that {{he was expected to}} be appointed as the <b>new</b> <b>Chief</b> of the Air Staff.

5|$|The <b>new</b> <b>Chief</b> of Staff, General Malin Craig offered Eichelberger {{command of}} the 29th Infantry, the {{demonstration}} regiment based at Fort Benning, Georgia. Eichelberger turned this down, {{as he had been}} away from the infantry for many years, and some infantry officers might be jealous. Instead, he accepted {{command of the}} 30th Infantry, a less prestigious unit stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, but there were still officers who resented someone attaining command of a regiment at the age of 52. Before departing, he took a brief course at the Infantry School at Fort Benning to reacquaint himself with the infantry. As part of the 3rd Infantry Division, the 30th Infantry took part in a series of major training exercises over the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded <b>new</b> <b>chief</b> judge McGruder {{to permit}} the {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than ever. The Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
