2500|$|... 1976 {{brought about}} a few changes on the Electra. The {{front-end}} was reworked, including the grille and bumper. The new plastic grille featured 17 vertical bars and covered much of the radiator. The grille did not extend under the headlights in 1976, but instead Buick moved the running lights and turn signal lights underneath the headlights, where the 1975 grille had once been. The bumper no longer housed running lights. [...] There were also some minor interior differences. The brake release handle was black instead of chrome, the seat material was slightly different, on the limited, <b>notch-back</b> diamond pattern seating. The 1975 material appeared in a [...] "corduroy" [...] form, but the actual material was not corduroy. The 1976 diamond pattern seating material did not have this appearance. [...] The engine air cleaner {{did not have a}} [...] "cold-air" [...] ram air intake hose like the 1975 model did, and there were some carburetor changes and camshaft changes to meet EPA standards. The rear end ratio also was higher than the 1975 standard, at 2.56:1 instead of 2.73:1. The Park Avenue and leather seating in 1975 and 1976 were the same. Once again, there was the base 225, the Limited, and the luxurious Park Avenue. The Park Avenue Deluxe vanished for 1976 due to poor sales. The 1976 Electra is about {{the same size as the}} 1975 at , making them among the biggest Buicks ever.|$|E
2500|$|For 1969, Pontiac {{moved the}} Grand Prix from the {{full-sized}} lineup into a G-body model {{of its own}} based on the A-body intermediate four-door modified from 116 inches to 118 inches wheelbase chassis, but with distinctive styling and long hood/short deck proportions to create yet another niche product - the intermediate-sized personal-luxury car that offered the luxury and styling of the higher priced personal cars such as the Buick Riviera and Ford Thunderbird and the old Grand Prix and Olds Starfire but for a much lower price tag. The development of the car really has an interesting twist. Pete Estes who like Knudsen had moved to be GM of Chevrolet in 1966 and Delorean now {{general manager of the}} Pontiac division needed a car {{to take the place of}} the sagging sales of the full size Grand Prix, but the development cost of the car was too much of burden for Pontiac division alone, so Delorean went to his old boss now at Chevrolet to gather support for the development cost of the new [...] "G" [...] body Grand Prix. Estes agreed to share in the cost and allow Pontiac to have a one-year exclusivity on this new car, the next year Chevy would follow with its version which was called Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The new Grand Prix was such a sales success in 1969 as dealers moved 112,000 units - more than four times the number of Grand Prixs sold in 1968. Full-sized Pontiacs were also substantially restyled but retained the same basic under-body structure and chassis that debuted with the 1965 model - in fact the roof-lines for the four-door pillared sedans and Safari wagons were the same as the 1965 models, while the two-door semi-fastback design gave way to a squared-off <b>notch-back</b> style and four-door hardtop sedans were also more squared off than 1967-68 models. The GTOs and Firebirds received the Ram Air options, the GTO saw the addition of the [...] "Judge" [...] performance/appearance package, and the Firebird also got the [...] "Trans Am" [...] package. Although originally conceived as a 303 cubic inch model to compete directly in the Trans Am racing series, in a cost-saving move the Pontiac Trans Am debuted with the standard 400-cubic-inch performance engines. This year also saw De Lorean leaving the post of general manager to accept a similar position at GM's Chevrolet division. His replacement was F. James McDonald.|$|E
5000|$|The Volkswagen Type 3 (saloon/sedan, <b>notch-back,</b> fastback) was {{initially}} {{equipped with a}} 1.5-litre engine, displacing , based on the air-cooled flat-4 found in the Type 1. While the long block remained {{the same as the}} Type 1, the engine cooling was redesigned reducing the height of the engine profile, allowing greater cargo volume, and earning the nicknames of [...] "Pancake" [...] or [...] "Suitcase" [...] engine. This engine's displacement would later increase to 1.6 litres.|$|E
50|$|A one-model {{policy for}} the Standard marque (alongside a range of new Triumphs) was adopted in 1948 with the {{introduction}} of the 2-litre Standard Vanguard, which was styled on American lines by Walter Belgrove, and replaced all the carry-over pre-war models. This aptly named model was the first true post-war design from any major British manufacturer. The beetle-back Vanguard Phase 1 was replaced in 1953 by the <b>notch-back</b> Phase 2 and in 1955 by the all-new Phase 3, which resulted in variants such as the Sportsman, Ensign, Vanguard Vignale and Vanguard Six.|$|E
5000|$|Detail improvements, {{such as a}} new {{dashboard}} and a steering-column shift, embellished the Kapitän line in May 1950. Bigger {{changes were}} saved for March 1951, to anticipate {{the opening of the}} doors of the Frankfurt show on April 19 for an 11-day run. Its earlier fast-back style was modified to a mild <b>notch-back</b> contour, and a new horizontal grille - not the prettiest in Opel history - dominated the frontal view. With a higher compression ratio (still only 6.25:1), engine power was [...] at 3,700 rpm and top speed was 80 mph. Output increased to [...] during the further life of this model, which ended in July 1953.|$|E
50|$|Town and Country for 1972 {{borrowed}} {{most of its}} exterior trim {{from the}} New Yorker. Die cast grille inserts were shared with New Yorker, and rear wheel openings once again wore fender skirts. Brushed bright metal moldings about two inches wide {{ran the length of}} the car from front bumper to rear, and served as the lower border for the standard simulated wood grain side panels. Standard wheel covers were shared with the Newport, and were identical to the 1969 wheel covers, then shared with the New Yorker. Inside, the front seating choices and door trim were again shared with the Newport Custom. Seatbacks for the standard <b>notch-back</b> front seat featured a high back design with integral head rests. And, Chrysler's two-way door-gate became a three-way, able to open as door with the glass up. Unfortunately, as the Town and Country (and every other car in the ‘70s) grew heavier, available powertrain choices became fewer and weaker. Compression ratios were further reduced to 8.2:1. An increase in bore from 4.25” in the 383 to 4.34” produced a new LB series engine displacement of 400 cu. in. With a 2-BBL carburetor, it just matched the 190 net horsepower and 310 lbft Nm net torque ratings of the prior year 383s. The only remaining optional engine was the 440 cu. in. 4-BBL V8 producing 215 net horsepower and 345 lbft Nm net torque.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was {{performed with the}} purpose of comparing the arodynamic drag of an automobile as measured in a full-scale wind tunnel with the drag as measured on the road. A definition of the drag coefficient as measured both on the road and in the wind tunnel is given in advance in order to allow a comparison to be made between the two operating conditions. Three medium size european cars were selected, one <b>notch-back</b> type and two hatch-back types. Road testing was mainly based on the coast-down method. The total resistance was determined by statistical analysis of the experimental results. The theoretical basis and the specifications of the procedure are investigated and justified. Additional outdoor and indoor tests were carried out in order to isolate the aerodynamic drag. The wind tunnel tests were conducted on the same cars fully equipped as tested on the road and in the same speed range. The wind tunnel tests being executed at steady speeds, however, supplementary road tests were performed {{in order to determine the}} effect of the deceleration on the aerodynamic drag. The final results show only small differences between the aerodynamic drag coefficients as measured in the wind tunnel and on the road with the procedure here describe...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study using}} Large Eddy Simulation Coherent Structure Model (LES-CSM), {{of the flow}} around a simplified Ahmed body, {{has been done in}} this work of thesis. The models used are two salient geometries from the experimental investigation performed in [1], and consist, in particular, in two <b>notch-back</b> body geometries. Six simulation are carried out in total, changing Reynolds number and back-light angle of the model’s rear part. The Reynolds numbers used, based on the height of the models and the free stream velocity, are Re = 10000, Re = 30000 and Re = 50000. The back-light angles of the slanted surface with respect to the horizontal roof surface, that characterizes the vehicle, are taken as B = 31. 8 ◦ and B = 42 ◦ respectively. The experimental results in [1] have shown that, depending on the parameter B, asymmetric and symmetric averaged flow over the back-light and in the wake for a symmetric geometry can be observed. The aims of the present work of master thesis are principally two. The first aim is to investigate and confirm the influence of the parameter B on the presence of the asymmetry of the averaged flow, and confirm the features described in the experimental results. The second important aspect is to investigate and observe the influence of the second variable, the Reynolds number, in the developing of the asymmetric flow itself. The results have shown the presence of the mentioned asymmetry as well as an influence of the Reynolds number on it...|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{more energy}} {{efficient}} transportation {{we have to}} reduce losses and resistance forces all over the vehicle. Aerodynamic drag {{is one of the}} primary resistance forces a passenger vehicle has to overcome and the force increases exponentially with increased speed. The under-body and rear-end geometry of a passenger car is a significant contributor to the overall aerodynamic drag and the shape of it is normally a compromise between styling, cost and other properties. To reduce the aerodynamic drag {{it is very important to}} have a good pressure recovery at the rear-end; to end up with a base pressure as high as possible. It is not necessarily the case that an optimized lower part of the rear-end for a square-back car has the same performance as a <b>notch-back</b> or fast-back car. This work investigates the rear-end flow and aerodynamic performance of a sedan and wagon car with varying rear-end under-body design parameters. The study is a numerical analysis using a standard CFD approach commonly used in the automotive industry. A parameter study of under-body covers with varying rear angles, making the rear floor act like a diffuser. The function of the rear floor working as a diffuser is similar regardless of the upper geometry, but its function as a drag reduction device can be very different. Results from this study show a potential to reduce aerodynamic drag of the sedan car approximately 10 %, with the best diffuser angle and cover plates over the floor. The best drag reduction for the wagon car was 2 - 3 % and the optimum was at a smaller diffuser angle. Flow analysis of the wake shows how important it is the wake is balanced...|$|E
