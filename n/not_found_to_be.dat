5|$|Alex {{decides to}} remove {{this program and}} grant Ada her own mental freedom, as he is uninterested in a partner who cannot truly {{interact}} with him. Because removing the program is illegal and carries harsh consequences for both Ada and Alex, they have to pretend Ada is not self-aware. When a jealous love-interest of Alex reports Ada as sentient to the FBI, Alex and Ada attempt to flee the country. When they are intercepted by the FBI, Ada gets shot {{by the police and}} Alex is arrested. He is convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison, but Ada is <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sentient.|$|E
5|$|One {{study found}} that people with or without {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E

5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> responsible for the accident.|$|E

25|$|In a meta-analytic {{study from}} 2008, {{researchers}} found an effect size of −.07 (Cohen's d) between pharmacologic treatments and psychological treatments for depressive disorders, suggesting pharmacologic treatments {{to be slightly}} more effective, though the results were <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> statistically significant. This small effect is true only for SSRIs, with TCAs and other pharmacologic treatments showing no differences from psychological treatments. Additionally, {{there have been several}} studies yielding results that indicate that severe depression responds more favorably to psychotherapy than pharmacotherapy.|$|E

25|$|From their 40s onward, {{males with}} FXS begin {{developing}} progressively more severe problems in performing tasks {{that require the}} central executive of working memory. Working memory involves the temporary storage of information 'in mind', while processing the same or other information. Phonological memory (or verbal working memory) deteriorates with age in males, while visual-spatial memory is <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directly related to age. Males often experience an impairment in {{the functioning of the}} phonological loop. The CGG length is significantly correlated with central executive and the visual–spatial memory. However, in a premutation individual, CGG length is only significantly correlated with the central executive, not with either phonological memory or visual–spatial memory.|$|E
25|$|One {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} colony fission is that male sex ratios are favored, {{which increases the}} chance for genetic drift among colonies and allows the species to become susceptible to inbreeding practices. However, this was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true in Eciton burchellii populations. Research shows that these populations were capable of maintaining {{a high rate of}} gene flow because of the male individuals. High heterozygosity was also found, but no cases of inbreeding. This is accomplished by the males flying at least one kilometer away from their home population to mate with a neighboring colony's queen, thereby minimizing the chances of procreating with a related queen. Also, the monthly migrations of these ant populations help spur enhanced gene flow and eliminate the harmful effects of small breeding population sizes.|$|E
25|$|Political {{ideology}} is <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> correlated with social class; however, a statistical relationship is seen between {{the level of}} one's educational attainment one's likelihood of subscribing to a particular political ideology. In terms of income, liberals tend to be tied with pro-business conservatives. Most mass affluent households {{tend to be more}} right-leaning on fiscal issues but more left-leaning on social issues. The majority, between 50% and 60%, of households with incomes above $50,000 overall, not all of whom are upper middle class, supported the Republican Party in the 2000, 2004, and 2006 elections. Nevertheless, those with postgraduate degrees overall statistically favour the Democratic Party. In 2005, 72% of surveyed full-time faculty members at four-year institutions, the majority of whom would be considered upper middle class, identified themselves as liberal.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the first}} batches of Thompsons were bought in America by agents of the Irish Republic, notably Harry Boland. The first test of a Thompson in Ireland was {{performed}} by West Cork Brigade commander Tom Barry in presence of IRA leader Michael Collins. A total of 653 were purchased, but 495 were seized by US customs authorities in New York in June 1921. The remainder {{made their way to}} the Irish Republican Army by way of Liverpool and were used in the last month of the Irish War of Independence (1919–21). After a truce with the British in July 1921, the IRA imported more Thompsons and they were used in the subsequent Irish Civil War (1922–23). They were <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very effective in Ireland; in only 32% of actions where it was used did the Thompson cause serious casualties (death or serious injury) to those attacked.|$|E
25|$|Near {{the end of}} Craig's term in 1956 {{a scandal}} was {{discovered}} that implicated three highway commissioners in accepting bribes to influence their decision on accepting construction contracts. Lieutenant Governor Harold Handley used the situation to attack Craig, and {{accused him of being}} responsible for the scandal. Craig himself was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> personally involved in the plot, but was required to testify before a grand jury in 1957, after he left office. When he left the court building, he gave an interview to the press in which he attacked William Jenner {{and a number of other}} party leaders for having a political vendetta against him. The scandal and his interview were published around the state and significantly hurt his popularity. In his later years he said that he forgave Jenner for his actions while Craig was governor, and that the two never agreed on anything except the weather.|$|E
25|$|Newer studies {{sometimes}} use mercury vapor analysis {{instead of}} the standard exposure test. Because this test was designed for factories and large enclosures, Consumer Reports has reported {{that this is not}} an accurate method of analysis for the mouth. It is less reliable, less consistent, and tends to greatly exaggerate the amount of mercury inhaled. Moreover, it is argued this test additionally exaggerates the amount of mercury inhaled by assuming that all the mercury vapor released is inhaled. This assumption was reviewed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> valid. Their research review found that most of the mercury vapor released from amalgam fillings is mixed with saliva and swallowed, some part is exhaled, and the remaining fraction is inhaled. Of these amounts, {{it is important to note}} that the lungs absorb about 80% of inhaled mercury whereas only about 0.01% of swallowed mercury vapour is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

25|$|After the verdict, the {{question}} was how to collect. The former monarchy of Iran had {{billions of dollars in}} assets within the United States that were frozen after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. However, in order to secure an end to the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the assets were unfrozen and most if not all of it, was collected by 1982 due to the Iran–Iraq War. Rhode Island attorney David J. Strachman, along with other attorneys, representing the plaintiffs, found that the late Shah had purchased a home in Lubbock, Texas for his son, which was sold for $400,000;. After that, they attempted to go after assets of Iranians who had previously worked for the former monarchy, but the U.S. courts would overturn all their attempts to seize their assets, as they were <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> liable for the damages. They then went after Iranian-owned objects held by U.S. museums in Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan. The Oriental Institute and its holdings from Persepolis became a primary target. Strachman said collectors are interested in the antiquities, potentially for tens of millions of dollars.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was tested}} as a {{chemical}} weapon in WWI but was <b>not</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very effective. United States and Italy used hydrogen cyanide against the Central Powers in 1918. France had {{used it in}} combat already in 1916, but this proved to be ineffective due to weather conditions. The gas is lighter than air and rapidly disperses up into the atmosphere; this {{is in contrast to}} denser agents such as phosgene or chlorine which tend to remain at ground level. Compared to such agents it must also be present in higher concentrations in order to be fatal. These properties combine to make its use in the field impractical. A hydrogen cyanide concentration in the range of 100–200 ppm in air will kill a human within 10 to 60 minutes. A hydrogen cyanide concentration of 2000 ppm (about 2380mg/m3) will kill a human in about 1 minute. The toxicity is caused by the cyanide ion, which halts cellular respiration by acting as a non-competitive inhibitor for an enzyme in mitochondria called cytochrome c oxidase. As such hydrogen cyanide is commonly listed among chemical warfare as a blood agent. It is listed under Schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention as a potential weapon which has large-scale industrial uses, manufacturing plants in signatory countries which produce more than 30 metric tons per year must be declared to, and can be inspected by, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.|$|E

In the 16th-century Romeo and Juliet, [...] {{blisters}} [...] "o'er ladies' lips" [...] are mentioned. In the 18th century, it was so common among prostitutes that it was called [...] "a vocational disease of women".
