40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the main design parameters contributing to loosening of bolts due to vibration and to identify their relative importance and degree of contribution to bolt loosening. Vibration testing was conducted on a shaketable with a controlled-random input in the dynamic testing laboratory of the Structural Test Division of MSFC. Test specimens which contained one test bolt were vibrated for a fixed amount of time and percentage of pre-load loss was measured. Each specimen tested implemented some combination of eleven design parameters as dictated by the design of experiment methodology employed. The eleven design parameters were: bolt size (diameter), lubrication on bolt, hole tolerance, initial pre-load, <b>nut</b> <b>locking</b> <b>device,</b> grip length, thread pitch, lubrication between mating materials, class of fit, joint configuration and mass of configuration. These parameters were chosen for this experiment because they are believed to be the design parameters having the greatest impact on bolt loosening. Two values of each design parameter were used and each combination of parameters tested was subjected to two different directions of vibration and two different g-levels of vibration. One replication was made for each test to gain some indication of experimental error and repeatability and to give some degree of statistical credibility to the data, resulting in a total of 96 tests being performed. The results of the investigation indicated that nut locking devices, joint configuration, fastener size, and mass of configuration were significant in bolt loosening due to vibration. The results of this test can be utilized to further research the complex problem of bolt loosening due to vibration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Locking {{devices are}} widely used in robotics, for {{instance}} to lock springs, joints or to reconfigure robots.

Aiming at the 1 # {{centrifuge}} of CAEP(China Academy of Engineering Physics), the mechanical design of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> has been done, and its maximum locking torque is 8000 N·M. The simulation model has been established in ANSYS to obtain key parameters of the <b>locking</b> <b>device,</b> such as the thickness of shaft, the distribution of circular groove, the working pressure of oil source and so on.

For these devices, many disadvantages are included such as inconvenient assembly, difficult processing and so on.

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> {{that consists}} of an electromagnet and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric <b>locking</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>Locking</b> <b>devices</b> can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> remains <b>locked</b> when power is lost. Fail-safe <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the electromagnet portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the electromagnet is energized, a current passing through the electromagnet creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the electromagnet, creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the electromagnet and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R

40|$|A new Research Reactor (ARR) {{has been}} under design by KAERI since 2002. In this work, {{as a first step}} for the design of the fuel {{assembly}} of the ARR, the conceptual design has been carried out. The vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel model and the locking performance of the preliminary designed <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were investigated. In order to investigate the effects of the stiffener on the vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel, a modal analysis was performed for the finite element models of the tubular fuels with stiffeners and without stiffeners. The analysis results show that the vibration characteristics of the tubular fuel with stiffeners are better than those of the tubular fuel without stiffeners. To investigate the locking performance of the preliminary designed <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> for the fuel assembly of the ARR, the elements of the <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were fabricated. Then the torsional resistance, fixing status and vibration characteristics of the <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> were tested. The test results show that using the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> with fins on the bottom guide can prevent the torsional motion of the fuel assembly, and that additional springs or guides {{on the top of the}} fuel assembly are needed to suppress the lateral motion of the fuel assembly. Based on the modal analysis and experimental results, the fuel assembly and <b>locking</b> <b>devices</b> of the ARR were designed and its prototype was fabricated. The locking performance, pressure drop characteristics and vibration characteristics of the newly designed fuel assembly will be tested in the near future...|$|R

40|$|The {{dimensioning}} of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> of {{a switch}} is made essentially {{as a function}} of the applied loads during the switch rails movement or considering a false route. The phenomena related to the vibrations induced by the track are therefore normally not taken into account. Such vibrations are particularly accentuated by the ballast bed deconsolidation in the sleeper panel supporting the <b>locking</b> <b>device.</b> Unfortunately, there is no specific technical reference in order to control these aspects, even though the most frequent cause of <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> components failures is relied to the vertical oscillations induced by the trains, rather than to the effort to commute the switch rails. In this study, the results of a field investigation carried out at two levels of ballast tamping are reported and discussed. It is found that the ballast compaction plays a fundamental role for the component to be prone to the early attainment of critical mechanical conditions. Procedures for the monitoring of the stability and efficiency of the ballast bed to ensure the required reliability of the <b>locking</b> <b>device</b> are also envisaged...|$|R
