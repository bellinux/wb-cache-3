A few disapproved of Delaroche's choice of painting, while others disapproved of Delaroche himself, saying, in some form, that he sought the genius of Napoleon, to <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Back in La Pointe, Buffalo {{took several}} actions to {{forestall}} and prevent removal. He {{and other leaders}} petitioned the US government {{for the next two}} years to <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the debacle in Sandy Lake. Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran editorials condemning the removal effort.

5|$|Former Waffen-SS men {{who wished}} to join the Bundeswehr still faced {{heightened}} scrutiny. All Waffen-SS applicants went through the rigorous vetting process reserved only for those with the higher ranks in the Wehrmacht. HIAG protested {{to the government and}} its military planners, but to <b>no</b> <b>avail.</b> As a result, by September 1956, only 33 of 1310 applications by ex-Waffen-SS officers had been accepted (making them 0.4% of the Bundeswehr's officer corps), as compared to 195 of 462 applications by enlisted men.|$|E

50|$|Roman and Byzantine law made no {{room for}} the custom. The Codex and the Digesta of Justinian I include {{sections}} respectively titled De naufragiis and De incendio, ruina, naufragio rate, nave expugnata. They refer to a law of the emperor Antoninus Pius outlawing exercise of the jus naufragii. Around 500 the Breviarium Alaricianum of the Visigoths, probably following Roman law, forbade the custom. Theodoric the Great also legislated against it, but apparently to <b>no</b> long-term <b>avail.</b>|$|R

60|$|We {{always knew}} when these {{disorders}} had set in, we {{knew all the}} signs but <b>no</b> medicine <b>availed</b> to stop their progress.

Death was a never-absent hovering shadow when those bitter winter winds were blowing, and realizing this I came to hate the great desolate city in which we lived, and to long with the most passionate ardor for the coming of April's sun.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism.

Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
60|$|That {{leaves no}} room for a modern Utopia in Central Africa, or in South America, or round about the pole, those last refuges of ideality. The {{floating}} isle of La Cite Morellyste <b>no</b> longer <b>avails.</b> We need a planet. Lord Erskine, {{the author of a}} Utopia ("Armata") that might have been inspired by Mr. Hewins, was the first of all Utopists to perceive this--he joined his twin planets pole to pole by a sort of umbilical cord. But the modern imagination, obsessed by physics, must travel further than that.|$|R
60|$|A few heavy {{drops of}} rain splashed against one window. The clouds were lower and denser.

Perhaps he is a messenger from your father." ...|$|R
