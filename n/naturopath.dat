5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a <b>naturopath.</b> Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some <b>naturopath</b> practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. There appears to be no consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E

40|$|A {{pilot survey}} was {{undertaken}} to identify dietitians' and naturopaths' attitudes to and advice about organic foods, and {{to ascertain whether}} nutrition education is required. A questionnaire, which was not validated, was mailed to 240 randomly selected private practice dietitians and <b>naturopaths</b> in Australia. The responses were analysed by chi-squared and independent two-samples t-test. Each group had {{a response rate of}} 50 %. More dietitians (n = 52) than <b>naturopaths</b> (n = 18) (P < 0. 01) indicated a lack of difference in protein (88 % vs 30 %), fat (83 % vs 33 % where n = 49 dietitians and 20 <b>naturopaths)</b> and carbohydrate (85 % vs 38 %, n = 50 dietitians and 23 <b>naturopaths)</b> between organic and conventional foods. Significantly more <b>naturopaths</b> (P < 0. 01) than dietitians indicated that organic foods contained more vitamins (85 % vs 32 %, n = 51 <b>naturopaths</b> and 19 dietitians), minerals (82 % vs 25 %, n = 49 <b>naturopaths</b> and 15 dietitians) and phytochemicals (72 % vs 32 %, n = 43 <b>naturopaths</b> and 19 dietitians) compared with conventionally produced foods. The majority of <b>naturopaths</b> indicated that organic foods have a favourable effect on health (97 %, n = 58) and differ in taste (82 %, n = 49). Dietitians were less certain with n = 21 thinking there is an effect on health and n = 15 indicating that there is a difference in taste (P < 0. 01). More <b>naturopaths</b> (77 %, n = 46) than dietitians (31 %, n = 18) indicated that they have sufficient knowledge of organic food. <b>Naturopaths</b> discuss the topic of organic food with their clients 'sometimes' (55 %, n = 33) or 'always' (32 %, n = 19) whereas the majority of dietitians 'seldom' (51 %, n = 30) or 'never' (7 %, n = 4) do so. <b>Naturopaths</b> recommend organic foods more often than dietitians (P < 0. 001).

Nature cures include a range of therapies based on exposure to natural elements such as sunshine, fresh air, or heat or cold, as well as nutrition advice such as following a vegetarian and whole food diet, fasting, or abstention from alcohol and sugar.

25|$|In 1977, a {{committee}} reviewed all colleges of naturopathy in Australia and found that, although the syllabuses of many colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little {{relationship to the}} documented course. In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, {{at a level of}} dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the <b>naturopath</b> and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.|$|E

40|$|Naturopathic medicine, {{also known}} as naturopathy, {{is a type of}} {{complementary}} and alternative medicine. It appeals to many people, especially those who desire a “holistic ” approach to both prevention and treatment. While there is much variation in the types of treatment used by different <b>naturopaths,</b> commonly used ones include acupuncture, herbalism, and homeopathy. These types of treatment often lack sound supporting evidence of efficacy. But at the same time <b>naturopaths</b> are often hostile to conventional drugs, even those that are of proven effectiveness and pose little risk of harmful side effects. Many <b>naturopaths</b> employ treatments, such as diet, herbs, fasting, and colonic irrigation that are claimed to “detoxify ” the body and thereby lead to improved health. There is a complete absence of supporting evidence for this type of therapy. Some aspects of the theories and practices employed by <b>naturopaths</b> are well supported by the evidence. In particular, the emphasis that <b>naturopaths</b> place on leading a healthy lifestyle so as to prevent disease is entirely consistent with modern concepts in this area. Overall, the positive aspects of naturopathy are greatly outweighed by the negative aspects...|$|R
