50|$|One {{example of}} {{perimeter}} protection {{still in use}} is razor wire fencing. While U.S. ranchers in the 19th century kept the cattle in and the rustlers out with barbed wire, World War I saw the advent of specialized barbed wire to secure military operations. The 1965 escalation of the Vietnam conflict was accelerated by the successful penetration of ten foot high concertina wire (razor wire) fencing around Camp Holloway. Variations {{of this type of}} perimeter protection were used prolifically throughout the 20th century. Booby traps, electric fencing, watch towers and <b>night</b> <b>flares</b> were also vigorously employed to keep enemy forces out.|$|R

2500|$|A second {{voyage to}} Tahiti was aborted when Hōkūlea capsized and swamped in high wind and seas {{southwest}} of the Island of Molokai, five hours after departing Honolulu's Ala Wai Harbor. The crew hung on to the swamped canoe through the <b>night.</b> <b>Flares</b> were unseen by passing aircraft; the emergency radio reached no help.

Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.|$|R

The squadron received its nickname, “Big Red,” for dropping red <b>night</b> illumination <b>flares</b> (150 Mk-6 flares per mission) for allied air and ground units.

5|$|The Soviet Air Force {{practice}} of harassing German ground forces using antiquated Polikarpov Po-2 and R-5 biplanes at <b>night</b> to drop <b>flares</b> and fragmentation bombs, inspired the Luftwaffe to form its own Störkampfstaffeln (harassment squadrons). On 23 July 1942, Junkers offered the Ju 87 B-2, R-2 and R-4s with Flammenvernichter ("flame eliminators"). On 10 November 1943, the RLM GL/C-E2 Division finally authorised the design in directive No. 1117. This new equipment made the Ju 87 {{more difficult to}} detect from the ground in darkness.|$|R

On 6 December, the squadron transferred to Ubon to relieve the 47th TFS which rotated back to the US.|$|R
60|$|The mono-rail cable {{standard}} {{became a}} striking fact in urban landscape, {{for the most}} part stout iron erections rather like tapering trestles, and painted a bright bluish green.

These, by the bye, were placed almost horizontally to catch the eye of the passing mono-rail passengers above, and so served admirably to roof over a tool-shed and a mushroom-shed for Tom. All day and all night the fast cars from Brighton and Hastings went murmuring by overhead long, broad, comfortable-looking cars, that were brightly lit after dusk.

Many of the measurements, particularly the cross channel sightings, were taken at <b>night</b> using intense <b>flares</b> (handled by the artillery).

The diggers dug all through the short <b>night</b> by <b>flaring</b> pipes of gas, and on a level with the early sun, and deeper and deeper below it as it rose into its zenith, and aslant of it as it declined, and on a level with it again as it departed. Sturdy digging, and shovelling, and carrying away, in carts, barrows, and baskets, went on without intermission, by night and by day; but it was night for the second time when they found the dirty heap of rubbish that had been the foreigner before his head had been shivered to atoms, like so much glass, by the great beam that lay upon him, crushing him.|$|R

After a barrage of artillery fire, two companies of the 2e BEP stormed and took back 22 bis. After 7 hard-fought hours, the 3e BPC took back P.A. 24. At 9:00 PM, General Giap's forces launched their all out offensive at Nà Sản. Wave after wave of soldiers relentlessly assaulted several P.A.s, especially 21 bis and 26; sometimes the attackers outnumbered the defenders fifteen to one. All <b>night,</b> Dakotas dropped <b>flares</b> over the battlefields to give support troops visibility to defend the positions. Defending forces continuously fired their cannons into Vietminh human waves while B-26s, Hellcats and Privateers dropped bombs and napalm onto enemy attack waves and positions.

The laden trucks come lumbering in to the sugar mills at Ingham. All the air is sugar-sweet through the North at {{crushing}} time. " Clement Christensen, 1937. The above quote from Clement Christensen's 1937 book Queensland Journey was accompanied by a colour painting of what one assumes to be Victoria Sugar Mill, near Ingham, although there is no caption to indicate the name of the sugar mill. In front of the sugar mill was a locomotive pulling cane trucks loaded with harvested cane. The quote and painting occupy an entire page that starts the section in the book which deals with information for tourists travelling to North Queensland. This text is loaded with imagery associated with the production of sugar: 'the pennon of smoke' from the Victoria crushing mill at Ingham; 'a million acres of verdant plantations'; 'green fields of sugar cane spread over hills and dales like a shoreless sea'; and 'in the crushing season the mills pulsate with life, and by <b>night</b> the <b>flares</b> of burning trash illuminate a landscape which has all the appearances of a foreign country' (Christensen, 1937 : 36, 83 and 105).

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of very high energy gamma- ray emission from the intermediate- frequency- peaked BL Lacertae object W Comae (z = 0. 102) by VERITAS. The source was observed between 2008 January and April. A strong outburst of gamma-ray emission was measured {{in the middle of}} March, lasting for only 4 days. The energy spectrum measured during the two highest <b>flare</b> <b>nights</b> is fit by a power law and is found to be very steep, with a differential photon spectral index of Gamma = 3. 81 +/- 0. 35 (stat) +/- 0. 34 (syst). The integral photon flux above 200 GeV during those two nights corresponds to roughly 9 % of the flux from the Crab Nebula. Quasi-simultaneous Swift observations at X-ray energies were triggered by the VERITAS observations. The spectral energy distribution of the flare data can be described by synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) or external Compton (EC) leptonic jet models...|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} types and styles of yoga pants in {{addition}} to the traditional. The flared yoga pants are also commonly used as dancewear allowing it to stretch and for the ease of movement it affords. They also typically have combinations of stretchy fabric blends offered by lycra spandex and nylon giving the pants a rich and silky appearance and feel when worn. Crop-fitted yoga pants lie above the ankle (similar to capri pants), and are oftentimes utilized for a more flattering, versatile, and dressier look during warmer times of the year. They are used commonly as casual wear, activewear, for making errands, lounging, or as clubwear on a <b>night</b> out. The <b>flared</b> yoga pants are often paired with flip-flops, running shoes, flats, or Ugg boots, worn along with hoodies, shawls, cardigans or wraps paired with a tank top or shirt tucked underneath. Due to their high elasticity, yoga pants are comfortable enough to wear for many purposes. They were originally created for practicing yoga, but have become popular as everday mainstream clothing item in classrooms, gymnasiums, restaurants, shopping malls, and nightclubs.|$|R
2500|$|During the Vietnam War, the {{incredible}} {{success of the}} Douglas AC-47 Spooky but limitations of the size and carrying capacity of the plane led the US Air Force to develop a larger plane to carry more surveillance gear, weaponry, and ammunition, the AC-130 Spectre. However, due to the strong demands of C-130s for cargo use there were not enough Hercules frames to provide Spectres for operations against the enemy. The Air Force filled the gap by converting C-119s into AC-119s each equipped with four 7.62 minigun pods, a Xenon searchlight, <b>night</b> observation sight, <b>flare</b> launcher, fire control computer and TRW fire control safety display to prevent incidents of friendly fire. [...] The new AC-119 squadron was given the call-sign [...] "Creep" [...] that launched a wave of indignation that led the Air Force to change the name to [...] "Shadow" [...] on 1 December 1968. C-119Gs were modified as AC-119G Shadows and AC-119K Stingers. They were used successfully in both close air support missions in South Vietnam and interdiction missions against trucks and supplies along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
