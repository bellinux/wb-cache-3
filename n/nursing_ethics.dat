40|$|Introduction: Nursing {{profession}} requires {{knowledge of}} ethics to guide performance. The {{nature of this}} profession necessitates ethical care more than routine care. Today, worldwide definition of professional ethic code has been done based on human and ethical issues in the communication between nurse and patient. To improve all dimensions of nursing, we need to respect ethic codes. The {{aim of this study}} is to assess knowledge and performance about <b>nursing</b> <b>ethic</b> codes from nurses' and patients' perspective. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study Conducted upon 345 nurses and 500 inpatients in six teaching hospitals of Tabriz, 2012. To investigate nurses' knowledge and performance, data were collected by using structured questionnaires. Statistical analysis was done using descriptive and analytic statistics, independent t-test and ANOVA and Pearson correlation coefficient, in SPSS 13. Results: Most of the nurses were female, married, educated at BS degree and 86. 4 % of them were aware of Ethic codes also 91. 9 % of nurses and 41. 8 % of patients represented <b>nurses</b> respect <b>ethic</b> codes. Nurses' and patients' perspective about ethic codes differed significantly. Significant relationship was found between nurses' knowledge of ethic codes and job satisfaction and complaint of ethical performance. Conclusion: According to the results, consideration to teaching <b>ethic</b> codes in <b>nursing</b> curriculum for student and continuous education for staff is proposed, on the other hand recognizing failures of the health system, optimizing nursing care, attempt to inform patients about <b>Nursing</b> <b>ethic</b> codes, promote patient rights and achieve patient satisfaction can minimize the differences between the two perspectives...|$|R

25|$|The {{nature of}} nursing means that <b>nursing</b> <b>ethics</b> tends {{to examine the}} ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by {{exploring}} the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care. Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the virtues {{that would make a}} good nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct in relation to the person in the nurse's care. In recent times, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights and dignity of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses, such as in the latest code from the International Council of Nurses.|$|E
2500|$|Like medical ethics, <b>nursing</b> <b>ethics</b> is {{very narrow}} in its focus, {{especially}} {{when compared to}} the expansive field of bioethics. For the most part, [...] "nursing ethics can be defined as having a two-pronged meaning," [...] whereby it is [...] "the examination of all kinds of ethical and bioethical issues from the perspective of nursing theory and practice." [...] This definition, although quite vague, centers on the practical and theoretical approaches to nursing. The American Nurses Association (ANA) endorses an ethical code that emphasizes [...] "values" [...] and [...] "evaluative judgments" [...] in all areas of the nursing profession. The importance of values is being increasingly recognized in all aspects of healthcare and health research. And since moral issues are extremely prevalent throughout nursing, {{it is important to be}} able to recognize and critically respond to situations that warrant and/or necessitate an ethical decision.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the every-day moral decision making of experienced nurses. Eight experienced registered nurses participated in the completed research that is based on data gathered through interviews, document audit and literature review. A grounded theory approach was used to analyse the extensive data gathered for the study. This methodology generated a theoretical description involving the antecedents, processes and consequences of nursing moral decision making. Nursing practice has a moral content, if not an entirely moral purpose, and moral decision making is the central component of this practice. Every day, in numerous institutions and community settings, registered nurses make moral decisions in their practice, yet the ethical aspects of nursing practice remain a comparatively recent field of study. It is therefore essential to nurses and their patients that this process is adequately studied and theorised. To date, very few studies have been undertaken in this area in New Zealand. This study aims to at least partially redress this situation by offering insights through conceptualisation and theoretical description of nursing moral decision making. The findings of the study reveal that antecedents such as personal moral development, upbringing and social experiences, contribute to a 'nursing ethic' that guided the moral decision making of the experienced nurses who participated in the study. Furthermore, the study shows that the context and individual and shared perceptions of moral events influence the degree of nursing involvement in ethical situations. Finally, the study maintains that an intrinsic and enduring <b>nursing</b> <b>ethic</b> may serve to guide ethical decision making in <b>nursing.</b> This <b>ethic</b> is an undeniable phenomenon of considerable significance to nursing practice and education...|$|R

The aim was to analyze the errors that occur during surgery, to determine the participants in perioperative care who commit these mistakes, and to analyze the reasons why these errors occur. The theoretical part deals {{with the concept of}} security from different perspectives of patient safety in surgery, and the international guidelines that direct it. The situation in the Czech Republic in terms of care for patient safety in surgery is also described. One chapter deals with the autor's internship in operating rooms in Sweden. Using the results of observations, the empirical part of the dissertation analyzes the actual behaviour of staff in perioperative care during surgery against the binding documents that ensure safe perioperative care. It also sets out the reasons that lead to non-compliance of health and safety regulations in perioperative theatres. In conclusion, I suggest steps that would help to improve the situation.

40|$|The {{notion of}} 'Care' has {{occupied}} a central place as foundation in <b>nursing</b> theory, <b>ethics</b> and practice. An examination of critical and authoritative documents {{reveals that the}} term is vague and ill defined.
