50|$|Though not {{completely}} understood, Madagascan rousettes {{have been found}} in large quantities within the regurgitated pellets of Tyto alba, a type of barn owl native to Madagascar. A study conducted at Antonibe found that roughly four-fifths of the owl's diet consisted of adult rousettes. Previous studies have shown that T. alba does not always prey on large bodied bats and also shown that they can shift their feeding habits based on food availability. One theory of why T. alba feeds mostly on adults is that the owl preferentially hunts the larger bodied variant of the bat. Another theory is that the rousettes are not always available as a food resource due to <b>nursing</b> <b>colonies</b> within the bat populations. This theory would also explain the irregular predation of the rousettes.|$|R
5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have <b>nursing</b> <b>colonies</b> located in Hungary.|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} in a honeybee breeding apiary at Teodorów in 2004. Honeybee queens were caged in queenless colonies or in an incubator. Temperature was compared in spaces between frames of colonies where either non-inseminated queens were kept in Zander cages without attendant bees or instrumentally inseminated queens in “Folchron ” mailing cages were attended by bees. Temperature was also measured in cages with queens that were placed in beehives or in incubators. Temperature records were also taken outside the beehives and in the incubators. During the final investigations {{the manner in which}} the queens were kept before and after insemination was compared for its impact on the filling of queen spermathecae and on the evacuation of sperm from the oviduct. The temperature in the frame spaces of honeybee nests in which the cages with instrumentally inseminated bees together with attendant bees were placed was found to average 34. 5 °C and to be significantly higher than that measured in the frame spaces containing cages with non-inseminated queens and without attendant bees.

40|$|Studying the {{dispersal}} behaviour of small, volant, and nocturnal {{animals such as}} microchiropterans {{with direct}} methods (banding [...] recapture, telemetry) {{is a very difficult}} task. The development of easily scorable and highly variable genetic markers nowadays allows us to study some aspects of dispersal indirectly, using population genetics. Here, we applied these indirect methods to characterize male dispersal behaviour in a European bat species. The eight microsatellite loci analysed were highly variable in all the <b>nursing</b> <b>colonies</b> assessed (h = 0. 63 - 0. 93). Contrary to what we found in the mtDNA, an AMOVA and F-statistics showed that the overall European population structure of the noctule bat was very weak, indicating a high male dispersal rate. Nevertheless, the population was not totally panmictic (theta = 0. 006, p < 0. 001), and neither isolation by distance, nor influence of migration could account for this result. Rather, an analysis of pairwise theta-values showed that the population structure might be explained partly by a geographical barrier to gene flow (the Alps), and partly by {{the fact that there is}} some limit to the distance the males can disperse...|$|R

40|$|The primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata {{shows an}} age-based {{division}} of labor in which workers allocate tasks according to their relative ages (age ranks). This age polyethism seems quite flexible because in colonies devoid of old workers, young individuals can perform the tasks normally performed by older workers. Social interactions {{appear to be a}} plausible mechanism by which workers can assess their relative ages. To explore possible proximate mechanisms that can potentially generate such a flexible, age-based task allocation, the activator-inhibitor model was adapted to the social biology of R. marginata and tested using computer simulations. The model generated a clear age polyethism including the phenomena of precocious foragers in colonies with only young individuals and reverted <b>nurses</b> in <b>colonies</b> consisting of only old individuals. A simple extension of the model to allow the brood:adult ratio to modulate the rates of social interactions, shows how increasing task demands can be met by a decrease in the ages of first performance of, and an increase in the proportions of individuals engaged in, various tasks. These results show how a pattern of {{division of labor}} based on relative age can be generated and modulated by social interactions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractMalnutrition is a {{major cause}} of colony losses. In managed hives, bees are fed protein {{supplements}} (PS) during pollen shortages. If bees were provided with natural forage instead of PS, would they have lower pathogen levels and higher queen and colony survival? We addressed this question by either providing colonies with forage (Brassica rapa—rapini) or feeding them PS from November to February. Soluble protein concentrations in the PS were lower than the rapini pollen as were levels of most amino acids. Nurse bees digested less of the protein in PS than the pollen. Hemolymph protein titers in <b>nurse</b> bees and <b>colony</b> growth did not differ between those fed PS or foraging on rapini. However, colonies fed PS had higher levels of black queen cell virus and Nosema and greater queen losses, indicating that natural forage might improve overwintering survival...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{sublethal}} pesticide exposure on queen emergence and virus titers were examined. Queen rearing colonies were fed pollen with chlorpyrifos (CPF) alone (pollen- 1) and with CPF and the fungicide Pristine&# 174; (pollen- 2). Fewer queens emerged when larvae from open foraging (i. e., outside) colonies were reared in colonies fed pollen- 1 or 2 compared with when those larvae were reared in outside colonies. Larvae grafted from and reared in colonies fed pollen- 2 had {{lower rates of}} queen emergence than pollen- 1 or outside colonies. Deformed wing virus (DWV) and black queen cell virus were found in <b>nurse</b> bees from <b>colonies</b> fed pollen- 1 or 2 and in outside colonies. The viruses also were detected in queen larvae. However, we did not detect virus in emerged queens grafted from and reared in outside colonies. In contrast, DWV was found in all emerged queens grafted from colonies fed pollen- 1 or 2 either reared in outside hives or those fed pollen- 1 or 2. The results suggest that sublethal exposure of CPF alone but especially when Pristine&# 174; is added reduces queen emergence possibly due to compromised immunity in developing queens...|$|R
40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are {{the most}} {{economically}} important insect pollinator of agricultural crops in the United States. Honey bee colonies are required for pollination of approximately one-third of the nation’s fruit, vegetable, nut, and forage crops, with an estimated annual value in the billions of dollars. The economic value of a honey bee colony comes from its population size, as large colonies provide the necessary foraging force required for large-scale crop pollination services. A major component of colony strength is its genetic diversity, {{a consequence of the}} reproductive mating strategy of the queen known as polyandry. Despite some inherent risks of multiple mating, several studies have demonstrated significant advantages of intracolonial genetic diversity for honey bee colony productivity. Colony-level benefits include better disease resistance, more stable brood nest thermoregulation, and greater colony growth. Instrumental insemination of honey bee queens is a technique to precisely control queen mating, and thereby creates the opportunity to investigate the effects of intracolonial genetic diversity on colony performance. In this dissertation, I first consider the effects of intracolonial genetic diversity on pollen foraging using colonies headed by queens which were instrumentally inseminated with either one or twenty drones to generate colonies of very high or very low intracolonial genetic diversity, respectively. I found that colonies with high intracolonial genetic diversity amass significantly more pollen and rear more brood than colonies with low intracolonial genetic diversity. Of particular interest, colonies with low intracolonial genetic diversity collected a significantly greater variety of pollen types. I discuss these results in the context of scouting and recruiting, and suggest a more efficient foraging strategy exists among genetically diverse colonies. While intracolonial genetic diversity is positively correlated with collected pollen, its effect on the colony’s ability to process and distribute inbound protein resources is unknown. Again using colonies headed by queens instrumentally inseminated with either one or twenty drones, I studied the effects of intracolonial genetic diversity on pollen consumption and digestion by nurse bees, as well as protein allocation among nestmates by assessing total soluble protein concentration of late instar larvae, and total soluble hemolymph protein concentration in both nurses and pollen foragers. I found that <b>nurse</b> bees from <b>colonies</b> with high intracolonial genetic diversity consume and process more protein than <b>nurses</b> from <b>colonies</b> with low intracolonial genetic diversity, even when given equal access to protein resources. Further, both forager hemolymph protein concentrations and larval total protein concentrations were higher among the colonies with high intracolonial genetic diversity. My findings suggest that protein processing and distribution within a honey bee colony is affected by the social context of the hive. I discuss “worker policing”, and the role of nurse bees in modulating the foraging effort. Finally, I assess the standing genetic variability among several colonies sourced from different genetic and geographic locations. Using microsatellite DNA from workers sampled from each colony, I determined allelic richness, gene diversity, and effective mating frequency for each genetic line. I found differences in all three metrics between lines, and for one line in particular, there was no correlation with genetic variation and effective mating frequency, suggesting non-random mating. My results showed very different levels of intracolonial genetic diversity among naturally mated queens. Because of its impact on colony performance, the importance of maintaining genetic diversity in breeding populations is discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHoney bee queens {{mate with}} {{multiple}} males resulting in high intracolonial genetic diversity among nestmates; a reproductive strategy known as extreme polyandry. Several {{studies have demonstrated}} the adaptive significance of extreme polyandry for overall colony performance and colony growth. Colonies that are more genetically diverse collect more pollen than colonies with less diversity. However, the effects of intracolonial genetic diversity on worker nutritional status are unknown. We created colonies headed by queens instrumentally inseminated with sperm from either 1 or 20 drones, then compared protein consumption, digestion, and uptake among nestmates. We found that <b>nurse</b> bees from <b>colonies</b> with multiple-drone-inseminated (MDI) queens consumed more pollen, had lower amounts of midgut tissue protease, and invested more protein into larvae than nurse bees from single-drone-inseminated (SDI) queens. Pollen foragers from MDI colonies had significantly higher hemolymph protein concentration than pollen foragers from SDI colonies. Differences in hemolymph protein concentration between nurses and pollen foragers were significantly smaller among MDI colonies than among SDI colonies. While intracolonial genetic diversity is correlated with increased foraging, our results suggest that this relationship may be driven {{in part by the}} elevated resource demands of nurse bees in genetically diverse colonies that consume and distribute more protein in response to the social context within the hive...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{honey bee}} colony, the brood {{is able to}} {{manipulate}} and chemically control the workers in order to sustain their own development. A brood ester pheromone produced primarily by old larvae (4 and 5 days old larvae) was first identified as acting as a contact pheromone with specific effects on <b>nurses</b> in the <b>colony.</b> More recently a new volatile brood pheromone has been identified: E-b-ocimene, which partially inhibits ovary development in workers. Methodology and Principal Finding: Our analysis of E-b-ocimene production revealed that young brood (newly hatched to 3 days old) produce the highest quantity of E-b-ocimene relative to their body weight. By testing the potential action of this molecule as a non-specific larval signal, due to its high volatility in the colony, we demonstrated that {{in the presence of}} E-bocimene nest workers start to forage earlier in life, as seen in the presence of real brood. Conclusions/Significance: In this way, young larvae are able to assign precedence to the task of foraging by workers in order to increase food stores for their own development. Thus, in the complexity of honey bee chemical communication, Eb- ocimene, a pheromone of young larvae, provides the brood with the means to express their nutritional needs to the workers...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the extent to}} which selected Indiana superintendents of schools tie work as central life interest and to compare leadership behaviors of superintendents identified as having high interest in work and superintendents with low work interest, as perceived by subordinate administrators. Ninety-five of the 116 superintendents invited to participate in the study completed the Central Life Interest Inventory developed by Dubin. Analyses of responses resulted in identification of the intensity to which superintendents viewed work as a central life interest. Subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having high commitment to work and subordinate administrators identified by the twenty-five superintendents identified as having low interest in work were invited to evaluate respective superintendents by means of the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire- - Form XII. Twelve null hypotheses were developed to facilitate determination of statistically significant differences between subordinate administrator evaluative response of superintendents having high interest in work and superintendents having low interest in work. Statistical treatment of the twelve hypotheses was accomplished by means of the chi-square test of significance. The. 05 level of confidence was established as the critical probability level for the non-acceptance of hypotheses. Findings relative to the first study purpose, which was to measure the extent to which selected Indiana superintendents view work as central life interest, were: 1. Thirty-two, or 33. 6 percent, of the ninety-five participating superintendents had a high interest in work as a central life interest. 2. Eighteen earlier studies had measured the extent to which persons in various occupations viewed work as a central life interest. When superintendents were compared and contrasted, nine occupational groups reflected higher interest in work as a central life interest and nine groups reflected lower interest in work as a central life interest. Superintendents had a higher interest in work as a central life interest than lumber workers, truck drivers, American factory workers, secondary teachers, elementary teachers, principals, industrial arts teachers, clerical workers, and British factory workers. Superintendents had a lower interest in work as a central life interest than management personnel in Japanese industry, cooperative extension agents, <b>nurses,</b> Amana <b>Colony</b> workers, management personnel in American industry, middle managers in Oregon, middle managers in seven states, industrial supervisors, and German industrial workers. Findings relative to the second study purpose, a comparison of the leadership behaviors of the high and low superintendent groups as measured by perceptions of subordinate administrators using the Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire [...] Form XII instrument, were no statistically significant differences were found to exist for the three specific leadership behaviors factors of Representation, Demand Reconciliation, and Initiation of Structures. Statistically significant differences were found to exist for each of the nine specific leadership factors of Tolerance of Uncertainty, Persuasiveness, Tolerance of Freedom, Role Assumption, Consideration, Production Emphasis, Predictive Accuracy, Integration, and Superior Orientation. The major conclusion relative to the first study purpose was that even though relatively small percentages of superintendents might score as having high commitment to work as a central life interest, superintendents as a group do have high professional standards and are committed to performing job responsibilities effectively and efficiently. The major conclusion relative to the second study purpose as that superintendents with a high commitment to work as a central lire interest, are perceived by subordinates as being more effective leaders.

40|$|An {{intimate}} {{association between}} two species {{is known as}} a symbiosis. A symbiotic relationship where both partners benefit is defined as a mutualism. This is in contrast with parasitism, where one partner benefits at the expense of another partner. Commensalism is a third type of symbiotic association and is characterized by one partner that takes advantage of the association and the other is unaffected. These different types of symbioses are widespread in social insects. The largest diversity of social insect symbionts evolved in the group of myrmecophiles, which are arthropods that live inside or in close vicinity of ant nests. Up till now, studies on myrmecophiles focus typically on the association between a host and a single symbiont. In this thesis, ant nests were considered as microcosms with multiple myrmecophiles living together in the same ant nest. We were interested in the biotic and abiotic interactions that affect the symbiotic community as a whole, rather than focusing on single species interactions. In addition, our current knowledge on the symbiosis of arthropods with ants is typically based on very specialized species. Here, we focus on relatively unspecialized myrmecophiles, which probably outnumber the group of specialized species. Our main model system was the myrmecophile microcosm in the nests of red wood ants (Formica rufa group). Our second model system was an association of co- inhabiting (= parabiosis) African ant species that also houses a community of myrmecophile species. In chapter 1, we reviewed the diverse group of myrmecophiles that can be found in association with red wood ants (RWAs). In total, 125 species were listed and the biology of the different arthropod groups were discussed. This chapter serves as an introduction to the later chapters. The main part of this thesis deals with biotic interactions in ant nests, but we examined first in chapter 2 the effect of abiotic interactions on myrmecophile communities. In accordance with metapopulation theory, myrmecophile species richness per unit volume was negatively correlated with increasing nest mound isolation. We did not find support that the abiotic variables mound moisture, pH, mound size and site size affect the myrmecophile community or its species richness. To understand the dynamics of a community in nature, it is essential to have an idea of its trophic interactions. In chapter 4, a surprising complex food web was found In the RWA microcosm, with most myrmecophiles parasitizing on ant brood and ant prey. In addition, multiple trophic predator-prey links among the myrmecophiles were encountered. The results of the stable isotope analyses complemented the findings of direct feeding tests and indicated the existence of multiple trophic levels. The presence of large numbers of parasitic myrmecophiles can impose large costs on RWAs. However, RWAs could indirectly benefit from the intraguild predation of brood parasitic myrmecophiles. In chapter 3, another mechanism that might counter the high parasitic pressure was shown. In general, large foragers in insect colonies specialize in nest defending against large, extranidal threats. However, we demonstrated that small <b>nurses</b> in RWA <b>colonies</b> are the most aggressive and most efficient defenders of brood against small, intranidal, parasitic myrmecophiles. This group of workers is best suited to defend the brood against these parasites due to their better matching size, high encounter rate in the nest and the high task switching costs that would occur if foragers had to carry out this task. The RWA myrmecophiles showed a different level of integration, with some species preferring the dense brood chambers, whereas others avoided the brood chambers and lived {{at the edge of the}} nest (chapter 5). This level of integration was not correlated with the aggression they provoked in their RWA host or their brood predation tendency. Up till now, it is believed that social insect symbionts mainly employ chemical deception by either mimicking the host’s cuticular chemical profile (mimicry or camouflage) or being chemical insignificant to sneak into social insect nests. However, in the community of RWA myrmecophiles tested in chapter 6, most species had distinct chemical profiles. Some of them carried low concentrations of compounds, but a significant part showed no disguise at all. These results shed new light on the evolution of integration mechanisms in social insect symbionts, and stresses that unspecialized species can integrate in social insect nests by using simple strategies such as hiding, swift movements or emitting defensive chemicals rather than using chemical deception. Many RWA myrmecophiles are persecuted, but in chapter 7 we reported that survival of three obligate myrmecophilous beetles over a period of 20 days was not different from a control set-up without ants. However, reduced survival was detected for a facultative myrmecophile in presence of RWAs. Survival analyses in the presence of 9 different ant species showed that the three beetles survived better in presence of larger-bodied ant species, and was highest in presence of its preferred host F. rufa, which also has relatively large workers. These results suggests, that in spite of their unspecialized nature, these beetles are optimally adapted to their preferred host and the importance of size asymmetries in host-symbiont interactions. Finally, the interactions in the parabiotic nests of the large Platythyrea conradti and tiny Strumigenys maynei ants were described in chapter 8. The chemical profile of the parabiotic partners was very different. The parabiotic association tended to be mutualistic as P. conradti benefits from the supreme defence capabilities of S. maynei against alien ants and intranidal myrmecophiles. The latter, in turn, benefits from the prey that thrive in the organic material carried to the nest by P. conradti. nrpages: 248 status: publishe...|$|R
