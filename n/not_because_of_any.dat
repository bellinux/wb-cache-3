5|$|Traditionally, {{the arrest}} of the bishops {{has been seen as}} a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that {{the arrest of}} the bishops signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the notion of eternal return is related to the overman, since willing the eternal return of the same is a necessary step if the overman is to create new values, untainted by the spirit of gravity or asceticism. Values involve a rank-ordering of things, and so are inseparable from approval and disapproval; yet it was dissatisfaction that prompted men to seek refuge in other-worldliness and embrace other-worldly values. It could seem that the overman, in being devoted to any values at all, would necessarily fail to create values that did not share some bit of asceticism. Willing the eternal recurrence is presented as accepting the existence of the low while still recognizing it as the low, and thus as overcoming the spirit of gravity or asceticism. One must have the strength of the overman in order to will the eternal recurrence; that is, only the overman will have the strength to fully accept all of his past life, including his failures and misdeeds, and to truly will their eternal return. This action nearly kills Zarathustra, for example, and most human beings cannot avoid other-worldliness because they really are sick, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> choice they made.|$|E

Her namesake was Conan's companion in [...] "Red Nails", while her personality and fate {{were based on}} those of Bêlit, the pirate queen in [...] "Queen of the Black Coast". [...] According to Kristina Passman, {{an assistant professor of}} classical languages and literature, the film's Valeria is a perfect archetype of the [...] "good" [...] Amazon character, a fierce but domesticated female warrior, in cinema. [...] Rikke Schubart, a film scholar, said Valeria is a [...] "good" [...] Amazon because she is tamed by love and <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> altruistic tendencies. [...] Valeria's prowess in battle matches that of Conan, and she is also depicted as his equal in capability and status. [...] The loyalty and love she displays for Conan makes her more than a companion to him; she represents his [...] "possibilities of human happiness". [...] Her sacrifice for Conan and her brief return from death act out the heroic code, illustrating that self-sacrificing heroism brings [...] "undying fame". [...] Valeria's name is not spoken in the film; the only scene where she was named, her self-introduction, was cut.|$|E

500|$|The {{classical}} Kuiper belt {{appears to}} be a composite of two separate populations. The first, known as the [...] "dynamically cold" [...] population, has orbits much like the planets; nearly circular, with an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.1, and with relatively low inclinations up to about 10° (they lie close to the plane of the Solar System rather than at an angle). The cold population also contain a concentration of objects, referred to as the kernel, with semi-major axes at 44–44.5 AU. The second, the [...] "dynamically hot" [...] population, has orbits much more inclined to the ecliptic, by up to 30°. The two populations have been named this way <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> major difference in temperature, but from analogy to particles in a gas, which increase their relative velocity as they become heated up. Not only are the two populations in different orbits, the cold population also differs in color and albedo, being redder and brighter, has a larger fraction of binary objects, has a different size distribution, and lacks very large objects. The difference in colors may be a reflection of different compositions, which suggests they formed in different regions. The hot population is proposed to have formed near Neptune's original orbit and to have been scattered out during the migration of the giant planets. The cold population, on the other hand, has been proposed to have formed more or less in its current position because the loose binaries would be unlikely to survive encounters with Neptune. Although the Nice model {{appears to be}} able to at least partially explain a compositional difference, it has also been suggested the color difference may reflect differences in surface evolution.|$|E

25|$|In other words, {{according}} to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did <b>not</b> arise <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> pre-existing human nature.

If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{the normal}} {{operation}} conditions of a pico satellite, conventional Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) gives sufficiently good estimation results. However, if the measurements are <b>not</b> reliable <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> kind <b>of</b> malfunction in the estimation system, UKF gives inaccurate results and diverges by time. This study, introduces Robust Unscented Kalman Filter (RUKF) algorithms with the filter gain correction {{for the case}} of measurement malfunctions. By the use of defined variables named as measurement noise scale factor, the faulty measurements are taken into the consideration with a small weight and the estimations are corrected without affecting the characteristic of the accurate ones. Two different RUKF algorithms, one with single scale factor and one with multiple scale factors, are proposed and applied for the attitude estimation process of a pico satellite. The results of these algorithms are compared for different types of measurement faults in different estimation scenarios and recommendations about their applications are given. Keywords—attitude algorithms, Kalman filters, robust estimation. I...|$|R
2500|$|According to Livy, the First Samnite War started <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> enmity between Rome and the Samnites, but due {{to outside}} events.

[...] Unable to stand against the Samnites, the Sidicini sought help from the Campanians. [...] However, Livy continues, the Samnites defeated the Campanians in a battle in Sidicine territory and then turned their attention toward Campania. [...] First they seized the Tifata hills overlooking Capua (the main Campanian city) and, having left a strong force to hold them, marched into the plain between the hills and Capua. There they defeated the Campanians in a second battle and drove them within their walls. This compelled the Campanians to ask Rome for help.|$|E

He went on to make a string of other records, {{including}} three complete sets of the Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas (one on Vox Records and two on Philips Records). He was the first performer to record the complete solo piano works of Beethoven.

An important collection of Alfred Brendel is the complete Mozart piano concertos recorded with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, which is included in the Philips 180 CD complete Mozart Edition.

Informed by a review of selected literature on gaining access, this paper provides a critical account of the process of negotiating access with gatekeepers (chiefly, care home managers). The negotiations were time-consuming and largely fruitless in terms of actually gaining access to care home residents. Nevertheless, much was learned about the field, in particular, about the attitudes of those with responsibility for caring for older care home residents. The residents in care homes became “hard to reach” research subjects <b>not</b> necessarily <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> cognitive or communicative impairments on their part, but by the defensive attitudes adopted by gatekeepers.
