Constantine now proceeded to carefully marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E

5|$|Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 {{developer}} P Associates {{announced its}} agreement {{to buy the}} properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed {{plans to build a}} luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof ridge line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the development of agent-based software, several agent programming languages and architectures, have been created. Plans in these architectures are often self-contained procedures with an associated triggering event and a context condition, while any further information {{about the consequences of}} executing a plan is absent. However, agents designed using such an approach have limited flexibility at runtime, and rely on the designer’s ability to foresee all relevant situations an agent might have to handle. In order to overcome this limitation, we have created AgentSpeak(PL), an interpreter capable of performing state-space <b>planning</b> to generate <b>new</b> high-level <b>plans.</b> As the <b>planning</b> module creates <b>new</b> <b>plans,</b> the plan library is expanded, improving performance over time. However, for <b>new</b> <b>plans</b> to be useful in the long run, it is critical that the context condition associated with <b>new</b> <b>plans</b> is carefully generated. In this paper we describe a plan reuse technique aimed at improving an agent’s runtime performance by deriving optimal context conditions for <b>new</b> <b>plans,</b> allowing an agent to reuse generated plans as much as possible. ...|$|R
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's {{order not to}} assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As {{there was no time}} for proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, even if it meant increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E

5|$|The UMWA {{took action}} against Pittston's <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> of {{operation}} {{and offered to}} reach a settlement. The coal company stayed quiet, and {{when the time came}} to renew the health care and retirement benefit plans for its workers, Pittston refused. The refusal to renew the contract left about 1,500 people without health care. These people were not just miners employed by Pittston, but also families, widows, and disabled miners in the Virginia area.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{exercised}} {{his presidential}} veto {{power for the}} first time on April 5, 1792 to stop an apportionment act from becoming law. The legislation introduced a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for distributed seats in the House of Representatives among the various states in a way that the president deemed unconstitutional.

5|$|A <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was {{put forward}} by West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield West on the western fringes of the town.|$|E

5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Blore's <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for {{the corps}} de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish {{to use the}} footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, size and layout of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{military}} options disappeared {{with the}} French. Adopting a <b>new</b> <b>plan,</b> he subverted the imperial election.

Charles's brother, Klemens August of Bavaria, archbishop and prince-elector of the Electorate of Cologne, voted {{for him in the}} imperial election and personally crowned him on 12 February 1742 in the traditional ceremony in Frankfurt am Main. The next day, Charles's Bavarian capital of Munich capitulated to the Austrians to avoid being plundered by Maria Theresa's troops. In the following weeks, her army overran most of Charles's territories, occupied Bavaria, and barred him from his ancestral lands and from Bohemia.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was made to attack Ascalon but this was {{abandoned}} {{due to the lack}} of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms.

5|$|Having {{failed to}} {{blockade}} or bottle up the Russian squadron at Port Arthur by sinking blockships in the harbor's channel, the Japanese under Admiral Togo formulated a <b>new</b> <b>plan.</b> Ships were to mine the entrance from {{the harbor and}} then lure the Russians into the minefield {{in the hopes of}} sinking a number of Russian warships. Under cover of four detachments of torpedo boat destroyers, the minelayer Koru-Maru began to lay mines near the entrance to Port Arthur on the night of 31 March. The Japanese were observed by Admiral Makarov, who believed that they were Russian destroyers whom he had ordered to patrol that area.|$|E

5|$|However, a {{shortage}} of developers who understood the necessary changes, and performance problems arising from conversion to and from UTF-16, which is rarely used in a web context, led to delays in the project. As a result, a PHP 5.3 release was created in 2009, with many non-Unicode features back-ported from PHP6, notably namespaces. In March 2010, the project {{in its current form}} was officially abandoned, and a PHP5.4 release was prepared containing most remaining non-Unicode features from PHP6, such as traits and closure re-binding. Initial hopes were that a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> would be formed for Unicode integration, but as of 2014 none had been adopted.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, both {{growth and}} {{controversy}} accelerated rapidly as a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> was launched {{to develop the}} area known as the Crumbles, a shingle bank on the coast {{to the east of}} the town centre. This area, now known as Sovereign Harbour, containing a marina, shops and several thousand houses, along with luxury flats, was formerly home to many rare plants.

On 14 June the Allies committed to a landing in Southern France, codenamed Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil). Royal Flush and Zeppelin were scaled back, to tone down the threat to France, and it was decided a <b>new</b> <b>plan</b> (Ferdinand) was required to cover the intended invasion.|$|E
