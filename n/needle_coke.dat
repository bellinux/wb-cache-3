Successful application of nonaqueous enzymology to this problem will involve finding ways to stabilize the active conformations of the enzymes and provide for easy recovery of the enzymes, perhaps in an immobilized-enzyme packed-bed reactor. A second objective is to explore biological systems that can catalyze the cleavage or organometallics in fossil fuels, such as metal porphyrins. A biodemetallation function could greatly aid in the refining of high-metal, high-sulfur crudes and bitumens. During this period, work was initiated to develop new rapid and highly quantitative assays for specific desulfurization activities in isolated and separated enzyme fractions. The preparation of water-soluble chlorophyllin was carried out for use in assaying for demetallation activity in microorganisms.

40|$|Investment {{casting process}} has been a widely used process for centuries. It {{is known for its}} ability to produce {{components}} of complex shapes with dimensional accuracy and excellent surface finish. Investment casting has been used to make manufacture weapons, jewellery and art castings during the ancient civilization and today it is used to manufacture engineering components. In Investment casting wax patterns are made by wax injection and then coating of the wax patterns are done by ceramic slurry, made with silica flour and binder. After dewaxing and firing molten metal is poured in the shell and solidified casting can be achieved. Investment casting can be cast any ferrous and non ferrous metal which is difficult in die casting. Finishing operations are negligible and very thin sections as. 75 mm can also be cast which is not possible in sand casting but there are many challenges in Investment casting. It is relatively slow process because preparation of ceramic shell consumes a lot of time, permeability of shell is very low which causes gas permeability. Incorporation of chills is very difficult. Among all these challenges gas porosity is main problem because of poor permeability, entrapment of gases due to complex geometry of the shell, reuse of scrap metal.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on four commercial Waxy Oil green cokes with varying catalyst (Fe 3 O 4) concentrations (ash content: 1. 84 - 11. 18 %), {{to determine the effect}} thereof on the structural characteristics of calcined (1400 °C) and pre-graphitised (2000 °C) cokes. An increase in the catalyst content of the coke shows a substantial detrimental affect on the overall anisotropy of the carbon microstructure. The catalyst (with a particle size distribution between 0. 5 µm and 78 µm) was found to present a physical barrier around which the anisotropic flow domains formed. At higher catalyst concentrations the catalyst dominates the carbon microstructure; however, there is still evidence of flow patterns albeit with a shorter range. XRD powder data and Raman spectroscopy provide evidence of multiphase graphitisation in both the calcined coke and pre-graphite. The crystal development of the calcined coke is dominated by catalytic graphitisation and that of the pre-graphite showed a greater dependence on thermal graphitisation.

40|$|This {{research}} study determines {{the potential to}} increase substantially the anisotropy of a coke from an aliphatic Waxy Oil produced by Sasol Synfuels at Secunda, South Africa. Experimental modifications included filtration, distillation and thermal treatment, followed by distillation {{with the aim of}} producing a carbonised product similar to <b>needle</b> <b>coke.</b> The substantial concentration of an iron oxide catalyst (up to 2 %) in Waxy Oil is increased by an order of magnitude upon carbonisation and calcination due to low coke yield and reactivity factors. The catalyst also promotes oxidative polymerisation of the residue, acts as a barrier to mesophase formation and promotes multi-phase graphitisation. Filtration of Waxy Oil using a 0. 5 ìm sintered metal filter reduces the ash content to 0. 006 % and increases the anisotropy of the carbonised product to 54 % flow domains compared with 22 % for the carbonised product of virgin Waxy Oil. Thermal treatment followed by distillation of Waxy Oil reduces the effect of organic reactivity promoters (mainly multi-alkylated aliphatics/aromatics and oxygenates), while increasing the concentration of thermally stable (C 18 to C 30) normal alkanes to 85 % compared with 38 % in the filtered Waxy Oil. Compared with the filtered Waxy Oil, thermally stabilised Waxy Oil reduces the amount of the pre-carbonisation residue (from 98. 7 to 43. 0 %), while “static” carbonisation thereof increases the green coke yield (from 19. 8 to 36. 3 %) and increases the anisotropicity (from 54 to 100 % flow domains). The carbonisation mechanism of filtered and thermally treated Waxy Oil involves initial cracking of high molecular weight normal alkanes (C 18 to C 30), thus concentrating the molecular weight of normal alkanes (C 18 to C 22). This is followed by a slow cyclisation step involving both self condensation and cyclo addition reactions to form two- to six-ring cyclo-alkanes or hydro-aromatics. The hydro-aromatics are dehydrogenated rapidly to form methyl and di-methyl three- to six-ring substituted aromatics. Further thermal degradation dealkylates these molecules to form stable four- to six-ring “pre-mesogens”. The mesospheres are nucleated from the isotropic matrix and grow to more than 0. 050 mm in diameter, with a volume of 2. 61 x 10 - 3 mm 3. Subsequent coalescence of the mesospheres produces mesospheres with diameters of over 0. 200 mm and volumes of 41. 82 x 10 - 3 mm 3. The resultant microstructure of the solid carbon is composed of flow domains more than 400 ìm in length. Although needle cokes have historically been produced from aromatic residues, this research is the first to show that a coke with a similar microstructure can be produced from a totally aliphatic residue. The research thus provides potential {{for the development of a}} <b>needle</b> <b>coke</b> from a totally unique Waxy Oil residue with negligible sulphur (< 0. 008 %) and nitrogen (< 0. 09 %) contents.

40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} of exposure of workers to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) in petrochemical industries was performed by the measurement of urinary excretion of 1 -hydroxypyrene. In 121 of the 462 workers studied (both smokers and non-smokers) who had had no recent occupational exposure to PAHs a median 1 -hydroxypyrene concentration of 0. 21 micrograms/g creatinine was found. The upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval in these workers of 0. 99 micrograms/g creatinine {{was used as the}} upper normal value for industrial workers. Urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene concentrations were measured in workers involved in manufacture and maintenance operations in oil refineries (13 studies in eight different settings), in workers manufacturing or handling products containing PAHs in chemical plants (five studies in three settings) and laboratories (four studies), and in workers digging soil contaminated with PAHs (three studies). In most studies in oil refineries 1 -hydroxypyrene concentrations were only marginally greater than the values measured in the 121 workers with no recent occupational exposure to PAHs. This was also the case in maintenance operations with higher potential exposure to PAHs, indicating that personal protection equipment was generally adequate to prevent excessive exposure. The studies in chemical plants also showed that exposure to PAHs is low. An exception was the workers engaged in the production of <b>needle</b> <b>coke</b> from ethylene cracker residue, where increased urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene concentrations were measured.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{rates of}} petroleum coke, char, and residual oil were measured in molten sodium phosphate. Both oxygen and steam {{were used as}} oxidants, {{and a variety of}} reactor configurations were studied. Reactors consisted of fused ceramic parts sealed into a reactor configuration using castable refractory. The reaction rate of carbon particles in a bubbling molten phosphate slurry was found to depend upon the rate of particle-bubble contacting. Upon contact, direct conversion of carbon particles with the gas phase occurs due to the large carbon-molten sodium phosphate contact angle (136 °). The potential flow solution for flow around a bubble where particles are assumed to follow the streamlines gave a consistent picture of bubble-particle contacting. The reactivity of the carbon in the bulk liquid was found to be negligible due to the low solubility of oxygen in the melt. Gas phase (no salt) results were generated to establish base cases and to examine treatment effects on the reactivity of green sponge and green needle cokes. The reactivities of both were favorably affected by toluene extraction and adversely affected by calcination to 1300 K. Extraction decreased the agglomerating nature of the sponge coke. Both extracts were largely aromatic with the <b>needle</b> <b>coke</b> extract being more so. Molten sodium phosphate was found to catalyze the gasification of petroleum coke by steam and by oxygen. Such catalytic effects are limited due to the large carbon-salt contact angle and may be obscured in slurry reactors by the rate of particle-bubble contacting being slow. The steam reforming of residual oil revealed that the carbonized product in the molten salt phase closely resembled sponge petroleum coke (as produced by delayed coking). Cold model experiments employing water and polymeric beads revealed that dilute slurries of small, non-wetting particles decreased the rise velocity of single bubbles and increased the rate of bubble coalescence in swarms. Dilute slurries of wetting particles had no effect in either case...|$|E
