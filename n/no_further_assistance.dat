25|$|The {{second major}} {{incident}} of the boat's career happened on 1 March 1981, when Onslow was participating in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate {{off the coast}} of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an 'enemy' P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat's two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. Onslow rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The company was given a week's leave, with <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>assistance</b> from the RAN; psychological or otherwise. Two submariners were later awarded decorations for bravery.|$|E

There he had obtained some imperfect knowledge of Latin; yet the boy was fond of reading, and had picked up, in an odd way, more knowledge than might have been supposed. He had read 'Baker's Chronicle,' and 'The Old Universal History,' and 'Plutarch;' and had turned over, in the book room of an old gentleman at Morpeth, who had been attracted by his intelligence, not a few curious old folios, from which he had gleaned no contemptible store of curious instances of human nature. His guardian, whom he had never seen, and who was a great nobleman and lived in London, had signified to Mrs. Cadurcis his intention of sending his ward to Eton; but that time had not yet arrived, and Mrs. Cadurcis, who dreaded parting with her son, determined to postpone it by every maternal artifice in her power. At present it would have seemed that her son's intellect was to be left utterly uncultivated, for there was no school in the neighbourhood which he could attend, and no occasional assistance which could be obtained; and to the constant presence of a tutor in the house Mrs. Cadurcis was not less opposed than his lordship could have been himself.|$|E

40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} value of outpatient follow-up of patients who undergo routine uncomplicated nasal surgery. A total of 177 postoperative patients (117 males, 60 females) undergoing routine nasal surgery at the Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, was selected over a six-month period, 92 of whom (60 males, 32 females) were requested to return to the clinic for a follow-up session. A total of 72 (78. 3 %) patients attended for post-operative review. Of these, 55 patients (76. 4 %) had achieved a satisfactory result from surgery and 17 (23. 6 %) required additional treatment for persistent problems. The former group were pleased with the outcome of their operation and required <b>no</b> <b>further</b> treatment. Of the 25 patients who were prescribed medication at the time of discharge from hospital, 19 (76. 0 %) were still complying with the medication and required <b>no</b> <b>further</b> specialist <b>assistance.</b> The results suggest that routine follow-up of uncomplicated cases of nasal surgery is unnecessary. The good therapeutic results in the majority of cases indicate a need to decrease the number of routine reviews to reduce the high non-attendance rate and increase the proportion of new patients seen at outpatient clinics. The role played by general practitioners is vital to this cause. This would include minor postoperative care, monitoring of prescribed medication and review of patients with occasional postoperative problems...|$|R
60|$|Only {{that it is}} {{generally}} conceived that in such a history as is this the writer of the tale {{should be able to}} make his points so clear by words that <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>assistance</b> should be needed, I should be tempted here to insert a properly illustrated pedigree tree of the Marrable family. The Marrable family is of very old standing in England, the first baronet having been created by James I., and there having been Marrables,--as is well known by all attentive readers of English history,--engaged in the Wars of the Roses, and again others very conspicuous in the religious persecutions of the children of Henry VIII. I do not know that they always behaved with consistency; but they held their heads up after a fashion, and got themselves talked of, and were people of note in the country. They were cavaliers in the time of Charles I. and of Cromwell,--as became men of blood and gentlemen,--but it is not recorded of them that they sacrificed much in the cause; and when William III. became king they submitted with a good grace to the new order of things. A certain Sir Thomas Marrable was member for his county in the reigns of George I. and George II., and enjoyed a lucrative confidence with Walpole. Then there came a blustering, roystering Sir Thomas, who, together with a fine man and gambler as a heir, brought the property to rather a low ebb; so that when Sir Gregory, the grandfather of our Miss Marrable, came to the title {{in the early days of}} George III. he was not a rich man. His two sons, another Sir Gregory and a General Marrable, died long before the days of which we are writing,--Sir Gregory in 1815, and the General in 1820. That Sir Gregory was the second of the name,--the second at least as mentioned in these pages. He had been our Miss Marrable's uncle, and the General had been her father, and the father of Mrs. Lowther,--Mary's mother. A third Sir Gregory was reigning at the time of our story, a very old gentleman with one single son,--a fourth Gregory. Now the residence of Sir Gregory was at Dunripple Park, just on the borders of Warwickshire and Worcestershire, but in the latter county. The property was small,--for a country gentleman with a title,--not much exceeding £3000 a year; and there was no longer any sitting in Parliament, or keeping of race-horses, or indeed any season in town for the present race of Marrables. The existing Sir Gregory was a very quiet man, and his son and only child, a man now about forty years of age, lived mostly at home, and occupied himself with things of antiquity. He was remarkably well read in the history of his own country, and it had been understood for the last twenty years by the Antiquarian, Archæological, and other societies that he was the projector of a new theory about Stonehenge, and that his book on the subject was almost ready. Such were the two surviving members of the present senior branch of the family. But Sir Gregory had two brothers,--the younger of the two being Parson John Marrable, the present rector of St. Peter's Lowtown and the occupier of the house within the heavy slate-coloured gates, where he lived a bachelor life, as had done before him his cousin the late rector;--the elder being a certain Colonel Marrable. The Colonel Marrable again had a son, who was a Captain Walter Marrable,--and after him the confused reader shall be introduced to no more of the Marrable family. The enlightened reader will have by this time perceived that Miss Mary Lowther and Captain Walter Marrable were second cousins; and he will also have perceived, if he has given his mind fully to the study, that the present Parson John Marrable had come into the living after the death of a cousin of the same generation as himself,--but of lower standing in the family. It was so; and by this may be seen how little the Sir Gregory of the present day had been able to do for his brother, and perhaps it may also be imagined from this that the present clergyman at Loring Lowtown had been able to do very little for himself. Nevertheless, he was a kindly-hearted, good, sincere old man,--not very bright, indeed, nor peculiarly fitted for preaching the gospel, but he was much liked, and he kept a curate, though his income out of the living was small. Now it so happened that Captain Marrable,--Walter Marrable,--came to stay with his uncle the parson about the same time that Mary Lowther returned to Loring.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : This paper {{describes}} an image interpolation technique {{to produce a}} sequence of intermediate frames between two input Images A and B (a,c), as seen in our result in (b). While we show only three frames above, our method moves gradients in the original images to solve simultaneously {{for any number of}} frames of a temporally consistent interpolation, producing an animation sequence that preserves the frequency content of the original images, and looks quite natural. Note that this example is very challenging and under-constrained, involving complex, non-rigid and local deformations. Moreover, in contrast to conventional morphing-based techniques, our method is fully automatic — we require only the input images, with <b>no</b> <b>further</b> user <b>assistance.</b> We describe a method for plausible interpolation of images, {{with a wide range of}} applications like temporal up-sampling for smooth playback of lower frame rate video, smooth view interpolation, and animation of still images. The method is based on the intuitive idea, that a given pixel in the interpolated frames traces out a path in the source images. Therefore, we simply move and copy pixel gradients from the input images along this path. A key innovation is to allow arbitrary (asymmetric) transition points, where the path moves from one image to the other. This flexible transition preserve...|$|R
