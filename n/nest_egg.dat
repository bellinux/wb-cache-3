25|$|Operation <b>Nest</b> <b>Egg</b> is a {{programme}} {{run by the}} BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust—a {{partnership between}} the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves—usually when they weigh around 1200grams (42ounces). They are {{then returned to the}} wild. An Operation <b>Nest</b> <b>Egg</b> bird has a 65% chance of surviving to adulthood—compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and raised chicks. The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi.|$|E
500|$|World War I {{broke out}} in 1914. Although Whale had little {{interest}} in the politics behind the war, he realized that conscription was inevitable so he enlisted in the army. Considered because of his age a good candidate for officer training, he joined the Inns of Court Officer Training Corps in October 1915 and was stationed in Bristol. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Worcestershire Regiment in July 1916. He was taken prisoner on the Western Front in Flanders in August 1917 and was held at Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp, where he remained until December 1918. While imprisoned he became actively involved, as an actor, writer, producer and set-designer, in the amateur theatrical productions {{that took place in the}} camp, finding them [...] "a source of great pleasure and amusement". He also developed a talent for poker, and after the war he cashed in the chits and IOUs from his fellow prisoners to serve as a <b>nest</b> <b>egg.</b>|$|E

2500|$|After 15 {{years of}} {{appearing}} in films, Williams was threatened with contract suspension from MGM after refusing {{the lead role}} in The Opposite Sex (eventually released in 1956), a musical remake of 1939's The Women. The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by June Allyson as [...] "Kay", a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star Grace Kelly, packed her terry cloth robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which {{had been taken from}} her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a <b>nest</b> <b>egg</b> and a tax deferral.

2500|$|Federal {{regulation}} of falconry in North America is enforced under the statutes of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA), {{originally designed to}} address the rampant commercial market hunting of migratory waterbirds during the early 20th century. Birds of prey suffered extreme persecution from the early 20th century through the 1960s, where thousands of birds were shot at conspicuous migration sites and many state wildlife agencies issued bounties for carcasses. [...] Due to widespread persecution and further impacts to raptor populations from DDT and other toxins, the act was amended in 1972 to include birds of prey (eagles are also protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1959). Under the MBTA, it is illegal for people to [...] "take" [...] migratory birds, their eggs, feathers or nests. [...] Take is defined in the MBTA to [...] "include by any means or in any manner, any attempt at hunting, pursuing, wounding, killing, possessing or transporting any migratory bird, <b>nest,</b> <b>egg,</b> or part thereof". Falconers are allowed to trap, and otherwise possess certain birds of prey and their feathers with special permits issued by the Migratory Bird Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by state wildlife agencies (issuers of trapping permits).|$|E

6000|$|Reasonable People will conclude, {{that his}} Majesty and his Ministers have proceeded, not ridiculously, {{but with all}} that caution which became them. For in the first heat and vehemence of the Plot, the Avenues of White-Hall were more {{strictly}} Guarded: His Majesty abstaining from Places of publick Entertainment, and the Ministers taking all necessary Care in Council, both to discover Conspiracies and to prevent them. So, that simply considered, the Popish Plot {{has nothing to do}} with the Dissolution of Four Parliaments. But the Use which has been made of it by the House of Commons to Dis-inherit the Duke, to deny the King Supplies, and to make some Votes, which the King declares to be illegal, are the real and plain occasions of dissolving those Parliaments. 'Tis only affirm'd, but never will be prov'd by this Author, that the King or his Ministers have ever been desirous to stifle the Plot, and not to have it search'd into the bottom. For to what end has his Majesty so often offer'd the Popish Lords to be brought to their Trial, but that their innocence or guilt, and consequently, that of the whole party might be made manifest? Or why, after the execution of the Lord Stafford, did the House of Commons stop at the other Lords, and not proceed to try them in their turns? Did his Majesty stifle the Plot when he offered them, or did they refuse to sound the depth of it, when they would not touch upon them? If it were for want of Witnesses, which is all that can be said, the case is deplorable on the part of the accused; who can neither be bail'd, because impeach'd in Parliament, nor admitted to be tryed, for fear they should be acquitted for want of evidence. I do not doubt but his Majesty, after having done what in him lies for the utmost discovery of the Plot, both by frequent Proclamations of Indemnity, and Reward, to such as would come in, and discover more, and by several others too long to repeat, is desirous (for what good man is not?) that his care and trouble might be over. But I am much deceiv'd, if the Antimonarchical Party be of the same opinion; or that they desire the Plot should be either wholly discover'd, or fully ended. For 'tis evidently their Interest to keep it on foot, as long as possibly they can; and to give it hot water, as often as 'tis dying; for while they are in possession of this Jewel, they make themselves masters of the people. For this very reason I have often said, even from the beginning of the Discovery, that the Presbyterians would never let it go out of their hands, but manage it to the last inch upon a Save-all. And that if ever they had tryed one Lord, they would value themselves upon that Conquest, as long as ever it would last with the Populace: but whatever came on't, be sure to leave a <b>Nest</b> <b>Egg</b> in the Tower: And since I doubt not, but what so mean a Judge as I am could so easily discover, could not possibly escape the vigilancy of those who are at the Helm; I am apt to think, that his Majesty saw at least as great a danger arising to him from the discontented spirits of the popular Faction, as from the Papists. For is it not plain, that ever since the beginning of the Plot, they have been lopping off from the Crown whatever part of the Prerogative they could reach? and incroaching into Soveraignty and Arbitrary Power themselves, while they seem'd to fear it from the King? How then could his Majesty be blam'd, if he were forc'd to dissolve those Parliaments, which instead of giving him relief, made their Advantages upon his Distresses; and while they pretended a care of his Person on the one hand, were plucking at his Scepter with the other? ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} which effects of floor eggs, washed floor <b>eggs,</b> and clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> were investigated on incubation characteristics and performance in later life of broiler chickens. In both experiments, a young and an older breeder flock were used in a 3 × 2 factorial design during incubation. In the second experiment, male and female chickens were reared separately until d 35 of age in floor pens. During this grow out trial, an extra group was created in which chickens obtained from clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> were mixed with chickens obtained from floor eggs, meaning that grow out period was set up as a 4 × 2 × 2 factorial design with 4 egg types, 2 breeder ages, and 2 sexes. In both experiments, fertility and hatchability of fertile eggs were lower in floor and washed eggs than in clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> (hatchability: experiment 1 : 74. 4 vs. 70. 6 vs. 92. 6 % for floor eggs, washed floor <b>eggs</b> and clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs,</b> respectively, P < 0. 001; experiment 2 : 78. 3 vs. 81. 7 vs. 90. 2 %, respectively, P < 0. 001). In experiment 2, BW at d 0 of chickens obtained from clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs</b> was {{higher than that of}} chickens from floor eggs and washed floor eggs (41. 5 vs. 40. 4 and 40. 3 g, respectively; P < 0. 001). This difference disappeared during the grow out period and was absent at slaughter age at d 35 of age. Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and mortality during the grow out period were not affected by egg type. Incidence and severity of hock burns and footpad dermatitis were not affected by egg type or breeder age. Litter friability at d 35 of age tended to be lower in pens with chickens obtained from washed floor eggs compared to clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs.</b> We conclude that incubation of floor eggs or washed floor eggs resulted in lower fertility and hatchability compared to clean <b>nest</b> <b>eggs,</b> but that performance during the grow out period was not affected. </p...|$|R
