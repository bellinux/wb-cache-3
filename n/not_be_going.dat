5|$|Despite these setbacks, the West Pier Trust {{remained}} {{adamant that}} they would soon begin full restoration work. Retired boxer Chris Eubank criticised the delays in restoring the pier, saying he could raise the money himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The pier was partially demolished in February 2010, partly {{to make way for}} the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts rescued from the pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of the pier collapsed in 2016.|$|E

The mailboat left on September 3 and arrived in Barcelona, which was under martial law, on October 3, 1896. After a brief confinement at Montjuich prison, Rizal was told by Captain-General Eulogio Despujol that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on to Cuba, but would {{be sent back to}} the Philippines instead.

Guilt-ridden, he later rushes to church and upon entering, [...] sees a Christian rock band, Kovenant, performing. He is {{attracted}} to the singer, Rachel Jordan, who sings about not losing faith in God because he is always there for people. Inspired by the song, Ned later assists Rachel in loading some equipment onto her truck and confides in her of his loss, with which she sympathizes. He and Rachel become acquainted, but she has {{to leave for the}} next stop on the band's tour, promising to come back and meet up with him afterward.|$|E
500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had just read to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

Cyrus cited her various controversial moments {{as the reason}} behind this, claiming she only wanted to travel where she felt [...] "the most love". Following the release of Can't Be Tamed, Cyrus officially parted ways with longtime record label Hollywood Records. With Hannah Montana now officially over, Cyrus announced that she planned to take a hiatus from music to focus on her film career. She commented, [...] "I've not taken, like, acting lessons or anything, but it doesn't mean I don't need to because I'm sure I do... I'm probably going to go book an acting coach." [...] She later confirmed she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to college for the time being, stating that [...] " [...] a firm believer {{that you can go}} back at any age you want", and that she [...] " [...] worked hard to get to where [...] now, and [...] to enjoy it while it lasts".|$|E

500|$|Coey {{first saw}} combat action in November 1973, in a covert {{external}} operation in Portuguese Mozambique's north-western Tete Province. He enjoyed it, comparing {{the experience to}} the American Indian Wars of the 19th century. The following month, however, he was informed by his commanding officer {{that he would be}} not be used as a paratrooper, and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> on patrol again, as he was, in the commander's words, [...] "not worth it". Coey felt so humiliated that he considered leaving, but resolved to stay and fight on. Despite his commander's order to remain on base, he joined a patrol into Mozambique and crossed the border on 7 January 1974. The commanding officer flew into a rage when he discovered Coey's insubordination two weeks later, and immediately had him brought back. Meanwhile, Coey persevered with [...] "The Myth of American Anti-communism", and secured its publication in the conservative, nationally distributed journal Property and Finance on 7 February 1974. [...] Five days later, he was barred from taking part in a parachute exercise with his unit, and on 14 February he was instructed to choose another army corps or regiment by the 18th; the SAS no longer wanted him.|$|E
500|$|Before his death, Parsons {{appeared}} in science fiction writer Anthony Boucher's murder-mystery novel Rocket to the Morgue (1942) {{under the guise}} of mad scientist character Hugo Chantrelle. Another fictional character based on Parsons was Courtney James, a wealthy socialite who features in L. Sprague de Camp's 1956 short time travel story A Gun for Dinosaur. [...] In 2005 Pasadena Babalon, a stage play about Parsons written by George D. Morgan and directed by Brian Brophy, premiered at Caltech as a production by its theater Arts Group in 2010, the same year Cellar Door Publishing released Richard Carbonneau and Robin Simon Ng's graphic novel, The Marvel: A Biography of Jack Parsons. In 2012 the Science Channel broadcast a documentary dramatization titled Magical Jet Propulsion in an episode of its [...] television series. Parsons was portrayed by English actor Adam Howden. Independent record label Drag City released Parsons' Blues, an instrumental tribute single by experimental rock act Six Organs of Admittance. In 2014 AMC Networks announced plans for a serial television dramatization of Parsons' life titled Strange Angel, produced by Ridley Scott and David Zucker, and written by Mark Heyman, but in 2016 it was reported that the series [...] "will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> forward." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2011 {{press reports}} had {{indicated}} that the party was unlikely to run a candidate both for financial reasons and also because {{it was unlikely that}} a Fianna Fáil nominee could be successful. In early August 2011 there was press speculation that RTÉ broadcaster Gay Byrne might seek a nomination. On 6 August Micheál Martin rang Byrne at his holiday home to indicate that Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members would facilitate his nomination. Byrne indicated that he had yet to make a decision on whether to put his name forward, but said that if he did so he would not run under the Fianna Fáil banner but as an independent, albeit {{with the assistance of the}} party's organisation. [...] "Fianna Fáil are convinced no matter who they put up will be unelectable, so they're giving me their support" [...] he told the Irish Independent. Éamon Ó Cuív, the party's deputy leader and member of the committee tasked with deciding on their strategy for the election stated that [...] "I know of no approach to Gay Byrne... Nobody has discussed the issue with me— good, bad or indifferent." [...] On 13 August Byrne informed Martin that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> forward for nomination. He stated that the idea of running had been [...] "foisted on him and he had not known anything about it and what it would involve". This followed unease among Fianna Fáil parliamentary party Oireachtas members, with a number unhappy that a candidate was being imposed by the leadership without discussion.|$|E

In his first parliamentary statement as Welfare Secretary, Crabb said that the Government [...] "will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> ahead with the changes to PIP that were put forward.

2500|$|Gladstone {{felt that}} this was a deft {{political}} move. Public opinion would be satisfied with [...] "Chinese Gordon" [...] going to the Sudan, but at the same time, Gordon was given such a limited mandate that the evacuation would proceed as planned. The Cabinet felt very uncomfortable with the appointment as they had been pressured by the press to send a man who was opposed to their Sudan policy to take command in the Sudan with the Foreign Secretary Lord Grenville wondering if they had just committed a [...] "gigantic folly". Gordon made a short trip to Brussels to tell Leopold that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> to the Congo after all, news that enraged the King.|$|E

2500|$|As events transpired, the {{laboratory}} director walked in, received a confession from the instigator, and following a short office visit let Draper {{know that he}} did not have the spirit for scientific research, and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into that field. [...] While Draper thought this a tragedy at the time, he later looked at it as a great turning point in his career, freeing him for work that would eventually bring him prominence in his profession. [...] Draper was allowed to finish the course, after which one of his older classmates, Dr. Hugh Cumming, was put in charge of a scientific study of shellfish and water pollution. [...] Cumming then put Draper in charge of a small laboratory in Colonial Beach, Virginia where he spent the next year studying the bacteriological contamination of oysters in the Potomac River. [...] Since both Washington D.C. and Alexandria, Virginia dumped their raw sewage into the river, Draper was to answer the question of whether oysters were affected 68 miles downstream. [...] He discovered that the pollution had been neutralized by natural processes much further upstream, and thus had no effect where he ran most of his tests. [...] The study was important to ease fears that pollution might be affecting the extensive oyster beds near Point Lookout, Maryland, much further downstream.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2001, reports {{surfaced}} that Tylo was to {{exit the}} series again following unsuccessful contract negotiations, although two months later in December she signed a new contract which gave her more flexibility to pursue other projects. In October 2002, Bradley Bell killed off the character and Tylo's last appearance was on October 30, 2002. In March 2004, she made a multiple-episode guest appearance as Taylor's ghost. Following this, she told Soaps in Depth that [...] "I knew it my heart I would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> back", stating {{that she wanted to}} [...] "let the character go". During her time off the show, she had turned down offers to appear on other soaps including As the World Turns. In 2005, Deanna Barnert of Soap Opera Digest wrote that according to an industry insider, a character from the show [...] "may come back from the world of the beyond", leading fans to speculate whether either Macy Alexander (Bobbie Eakes) or Taylor would be returning. Taylor was revealed to be alive, with Tylo returning on-screen during the April 25, 2005 episode. She was said to be [...] "having fun surprising her castmates" [...] with her reappearance on set. The show's producers wanted to keep her on-screen return a secret, with Tylo wearing a wig when travelling to the set, and the character's name being changed on scripts.|$|E
2500|$|Opening the innings, Watson {{drove the}} first {{ball of the}} match for four. He [...] "laid on to the loose ones without mercy", and after {{reaching}} his century with [...] "a long drive for 4" [...] he went [...] "merrily on his way" [...] reported the Christchurch paper The Star, [...] "and {{if we do not}} chronicle all his important hits, it is because their number was so great, and even newspaper reports have their limit". He was eventually caught at point for 175 when the score was 300. While the Otago fielding was good, The Star commented, [...] "it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> too far to say that their bowling was probably the weakest that has yet been seen in an Interprovincial match". An obituarist recalled: [...] "I remember no innings which contained more good hits and fewer bad ones, than this of Mr Watson. The bowlers failed to get near his wicket at all." [...] He said of Watson's batting in general: [...] "Perhaps the best feature of Mr Watson's batting was its straightness ... His favourite hit was the drive: woe betide the bowler who, deceived by his patient treatment of length balls, presumed to over-pitch!" [...] Watson's score of 175 was the highest total by a player on debut in first-class cricket in New Zealand. The record stood until October 2017, when Brad Schmulian made 203 runs in the first innings for Central Districts in the 2017–18 Plunket Shield season.|$|E
