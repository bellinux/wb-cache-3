40|$|Sensory {{deprivation}} and motor restriction associated with extensive oxygen therapy {{may lead to}} poor oromotor control in preterm infants. <b>Non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> {{is one of the}} first complex oromotor behaviors infants perform. This study determined the spatiotemporal variability of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) pressure trajectories in three preterm groups with differing oxygen histories—one control group with minimal or no O 2 therapy, and two Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) groups with either a mild/moderate (RDS 1) or moderate/severe (RDS 2) O 2 history. The <b>Non-nutritive</b> <b>Suck</b> Spatiotemporal Index (NNS STI) quantifies spatial and temporal variability across kinematic trajectories, and was calculated from digital representations of infants’ suck pressure signals. An ANCOVA revealed a significant effect for group (p 3 ̆c. 001) on the NNS STI measure, with RDS 2 infants showing highly variable NNS patterning, and thus relatively underdeveloped suck. Extensive oxygen therapy, which alters the oral sensory environment and reduces motor experiences, disrupts the development of coordinated NNS in preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|Objective—To {{characterize}} {{the integrity of}} <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) parameters among three groups of preterm infants ranging from normal to those with progressive degrees of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Study Design—NNS compression waveforms were sampled from 55 infants in the neonatal intensive care unit using a silicone pacifier electronically instrumented for intraluminal pressure. Seven select NNS parameters were measured at two different sessions, and statistically analyzed using a General Linear Model Analysis of Covariance. Results and Conclusions—Preterm infants with a more extensive history of RDS and oxygen therapy manifest significantly (p≤ 0. 001) degraded performance on six of the seven NNS measures. This trend was disproportionately amplified in preterm infants with moderate-to-severe RDS. Prolonged periods of RDS requiring oxygen therapy may cause maladaptive orosensory experiences, and restrict oral movements which may contribute to delayed NNS development...|$|R
40|$|Aims and Objectives—Suck {{development}} is a challenging hurdle for preterm infants who endure an extensive oxygen history due to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The fine structure of the <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) was studied in preterm infants according to RDS severity. Design and Methods—Recordings of NNS were completed cribside in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in 55 preterm infants distributed among one healthy control group and two RDS infant groups. NNS pressure amplitude (cmH 20) and within-burst suck cycle period (ms) were the dependent measures extracted from digitized records of pacifier nipple compression pressure. Results and Conclusions—RDS preterm infants demonstrated significant differences in NNS suck pressure amplitude compared to healthy preterm infants. Periods of oxygen supplementation restrict orofacial movement and limit orosensory experiences necessary for suck development and neural maturation. RDS infants may be excellent candidates for patterned oral stimulation programs designed to advance the maturation of sucking skills...|$|R
5000|$|Although it is {{commonly}} believed that using a pacifier will lead to dental problems, if the pacifier is used for less than around three years, {{it does not appear}} to lead to long-term damage.

40|$|Variation in {{pacifier}} stiffness on <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) dynamics {{was examined}} among infants born prematurely {{with a history}} of respiratory distress syndrome. Three types of silicone pacifiers used in the NICU were tested for stiffness, revealing the Super Soothie™ nipple is 7 times stiffer than the Wee™ or Soothie™ pacifiers even though shape and displaced volume are identical. Suck dynamics among 20 preterm infants were subsequently sampled using the Soothie™ and Super Soothie™ pacifiers during follow-up at approximately 3 months of age. ANOVA revealed significant differences in NNS cycles/min, NNS amplitude, NNS cycles/burst, and NNS cycle periods as a function of pacifier stiffness. Infants modify the spatiotemporal output of their suck central pattern generator when presented with pacifiers with significantly different mechanical properties. Infants show a non-preference to suck due to high stiffness in the selected pacifier. Therefore, excessive pacifier stiffness may decrease ororhythmic patterning and impact feeding outcomes...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of oral sucrose combined with swaddling and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) as a method for reducing pain associated with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening. DESIGN: Randomised placebo controlled study. SETTING: Tertiary level neonatal intensive care unit. SAMPLE: 40 infants undergoing primary eye examination for ROP screening. INTERVENTION: The control group were swaddled, and received 0. 2 ml of sterile water given by mouth using a syringe and a soother. The intervention group were swaddled, and received 0. 2 ml of sucrose 24 % given by mouth using a syringe and a soother. RESULTS: 40 infants {{were included in the}} study. There was no difference in mean gestational age at birth, mean birth weight or corrected gestational age at first examination between both groups. The sucrose group had a significantly lower median Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS) score during ROP screening, initially following insertion of the speculum (6. 5 vs 5, p= 0. 02) and subsequently during scleral indentation (9. 5 vs 7. 5, p= 0. 03). Fewer infants experienced episodes of desaturations or bradycardia in the intervention group (1 vs 4, p= 0. 18). CONCLUSION: ROP screening is a necessary but recognised painful procedure. Sucrose combined with NNS and swaddling reduced the behavioural and physiological pain responses.

40|$|Background—For the {{premature}} infant, extrauterine life is {{a pathological}} condition which greatly amplifies the challenges to the brain in establishing functional oromotor behaviors. The extent to which suck can be entrained using a synthetically patterned orocutaneous input to promote its development in preterm infants who manifest chronic lung disease is unknown. Objective—To evaluate {{the effects of a}} frequency-modulated orocutaneous pulse train delivered through a pneumatically-charged pacifier capable of enhancing <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) activity in tube-fed premature infants. Methods—A randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of pneumatic orocutaneous stimulation 3 x/day on NNS development and length of stay (LOS) in the NICU among 160 newborn infants distributed among 3 subpopulations, including healthy preterm infants (HI), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and chronic lung disease (CLD). Study infants received a regimen of orocutaneous pulse trains through a PULSED pressurized silicone pacifier or a SHAM control (blind pacifier) during gavage feeds for up to 10 days. Results—Mixed modeling, adjusted for the infant’s gender, gestational age, postmenstrual age, and birth weight, was used to handle interdependency among repeated measures within subjects. A significant main effect for stimulation mode (SHAM pacifier vs PULSED orosensory) was found among preterm infants for NNS Bursts/minute (p=. 003), NNS events/minute (p=. 033), and for Total Oral Compressions/minute [NNS+nonNNS] (p=. 016).

This {{study was designed to}} determine the prevalence of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits and its association with acute diarrhoea in children aged 6 to 23 months in urban communities of Nigeria. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 12 communities from four out of 12 geopolitical wards in Ibadan North Local Government Area and 427 mothers of children aged 6 - 24 months were randomly selected. A pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics, recent history of diarrhoea (three months prior to visit) and use of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> materials. Descriptive statistics, Chi square and logistic regression were used for data analysis at p= 0. 05. Results: Mean age of the children was 13. 9 ± 5. 3 months and 50. 6 % were males. Prevalence of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> was 45. 2 %. Prevalence of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> was not significantly different between males (45. 8 %) and females (44. 5 %). The odds of engaging in <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> increases by 6. 0 % with increasing age (OR = 1. 06; 1. 02; 1. 10). More children who were not exclusively breastfed (53. 5 %) than exclusively breastfed (26. 2 %) were likely to engage in <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> (OR = 3. 25; 95 % CI = 2. 07, 5. 12).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (NNSHs) {{can cause}} occlusal alterations, {{including}} anterior open bite (AOB). However, not all patients develop this malocclusion. Therefore, {{the emergence of}} AOB {{does not depend on}} deleterious habits, only. OBJECTIVE: Investigate a potential association between <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (NNSHs), anterior open bite (AOB) and facial morphology (FM). METHODS: 176 children in the primary dentition stage were selected. Intra and extraoral clinical examinations were performed and the children's legal guardians {{were asked to respond to}} a questionnaire comprising issues related to <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (NNSHs). RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was found between <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (NNSHs) and anterior open bite (AOB). However, no association was found between these factors and children's facial morphology (FM). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (NNSHs) during the primary dentition stage play a key role in determining anterior open bite (AOB) malocclusion regardless of patient's morphological facial pattern (FM) ...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThe {{development}} of suck–swallow–breath rhythms during <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>suck</b> (NNS) {{may be an}} indicator of neurologic integrity. We have described swallow–breath (SwBr) interaction and phase of respiration (POR) with swallow during NNS in low-risk preterm (LRP) infants. NNS in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) has not been described with our method. MethodSuckle, swallow, thoracic motion, and nasal airflow were measured during NNS in 10 infants with NAS and 12 unaffected infants (control). Logistic regression models were fit to describe {{the three types of}} SwBr and five types of POR in terms of the independent variables (gender, gestational age, birth weight, postmenstrual age, weeks postfirst nipple feed and swallows per study). We also compared the NAS group to 16 LRP infants. ResultsIn the NAS group, there were 94 swallows in 18 studies. In the control group, there were 94 swallows in 12 studies. There were statistical differences between groups for all three types of SwBr. The distribution of SwBr in NAS was similar to LRP infants with NAS having fewer swallows with attenuated respiration and more with central apnea. For POR, there were few differences. Over time, the distribution of SwBr in NAS infants approaches that of control infants. DiscussionVariability in SwBr and POR during NNS may represent neurologic dysfunction in infants with NAS. Specifically, term infants with NAS display an immature pattern of SwBr making them more similar to preterm infants, rather than a unique pathology. The distribution of SwBr and POR in NAS infants becomes more like term infants, possibly representing catch-up development as the NAS symptoms resolve. ConclusionSwBr in babies with NAS is different from that of unaffected term infants, actually being similar to preterm infants. Infants with NAS exhibit a dysmature pattern of NNS development which resolves over time...|$|R
40|$|In utero {{exposure}} to opiates may affect autonomic {{functioning of the}} fetus and newborn. We investigated heart rate variability (HRV) {{as a measure of}} autonomic stability in prenatal opiate exposed neonates (n= 14) and in control term infants (n= 10). Electrocardiographic data during both <b>non-nutritive</b> and nutritive <b>sucking</b> were evaluated for RR intervals, heart rate (HR), standard deviation of the RR intervals (SDRR), standard deviation of the differences of subsequent RR intervals (SDDRR), and the power spectral densities in low and high frequency bands. In controls, mean HR increased significantly, 143 /min to 161 /min (p= 0. 002), with a trend toward a decrease in RR intervals from non-nutritive to nutritive sucking; these measures did not change significantly among exposed infants. Compared to controls, exposed infants demonstrated significantly greater HRV or greater mean SDRR and SDDRR during non-nutritive period (p< 0. 01), greater mean SDDRR during nutritive sucking (p= 0. 02), and higher powers in the low and high frequency bands during nutritive feedings. Our findings suggest that prenatal opiate exposure may be associated with changes in autonomic nervous system functioning involving both sympathetic and parasympathetic branches.

40|$|The {{main part}} of this thesis sets out to study the {{sequential}} organisation of sucking during normal breast feeding. Data on breast feeding are scarce {{when compared with the}} large body of work on sucking during bottle feeding. One of the initial outcomes is that on the first breast, as compared with the second, sucking is slower overall. The widely-quoted dichotomy between nutritive and <b>non-nutritive</b> modes of <b>sucking</b> is not upheld. Rather, the organisation of sucking exhibits complete gradation between these two rhythms, and pausing is always a feature of sucking on the breast. Sucking patterns were also seen to change progressively through the feed, and attempts are made to account for these changes using several different approaches. Sucking patterns, in particular sucking rate, during breast feeding appear to be determined largely by the rate of milk flow rather than by the baby's hunger, fatigue or behavioural state, although the concurrent changes in milk composition cannot be ruled out since changes in milk flow and composition on the breast cannot be dissociated. However, the probability of the baby sucking at any one time is less strongly correlated with milk flow rate. An attempt is made to place the findings in their evolutionary and social context...|$|R

40|$|Background:Enteral feeding {{intolerance}} is a {{major problem}} in the preterm neonates. <b>Non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> and abdominal massage are among the most important nutritional interventions in this regard. Aim: This study aimed to compare the effect of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> and abdominal massage on feeding tolerance in the preterm newborns. Method: This clinical trial was conducted on 52 preterm neonates in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of Imam Reza Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups, namely abdominal massage (17 newborns), <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> (18 newborns), and control groups (17 newborns). In the abdominal massage group, the intervention was fulfilled for 15 min twice a day, and in the <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> group, the intervention was performed for 10 min three times a day within 7 days. The control group only received tube feeding every two h without any intervention. Feeding tolerance was examined in terms of gastric residuals, vomiting, and abdominal distention. The data were collected through the recording daily information form. The data were analyzed through SPSS version 23, using ANOVA test and marginal models. Results: The mean gestational age of the abdominal massage group was 32. 8 ± 1. 0 weeks. This value was 32. 5 ± 1. 3 weeks in both sucking and control groups. Generalized estimating equation revealed that <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> was effective in the absence of distention (P= 0. 01) and vomiting (P= 0. 01).

Breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> {{are considered to be}} non-pharmacologic strategy of pain management. Objective: This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> on pain relief in infant immunization Methods: This was a quasy experimental study with posttest only control group. This study was conducted on 26 October till 30 November 2016 at hree Community Health Centers (Puskesmas), namely Puskesmas Cilacap Utara I, Puskesmas Cilacap Tengah, and Puskesmas Cilacap Selatan I. The population was infants aged 2 - 4 months who got immunization of DPT-HB-Hib 1. Samples were recruited using consecutive sampling technique. There were 69 samples in this study, which were divided into three groups. 1) The group was given a breastfeeding intervention (23 respondents), 2) The second group was given a non Nutritive sucking intervention (23 respondents), and 3) The control group (23 respondents). Data were analyzed using ANOVA. Results: The pain response of the three groups was groups was 2. 74 in breastfeeding group, 1. 87 in <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> group, and 3. 26 in control group. There was a significant difference between <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> and control group with p-value = 0, 000, and also the significant difference between breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> with p-value = 0. 016.

40|$|Objective: Aim of this {{case-control study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of malocclusion related to <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits (pacifier or finger) {{in a sample of}} children at the Unit of Pediatric Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillo-facial Sciences of the “Sapienza”, University of Rome. Materials and methods: Two samples of children were selected from January 2009 to December 2010, all aged between 5 and 9 years in deciduous or early mixed dentition. The first sample (study group) consisted of 125 subjects that presented one or more malocclusions; the second sample (control group) consisted of 150 children that did not show any form of malocclusion.

Beyond 3  years, <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> is implicated in malocclusions, such as anterior open bite, posterior crossbite, and Class II molar relationship. It is also recommended to monitor patients with low posture of the tongue and mouth breathing, in order to prevent dental open bite and excessive mandibular growth. Tongue thrusting and an abnormal tongue position may be associated with anterior open bite, speech difficulties, and anterior protrusion of the upper incisors [22, 23].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Nutritional, {{immunological}} {{and psychological}} benefts of exclusive breastfeeding for the frst 6 months {{of life are}} unequivocally recognized. However, mothers should also {{be aware of the}} importance of breastfeeding for promoting adequate oral development. This study evaluated the association between breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> patterns and the prevalence of anterior open bite in primary dentition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Infant feeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> were investigated in a 3 - 6 year-old sample of 1, 377 children, from São Paulo city, Brazil. Children were grouped according to breastfeeding duration: G 1 - non-breastfed, G 2 - shorter than 6 months, G 3 - interruption between 6 and 12 months, and G 4 - longer than 12 months. Three calibrated dentists performed clinical examinations and classifed overbite into 3 categories: normal, anterior open bite and deep bite. Chi-square tests (p< 0. 05) with odds ratio (OR) calculation were used for intergroup comparisons. The impact of breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> on the prevalence of anterior open bite was analyzed using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence estimates of anterior open bite were: 31. 9 % (G 1), 26. 1 % (G 2), 22. 1 % (G 3), and 6. 2 % (G 4). G 1 would have signifcantly more chances of having anterior open bite compared with G 4; in the total sample (OR= 7. 1) and in the subgroup without history of <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> (OR= 9. 3). Prolonging breastfeeding for 12 months was associated with a 3. 7 times lower chance of having anterior open bite. In each year of persistence with <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits, the chance of developing this malocclusion increased in 2. 38 times. CONCLUSIONS: Breastfeeding and <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> durations demonstrated opposite effects on the prediction of anterior open bite. Non-breastfed children presented signifcantly greater chances of having anterior open bite compared with those who were breastfed for periods longer than 12 months, demonstrating the benefcial infuence of breastfeeding on dental occlusion...|$|E

30|$|This {{cross-sectional}} {{retrospective study}} was conducted to determine association between breastfeeding duration, <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> habits, dental arch transverse diameters, posterior crossbite and anterior open bite in deciduous dentition.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, some studies did not found this {{association}} [11, 21, 22]. Some authors observed among children with minimal non-nutritive habits {{that those who}} breastfed had similar dental arch parameters and occlusal characteristics as those with shorter duration of breastfeeding or no breastfeeding [11]. A {{possible explanation is that}} the effects of breastfeeding on dental arch development are difficult to assess because {{it is not easy to}} separate these effects from those <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking</b> behaviors. This result is because most breastfed children also engaged in at least some <b>non-nutritive</b> <b>sucking.</b>|$|E
