5|$|The French {{sociologist}} Victor de Rochas {{refers to}} the Romani in the Northern Basque Country speaking Basque, rather than French, in his 1876 Les Parias de France et d'Espagne (cagots et bohémiens). The Canon Jean-Baptiste Daranatz published a wordlist in the periodical Eskualdun Ona in 1906 and in 1921 Berraondo and Oyarbide carried out some research. Although labelled gitano (Spanish for 'gypsy') or bohémien / gitan (French for 'gypsy'), some data {{can also be found}} in Azkue's 1905 dictionary and Pierre Lhande's 1926 dictionary, both of which list a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> identifiable as Erromintxela.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

40|$|In the Yule-Simon process, {{creation}} and selection <b>of</b> <b>words</b> follows the preferential attachment mechanism, {{resulting in a}} power-law growth in the cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>word</b> occurrences {{as well as the}} power-law population distribution of the vocabulary. This is derived using mean-field approximation, assuming a continuum limit of both the time and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> occurrences. However, time and word occurrences are inherently discrete in the process, and it is natural to assume that the cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> occurrences has a certain fluctuation around the average behavior predicted by the mean-field approximation. We derive the exact and approximate forms of the probability distribution of such fluctuation analytically, and confirm that those probability distributions are well supported by the numerical experiments...|$|R

5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} vocabulary spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A vocabulary spurt often occurs over time as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt.|$|E

50|$|Schachter et al. (1991) {{conducted}} an experiment to examine if the <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> choices affect pausing. They {{sat in on}} the lectures of 47 undergraduate professors from 10 different departments and calculated the <b>number</b> and times <b>of</b> filled pauses and unfilled pauses. They found significantly more pauses in the humanities departments {{as opposed to the}} natural sciences. These findings suggest that the greater the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> choices, the more frequent are the pauses, and hence the pauses serve to allow us time to choose our words.|$|R

40|$|The paper investigates a {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> free <b>word</b> order through the analysis by reduction.

The investigation focuses upon an interplay of two phenom-ena related to word order: (non-) projectivity {{of a sentence}} and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order shifts within the analysis by reduction. This interplay is exemplified on a sample of Czech sentences with clitics. ...|$|R
25|$|Dutch {{uses the}} diaeresis. For example, in ruïne {{it means that}} the u and the i are {{separately}} pronounced in their usual way, and not {{in the way that the}} combination ui is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the i. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (érg koud for very cold) or for disambiguation between a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> that are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (één appel = one apple, een appel = an apple; vóórkomen = to occur, voorkómen = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.|$|E
