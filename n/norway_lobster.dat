40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the effects on melanosis development in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) of treatment by dusting with a commercial sulphite-based product and of spraying with a formulation containing 4 -hexylresorcinol (0. 1 % and 0. 05 %), in combination with organic acids and chelating agents. The following tests were performed during chilled storage: polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, melanosis score, colour parameters, tyrosine and tyramine content, as the main substrate of PPO. Differences among treatments were evaluated by means of statistical analyses (ANOVA, principal components and discriminant analyses). All formulations diminished PPO activity during storage successfully. The melanosis score was higher in sulphite-treated <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and a formulation with 0. 05 % 4 -hexylresorcinol was enough to prevent the appearance of melanosis for 12 days. The tyrosine content decreased during storage, but the tyramine content was insignificant.

25|$|Fishery {{data for}} the Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is inadequate as it is still recorded as G. melastomus by observers. This species is caught incidentally on deepwater longlines and bottom trawls targeting other species, including wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), conger eel (Conger conger), <b>Norway</b> <b>lobster</b> (Nephrops norvegicus), and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus). Most landed sharks are discarded and likely suffer high mortality due to damage sustained during capture; the larger specimens are marketed for human consumption. Given the small extent of its range and the ubiquitous heavy fishing pressure within, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this shark as Near Threatened.|$|E
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and non-target species, particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the <b>Norway</b> <b>Lobster,</b> whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E

40|$|Hematodinium and Hematodinium-like {{species have}} emerged in the last 3 decades as {{important}} parasitic pathogens of crustaceans worldwide, causing a significant economic loss to fisheries and related markets. In some species (notably the Tanner crab Chionoecetes bairdi), the parasite reportedly causes the cooked meat to taste bitter and aspirin-like. The bitter taste, together with the gross pathology of the infection, renders these crabs unmarketable. Surprisingly, no organoleptic tests have ever been conducted to date, and the cause for the bitter taste is still unknown. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed that the bitter taste occurs widely in cooked meats and products derived from crustaceans infected with Hematodinium. In the present study, we analysed the meat quality and organoleptic attributes after capture and during storage of <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> Nephrops norvegicus from Scottish waters that were either asymptomatic or symptomatic of patent Hematodinium infection. Results from the sensory evaluation of the cooked product indicate that tail meat from symptomatic N. norvegicus is bland in flavour and aftertaste, and more friable or sloppier in texture than meat from asymptomatic animals. As a consequence, infected meat tends to be less palatable, although surprisingly no bitter taste is reported. From an analytical point of view, tail meat from patently infected animals is at an advanced stage of auto - lysis, while no difference in microbial load is detected. These results suggest that <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> heavily infected with Hematodinium are of inferior marketing quality even after the tails have been cooked...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{improved}} {{practices in}} the trawl fishery for <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) {{have made it possible}} to increase the proportion of trawl-caught lobsters that can be transported alive successfully. A major contributor to this has been the introduction of on-board seawater tanks, which allow for the recovery of animals immediately after they have been landed fromthe net. In this study, we have validated a vigour index that could be used both by fisheries scientists and by the industry dealing with live-traded Nephrops, allowing identification of the proportion of trawl-caught lobsters that fail to recover following capture and are not in a condition to survive live transportation. Results indicate that the process of visual selection into one of four possible vigour categories reflects with good accuracy the underlying physiological state ofthe animals, as assessed by the level of adenylate 5 –triphosphate in the tailmuscles, by the proportions of other nucleotides as expressed in the Adenylate Energy Charge, and by the amount of intra-muscular l-lactate present.

40|$|Rearing <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> for {{restocking}} is {{a management}} option to compensate fishing overexploitation, but this requires, among other topics, developing specific pellet diets. The activity of digestive enzymes and the histological {{organization of the}} hepatopancreas were analyzed to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} pellet diet on digestive performance. Thirty animals were reared individually for 6 mo, fed with mussels and pellets or starved. Comparisons with wild lobsters were also conducted. Survival rate of lobsters fed with frozen mussels was the greatest. Trypsin and amylase activity in the hepatopancreas of the lobsters fed pellets was greater than that of other treatments. In contrast, pepsin activity in the gastric juice of starved animals was the greatest. Levels of alkaline proteases in the gastric fluid were greater in lobsters fed with mussels and the pellet diet in contrast to fasted animals. Amylase was greater in specimens fed frozen mussels. The greatest level of lipid accumulation observed in lobsters fed with the pellet diet indicated a physiological imbalance between the absorptive and transport capacity of the hepatopancreatic cells resulting from an excess of dietary lipids. These results might serve as a reference for future studies for formulating feeds specifically designed for Nephrops norvegicus...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Organisms {{in natural}} {{habitats}} must frequently respond {{to changes in}} their environments through various physiological mechanisms. My laboratory has developed several methods for the quantifi-cation of stress in crustaceans. An ELISA was developed for the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) from the American lobster (Homarus americanus). It is sensitive to as little as 0. 2 fmol of peptide. Increases in hemolymph CHH were observed under conditions of acute hypoxia, elevated temperature, and altered salinity. In addition, elevated CHH concentrations were observed in <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) that were parasitized with the dinoflagellate Hematodinium sp. Stress proteins, also known as heat-shock proteins (HSPs), comprise a highly conserved class of proteins that display elevated transcription during periods of stress. Using homologous molecular probes, my collab-orators and I have examined the influence of heat-shock, osmotic stress, and the molt cycle upon HSP expression at the protein and mRNA levels. We observed a significant elevation in HSP mRNA expression after 1 hr of heat-shock or after 0. 5 hr of osmotic stress. When comparing claw and abdominal muscles during molting, we observed a tissue-specific HSP response. Quantification of these different stress responses may serve as early indicators of the degradation of environmental health...|$|R
40|$|Dinoflagellates of the genusHematodinium infect over 40 {{species of}} marine crustaceans. Since the initial {{description}} of this parasite in France in the 1930 s [1], {{it appears to}} have spread glob-ally, causing economic loss in some species, including Tanner crabs (Chionoecetes bairdi) in Alaska [2], blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) in the United States [3], edible crabs (Cancer pagurus) and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> (Nephrops norvegicus) in Europe [4 – 7], sand crabs (Portunus armatus) in Australia [8], and Chinese swimming crabs (Portunus trituberculatus) in northern China [9]. Because this disease is thought to be fatal, it may be of great significance to the sus-tainability of both captive shellfish fisheries and aquaculture [10, 11]. For instance, the decline in blue crabs from the Atlantic to Gulf Coasts in the US appears to be linked to epizootic out-breaks of disease caused byHematodinium [12]. Similarly, the reduction in velvet swimmer crab (Necora puber) numbers in Brittany in the 1980 s has been attributed to the high preva-lence of such infections [13]. Finally, the recent reports ofHematodinium infections in crabs and shrimp raised under aquaculture conditions in China [9, 14, 15] highlight the danger to ad-ditional, cultured crustacean populations. The number and host range of species ofHematodinium is unclear. Chatton and Poisso...|$|R

40|$|<b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters,</b> Nephrops norvegicus, are sediment-dwelling decapod {{crustaceans}} that excavate burrows {{from which}} they make short excursions to feed by predation and scavenging. The females of this species are known to reside within their burrows {{for an extended period}} of time over the winter while brooding their eggs. The aim of this study was to assess the likelihood of these females being able to feed during this brooding period. Biophysical and biochemical measurements that had previously been shown to change with starvation under laboratory conditions in male N. norvegicus were taken for female N. norvegicus under similar conditions. These measurements were also compared in both sexes obtained from monthly trawl samples from the Clyde Sea Area, Scotland, UK, together with trawl composition data. The laboratory study showed that the hepatosomatic index, and the copper, lipid and water content of the hepatopancreas can be used as indicators of the state of starvation in females, as in males. In the wild, both sexes have reduced nutritional status during the winter, but not to the degree seen in animals starved for 20 weeks in aquarium trials. This study does not support the hypothesis that females cease feeding over winter, during their brooding period. Firstly, some females were unable to sustain ovary development during starvation under controlled conditions, contrary to field observations. Secondly, field data suggest that there is no sex-specific reduction in nutritional status...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{necessity}} {{to move from}} a traditional fishery management to an ecosystem approach is now acknowl-edged. Indicators are required to support {{the development of this}} approach. For example, community indicators have been proposed {{to assess the impact of}} fishing. We tested here the applicability of one such community indicator, the abundance-biomass comparison (ABC method), as a measure of the impact of bottom trawling (years of sampling: 2001 and 2003) on the benthic invertebrates – typically starfishes, crabs, squat lobsters, shrimps and large hard-shelled molluscs- of “Grande Vasière”, a major French fishing zone, in the Bay of Biscay. The ABC method is generally used as an impact indicator for different types of physical, biological and anthropogenic disturbances on benthic communities. This method is based on the assumption that increasing disturbance shifts communities from dominance by large-bodied species with low turnover rates toward dominance by small-bodied species with high turnover rates. At less disturbed areas the average biomass of individuals is greater than at more heavily disturbed areas. The ABC method measures this effect by comparing the ranked distributions of abundance and biomass within a given community. We applied the ABC method and compared the size structure and the species diversity at two areas exposed to moderate and high bottom trawl effort. Species diversity was lower in the most exploited area. The highly trawled area was dominated by opportunistic organisms, mainly one species of swimming crab Liocarcinus depurator, one species of squat lobster Munida rugosa and <b>Norway</b> <b>lobsters</b> Nephrops norvegicus, which are large-bodied species.
