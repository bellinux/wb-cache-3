5|$|This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Ally McBeal. It is {{not about}} finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|Chauncey Vibbard, often {{abbreviated}} as C. Vibbard or just Vibbard, was a steamboat {{built in}} New York in 1864 for passenger {{service on the}} Hudson River. The first steamboat built specifically for what later became the Hudson River Day Line, Chauncey Vibbard quickly established herself as the fastest steamboat on the river, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> with a record run from New York to Albany in 1864. Her popularity was such that after only two years of service she was lengthened to accommodate more passengers.|$|E

500|$|In {{speculative}} fiction, extrapolation allows {{writers to}} focus {{not on the}} way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called [...] "cognitive estrangement": the recognition that what we are reading is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective. When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted. SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens.|$|E
500|$|In metaphors {{carried over}} from the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{describes}} marriage as a prison and women as slaves within it in The Wrongs of Woman. In the first chapter Maria laments, [...] " [...] <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> a vast prison, and women born slaves?" [...] and later she makes a politically charged allusion to the French prison, the Bastille: [...] "marriage had bastilled me for life". Moreover, Maria's body is bought and sold like a slave's: she is worth £5,000 on the open marriage market and her new husband attempts to sell her into prostitution. Commenting on her condition, Maria states: [...] "a wife being as much a man's property as his horse, or his ass, she has nothing she can call her own". In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft had used the metaphor of slavery not only to describe the horrors of marriage as it currently existed but also to offer a juxtaposition {{to the possibility of}} a new kind of marriage, one which assumed equality between affectionate and rational partners. In The Wrongs of Woman, this option is never presented; instead, the reader is shown a series of disastrous marriages in which women are abused, robbed, and abandoned.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} years the Chicago Marathon was held in August. [...] It has from its {{inception}} with 4,200 runners and 2,128 finishers {{been one of the}} nation's largest marathons. [...] The 2000 running was second only to New York. [...] The 1979 and 1980 events, however, continued to be gatherings of amateur runners. By 1982, the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes. [...] The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2:10:59 by Greg Meyer. [...] By 1983, the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America's most important marathons. [...] In 1984, Beatrice raised the purse to $250,000 ($50,000 more than New York's). [...] The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners. [...] The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record (2 seconds short of the world record) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion, two-time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist, Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen. [...] Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation. [...] At that time, it was considered the premier marathon in the United States, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> [...] Although 1986 had 40 world-class runners among the 8,000 participants the times paled in comparison. Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987. Because of this only a half-marathon race was held that year and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988 and attracted Heileman Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon. [...] The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions. [...] In 1991, Heileman discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned. [...] In 1992, the race again had no sponsorship, but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank. In 1994, the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon. [...] In 1996, LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events, Inc., who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty. In 1998, the race began using transponder timing. [...] In 2001, when Catherine Ndereba broke the women's world record marathon time, both the men's and women's then-current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon. [...] For 2008, the race was sponsored by Bank of America following the purchase of LaSalle Bank from ABN Amro to Bank of America, and the new title will be in use.|$|E

2500|$|On Halloween {{night in}} 1989, {{two weeks after}} San Francisco was devastated by the 6.9 (Richter scale) Loma Prieta earthquake, the Sisters {{performed}} street theater and used donation buckets to collect {{thousands of dollars for}} the mayor's Earthquake Relief Fund from the Halloween crowds that poured into The Castro for the massive street party. The group formally added donation gates, a stage and structure to safely manage the event from 1990–1995, until [...] "drunken gay-bashers out to get their kicks" [...] convinced the group the event was unsafe without official city support. In 1995, the Sisters agreed to host a costume-mandatory dance, HallowQueen, in a SoMa gay nightclub – which raised over $6000 for charities – as their contribution to helping move the event out of the mostly residential neighborhood. In multi-year planning discussions on how to address the events challenges, New York City's Village Halloween Parade, the United States' largest Halloween celebration, [...] was often cited {{as an example of the}} potential for the event to attract tourists and benefit local businesses as well.

It is the largest participatory parade in the country if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> encouraging spectators to march in the parade. Barbara Ehrenreich, in her book on [...] mentions this as an example of how Halloween is transitioning from a children's holiday to an adult holiday and compares it to Mardi Gras.
