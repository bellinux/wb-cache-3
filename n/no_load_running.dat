40|$|The paper {{reports the}} results of some {{laboratory}} and field tests aimed at assessing the acceleration levels transmitted to the hand-arm system by electric portable harvesters for olive. Four harvesting heads, different for shape and kinematic system, and five bars, different for diameter, length and material (aluminium and carbon fibre), were used in assembling eleven harvesters. The vibrations were measured in two points, next to the handgrips. The laboratory tests allowed {{the evaluation of the}} acceleration levels in standard controlled conditions, while the field tests allowed the assessing {{of the effects of the}} tree canopy with respect to the <b>no</b> <b>load</b> <b>running.</b> The laboratory tests showed that in reducing the vibration level plays a major role the kinematic system of the harvesting head and then the bar material. The classical flap-type harvester produced accelerations of around 20 m/s 2, while by using a harvesting head with two parts in opposite movement, the accelerations were lowered to about 6 m/s 2. The use of carbon fibres for the bars, besides the reduction in weight, produced also a reduction in acceleration (from 21 to 16 m/s 2). The field tests proved that the tree canopy had a negative effect on the vibrations transmitted to the hand-arm system, especially when the aluminium bar of small diameter was used...|$|E

The tests were carried on a 3 -Phase IM with special design and construction suitable {{to be used in}} electric car. The resistive loads of the car were simulated using a synchronous generator with a variable electric resistive load coupled to 3 -Phase IM. An electronic car foot pedal and a battery bank were used as main source of power with a capacity suitable for the size of a light weight or medium size car. The performances of 3 -Phase IM were tested in several practical cases simulating the running of 3 -Phase IM on <b>no</b> <b>load,</b> <b>running</b> of 3 -Phase IM to accelerate the car from stop position to reach a certain speed fixed by driver, for different resistive loads of the car.

Variations of rotation speed in time and variation of active torque in time of 3 -Phase IM were studied for these cases, when different resistive load coupled to 3 -Phase IM.

The adoption of an efficient two dimensional (2 D) finite element formulation, in conjunction with the proper representation of the core material characteristics and geometrical configuration, provides good agreement between calculated and measured loss values.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{efficacy}} of an insulin priming dose with a continuous insulin infusion versus two continuous infusions without a priming dose. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — This prospective randomized protocol used three insulin therapy methods: 1) load group using a priming dose of 0. 07 units of regular insulin per kg body weight followed by a dose of 0. 07 unit � kg � 1 � h � 1 i. v. in 12 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA); 2) <b>no</b> <b>load</b> group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0. 07 unit � kg body weight � 1 � h � 1 without a loading dose in 12 patients with DKA, and 3) twice <b>no</b> <b>load</b> group using an infusion of regular insulin of 0. 14 � kg � 1 � h � 1 without a loading dose in 13 patients with DKA. Outcome was based on the effects of insulin therapy on biochemical and hormonal changes during treatment and recovery of DKA. RESULTS — The load group reached a peak in free insulin value (460 �U/ml) within 5 min and plateaued at 88 �U/ml in 60 min. The twice <b>no</b> <b>load</b> group reached a peak (200 �U/ml) at 45 min.
