It {{would be very difficult to}} do because of the variety of crops that are produced and the different production methods that are used to get crops to a salable size. Production Regions: Long Island NY (Suffolk County), Western NY (Erie and Cattaraugus counties), various nurseries scattered throughout state. Cultural Practices: Unfinished plants & propagation material – The propagation of plants is an important part of the production cycle. Depending on the plant species (or cultivar), plants may be propagated by seed, cuttings, division (as is the case with some herbaceous perennials), budding, grafting, and tissue culture. Many <b>nurseries</b> <b>propagate</b> much of what they grow; however, many others purchase <b>propagated</b> <b>material</b> from <b>nurseries</b> outside of the state.

5000|$|The Convention was revised in Geneva in 1972, 1978 and 1991. Both the 1978 and the 1991 Acts set out {{a minimum}} scope of {{protection}} and offer member States the possibility of taking national circumstances into account in their legislation. Under the 1978 Act, the minimum scope of the plant breeder's right requires that the holder's prior authorisation {{is necessary for the}} production for purposes of commercial marketing, the offering for sale and the marketing of <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> of the protected variety. The 1991 Act contains more detailed provisions defining the acts concerning <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> in relation to which the holder's authorisation is required. The breeder's authorisation is also required in relation to any of the specified acts done with harvested material of the variety, unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the <b>propagating</b> <b>material,</b> or if not doing so could constitute an [...] "Omega Threat" [...] situation. Under that provision, for example, a flower breeder who protects their variety in the Netherlands could block importation of cut flowers of that variety into the Netherlands from Egypt, which does not grant plant breeders' rights, because the breeder had no opportunity to exercise any rights in Egypt. Member countries also have the option to require the breeder's authorization with respect to the specified acts as applied to products directly obtained from the harvested material (such as flour or oil from grain, or juice from fruit), unless the breeder has had reasonable opportunity to exercise their right in relation to the harvested material.|$|R

40|$|Two {{new methods}} of {{propagating}} plantain and banana have been developed by the National Horticultural Research Institute in Nigeria. Both plantains and bananas are a major food in West Africa, but availability of <b>propagating</b> <b>material</b> has limited the expansion of groves 90 % of which are owned by peasant farmers. Lack of planting material and risk of disease transfer also pose problems for on-farm multiplication. The new methods use materials {{that would have been}} left to waste on the field and also ensure that true-to-type planting materials are used. In the first technique, the split corm technique (SCT), corms are cut into sett sizes of 50 g each and treated with fungicide. They are then air-dried for 24 hours before being planted in a 1 : 1 mix of forest topsoil and sterilized sawdust. New sprouts appear after four weeks from the date of planting and up to 20 plants have been obtained from one corm in this way. The second method is the Split Bud Technique (SBT) and is a modification of SCT. When the corn setts begin to sprout they are removed-from the nursery bed and split longitudinally into 4 sections. Using this method, up to 500 plants can be obtained from a single corm within 24 weeks. These methods will greatly increase the supply of banana and plantain <b>propagating</b> <b>material,</b> especially as the methods are not complicated and require no specialized equipment.
