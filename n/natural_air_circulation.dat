5000|$|The Lend-A-Hand Club was a three-story, brick, U-shaped {{building}} that was built over a raised basement. It was designed by Davenport architect Frederick G. Clausen in the Renaissance Revival style. It featured terracotta pilasters and cornice. Four decorative urns were located on the parapet. The shape of the building allowed the residential spaces to receive full <b>natural</b> light and <b>air</b> <b>circulation.</b> [...] The main floor was a rectangular box that housed the social service elements of the facility.|$|R
50|$|The New Law School {{employs a}} double skin curtain wall, cavity facade system with {{operable}} louvers. This system creates a stack effect and regulates the interior thermally. The louvres change {{according to the}} position of the sun or preferences of the building's inhabitants. The harsh daylight is therefore softened when it is filtered into the interior space. This system also allows variation in light and shade, blocking harsh glare and heat while preserving and directing views. In addition, <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> is concerned through the interior, tempering the environment as it is needed. On the other hand, the double skin glass serves as an acoustic barrier to noises from the busy City Road, so that inhabitants can engage in quiet activities without disturbance.|$|E

The main hazards associated with this flow of gas and its potential accumulation in confined volumes in buildings are asphyxiation and intoxication. A further study is in progress in order to better understand the origin of the gas generation within the old iron mine workings.

50|$|Another of Trungram Gyalwa’s projects, the World Center for Peace and Unity, at Buddha Shakyamuni’s birthplace in Lumbini, Nepal, is {{intended}} as a locus {{for the growth of}} an all-encompassing non-sectarian spirit, and an example of 21st century Buddhism contributing to a greener world and reviving ancient art and culture. Inaugurated in 2011, it is located in a special development zone connected to the Lumbini UNESCO World Heritage Site. Unlike the other monasteries, it was specifically conceived to be a non-sectarian center for any Buddhist, or non-Buddhist, visitors to Lumbini, regardless of tradition or lineage, and especially for those who were not represented by the nations who built the other monasteries. Although it is the largest building inside the Lumbini United Nations Development Project Site, it is the most environmentally friendly, with cavity walls, <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation,</b> and solar power. Trungram Gyalwa, who designed the building himself, feels this “green” approach highlights the importance of our interconnectedness, thus physically promoting peace and unity. The center’s design is based on the ancient stupa at the original Nalanda University. It includes elements of early Nepalese architecture, drawn from the style of the 7th-13th centuries, known as the premier era of Buddhist architecture.|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} types of transmutation systems under investigation include accelerator driven (ADS) and critical systems. To switch off an accelerator {{in case of an}} accident initiation is quite important for all accidents. For a fast ADS the grace times available for doing so depend strongly on the total heat capacity and the natural circulation capability of the primary coolant. Cooling with heavy metal Pb-Bi has considerable advantages in this regard compared to gas cooling. Moreover it allows passive ex-vessel cooling with <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> or water <b>circulation.</b> In the remote likelihood of fuel melting, oxide fuel appears to mix with the Pb-Bi coolant. Fast critical systems that are cooled by Pb-Bi will automatically shut off if the flow or heat sink is lost. Reactivity accidents can be limited by a low total control rod worth. High temperature reactors can achieve only incomplete burning of actinides. If an accelerator is added to increase burn-up, a fast spectrum region is needed, which has a low heat capacity. 50...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} for a {{dehumidifier}} {{has been developed}} which reduces the need for ventilation and saves energy and CO 2. The objective {{of the system is}} a low energy demand. This is achieved by <b>natural</b> convection driven <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> and integration of sensible heat recovery. Moreover a heat pump is applied for the transformation of latent heat into sensible heat. The system is positioned below the crop not causing any light reduction and distributed throughout the greenhouse. With a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program the optimal geometry and dimensions of the components in the system are determined. A separate model for condensation has been created because this is not included in the CFD-program. A prototype based on the best design is built and tested. The calculations and experiments are in good agreement. The system has a capacity to remove 50 to 70 ml of condensate per hour per metre length of system during humid greenhouse conditions (> 80 percent relative humidity). Predictions show that 4 to 7 percent energy can be saved in a conventional greenhouse. For modern well-insulated greenhouses these savings are much higher...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reduction}} of PV electrical efficiency {{due to the}} temperature increase of it can be partially avoided by air heat extraction. Hybrid Photovoltaic / Thermal (PV/T) solar systems can simultaneously give electrical and thermal output, resulting to a higher energy conversion rate of the absorbed solar radiation. In our laboratory we are studying several modes of PV air cooling, aiming to practical and efficient system configurations, suitable {{to be used in}} PV installations on buildings. In the present paper we give test results of air cooled modified PV modules. The used PV/T prototypes were of two types, one with commercial pc-Si PV module, used as reference system (PV/R) and a second system using a new fabricated pc-Si PV module with transparent tedlar on the front and normal glass on the back PV surface, used as modified system (PV/M). The two systems were tested in vertical position with <b>natural</b> and forced <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> as well as in stagnation (no air flow). In addition, we tested system PV/M inserting a flat metallic sheet {{in the middle of the}} air channel. The results showed that the suggested modifications contribute to satisfactory PV cooling and to the improvement of PV/T system energy performance...|$|R

This paper presents a method for calculating the rating of such circuits using computational fluid dynamics techniques, applied to two common trough designs. One design has solid concrete lids while for the second some lids are replaced by grilles to encourage <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation.</b> For the case of covered troughs with solid concrete lids, the IEC 60287 method was found to be conservative owing to its failure to consider the thermal impact of the ground. Good agreement was observed between the CFD model and an improved analytical formulation by Anders. Modeling of partially ventilated troughs, which at present cannot be rated analytically, shows continuous rating increases of up to 31 % over the covered design owing to greater air circulation...|$|E

Drum composting is a potential treatment option for such waste at individual or community level. The present study was aimed to produce compost from wet waste (primarily comprising food waste) in composting drums modified for improved <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation.</b> Effect of microbial inoculum and waste turning on composting process was also studied. The final results showed the production of matured and stable compost in the modified drums. Addition of the microbial inoculum resulted in thermophilic phase within a week time. The self-heating test and germination index (> 80 %) showed the production of non-phytotoxic and mature compost in the modified drums after 60 days. The change in microbial population, humic substances and biological parameters (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) during the study is discussed. Moreover, the reduction in waste mass and volume is also reported. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Composting of deer {{carcasses}} {{was effective}} in reducing pathogen levels, decomposing the carcasses and producing a useable end product after 12 months. The composting process used in this project involved enveloping the carcasses of road-killed deer in woodchips and allowing those piles with <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> to sit undisturbed. Temperatures were measured and samples from the piles were analyzed periodically for pathogens and for compost parameters. While significant pathogen reduction occurred in several months, it took 12 months {{for all of the}} measured pathogens to decline to low levels in all of the 6 piles studied. Samples taken at other sites in New York State that have been composting road-killed deer for over a year also had low pathogen content. We thus suggest a composting duration of 12 months before use. In the interest of being cautious, we also recommend that the end product be used in low public contact settings such as highway rights-of-way...|$|E
40|$|The Dragon capsule is a {{reusable}} vehicle {{being developed}} by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) that will provide commercial cargo transportation to the International Space Station (ISS). Dragon {{is designed to be}} a habitable module while it is berthed to ISS.

40|$|Advanced water {{reactors}} {{are being}} designed to utilize a passive containment cooling system to remove post-accident reactor sensible heat and core decay heat {{to the ultimate}} heat sink by natural convection. Such systems usually involve cooling {{the outside of the}} containment, which causes the in-containment steam to condense and thereby remove heat from the reactor system. These passive containment cooling designs differ primarily in cooling location and methods. However, the low heat transfer capability of current passive containment cooling designs has limited applications. The objective of this thesis research was to explore a high heat removal capability passive containment cooling system: the prefilled water-air annulus- an annulus prefilled with water such that the water boils off and a smooth transition to a <b>natural</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>air</b> system results, that can allow a high power rating reactor design.

40|$|A {{concept for}} a {{greenhouse}} dehumidifier has been designed. Important constraints {{for the design}} are low-energy consumption and homogeneous greenhouse climate. From a survey of dehumidifying methods, condensation to a cooled surface was selected as most promising. Low-energy demand is achieved by <b>natural</b> <b>air</b> <b>circulation</b> through the system and by recovering sensible heat. A homogeneous climate can be realized by decentralized local dehumidification in the greenhouse. Applying a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to simulate fluid flow and heat exchange enabled great improvements in the design. A vertical geometry was chosen first in a double-chimney approach to exploit the vertical distance between inlet and cold surface and that between cold and hot surface for natural convection air circulation. However, CFD calculations indicated stagnating flow in this vertically oriented system. Orienting the system horizontally greatly enhanced the systems performance. A separate model for condensation has been created to complement the CFD programme that did not include condensation. A prototype of the designed dehumidifier was built and tested. Calculations and experiments were in fair agreement and demonstrated the potential for practical application...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} airports' current {{thermal comfort}} {{temperature and humidity}} were registered in three main Brazilian international airports, other variables were local region climate characteristics and the constructive types of passenger terminal buildings. The Brazilian air transportation demand has considerably grown over the last decade, with some airports reaching their capacity. Thermal discomfort may be a key driver of passenger perceptions of airport service levels, specially under capacity overload situations. Therefore, to achieve airport thermal comfort within this new scenario, and with the imminent and future expansions of the airport system, certainly put extra work on the existing air conditioning systems, consequently increasing energy consumption and its associated costs.
