The courtship turned sour after {{he caught her}} cavorting with his jockey and notorious ladies man Tod Sloan. Dixon later married fellow gambler, Riley Grannan, who eventually died broke in Rawhide, Nevada in 1908. According to McGill, Smith <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> interest in another woman after Dixon's betrayal.|$|E

An original does exist in another part of Columbia, SC, giving that city two; an original and a copy. Colson and his son also worked on the restoration of the Doughboy in Clearwater, Florida, along with its companion statue, Spirit of the American Navy.|$|E

Bell's handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.

5|$|Before Beijing, the Bahamas {{had participated}} in the Summer Olympics {{thirteen}} times.

The Bahamian delegation in Beijing included twenty-five athletes, one of its largest delegations in its history up to that point. Prior to Beijing, Bahamian athletes had won four gold medals, one silver and four bronze; a total of nine medals. Bahama's delegation in Beijing added one silver and one bronze medal to the tally, increasing the total number of Bahamian medals to eleven. The flag bearer at ceremonies was Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie. The Bahamian delegation was 41st in line during the flagbearing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|McCabe ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so he <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity {{to serve with}} the NSWCA. After {{the end of his}} first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, but stopped playing in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E

5|$|Nagumo {{was now in}} a quandary. Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, leading Carrier Division 2 (Hiryū and Sōryū), {{recommended}} that Nagumo strike immediately with the forces at hand: 18 Aichi D3A1 dive bombers each on Sōryū and Hiryū, and half the ready cover patrol aircraft. Nagumo's opportunity to hit the American ships was now limited by the imminent return of his Midway strike force. The returning strike force needed to land promptly or {{it would have to}} ditch into the sea. Because of the constant flight deck activity associated with combat air patrol operations during the preceding hour, the Japanese <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to position ("spot") their reserve planes on the flight deck for launch.|$|E

For their services, Stewart and his fellow prisoners were later released and allowed to sail to the Cape of Good Hope. There they discovered Windham, which had failed to arrive at Île de France. Although her prize crew had retained control of the ship following the storm, they had been sighted, chased and seized within sight of Île de France on 29 December by the newly arrived British frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Lucius Curtis. Bellone and her prizes arrived at Port Louis on 2 January, having slipped past Rowley's blockade {{during a period of}} calm weather.|$|E
