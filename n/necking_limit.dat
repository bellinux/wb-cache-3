This paper presents an overview of mechanisms that have been suggested to explain the enhanced formability. The difference between fracture limit and <b>necking</b> <b>limit</b> in sheet metal forming is discussed. The <b>necking</b> <b>limit</b> represents a localized geometrical instability. Localized deformation is an essential characteristic of ISF and proposed mechanisms should stabilize the localization before it leads to fracture. In literature six mechanisms are mentioned in relation to ISF: contact stress; bending-under tension; shear; cyclic straining; geometrical inability to grow and hydrostatic stress. The first three are able to localize deformation and all but the last, {{are found to be}} able to postpone unstable growth of a neck.

40|$|A strain-based forming limit {{criterion}} {{is widely}} used in sheet-metal forming industry to predict necking. However, this criterion is usually valid when the strain path is linear throughout the deformation process [1]. Strain path in incremental sheet forming is often found to be severely nonlinear throughout the deformation history. Therefore, the practice of using a strain-based forming limit criterion often leads to erroneous assessments of formability and failure prediction. On the other hands, stress-based forming limit is insensitive against any changes in the strain path and hence it is first used to model the <b>necking</b> <b>limit</b> in incremental sheet forming.

40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) is a {{flexible}} {{process in which}} sheet metal is formed by a progression of localized deformation. However, the overall mechanics is complicated and special conditions, such as bending under tension, cyclic bending & unbending, and shear deformation occur during the process which contribute to the overall enhancement of formability. The research investigates the deformation mechanisms in ISF with relation to necking and failure. A strain-based forming limit criterion is widely used in sheet-metal forming industry to predict necking. However, this criterion is strictly valid only when the strain path is linear throughout the deformation process. Strain path in ISF is often found to be severely nonlinear throughout the deformation history.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of sheet forming simulations relies on failure criteria {{to define the}} limits of metal deformation. The common requirements for these criteria across {{a broad range of}} application areas have not yet been satisfied or fully identified, and a single criterion to satisfy all needs has not been developed. Areas where existing criteria appear to be lacking are in the comprehension of the effects of non-proportional loading, general non-planar and triaxial stress loading, and process and material mechanisms that differentiate between necking and fracture. This study was mainly motivated to provide an efficient method for the analysis of necking and fracture limits for sheet metals. In this paper, a model for the <b>necking</b> <b>limit</b> is combined with a model for the fracture limit in the principal stress space by employing a stress-based forming limit curve (FLC) and the maximum shear stress (MSS) criterion. A new metal failure criterion for in-plane isotropic metals is described, based on and validated by a set of critical experiments. This criterion also takes into consideration of the stress distribution through the thickness of the sheet metal to identify the mode of failure, including localized necking prior to fracture, surface cracking, and through-thickness fracture, with or without a preceding neck. The fracture model is also applied to the openability of a food can for AA 5182. The predicted results show very good agreement with the experimentally observed data...|$|E

40|$|The FLC is a {{well known}} concept in the sheet metal forming world. It is used to map the material’s {{formability}} and the make-ability of a product. The FLC is valid only within certain restrictions. These restrictions are: A: a straight strain path; B: absence of bending; C: absence of through-thickness shear; D: a condition of plane stress. The formability of a material can be increased significantly if one is allowed to violate any of these restrictions, meaning either: use a complex strain path, incorporate bending, incorporate through-thickness shear, or apply a contact stress. Both shear and contact stress change the stress state, and both lower the yield stress in tension and raise the <b>necking</b> <b>limit</b> {{up to a certain}} level. Bending creates a non-uniform stress distribution over the thickness of the sheet, resulting in a reduction of the yield force in tension, and it creates a range of stable elongation depending on the sheet thickness at each passage of the punch. The effect of a complex strain path depends on the particular situation; in incremental sheet forming it is based on non-isotropic hardening. In general it will not be possible to create such conditions in the entire product at once. However it is possible to do this intentionally in a small, restricted zone by creating special situations there. By moving this zone over the entire product the whole part can be made with increased formability. This technique of incremental forming is explained briefly. The special conditions around the punch indeed violate the FLC restrictions mentioned above. The enhanced formability obtained in incremental sheet forming is illustrated with many examples...|$|E

The specific {{purpose of the}} current work is, first, to numerically investigate the effect of kinematic hardening on localized necking in a freestanding metal layer. Second, the impact of adding a substrate layer on the ductility evolution of the resulting elastomer/metal bilayer will be analyzed. The materials in the metal and substrate layers are assumed to be isotropic, incompressible and strain-rate independent. The behavior of the metal layer is described by a rigid–plastic model with mixed (isotropic and kinematic) hardening. The isotropic hardening contribution is modeled by the Hollomon law, while kinematic hardening is modeled by the Armstrong–Frederick law. The substrate layer is made of elastomer material whose mechanical behavior is assumed to be hyperelastic and modeled by a neo-Hookean constitutive law. The Marciniak–Kuczynski imperfection analysis is used to predict plastic flow localization. Through various numerical simulations, the influence of kinematic hardening on localized necking as well as the impact of the addition of an elastomer layer are specifically emphasized. Comparisons with experimental results are also carried out to assess the relevance of incorporating kinematic hardening in the constitutive modeling of freestanding metal sheets...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} {{stainless steel}} tube (HSST) presents promising applications in many clusters as one of key lightweight materials. While, over thinning and further crack in plastic deformation are prone to occur due to limited strain hardening and high yield-strength ratio. To avoid this phenomenon, the accurate prediction of forming limit of HSST needs to be achieved considering uneven deformation induced fracture. Via the digital speckle correlation method (DSCM) based tension, both the diffuse <b>necking</b> <b>limited</b> hardening and the variation of Lankford coefficient R along tube deformation are studied, modeled and coupled into the Hill' 48 anisotropic yield framework; then by replacing the Mises effective stress with the extended Hill's anisotropic one and using a stepwise inverse method for damage parameter calibration, both the GTN and Lemaitre ductile fracture criteria (DFCs) coupled with anisotropy evolution are established and numerically implemented; thus, regarding several indexes in cases of uniaxial tension, flaring and mandrel bending of HSST, four individual anisotropic plasticity models and two coupled models are compared and evaluated. Due to considering the interplay between inhomogeneous deformation and damage evolution, the coupling model with the improved anisotropic plasticity provides the most accurate prediction of overall performance in all cases. The significance of the coupling DFCs with the anisotropic plasticity on overall simulation of complex forming processes of tubular materials is thus recognized.
