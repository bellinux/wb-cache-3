McNutt criticized Nellie Bertram, noting that, despite the character's potential, the show [...] "places her into the series as a blind antagonist without any sense of what drives her to these actions." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times argued that the producers of The Office seemed to be using her only because British people are ridiculous and are completely different to Americans. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics, on the other hand, praised Catherine Tate's acting and her character, writing, [...] "Tate's first appearance last season was intriguing, and her stint as head honcho down in Florida was entertaining, but in [...] "Get the Girl" [...] {{it became obvious that}} Nellie Bertram as branch manager could be exactly what The Office <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> afloat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queen versus rook (see Philidor position#Queen versus rook). [...] There are two changes here {{enabling}} the rook {{to put up}} a better defense, but the queen still wins.

[...] Tablebases show that a third-rank defense takes a while to breach, which is difficult for a human to do.

2500|$|In this position, {{the black}} king {{needs to get}} {{to one of the}} marked squares in order to draw. If he gets to one of the squares marked with [...] "x", the king can move next to the pawn and the rook can capture the pawn for a draw. Otherwise, the king <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the squares marked with dots: g7 and h7. The reason is that if the black king is on another rank, the white rook can check and then the pawn {{promotes}} and wins. For example, if the black king were on f6 instead, with White to move, 1. Rf8+ followed by 2. a8=Q wins. Also, the black king needs to be on g7 or h7 rather than d7, e7, or f7. If it were White's move in this position, White wins by 1. Rh8 Rxa7 (otherwise the pawn promotes and wins) 2. Rh7+, skewering the rook [...] If the black king is on g7 or h7 and the white king approaches the pawn (to protect it while the rook moves out of the way), the black rook will check from behind and the king has no cover from the checks.|$|E
