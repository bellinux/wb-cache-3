5|$|A Confession of Faith {{to replace}} the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record {{of the actions of}} the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were {{significant}} debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a <b>nullity.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a political dispute. When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of <b>nullity</b> of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nullity</b> theorem {{says that}} the <b>nullity</b> of A equals the <b>nullity</b> of the {{sub-block}} in the lower right of the inverse matrix, and that the <b>nullity</b> of B equals the <b>nullity</b> of the sub-block in the upper right of the inverse matrix.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study {{we are going to}} analyse the regime of the <b>nullities</b> in the Romanian {{criminal}} trial. This presentation will take into consideration the Criminal Procedure Code in force (adopted in 1968), the doctrine and the practice of the courts. Also, we took into consideration the new provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code which is going to enter into force in 2014. This study is focused on analysing the distinctive regime of the absolute and relative <b>nullities</b> and illustrating the situation in which absolute <b>nullities</b> do not lead ope legis to the annulment of the acts set up without respecting the requirements. In this way, we are going to analyse the situation in which in spite of absolute <b>nullities</b> existence, this sanction can be disregarded and the criminal trial will follow its course...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} {{procedural}} <b>nullities</b> {{in the new}} Civil Procedural Code and their suitability in the democratic rule-of-law state. The 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, has brought contextual changes, and thus demanded a review of procedural <b>nullities</b> and the process itself aiming at constitutionally adequate interpretation. Instead of being either a double-dealing instrument inherent to the liberalism of procedural law or a judge´s correction instrument given in the socialization of procedural law, the <b>nullities</b> are now deemed {{as a form of}} control of the procedural acts, their regularity and conformity with the constitutional model of process, as one can interpret drawing on a joint approach to Habermas’ theory, Fazzalari’s theory and the Constitutionalist theory...|$|R

25|$|The number dim(im(f)) is {{also called}} the rank of f and written as rank(f), or sometimes, ρ(f); the number dim(ker(f)) is called the <b>nullity</b> of f and written as null(f) or ν(f). If V and W are finite-dimensional, bases have been chosen and f is {{represented}} by the matrix A, then the rank and <b>nullity</b> of f are equal to the rank and <b>nullity</b> of the matrix A, respectively.|$|E
25|$|By the rank–nullity theorem, {{a system}} of n vectors (matrix columns) in k linearly {{independent}} dimensions (the rank of the matrix {{is the number of}} fundamental dimensions) leaves a <b>nullity,</b> p, satisfying (p=n'k), where the <b>nullity</b> is the number of extraneous dimensions which may be chosen to be dimensionless.|$|E

25|$|Same-sex {{marriage}} in the United Kingdom {{has been the subject}} of wide debate since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in Britain. Previous legislation in England and Wales had prevented same-sex marriage, including the Marriage Act 1949 which defined marriage as between a man and a woman, the <b>Nullity</b> of Marriage Act 1971 which explicitly banned same-sex marriages, and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 which reiterated the provisions of the <b>Nullity</b> of Marriage Act.|$|E

25|$|A <b>nullity</b> {{order is}} one which annuls a void or {{voidable}} civil partnership. Section 49 of the Act provides that a civil partnership is void on grounds of ineligibility to register, if the parties: disregarded certain requirements as {{to the formation of}} the partnership, where any party is a minor, where any person whose consent is required (e.g. a parent) has forbidden the formation of the partnership and the court has not given its consent. Where a civil partnership is voidable, applications for <b>nullity</b> orders are subject to the bars of time, knowledge of defect and approbation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe restate several {{results on}} the Kronecker {{structure}} obtainable after a given matrix pencil is affected by an arbitrarily small perturbation, and state some new {{results on the}} Kronecker structure after a new row is appended or a column deleted. The results are simple consequences of a theory of majorization for semi-infinite integer sequences. The bounds after a new row is appended correspond to bounding the controllability indices after adding a single input to a linear time-invariant dynamical system. We illustrate the known relations between the Kronecker indices, the Segre characteristics, and the <b>nullities</b> of certain block Toeplitz matrices constructed from the original pencils and discuss how those <b>nullities</b> change when the pencil is affected by a perturbation or a new row...|$|R
