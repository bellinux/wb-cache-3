40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{identify}} <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS), which is still a challenging task for analytical chemists, PET pellets, preforms and bottles were analyzed by an optimized headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). Fingerprints obtained by the proposed method were analyzed by three chemometric tools: Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and a multi-block method (Common Components and Specific Weights Analysis CCSWA) in order to extract pertinent variations in NIAS concentrations. Total ion current (TIC) chromatograms were used for PCA and ICA while extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) were used for CCSWA, each ion corresponding to a block. PCA managed to discriminate pellets and preforms from bottles due to several NIAS. Volatiles like 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane, ethylene glycol, ethylbenzene and xylene {{were responsible for the}} discrimination of pellets and preforms. Less volatile compounds like linear aldehydes and phthalates were responsible for the discrimination of bottles. ICA showed more specific discriminations especially for bottles and pellets while CCSWA managed to discriminate preforms. The proposed methodology, combining HS-SPME/GC-MS with chemometric tools proved its efficiency in highlighting NIAS in PET samples in a relatively simple and fast approach compared to classical techniques...|$|R
40|$|IF 3. 778 International audienceThis review {{focuses on}} the use of in vitro bioassays for the hazard {{assessment}} of food contact materials (FCM) as a relevant strategy, in complement to analytical methods. FCM may transfer constituents to foods, not always detected by analytical chemistry, resulting in low but measurable human exposures. Testing FCM extracts with bioassays represents the biological response of a combination of substances, able to be released from the finished materials. Furthermore, this approach is particularly useful regarding the current risk assessment challenges with unpredicted/unidentified <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS) that can be leached from the FCM in the food. Bioassays applied to assess hazard of different FCM types are described for, to date, the toxicological endpoints able to be expressed at low levels; cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and endocrine disruption potential. The bioassay strengths and relative key points needed to correctly use and improve the performance of bioassays for an additional FCM risk assessment is developed. This review compiles studies showing that combining both chemical and toxicological analyses presents a very promising and pragmatic tool for identifying new undesirable NIAS (not predicted) which can represent a great part of the migrating substances and/or "cocktail effect"...|$|R
40|$|Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) {{is widely}} used as a {{packaging}} material {{for all kinds of}} foodstuff. Low diffusivity of the polymer combined with the limited number of additives and their low concentrations lead to very limited mass transfer (migration) of monomers, catalysts, or impurities from the PET polymer into food. This mass transfer (migration) for monomers, oligomers, catalysts, additives and <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS) is discussed within this study. Based on the data given in the scientific literature it could be concluded that overall migration tests as well as specific migration tests for monomers and catalysts, like ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, iso-phthalic acid and antimony are superfluous, because their migration limits cannot be exceeded, even if worst case conditions and swelling simulants like 95 % ethanol are applied. A more suitable procedure for evaluation of the food law compliance of PET is the determination of migration relevant substances in PET and calculation of their migration by use of migration models. In addition, the analytical screening for low molecular weight migrants (like NIAS) gives an additional safety factor, because such NIAS were not determined using the conventional migration testing procedures...|$|R
40|$|Background Over {{the last}} years the variety of food and {{beverage}} packaging has increased {{with the development of}} new plastic materials and (co) polymer modifications. Oligomers which are always present in polymers evoke attention as potential migrants, from a qualitatively and quantitatively viewpoint. Scope and approach This article deals with oligomers as potential migrants from plastics food contact materials and reviews their occurrence as well as analytical methods for their identification and quantification. Additionally a section about migration summarizes literature providing oligomer levels in food simulants and foods. Special attention was given to polycondensates since these represent a rapidly expanding polymer field due to increased numbers of (co) -monomers authorized by the EU. Key findings and conclusions Evaluating a polymer regarding the content and migration potential of its oligomers several factors like the separation of oligomers from the material, the choice of suitable separation and detection techniques for identification and quantification and the choice of an appropriate standard have to be considered. Generally, MS technologies coupled to liquid chromatography have been shown to represent the analytical approach of choice. This is, so far as the authors are aware of, the first review exclusively focusing on analytical methods for oligomers as polymer specific substances, which suggests to consider them as a separate polymer related and polymer type specific group besides the so-called <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS) ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in food contact materials research is {{to prove that the}} presence of <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS) is not a safety issue. Migration extracts may contain many unknown substances present at low concentrations. It is difficult and time-consuming to identify all these potential NIAS and concurrently to assess their health risk upon exposure, whereas the health relevance at low exposure levels might not even be an issue. This paper describes a scientifically based, but pragmatic safety assessment approach for unknown substances present at low exposure levels in food contact matrices. This complex mixture safety assessment strategy (CoMSAS) enables one to distinguish toxicologically relevant from toxicologically less relevant substances, when related to their respective levels of exposure, and allows one to focus on the substances of potential health concern. In particular, substances for which exposure will be below certain thresholds may be considered not of health relevance in case specific classes of substances are excluded. This can reduce the amount of work needed for identification, characterisation and evaluation of unknown substances at low concentration. The CoMSAS approach is presented in this paper using a safety assessment of unknown NIAS that may migrate from three carton samples. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

40|$|Food contact {{plastics}} {{are known}} to be a potential source of chemical contaminants in food. In order to ensure that the use of these plastics is safe, a thorough knowledge of their composition appears to be a crucial step, especially after the alarming emergence of <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS), in addition to intentionally added ones (IAS). Both IAS and NIAS may be transferred to food, leading to high exposure to certain chemicals which might cause health risks for humans. Inspired by untargeted approaches, extracting useful information from analytical fingerprints is becoming a key step in recent advancements in analytical chemistry. In addition, the fast analysis approach is very attractive for performing a large number of analyses in a short time, which we applied for the characterization of food contact plastics. This data mining is normally done by multivariate data analysis techniques in order to highlight hidden information from complex data matrices. In the present work, flow injection analysis coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (FIA/ESI-MS) was used in order to acquire compositional information about high and low density polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE) samples intended for food contact. Soxhlet extracts of PE samples (pellets, containers and films) were analyzed. Subsequently, positive and negative mass spectral fingerprints were organized in data matrices and treated using a relatively recent chemometric technique called “independent components analysis (ICA) ”. In a first step, mass spectral fingerprints were acquired using a Surveyor HPLC system coupled to a LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. ICA applied on mass spectral fingerprints of PE extracts highlighted group discrimination related to different m/z values which were putatively assigned to IAS but also to NIAS. In order to confirm the putative annotations of discriminating m/z values extracted by the different ICs, a hybrid LTQ-Orbitrap Fourier transform mass spectrometer (LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used with a mass resolving power of 60 000 FWHM (Full width at half maximum) at m/z 400. This mass spectrometer is characterized by a high mass resolving power and accurate mass measurements giving access to the elemental composition of the discriminating ions, allowing thus to validate their identifications. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first FIA untargeted methodology for a compositional evaluation of food contact plastics. The proposed approach benefits from the ability to perform fast analyses at high rate and high reproducibility. The combination between mass spectral fingerprints and ICA helps to overcome the complexity of such data giving the possibility to inspect, compare and control large number of plastic samples...|$|R
40|$|In this PhD thesis, {{analytical}} chemistry plays {{a significant role}} in the assessment of food quality and safety; in particular, three different topics have been addressed to and they are presented into three chapters in which different analytical methodologies have been developed, validated and applied successfully in different topics of food chemistry research. The first chapter is focused on an innovative analytical technique, capillary zone electrophoresis coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. This technique was exploited for the first time for the determination of two products of the Maillard reaction: N-ε-furoylmethyl-L-lysine (furosine) and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which are widely used as markers of food process as well as markers of the nutritional quality of food. The potentiality of this methodology has been investigated as it appears very interesting from different points of view: low consumption of solvents and sample, short time of analysis and high specificity due to mass spectrometry detection. The validated method for furosine analysis was applied to the study of furosine behavior against maltose:maltulose ratio, previously investigated and proposed as a marker of thermal treatment in flour-derived products and infant formulas. Object of the research was a model bread submitted to different cooking procedures by combining different times and temperatures and two different ovens (a low-emissivity oven a conventional one). Thermal treatment entity was expressed in terms of cook value index and other parameters such as colour, weight loss and surface temperature were investigated and correlated to each other. The concurrent evaluation of several markers could be considered as the best way for obtaining information retrospectively about the heat treatment applied during processing and also about the storage conditions of commercial food products. Moreover, the potentiality of capillary zone electrophoresis coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was also investigated for the detection and quantification of a neutral molecule, HMF, in different kind of food products. The topic of the second chapter is the study of different chili peppers varieties grown in the Parma district by Azienda Agraria Sperimentale Stuard, with the aim of the creation of a controlled food supply chain in northern Italy in order to reduce importation of chili pepper from oriental countries. 44 Capsicum genotypes (Capsicum annuum, Capsicum frutescens, Capsicum chinense) were characterized in terms of pungency through evaluation of the capsaicinoids profile by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode-array detector. Berries were also classified according to shape, dimension and colour. Thereafter, six genotypes were selected in order to achieve the ideal requirements for industrial purpose, and for the cultivation on a large scale. Besides, the evaluation of the changes occurring in terms of colour, furosine, capsaicinoids and carotenoids, during one year of shelf-life of the pepper powders was performed, with the aim of optimizing the powder characteristics and obtaining a stable product from a commercial point of view. The third chapter describes the exploitation of high resolution mass spectrometry in the field of food-contact materials. In particular, a new line of hybrid mass spectrometer, namely Q-Exactive, was employed, for the first time, for characterization of polycarbonate intended to come in contact with food. The safety of materials in contact with food must be evaluated as molecules could migrate from materials into food. The materials should be manufactured in compliance with EU regulation, which also require good manufacturing practices, so that any potential transfer to foods does not raise safety concerns, change the composition of the food in an unacceptable way or have adverse effects on the taste and odour of foods. This work has to be contextualized as a supporting job for food companies which have obtained declarations of conformity for plastic material involved in food processing but are not aware of its composition. Recently, polycarbonate has been taken into account from European Commission from safety point of view on the basis of recent scientific report about estrogenic activity of its monomer, bisphenol A. Another important point is the coloration of these plastics. No scientific data are reported about the organic colourants effectively used for the coloration of food-contact plastics. High-resolution mass spectrometry is decisive for the identification of unknown molecules like organic colourants, <b>non-intentionally</b> <b>added</b> <b>substances</b> (NIAS), degradation products and plastic additives. Moreover, until now, no methods employing high resolution mass spectrometry for the multitarget determination of the above cited substances have been developed...|$|R
