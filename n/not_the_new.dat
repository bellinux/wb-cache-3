25|$|Kentucky has a non-contiguous part {{known as}} Kentucky Bend, {{at the far}} west corner of the state. It exists as an exclave {{surrounded}} completely by Missouri and Tennessee, and {{is included in the}} boundaries of Fulton County. Road access to this small part of Kentucky on the Mississippi River (populated by only 18 people as of 2010) requires a trip through Tennessee. The epicenter of the powerful 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes was near this area, even causing the river to flow backwards in some places. Though the series of quakes did change the area geologically and affect the (small number of) inhabitants of the area at the time, the Kentucky Bend was formed because of a surveying error, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Madrid earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The Greater Toronto Area {{contains}} {{the second largest}} population of Indian descent in North America, enumerating 572,250 residents of Indian origin as of 2011, surpassed only by the 592,888 estimate by the 2011 American Community Survey (and 659,784 in 2013) for the New York City Combined Statistical Area. Note, however, that the Toronto count (but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York count) includes individuals of West Indian/Indo-Caribbean descent. Compared to the Vancouver area, Toronto's Indian community is much more linguistically and religiously diverse with large communities of Gujaratis, Malayalis, and Tamils, {{as well as more}} Indians who are Hindu, Sikh and Muslim than Vancouver. From Toronto, Indian air carrier Jet Airways offers daily flights to Delhi via Amsterdam, while Canadian carrier Air Canada operates non-stop flights to Delhi and Mumbai.|$|E

25|$|The {{executive}} offices of General Motors headquarters continued to clash with DeLorean's nonconformity, {{and he was}} still not able to fit the traditional mold of conservatism that was usually expected of someone of his stature. When John was appointed, Chevrolet was having financial and organizational troubles, and GM president Ed Cole needed a first-class manager in that position to sort things out – company man or <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> model Camaro was due out for the 1970 model year, and it was rapidly falling behind schedule. Redesigns for the Corvette and Nova were also delayed, and unit sales had still not recovered from the past four years of turmoil, much of that because of the bad publicity surrounding the Corvair and well-publicized quality-control issues affecting other Chevy models, including defective motor mounts that led to an unprecedented recall of 6.7 million Chevrolets built between 1965 and 1969. DeLorean responded to the production problems by delaying the release of the Camaro, and simplifying the modifications to the Corvette and Nova.|$|E

500|$|U2 is {{credited}} with composing the music for all of Achtung Babys tracks, despite periods of separated songwriting. They wrote the music primarily through jam sessions, a common practice for them. The album represents a deviation {{from the sound of}} their past work; the songs are less anthemic in nature, and their musical style demonstrates a more European aesthetic, introducing influences from alternative rock, industrial music, and electronic dance music. The band referred to the album's musical departure as [...] "the sound of four men chopping down The Joshua Tree". Accordingly, the distorted introduction to the opening track [...] "Zoo Station" [...] was intended to make listeners think the record was broken or was mistakenly <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> U2 album. Author Susan Fast said that with the group's use of technology in the song's opening, [...] "there can be no mistake that U2 has embraced sound resources new to them".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from its}} firepower, a battleship's {{defining}} feature is its armor. The exact design and {{placement of the}} armor, inextricably linked with the ship's stability and performance, is a complex science honed over decades. A battleship is usually armored to withstand an attack from guns {{the size of its}} own, but the armor scheme of the preceding [...] was only proof against [...] shells (which they had originally been intended to carry), while the [...] and [...] classes were designed only to resist their original complement of [...] Mark V [...] shells, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> [...] "super-heavy" [...] APC (Armor Piercing, Capped) Mark VIII shells they actually used. The Montanas were the only US battleships designed to resist the Mark VIII, and were designed to give a zone of immunity against fire from 16-inch/45-caliber firing 2,700lb (1,225kg) shell, between 18,000 and 31,000 yards (16,459 and 28,346 m) and 16-inch/45-caliber firing 2,240lb (1,016kg) shell, between 16,500 and 34,500 yards (15,087 and 31,546 m) away.|$|E
500|$|Morshead {{was one of}} only a few Allied divisional commanders with a {{distinct}} record of success {{at this stage of the}} war and had been acting commander of the British XXX Corps, a formation largely composed of Commonwealth troops, on two occasions. He had hopes that he might be given command of a corps, as Harry Chauvel had been in the Great War. Many war correspondents, including Gavin Long, thought that Morshead would be an excellent choice, but disagreements with Auchinleck had led to the latter labelling Morshead [...] "a difficult subordinate", who, while an excellent division commander, was not up to the demands of commanding a corps. Moreover, while Chauvel had been an Australian, he had been a regular officer, while Morshead was <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> commander of the British Eighth Army, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery felt that a reservist could not [...] "possess the requisite training and experience" [...] to command a corps. Morshead was passed over in favour of Oliver Leese, a British regular officer, who was junior to him and had never commanded a division in action.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{described}} {{the book as}} both convincing and <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> Yorker wrote that skeptical readers would find the book convincing. Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) thought the book would lead readers to ask why [...] "the principles of progressive education" [...] were not more accepted in England. Reisman (The Phi Delta Kappan) wrote that even the sections dedicated to the origins of neuroses were [...] "still noteworthy, challenging, and provocative". He wrote that the book's impact is in its [...] "realistic demonstration of how children can be helped to become happy people" [...] without guilt, hate, and fear. On the other hand, the Saturday Review doubted children wanted or benefitted from lack of adult authority. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) thought that the book, while stimulating, left questions as to its actual contribution past an [...] "experiment in applied psychoanalysis", with [...] "clinical procedure ... alternatively inspired, naive, and hair-raising". He called Neill [...] "an excellent devil's advocate for educators" [...] but unhelpful in resolving the ailments of mass education.|$|E
500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has {{always seemed to be}} so much out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should have no place in any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E
