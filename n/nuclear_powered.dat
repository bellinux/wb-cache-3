However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> of China's energy structure and industry system. Comparing with other renewable energy the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> chain has very low greenhouse gas emission, so it will play more important role in China's low-carbon economy. The paper also discussed the necessity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> development to achieve emission reduction, energy structure adjustment, <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> safety, environmental protection, enhancement of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> technology, <b>nuclear</b> waste treatment, and disposal, as well as <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant decommissioning. Based on the safety record and situation of the existing power plants in China, {{the current status of}} the development of world <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> technology, and the features of the independently designed advanced power plants in China, this paper aims to demonstrate the safety of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> A <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant will not cause harm either to the environment and nor to the public according to the real data of radioactivity release, which are obtained from an operational nuclear plant. The development of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> technology can enhance the safety of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> Further, this paper discusses issues related to the nuclear fuel cycle, the treatment, and disposal strategies of nuclear waste, and the decommissioning of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant, all of which are issues of public concern...|$|R

25|$|The Navy studied {{nuclear power}} as a design option for the CG(X), but has never {{announced}} whether it would prefer to build the CG(X) as a nuclear-powered ship - it would have added $600–800M to the initial cost of the ship, but save on running costs. Under normal budgeting practices, long lead-time items for nuclear propulsion would have needed to be procured in FY2009 if the main ship were to be procured in FY2011.

25|$|Deciding {{the future}} submarines' {{propulsion}} system is {{closely tied to}} determining its operational range, endurance and stealthiness. Two basic options are presented in submarine propulsion: nuclear propulsion, and conventional, diesel-electric propulsion. The option of nuclear propulsion effectively gives submarines an unlimited range and endurance, only restrained by maintenance and human crew requirements for resupply and rest, and removes the necessity for surfacing to recharge batteries, an unstealthy and risky process. Australian governments have repeatedly rejected the nuclear propulsion option {{due to the lack}} of an Australian nuclear power industry (Australia would be the only non-nuclear nation to operate nuclear submarines), related issues of operational sovereignty were Australia to operate an American <b>nuclear</b> <b>powered</b> submarine such as the Virginia class, rendering it dependent on American technical support, and public opposition to nuclear technology.|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyses}} Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses as necessitation by {{uncovering the}} strategies and arguments surrounding the <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion debate in 2004 - 2006. The study on Japanese case is contrasted with Finland as a representing case of European perspective of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in revival period from early to mid- 2000 s. Based on previous research {{the concept of}} necessitation is defined as 'reluctant acceptance' of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> People unwillingly accept <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as for the greater challenges such as climate change and energy security. In addition, necessitation is a forceful strategy of argumentation promoting <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as an energy source without alternatives. Regarding necessitation, this research addresses following themes: discourses and representations surrounding <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan 2004 - 2006, argumentation strategies to necessitate <b>nuclear</b> <b>power,</b> and major similarities and differences of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses between Japan and Finland. Qualitative content analysis {{is applied to the}} minutes of the meetings produced by responsible institutions in Japan. Following datasets are selected for the analysis: 1) the sectorial meetings for long-term nuclear energy policy under Japan Atomic Energy Commission in 2004 - 2005 and 2) the minutes documented in Nuclear Subcommittee under Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 2005 - 2006. In order to gain deeper understanding of the arguments, discourse analysis is also conducted upon the material. The research first discloses seven Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discourses based on the arguments - <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for: energy security, stable supply, cost-efficiency, environmental compatibility, <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> as a means of international contribution, new economic growth, and guaranteed nuclear safety. Representations of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are analysed within each discourse. The analysis also reveals the employed argumentation strategies to oblige <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> use and prioritised discourses. A comparison between Japanese and Finnish <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> discussions shows significant common discourses in energy security, stable supply, affordable electricity, and climate change mitigation. This comparison also shows distinctive Japanese discourses in international collaboration and national economic prosperity. Moreover, Japanese arguments over environmental and economic benefit of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> are by far more elaborate. The research reveals a wide range of social issues concerning the necessity of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> in Japan, whereas Europe concentrates on limited social issues of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power.</b> A detail picture of Japanese <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> shows extensive expectation of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> which are embedded in the society. This indicates that more convincing persuasion for <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> expansion is required in Japan. In both domestic and international level, Japan still has to dispel the suspicion of military use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> and diminish the concerns about nuclear safety. Moreover, Japan is in need of establishing additional social benefit of <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> for the acceptance of more economically, environmentally and technologically challenging nuclear fuel cycle...|$|R
