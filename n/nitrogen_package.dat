40|$|Pecan nuts {{might become}} {{contaminated}} with foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella and E. coli., through birds and other {{potential sources of}} contamination {{that can lead to}} serious illness or even death, as well as financial losses. For example, the outbreak of Salmonella in pecan products in Texas caused major product recalls in 2010. Irradiation with electron beams could be an effective method of preventing potential outbreaks without changing the pecans' taste, color and flavor and without causing any risk of recontamination before the product reaches the consumer. However, when irradiation is applied alone, the shelf life of the product is decelerated because of the detrimental effect of lipid oxidation. Therefore, to extend the shelf of the pecans while assuring their safety, irradiation of pecans under modified atmosphere packing (MAP) conditions could be a viable option. This research showed that when treated with electron beams, surrogates of Escherichia coli (a cocktail of BAA- 1427, BAA- 1428, and BAA- 1430), and Salmonella (S. Typhimurium LT 2) were more resistant to ionizing radiation (higher D 10 values) when packed under vacuum (VP) than under air or other MAP conditions. This research also showed that lipid oxidation in pecans (due to exposure to ionizing radiation) shows a lag phase, probably due to the antioxidants present in pecan nuts. The lag phase represents a delay period before the pecan nuts start to get rancid (increase in PV formation), and it is best described by a modified Gompertz model. Kinetic evaluation of the lipid oxidation reaction suggests that the dose level has a more drastic effect in PV formation than the type of package used during the irradiation treatment, e. g., vacuum packed versus nitrogen-packed. Moreover, accelerated shelf life studies (4 weeks at 48. 9 oC) showed that vacuum-packed (VP) pecans can be stored at - 25 degrees C up to three years, while irradiated (at 3. 0 kGy) VP pecans can be stored only for eight months, without the detrimental effects of lipid oxidation. Therefore, irradiation of pecans under air at 3. 0 kGy reduces the shelf life of the nuts in terms of rancidity, but vacuum-packaging can be used to extend their shelf-life. Irradiation in oxygen packaging increases rancidity and the oxidation reaction rate accelerates with increasing dose. Irradiation under <b>nitrogen</b> <b>packaging</b> requires lower doses to achieve the almost same number of log reductions in microbial population. The use of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>packaging</b> also inhibits the oxidative reaction leading to rancidity in pecans. Although there are some drawbacks to the application of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>packaging</b> in an irradiation plant (special machinery and packaging films (permeability specifications for N 2 gas)), the savings induced by avoiding recalls may make this technology worthy of consideration...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} the effects of an electron beam irradiation treatment with the Repetitive High Energy Pulsed Power (PHEPP) accelerator at Sandia National Laboratories. Test variables included irradiation/storage temperatures (30 or 0 °F), packaging environments (aerobic or nitrogen-flushed), and irradiation dose (0, 1. 5, or 3. 0 kGy). Ground beef patties formulated to a target fat level of 20 % were packaged in barrier film under nitrogen (ca = 400 ppm residual oxygen) or sealed in aerobic packages (no vacuum), stored, and irradiated chilled or frozen. Thiamin and riboflavin levels were not affected (P>. 05) by irradiation dose. Thiamin content of irradiated patties was greater for frozen vs. chilled and for nitrogenpackaged vs. aerobically packaged product. Riboflavin content was greater in frozen patties that were <b>nitrogen</b> <b>packaged.</b> Electron beam pasteurization by this method did not affect thiamin or riboflavin concentration of treated ground beef patties...|$|R

50|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> {{fixation}} <b>packages</b> {{must be used}} in a laboratory-type environment, {{which can}} {{take the form of a}} temporary laboratory set up in the field, as long as it is under stable, uncontaminated conditions. The product needs to be supplied with many potted samples of the plants and of the neighbouring soil, taken from separate areas on the farm or field under study. The tests rely on the availability of the Herbaspirillum bacteria in the soil. This bacterium is found at the root of most legumes, which is where they produce nitrogen. In order to test the soil properly, it must be free of added nitrogen fertilizers, which have harmful effects on the Herbaspirillum bacteria needed for fixation.|$|R

40|$|Nila {{is a kind}} of {{traditional}} fish usually used as foodstuff at Indonesian society especially at South Sumatera area. The objective of this research was to study the nitrogen gas application for nila chips packaging. Polypropilene plastic with thichness of 0. 6 mm was used as the packaging material, filled with nitrogen gas at full volume, sealed and stored under various times (O, 2 O, 40 and 60 days) and temperatures (30 and 40 centigrade). Control, without filling with nitrogen gas, was also performed to compare the result. The nila chips were analyzed for the moisture content, rancidity values, browning index and total microbes. The results showed that moisture content, peroxide value and browning index increased during storage, with linier correlation model. The total microbes were also increased of about one log cycle during 60 days of storage. <b>Nitrogen</b> gas <b>package</b> could be able to decrease deterioration of nila chips during storage at ambient temperature.

40|$|Pecorino Toscano is an ovine P. D. O cheese {{produced}} in soft and semihard varieties. In {{relation to the}} inconstant availability of the sheep milk during the different periods of the year, due to the largely seasonal nature of the sheep milk production, the supply of the soft variety, characterized by {{a short period of}} ripening, is not regular and sometimes not sufficient for the market, particularly in the summer months. For this reason it is interesting to carry out studies on storage practices, in order to maintain as long as possible the peculiar organoleptic characteristics of these type of cheese. In this work, some packaging practices useful to prolong the shelf life of the product, commonly employed (under vacuum and modified atmosphere packaging) were studied up to 90 days after the packaging of cheeses. Moreover the frozen storage of the cheese after the salting phase, followed by a delayed ripening period, was tested. The following microbiological and physico-chemical parameters were evaluated: total bacterial count, mesophilic and thermophilic lactic acid cocci, mesophilic and thermophilic lactobacilli, yeasts and moulds, Micrococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, enterococci; pH, aw, moisture, total nitrogen, pH 4. 6 -soluble <b>nitrogen.</b> The <b>packaging</b> procedures showed to influence the evolution of some of the examined microbiological and physico-chemical parameters but did not result able to maintain the shelf-life of the cheese up {{to the end of the}} trials. For the freeze-thawed cheeses the analyzed parameters revealed values similar to those of the control cheeses, thus indicating that further studies on longer times of frozen storage could be of interest...|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se o efeito das propriedades de barreira de materiais de embalagem e das condições do enchimento em equipamento {{flow pack}} {{vertical}} (com e sem injeção de nitrogênio), sobre a vida-útil de café torrado e moído. Avaliou-se três tipos de materiais de embalagem de estrutura composta de um laminado de poliéster metalizado (PETmet) e polietileno de baixa densidade linear (PEBDL) que diferiam na camada de metalização (TPO 2 de 0, 5; 2, 9 e 5, 5 cm³(CNTP) /m²/dia a 25 ºC, a seco e 1 atm). Após formação, enchimento e termossoldagem das embalagens, as amostras foram estocadas a 25 ± 2 ºC / 65 ± 3 %UR. Durante a estocagem observou-se redução na concentração de oxigênio residual do espaço-livre das embalagens devido ao consumo em reações de oxidação, o que causou alterações sensoriais no produto e limitou sua vida-útil. Os resultados obtidos sugerem vida-útil para o café de, no mínimo, 6 meses a 25 ºC/ 65 %UR em embalagens inertizadas (2 a 3 % de O 2 residual em um espaço-livre de, em média, 680 mL a 25 ºC e 0, 92 atm), enquanto no sistema sem injeção de nitrogênio a vida-útil foi de 3 meses. Também verificou-se que materiais de embalagem com taxas de permeabilidade ao oxigênio próximas aos dos materiais avaliados não diferem no nível de proteção oferecida a café torrado e moído até 6 meses de estocagem em embalagem inertizada. In this paper it was evaluated {{the effect of}} the barrier properties of packaging materials and filling conditions in vertical flow pack equipment (without and with nitrogen injection), on the shelf-life of roasted and ground coffee. Three types of packaging materials made by s laminate of metallized polyester (PETmet) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), that had a different metallization layer (OTR of 0. 5; 2. 9 and 5. 5 cm³(STP) /m²/day at 25 ºC, 1 atm in dry conditions) were evaluated. After formation, filling and heatsealing of the packages, the samples were stored at 25 ± 2 ºC/ 65 ± 3 %RH. A decrease of the residual oxygen concentration of the headspace was observed during the storage, probably caused by consumption of that gas in oxidation reactions. It caused sensorial changes in the product and limited its shelf-life. The results indicated that the shelf-life to the coffee was at least 6 months at 25 ºC/ 65 %RH in <b>nitrogen</b> gas flushing <b>packages</b> (2 to 3 % of residual oxygen in a headspace average of 680 mL at 25 ºC and 0. 92 atm), while in the system without nitrogen injection the shelf-life was 3 months.

Among these products, watercress represents an interesting alternative due to its high content of functional compounds. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of non-conventional modified atmosphere <b>packaging</b> (<b>nitrogen</b> (89. 7 % N 2, 10. 3 % O 2), argon (89. 9 % Ar, 10. 1 % O 2), helium (90. 1 % He, 9. 9 % O 2), nitric dioxide (89. 3 % N 2 O, 10. 7 % O 2) and air (0. 03 % CO 2, 21 % O 2)) on fresh-cut watercress leaves preserved for 13 days at 5 ◦C. The respiratory rate was reduced by the non-conventional atmosphere up to 3 days of storage, and no significant effects were observed on C 2 H 4 production. In addition, mesophilic microbial growth was reduced up to 3 days of storage, and no effect was observed on psychrotrophic and Enterobactericeae counts. He and N 2 O atmospheres increased the antioxidant activity of watercress at the end of the storage period. Nevertheless, there was no clear effect of non-conventional gases on the color parameters, polyphenol contents and sensory parameters of fresh-cut watercress.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityMango (Mangifera indica L.) {{is one of}} {{the finest}} {{tropical}} fruits in the world with about 75 % of the world production coming from Asia. In the Philippines, mango ranks third among fruit crops after banana and pineapple based on export volume and value. Acclaimed {{to be one of the}} best worldwide, this fruit has established a good reputation in the international market. However, huge postharvest losses ranging from 5 - 87 % have been reported due mainly to inadequate preservation technologies, and improper handling and storage. In this research, a more stable product such as mango powder was investigated using a novel drying technology called Refractance Window® drying (RW), and three other commonly used drying methods, namely: freeze drying (FD), drum drying (DD) and spray drying (SD). The influence of these four drying methods on the physical properties and microstructures of mango powder was studied. RW drying can produce mango powder with quality that is comparable to freeze drying, and better than the drum and spray-dried mango powders. Water sorption characteristics and glass transition temperatures of mango powder was examined to understand water mobility within the mango solids. Physical and chemical stability of mango powder were analyzed during storage at different temperatures and by subjecting them to different <b>packaging</b> atmospheres. <b>Nitrogen</b> flush <b>packaging</b> was effective in preserving the ascorbic acid (AA) in mango powder at room temperature and under refrigerated conditions, while reduced percentage loss of beta carotene was observed after 6 months of storage. Regardless of packaging atmosphere, mango powder stored at 45 °C suffered discoloration as well as AA and beta carotene degradation over a period of 6 and 12 months. Mango powder has high concentration of low molecular weight sugars which causes the product to become sticky when exposed to high temperatures and humid conditions. To avoid occurrence of this phenomenon, several sticky-point temperature measuring devices were explored in the past, but there is still a need for further development. A new method to characterize the sticky phenomena in mango powder was investigated using an advanced rheometer. The developed method and protocol was found suitable to characterize the sticky point temperature of mango powder with high degree of repeatability and accuracy.

40|$|Soybeans {{were chosen}} for lunar and {{planetary}} missions, where soybeans will be supplied in bulk or grown locally, due to their nutritive value and ability to produce oil and protein for further food applications. However, soybeans must be processed into foods prior to consumption. Radiation that soybeans would be exposed to during bulk storage prior to and during a Mars mission may influence their germination and functional properties. The influence of radiation includes the affect of surface pasteurization to ensure the astronauts safety from food-borne illnesses (HACCP, CCP), and the affect {{of the amount of}} radiation the soybeans receive during a Mars mission. Decreases in the amount of natural antioxidants free radical formation, and oxidation-induced changes in the soybean will influence the nutritional value, texture, color, and aroma of soyfoods. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of pasteurization and sterilization surface radiation on whole soybeans using gamma and electron beam radiation. The influence of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 30 kGy on microbial load, germination rate, ease of processing, and quality of soymilk and tofu were determined. Surface radiation of whole dry soybeans using electron beam or gamma rays from 1 - 30 kGy did provide microbial safety for the astronauts. However, the lower dose levels had surviving yeasts and molds. These doses caused oxidative changes that resulted in soymilk and tofu with rancid aromas. GC-MS of the aroma compounds using SPME Headspace confirmed the presence of lipid oxidation compounds. Soybean germination ability was reduced as radiation dosage increased. While lower doses may reduce these problems, the ability to insure microbial safety of bulk soybeans will be lost. Counter measures could include vacuum <b>packaging,</b> <b>nitrogen</b> flushing, added antioxidants, and radiating under freezing conditions. Doses below 1 kGy need to be investigated further to determine the influence of the radiation encountered during Mars missions...|$|R
