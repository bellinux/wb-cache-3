40|$|Rhizome explants {{of three}} {{temperate}} terrestrial Cymbidium species, C. sinense, C. ensifolium and C. kanran, produced protocorm-like-bodies (PLBs) {{by the addition}} of 10 mgl^{- 1 } 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA). PLB explants of Cymbidium Melody Fair ‘Marilyn Monroe’, a hybrid of tropical species, induced rhizomes under shaded and continuous dark conditions, and the conversion was promoted by the supplement of 0. 1 and 1 mgl^{- 1 } a-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA). The structure of the induced PLBs and rhizomes was very {{similar to that of the}} true PLBs and rhizomes, respectively, except for <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism</b> and less starch accumulation in the induced rhizomes. These results indicate that the interconversion between rhizome and PLB is possible in Cymbidium species and this organogenesis may be regulated by auxins and cytokinins...|$|E
40|$|The auxin {{transport}} inhibitor methyl- 2 -chloro- 9 -hydroxyfluorene- 9 -carboxylate (CFM), a morphactin, inhibits <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism,</b> causes cellular swelling, and induces {{root hair}} formation in roots of intact Pisum sativum L. seedlings. In excised pea root tips, CFM inhibits elongation more than increase in fresh weight (swell ratio = 1. 3 at 20 μm CFM). CFM growth inhibition was {{expressed in the}} presence of ethylene. Indoleacetic acid (IAA) prevented the expression of CFM growth inhibition possibly because IAA inhibited the accumulation of CFM into the tissue sections. CFM inhibited the accumulation of IAA and 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid into excised root tips. Applying Leopold's (1963. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 16 : 218 - 234) model for polar auxin transport, this result suggests a possible explanation for CFM inhibition of geotropism in pea roots, i. e. disruption of auxin transport by interfering with auxin binding...|$|E
40|$|Rhizophora mangle L., one of {{the most}} common {{mangrove}} species, has an aerial structure system that gives it stability in permanently swampy soils. In fact, these structures, known as "aerial roots" or "stilt roots", have proven to be peculiar branches with positive geotropism, which form a large number of roots when in contact with swampy soils. These organs have a sympodial branching system, wide pith, slightly thickened cortex, collateral vascular bundles, polyarch stele and endarch protoxylem, as in the stem, and a periderm produced by a phellogen at the apex similar to a root cap. They also have the same type of trichosclereid that occurs in the stem, with <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism,</b> unlike true Rhizophora roots, which do not form trichosclereids at all. On the other hand, these branches do not form leaves and in this respect they are similar to roots. These peculiar branches are rhizophores or special root-bearing branches, analogous to those found in Lepidodendrales and other Carboniferous tree ferns that grew in swampy soils...|$|E
30|$|Obviously, with seed germination, {{growth of}} a plant begins. The first root, called the radicle, will grow out of the seed through the {{micropyle}}, and the micropyle {{is part of the}} seed where water imbibes into the seed and enhances germination. Naturally, the shoot of the germinating seed has a <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism,</b> and the radicle has a positive geotropism. In managing seed sowing processes, the orientation of micropyle is related with supporting the upcoming response of the seedling to the stimulus (gravity). The downward curvature of the root tipped toward the center of gravity is influenced by biochemical and environmental factors and is considered as an essential characteristic for plant survival (He and South 2006). According to Coutts (1989), if the root is displaced from its vertical position or the seeds oriented vertically upward with respect to micropyle, the tip of the root bends downward. Similarly, the roots of the seed sown by positioning the micropyle vertically upright have to curve over the seed itself in order to grow in their normal (downward) direction (Fig.  1).|$|E
40|$|Vast miumbers of {{plankton}} {{organisms are}} known to rise toward {{the surface of the}} water at night and sink downward during the day. This vertical migration was first studied by the great oceanic expeditions of the last century, particularly that of the â€œ¿Challenger â€œ¿in 1872 (Murray and Hjort, 1912). The first laboratory investigations were those of Groom and Loeb (1890) and Parker (1902). The earlier work has l) een extensively reviewed by Russell (1927) amid Kikuchi (1930). It was soon apparent that light was the main environmental factor involved, but niany diverse conclusions were made as to its niode of action. These may be suniniarized as follows: (1) Phototrop-is;,z overcoming geotropism. â€”Parker (1902) fouiid that Labidocera aestiva rose at night because of its <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism,</b> but sank during the day because this was overcome by its negative phototropism. (2) Light changing the sign of geotropism. â€”Cyciops albidus was found to be geopositive in the light and geonegative in the dark (Esterly, 1907). Field observations on Cyclops by Worthington (1931) and Southern and Gardiner (1932) support this view...|$|E
40|$|Brazilians {{have been}} using the {{underground}} organs of Smilax species in alternative medicine since the 19 th century because of their anti-rheumatic qualities. However, even nowadays, these species are explored only by extractivism. Studies on seed germination and development of these organs could be useful to preserve these plants. After germination, seedling development of Smilax polyantha was analyzed to understand underground stem formation. Furthermore, to analyze the ontogenesis of the underground system, seedlings aged from one to twelve months were sectioned. One {{of the most striking}} features of this species is the presence of two stem branching systems. The plumule gives rise to the first stem branching system with <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism.</b> Its first underground axillary bud sprouted into the other caulinar axis with positive geotropism. The horizontal growth and the subsequent thickening of this underground organ depended on the development of axillary buds from basal nodes of the previous branches. The cotyledonary bud did not {{play a role in the}} underground formation, as previously described in the literature for this genus, but the buds of the basal cataphylls built the second stem branching system. In this study we discuss the terminology and suggest calling this second stem branching system a rhizophore...|$|E
40|$|The eggs of both Simulium nigritarse and S. adersi took up to 13 days {{to hatch}} in water at a {{temperature}} of 25 °C. The larvae of S. nigritarse required a minimum of 20 days and those of S. adersi a minimum of 17 days to pupate when reared in water at 20 ± 1 °C. No difference between the sexes was observed in the time taken by the larvae of either species to complete their life cycle. The duration of the pupal stage of S. nigritarse ranged from a minimum of 47 hours at 25 °C {{to a maximum of}} 569 hours (23, 7 days) at 6 °C. An ambient temperature of 30 ± 1 °C was lethal for both the larvae and the pupae of S. nigritarse. Eclosion of S. nigritarse reaches a peak after sunrise, then the rate declines towards sunset. A mean of 76 % of the flies were found to hatch during the day. The time of eclosion of both males and females was similar. Pupation of S. nigritarse could take place at a water-depth of 2 m and was common at a depth of 1, 1 m. In still water no <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism</b> could be detected in the behaviour of S. nigritarse larvae and they were positively phototropic. In agitated water larvae did not respond to a light gradient ranging from 5 to 1100 lux. Adult larvae became negatively phototropic before the onset of pupation, which took place in dark, fast-flowing water. S. nigritarse can overwinter in both the larval and the pupal stages.

40|$|As plantas do gênero Cordyline possuem estruturas caulinares peculiares geralmente chamadas de rizoma. Um autor do início do século XX sugeriu que havia uma relação entre esse órgão de Cordyline e o órgão formador de raiz de Selaginella. O termo rizóforo foi originalmente cunhado para Selaginella e significa ó̈rgão portador de raízesë também passou a ser aplicado aos órgãos caulinares subterrâneos de Vernonia, Dioscorea e Smilax e ao que tradicionalmente era chamado de raiz aérea em Rhizophora mangle. Recentemente admitiu-se que as estruturas de Cordyline fruticosa são rízóforos, mas nenhum estudo de desenvolvimento foi apresentado a fim de confirmar tal hipótese. Rizóforo é um caule com geotropismo positivo não originário da plúmula do embrião, presente em plantas com sistema caulinar bipolar de ramificação, isto é, a planta possui ramos aéreos, as quais tem geotropismo negativo e formam folhas, e ramos basais, os quais tem geotropismo positivo e formam raízes. Em Cordyline, os rizóforos se desenvolvem a partir de gemas laterais e possuem crescimento secundário do mesmo modo que o eixo aéreo. O espessamento do caule de Cordyline já foi amplamente analisado em sua porção aérea, mas trabalhos a respeito da porção caulinar subterrânea são mais escassos. Esse espessamento é resultado direto e indireto da atuação do periciclo. No corpo primário, o periciclo produz tecido {{vascular}} adicional aumentando o diâmetro do caule concomitante com a atividade meristemática da endoderme. O periciclo ainda é o responsável pela formação do MES, o qual proporciona o espessamento secundário e atua de maneira semelhante na porção aérea e no rizóforo, com pequena variação. A vascularização das raízes adventícias conecta-se à vascularização do caule pelo periciclo durante o crescimento primário e pelo MES durante o crescimento secundário. As características morfológicas e anatômicas do rizóforo estão diretamente relacionadas com uma maior produção de raízes, assim, sua principal função é o aumento da rizosfera. Outras funções importantes dessa estrutura é o acúmulo de reservas e a reprodução vegetativa. O presente estudo averiguou a natureza dos órgãos subterrâneos de Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis e C, spectabilis, através de estudos anatômicos e observações do desenvolvimento ontogenético. Plants of {{the genus}} Cordyline possess distinctive caulinar structures usually known as rhizomes. An author from {{the early twentieth century}} suggested that there was a relationship between this organ in Cordyline and the root-generating organ in Selaginella. The term rhizophore - meaning r̈oot-bearing organ-̈ was coined originally for Selaginella and was later applied to the subterranean stem organs of Vernonia, Dioscorea and Smilax and to the structures traditionally known as aerial roots in Rhizophora mangle. Recently, these structures in Cordyline fruticosa have been categorized as rhizophores, but this hypothesis has not previously been confirmed by any published developmental study. A rhizophore is a stem with positive geotropism which does not arise from the plumule of the embryo, and is present in plants with a stem system having bipolar branching, i. e. with aerial branches, which have <b>negative</b> <b>geotropism</b> and form leaves, and basal branches, which have positive geotropism and form roots. The rhizophores of Cordyline develop from lateral buds and have secondary growth of the same type as in the aerial axis. The stem thickening of Cordyline has already been extensively studied in its aerial parts, but there are few such studies regarding the subterranean part of the stem. This thickening is the direct and indirect result of the activity of the pericycle. In the primary body, the pericycle produces additional vascular tissue, which increases the diameter of the stem concomitant with the meristematic activity of the endodermis. The pericycle is also responsible for the generation of the STM, which provides the secondary thickening and functions in a similar way in the aerial stem and the rhizophore, with little variation. The adventitious roots vascular tissue are connected to the vascular system of the stem by the pericycle during primary growth and by the STM during secondary growth. The morphological and anatomical features of the rhizophore are directly related to an increased production of roots, and thus its main function is the rhizosphere expansion. Beside that, the rhizophore is important as a storage organ and vegetative reproduction. The present study investigated the structure of the subterranean organs of Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis and C. spectabilis by anatomical techniques and observations of their ontogenetic development...|$|E
