5000|$|API {{documentation}} {{describes what}} services an API offers {{and how to}} use those services, aiming to cover everything a client would need to know to use the API.Documentation is crucial for the development and maintenance of applications that use the API.API documentation is traditionally found in documentation files, but can also be found in social media such as blogs, forums, and Q&A websites.Traditional documentation files are often presented via a documentation system, such as Javadoc or Pydoc, that has a consistent appearance and structure.However, the types of content included in the documentation differs from API to API.To facilitate understanding, API documentation can include description of classes and methods in the API as well as [...] "typical usage scenarios, code snippets, design rationales, performance discussions, and contracts", but implementation details of the API services themselves are usually omitted. Restrictions and limitations on how the API can be used are also covered by the documentation. For example, documentation for an API function could note that its parameters cannot be null, or that the function itself is <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> safe.Because API documentation is so comprehensive, it can be difficult for the writers to keep the documentation updated and for the users to read it carefully, potentially resulting in bugs.|$|E

In contrast, at the equivalent position in hFAN 1, the hole is much smaller and unlikely to allow ssDNA passage (Fig.  2 B). Thus, our structure supports the notion that hFAN 1 is unlikely to sequester 5 ′ flap DNA via a threading mechanism.|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} work on {{epitaxial}} Ge films grown on a thin buffer layer of C doped Ge (Ge:C). The {{growth rate of}} Ge:C is found to slow over time and is thus unsuitable for thick (> 20 nm) layers. We demonstrate Ge films from 10 nm to > 150 nm are possible by growing pure Ge on a thin Ge:C buffer. It is shown that this stack yields exceedingly low roughness levels (comparable to bulk Si wafers) and contains fewer defects and higher Hall mobility compared to traditional heteroepitaxial Ge. The addition of C at the interface helps reduce strain by its smaller atomic radius {{and its ability to}} pin defects within the thin buffer layer that do <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> to the top Ge layer. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of balance. Man {{and society in}} late medieval humoral theories. Medieval humoral theories reflected a view on both man and society. The theories clearly defined the worst and the best physical balance possible, and these ideas could be linked to judgments on society. The popular theory of temperaments envisaged the sanguine man as the perfect human being. He was a merry, wealthy, courteous nobleman; a powerful secular ideal. Learned medicine used a humoral theory in which health was described as the right proportion between the different quantities. In the fit body, every humour knew its correct place, and would <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> beyond its proper measure. This notion was used to define the body politic: the humours of the healthy state accepted their position without ambitious quarrelling. These views on man and his body differ from the ones defined by Galen in his influential tract De complexionibus, which make them even more telling. In addition {{to an analysis of}} Galen's tract, this article describes the most important developments of humoral theory from Antiquity to the Middle Ages...|$|E

40|$|Performance is {{traditionally}} {{considered one of}} the most significant concerns in intensive database applications. Several architectural tactics may be taken to minimize the possibility of coming across with any performance bottleneck. One of them is the usage of Call Level Interfaces (CLI). CLI are low level API that provide a high performance environment to execute SQL statements on relational and also on some NoSQL database servers. In spite of this, CLI are <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> safe, this way preventing distinct threads from sharing datasets retrieved from databases through Select statements. Thus, in situations where two or more threads need to access datasets retrieved from the same Select statement, there is no other alternative than providing each thread with its own dataset, this way consuming important computational resources. In this paper we propose a new design for CLI to overcome the aforementioned drawback. Unlike current implementations of CLI, now they are natively thread-safe. The implementation herein presented is based on a thread safe updatable local memory structure where data retrieved from databases is kept. A proof of concept based on Java Database Connectivity type 4 (JDBC) for SQL Server 2008 is presented and also a performance assessment...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion {{complexes}} between cyclodextrins and polymers—so-called pseudopolyrotaxanes (PPR) —are at {{the origin}} of fascinating supramolecular structures, which are finding increasing uses in biomedical and technological fields. Here we explore the impact of both native {{and a range of}} modified cyclodextrins (CD) on the self-assembly of X-shaped poly(ethylene oxide) –poly(propylene oxide) block copolymers, so-called Tetronics or poloxamines, by focusing on Tetronic 904 (T 904, Mw 6700). The effects are markedly dependent on the type and arrangement of the substituents on the macrocycle. While native CDs drive the formation of a solid PPR, most substituted CDs induce micellar breakup, with dimethylated β-CD (DIMEB) having the strongest impact and randomly substituted CDs a much weaker disruptive effect. Using native α-CD as a “molecular trap”, we perform competitive binding experiments—where two types of CDs thread together onto the polymer chains—to establish that DIMEB indeed has the highest propensity to form an inclusion complex with the polymer, while hydroxypropylated CDs do <b>not</b> <b>thread.</b> 1 D 1 H NMR and ROESY experiments confirm the formation of a soluble PPR with DIMEB in which the CD binds preferentially to the PO units, thus providing the drive for the observed demicellization. A combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to extract detailed structural parameters on the micelles. A binding model is proposed, which exploits the chemical shifts of selected protons from the CD in conjunction with the Hill equation, to prove that the formation of the PPR is a negatively cooperative process, in which threaded DIMEBs hamper the entrance of subsequent macrocycles...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the abiotic {{environment}} on byssus tenacity and associated features was investigated for Mytilus galloprovincialis in the Ría de Vigo (NW Spain). The effect of site was examined at macro-geographical (outer exposed Cabo Estay vs. inner sheltered San Simón Ensenada sites) and micro-geographical (intertidal vs. subtidal locations) scales. Site significantly influenced byssus tenacity, shape and byssus thread diameter, whereas location did not. Qualitative analysis of the byssus corroborated the importance of site; mussels inhabiting the rougher outer Ría secreted stronger and stiffer threads regardless of location and had a higher potential to form cross-links or metal chelation in the byssal collagen to gain structural integrity when needed. When mussels were transplanted between exposed and sheltered sites, asymmetrical changes were observed in tenacity, endogenous indices, byssus morphology and mechanical properties after 3 mo. Individuals transferred from the sheltered to the exposed site shifted all variables, suggesting that mussels have a plastic response to rougher environments by increasing byssus size and mechanical integrity. In contrast, mussels transplanted from the exposed to the sheltered site shifted tenacity, endogenous indices and thread length but <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> diameter nor mechanical properties. In summary, we report the highly dynamic nature of the mussel ability to modify byssus tenacity when subjected to abrupt environmental changes. Mussels {{have the potential to}} change byssus diameter and mechanical properties to increase strength in stressful abiotic conditions, and can re-allocate energy for vital structures such as gonadal and soft tissue growth in more benign environmentsThis study was partly funded by “National Science Foundation EF 1041213 to E. 600 Carrington.

40|$|Greater {{understanding}} {{and acceptance of}} the new concept "bone quality", which was proposed by the National Institutes of Health {{and is based on}} bone cells and collagen fibers, are required. The novel protein Semaphorin 3 A (Sema 3 A) is associated with osteoprotection by regulating bone cells. The aims of this study were to investigate the effects of mechanical loads on Sema 3 A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers around implants in rat maxillae. Grade IV-titanium threaded implants were placed at 4 weeks post-extraction in maxillary first molars. Implants received mechanical loads (10 N, 3 Hz for 1800 cycles, 2 days/week) for 5 weeks from 3 weeks post-implant placement to minimize the effects of wound healing processes by implant placement. Bone structures, bone mineral density (BMD), Sema 3 A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers were analyzed using microcomputed tomography, histomorphometry, immunohistomorphometry, polarized light microscopy and birefringence measurement system inside of the first and second thread (designated as thread A and B, respectively), as mechanical stresses are concentrated and differently distributed on the first two threads from the implant neck. Mechanical load significantly increased BMD, but not bone volume around implants. Inside thread B, but <b>not</b> <b>thread</b> A, mechanical load significantly accelerated Sema 3 A production with increased number of osteoblasts and osteocytes, and enhanced production of both type I and III collagen. Moreover, mechanical load also significantly induced preferential alignment of collagen fibers in the lower flank of thread B. These data demonstrate that mechanical load has different effects on Sema 3 A production and bone quality based on bone cells and collagen fibers between the inside threads of A and B. Mechanical load-induced Sema 3 A production may be differentially regulated by the type of bone structure or distinct stress distribution, resulting in control of bone quality around implants in jaw bones...|$|E
