The EMCs of PF-bonded boards were approximately 1 % {{higher than those of}} IC-bonded boards because of the notice able difference in EMCs between the binders.

We found that the wetting capillary pressure curve, relevant for many building physics problems of hygroscopic capillary active materials, is preferentially described by bimodal functions or unimodal functions with sufficient flexibility towards the hygroscopic zone.

Accurate prediction of swelling behaviour allows us to design more efficiently and with better reliability. This research aims at developing a more comprehensive framework to predict swell potential. Laboratory studies are conducted on five natural expansive soils with different degree of expansiveness. Initial studies include determination of basic soil characterization, swell strains and swell pressures at their compacted state along with their inherent mineralogy. Later, replicate samples were studied for soil water characteristic curves using standard pressure cell apparatus and filter paper techniques. The path traversed by the specimen during swelling process is representative of the soil water characteristic curve of the same specimen. Hence, studies are pursued to understand the relationship between degree of expansiveness and the specific <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity</b> relative to that particular range of suction head.

Some of the different methods were illustrated by using measurements on cellular concrete.

The {{moisture absorption}} rate(Va),the moisture conductivity(λ'),and the moisture content profile of each board type were calculated and compared. LDPB was more hygroscopic than WLB in that its Va was calculated to be 1. 9 times larger, its λ′ 4. 3 times greater, and its d_ 95 (the depth from the board surface which accounts for 95 % of the moisture absorbed) 1. 6 times larger. These values help explain the superior performance of the LDPB over the WLB for humidity control as described in the first paper of this series. These differences suggest that the vapor diffusion paths are larger and more continuous in LDPB than those in WLB. A reduction in density from 820 kg/㎥ to 540 kg/㎥ increased Va 1. 7 times, λ′ 4. 7 times, and d_ 95 2. 1 times.

The MMP- 9 levels in the cortex, BBB permeability, cerebral <b>moisture</b> <b>capacity</b> and expression of AQP- 4 and MMP- 9 in the HI group were significantly higher compared with those in the sham surgery group (P< 0. 01), and they were significantly lower in the drug prophylaxis group compared with those in the HI group (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{sorption}} isotherm {{is one of}} {{the most}} important hygric properties for modeling moisture transport in hygroscopic materials. For wood and wood based materials, the equilibrium moisture content within hygroscopic range is a function of temperature and relative humidity as well as its sorption history. The constitutive equations of the existing models in literature, which attempted to take into account temperature dependent sorption hysteresis, are either incomplete or have too many model parameters needed to be experimentally determined. As a result they are not suitable for practical applications in building physics. Therefore, a coupled heat and moisture transport model is formulated based on the classical local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption.
