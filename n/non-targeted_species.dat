2500|$|Prior to {{the initial}} efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's {{offshore}} islands {{there was a great}} deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the animal rights movement, which contends that the welfare of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species</b> that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and sterilization be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective see Kangaroo Island koalas.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well. [...] Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of hedgehog removal in the Outer Hebrides offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of Eucalyptus trees from Angel Island in San Francisco Bay faced considerable opposition.|$|E

40|$|The {{most obvious}} effect of fishing on <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> is direct mortality. To {{quantify}} this {{effect on the}} vulnerability of species requires measurement of the current fishing mortality rate and of the tolerance of the species to fishing mortality. These are difficult to estimate for the little-studied <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> We describe two potential methods for estimating current fishing mortality rate when data are limited. Their application is illustrated for dab (Limanda limanda) and grey gurnard (Eutrigula gurnardus), two common <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> in the North Sea. We also develop approaches to define tolerance levels for fishing mortality for little-studied and rare species, based on the potential jeopardy level: the fishing mortality that causes a reduction in spawning stock biomass per recruit relative to the unexploited situation. We propose that for <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> models founded on basic knowledge of life history parameters, and on generally established relationships between these parameters, may offer the only practical approach...|$|R

50|$|Studies of {{long-term}} {{effects on the}} marine environment have not been carried out, including damage to <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Results of the devices are mixed, and they have proved ineffective in some circumstances, especially over the long term, while design improvements such as electric fences to keep seals from climbing into enclosures, gear modification to exclude certain species, and keeping aquaculture plants clean of dead fish have often been effective at solving the problem of keeping predatory species away.

40|$|Demersal {{fisheries}} targeting a few high-value species often {{catch and}} discard other “non-target” species. It {{is difficult to}} quantify {{the impact of this}} incidental mortality when population biomass of a <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> is unknown. We calculate biomass for 14 demersal fish species in ICES Area VIIg (Celtic Sea) by applying species- and length-based catchability corrections to catch records from the Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS). We then combine these biomass estimates with records of commercial discards (and landings for marketable <b>non-target</b> <b>species)</b> to calculate annual harvesting rates (HR) for each study species. Uncertainty is incorporated into estimates of both biomass and HR. Our survey-based HR estimates for cod and whiting compared well with HR-converted fishing mortality (F) estimates from analytical assessments for these two stocks. Of the <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> tested, red gurnard (Chelidonichthys cuculus) recorded some annual HRs greater than those for cod or whiting; challenging “Pope's postulate” that F on non-target stocks in an assemblage will not exceed that on target stocks. We relate HR for each species to two corresponding maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference levels; six <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> (including three ray species) show annual HRs ≥ HRMSY. This result suggests that it may not be possible to conserve vulnerable <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> when F is coupled to that of target species. Based on biomass, HR, and HRMSY, we estimate “total allowable catch” for each <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> This is a pre-copy-editing, author-produced PDF of an article accepted for publication in ICES Journal of Marine Science following peer review.

[...] For the management of some invasive plants, or in some cases when dealing with garlic mustard, herbicide application and human-managed labor such as mowing, tilling, burning, and pulling may be preferred for managing unwanted vegetation on land that is highly-disturbed by human activity, such as agricultural land.

One species of weevil that targets garlic mustard, for instance, consumes the seeds. Unlike with some invasive plants which are annuals, such as Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), the mowing of garlic mustard is less effective because it will regrow from its tap root, especially if it is mowed in its second, flowering, year — where the root has grown enough to store considerable energy.|$|E

Assessment of its conservation status is difficult as few fisheries separate the great hammerhead from other hammerheads in their reported catches. This species is listed as globally Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is Endangered in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, where {{though it is a}} <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species,</b> populations have dropped 50% since the 1990s due to bycatch. It is also Endangered in the southwestern Indian Ocean, where large numbers of longline vessels operate illegally along the coasts for hammerheads and the giant guitarfish (Rhynchobatus djiddensis). The great hammerhead catch rate in Indian Ocean has declined 73% from 1978 to 2003, though it is yet undetermined whether these represent localized or widespread depletion. The great hammerhead is Critically Endangered along the western coast of Africa, where stocks have collapsed with an estimated 80% decline in the past 25 years. The West African Sub-Regional Fishing Commission (SRFC) has recognized the great hammerhead as one of the four most threatened species in the region, though fishing continues unmonitored and unregulated. Off northern Australia, this species was assessed as Data Deficient but at [...] "high risk". Concern has arisen there over a substantial increase in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, reflecting the raising value of this shark's fins.|$|E

40|$|Many {{fisheries}} {{around the}} world are plagued with the problem of bycatch [...] the inadvertent harvesting and discard of <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Bycatch occurs when targeted and <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species</b> coincide in the same habitat and gear is imperfectly selective. One of the prevailing methods of controlling bycatch is the common-pool quota system. Under this system, biologists set total allowable catches (TACs) for both the targeted and <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species,</b> and the fishing season is closed when one of these TACs binds. We develop a predictive model of a renewable resource that is regulated with this kind of common-pool quota system. The model demonstrates that the equilibrium will generally be characterized by excessive discards, shortened seasons, and foregone target species harvest. These results occur even with very efficient (low bycatch) fishing gear. We examine the sensitivity of our predictions to changes in technological parameters and degrees of spatial correlation of target and non-target species. Finally, we derive the optimal bycatch penalty function and describe its significance in light of various policy options available to regulators.

40|$|Detection of <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> during {{distribution}} surveys {{may influence}} the detection of the focal species, due to bait being consumed, or trapping devices inactivated. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> (field mice, Apodemus sp.) on the detection and occupancy estimates of a target species (the red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris) during hair-tubes surveys. Following a modelling approach that accounted for imperfect detection of both target and <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> we tested the hypothesis that detection probability of the red squirrel is affected by detection of field mice. We also investigated the level of bias that occurred in estimation of key-parameters such as probability of presence and detection probability. Our results show that detection of red squirrels and field mice using hair-tubes surveys is not independent. Detection probability of the red squirrel was higher when field mice did not visit the hair-tubes.

The proportions of samples that were seropositive to RHDV were 38 % for cats, 18 % for stoats, 25 % for ferrets and 4 % for hedgehogs.
