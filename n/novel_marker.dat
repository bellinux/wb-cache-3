Mice lacking this serotonin receptor 1d, displayed lower monosynaptic reflex (a reflex arc involving only a sensory and motor neuron), which may be caused by a reduced response to sensory stimulation in motor neurons. In addition, knockout mice without this serotonin receptor exhibited more coordination on a balance beam task, suggesting that less activation of motor neurons by Ia afferents during movement could reduce the unnecessary excess of muscle output.|$|E
50|$|Although {{mutations}} in single genes were not individually predictive, TNBC tumors bearing {{mutations in}} genes {{involved in the}} androgen receptor (AR) and FOXA1 pathways were much more sensitive to chemotherapy. Mutations in the AR/FOXA1 pathway provide a <b>novel</b> <b>marker</b> for identifying chemosensitive TNBC patients who may benefit from current standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens. Mutations that lowered the levels of functional BRCA1 or BRCA2 RNA were associated with significantly better survival outcomes. This BRCA deficience signature define a new, highly chemosensitive subtype of TNBC. BRCA-deficient TNBC tumors have {{a higher rate of}} clonal mutation burden, defined as more clonal tumors with a higher number of mutations per clone, and are also associated with a higher level of immune activation, which may explain their greater chemosensitivity.|$|E

Zoological Studies 42 (1) : 186 - 192. The abundance {{and location of}} the branchial Na+,K+, 2 Cl(-) -cotransporter (NKCC) were examined in freshwater- and seawater-adapted tilapia. Immunoblots revealed 4 bands with molecular masses centered at 282, 208, 122, and 105 kDa, respectively. Gill NKCC in tilapia is upregulated after seawater adaptation. Confocal laser scanning micrographs showed that in seawater-adapted tilapa, NKCC as well as Na,K-ATPase exhibited identical diffuse distribution confined to the basal portion of branchial mitochondria-rich cells. However, in freshwater-adapted tilapia, NKCC was displayed only in the apical region of Na,K-ATPase-immunoreactive cells.

40|$|Introduction: Acute {{appendicitis}} is {{the most}} common abdominal emergency requiring emergency surgery. However, the diagnosis is often challenging and the decision to operate, observe or further work-up a patient is often unclear. The utility of clinical scoring systems (namely the Alvarado score), laboratory markers, and the development of <b>novel</b> <b>markers</b> in the diagnosis of appendicitis remains controversial. This article presents an update on the diagnostic approach to appendicitis through an evidence-based review. Methods: We performed a broad Medline search of radiological imaging, the Alvarado score, common laboratory <b>markers,</b> and <b>novel</b> <b>markers</b> in patients with suspected appendicitis. Results: Computed tomography (CT) {{is the most}} accurate mode of imaging for suspected cases of appendicitis, but the associated increase in radiation exposure is problematic. The Alvarado score is a clinical scoring system that is used to predict the likelihood of appendicitis based on signs, symptoms and laboratory data. It can help risk stratify patients with suspected appendicitis and potentially decrease the use of CT imaging in patients with certain Alvarado scores. White blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), granulocyte count and proportion of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are frequently elevated in patients with appendicitis, but are insufficient on their own as a diagnostic modality. When multiple markers are used in combination their diagnostic utility is greatly increased. Several <b>novel</b> <b>markers</b> have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis; however, while promising, most are only in the preliminary stages of being studied.   Conclusion: While CT is the most accurate mode of imaging in suspected appendicitis, the accompanying radiation is a concern. Ultrasound may help in the diagnosis while decreasing the need for CT in certain circumstances. The Alvarado Score has good diagnostic utility at specific cutoff points. Laboratory markers have very limited diagnostic utility on their own but show promise when used in combination. Further studies are warranted for laboratory markers in combination and to validate potential <b>novel</b> <b>markers.</b> [West J Emerg Med. 2014; 15 (7) :– 0. ...|$|R

40|$|Retinal bipolar neurons {{serve as}} relay interneurons that connect rod and cone {{photoreceptor}} cells to amacrine and ganglion cells. They exhibit diverse morphologies essential for correct routing of photoreceptor cell signals to specific postsynaptic amacrine and ganglion cells. The development and physiology of these interneurons {{have not been}} completely defined molecularly. Despite previous identification of genes expressed in several bipolar cell subtypes, molecules that mark each bipolar cell type still await discovery. In this report, <b>novel</b> genetic <b>markers</b> of murine bipolar cells were found. Candidates were initially generated by using microarray analysis of single bipolar cells and mining of retinal serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) data. These candidates were subsequently tested for expression in bipolar cells by RNA in situ hybridization. Ten new molecular markers were identified, five of which are highly enriched in their expression in bipolar cells within the adult retina. Double-labeling experiments using probes for previously characterized subsets of bipolar cells were performed to identify the subtypes of bipolar cells that express the <b>novel</b> <b>markers.</b> Additionally, the expression of bipolar cell genes was analyzed in Bhlhb 4 knockout retinas, in which rod bipolar cells degenerate postnatally, to delineate further the identity of bipolar cells in which <b>novel</b> <b>markers</b> are found. From the analysis of Bhlhb 4 mutant retinas, cone bipolar cell gene expression appears to be relatively unaffected by the degeneration of rod bipolar cells.
