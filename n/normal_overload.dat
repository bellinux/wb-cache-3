In order to estimate the unknown angle-of-attack, a sliding mode observer was designed. The convergence capability of the sliding mode observer was analyzed according to the Lyapunov stability theory. A sliding mode controller was designed to drive the missile <b>normal</b> <b>overload</b> output to track its command, based on the output-redefinition approach. In order to confirm {{the performance of the}} designed sliding mode observer and controller, a simulation example was carried out for nonlinear missile model.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel integrated guidance and control method for near space interceptor, considering the coupling among different channels {{of the missile}} dynamics, which makes {{the most of the}} overall performance of guidance and control system. Initially, three-dimensional integrated guidance and control model is employed by combining the interceptor-target relative motion model with the nonlinear dynamics of the interceptor, which establishes a direct relationship between the interceptor-target relative motion and the deflections of aerodynamic fins. Subsequently, regarding the acceleration of the target as bounded uncertainty of the system, an integrated guidance and control algorithm is designed based on robust adaptive backstepping method, with the upper bound of the uncertainties unknown. Moreover, a nonlinear tracking differentiator is introduced to reduce the “compute explosion” caused by backstepping method. It is proved that tracking errors {{of the state and the}} upper bound of the uncertainties converge to the neighborhoods of the origin exponentially. Finally, simulations results show that, compared to the conventional guidance and control design, the algorithm proposed in this paper has greater advantages in miss distance, required <b>normal</b> <b>overload,</b> and flight stability, especially when attacking high-maneuvering targets...|$|E

The self-routing nature of IP networks requires planners {{to determine how the}} network will behave under <b>normal,</b> <b>overloaded,</b> and failure scenarios. The fact that IP can drop or delay packets during overload conditions introduces new complexity to the system. Interactive services such as voice, two-way video, and gaming are particularly susceptible to the resultant digital jitter and delay. Under these circumstances, the network planners need to know how these services will be affected under varying conditions. In addition, they need to know how the network can be configured to provide the best quality of service at the least cost.|$|R

Steroid treatment of OV animals did not after the response of any parameter analyzed for the OV group, but in the OV-sus group steroid treatment induced increases in muscle weight and in protein content of the OV-sus-S group. The treatment did not alter the pattern of isomyosin expression observed in the OV or the OV-sus groups.

This thesis is based on both theoretical and empirical research with a focus on investigating overload control mechanisms for web servers.

The overload control mechanisms have been analyzed and simulated with respect to performance, and two of the overload control mechanisms have been implemented as modules in the Apache web server.

To {{solve this problem}} and a specific methodology for pilotage of the pre-emption, and automation tools are being developed. Preliminary study ofpilotage technique and authomatic control algorythm demand a reliable mathematical model of aircraft dynamics at cargo item drop. Such model should take into account {{significant change in the}} position of the aircraft center of mass and aircraft inertia tensor. Simplified models were based on modeling the movement of the center of mass and rotation around the cen- ter of mass of the aircraft. Such models do {{not take into account the}} inertial forces and moments of moving a cargo item. This circumstance does not allow to obtain reliable results in the simulation. The article presents the description of the complete mathematical model of the movement of military transport aircraft in landing of a cargo item. Examines the com- plex material system of solids and a detailed description of the properties of its components. The equations of motion of the aircraft as a system carrier (aircraft without a cargo item) and wear (of moving a cargo item) bodies to reflect the changes in the inertia tensor. The functioning of the power plant, steering actuators, flight control system, an exhaust chute, the sen- sors of the primary information are taken into account. The equations of motion for systems of bodies projected on the air- craft reference plane are being recorded. This approach takes into account changes of the inertia tensor and the position of the main central axes of inertia in the process of landing of a cargo item.

40|$|Compensatory {{hypertrophy}} was induced on the plantaris (PL) and soleus (SOL) {{muscles of}} five week old normal and dystrophic (strain 14. 6) hamsters. This {{was done to}} indicate whether submaximal exercise would be beneficial in reducing the progression of the muscular dystrophy (i. e., by causing muscle hypertrophy, reducing the total collagen content, and increasing the total protein content of the diseased muscle to approximate that of normal tissue). The hamsters were divided into four groups: 1) dystrophic overload (DO), 2) dystrophic control (DC), 3) <b>normal</b> <b>overload</b> (NO), and 4) normal control (NC). Eight weeks of overload of the PL and SOL muscles was induced by surgical ablation of the synergistic gastrocnemius muscle. Muscle wet weight data indicated significant muscle hypertrophy of 125 % and 92 % in the NO and DO PL respectively, and 60 % in the NO SOL. Dry muscle weight data was comparable to the above results. There {{was no significant difference}} in the muscle collagen content between the NC and DC groups. Collagen content increased significantly in the NO and DO PL by 81 % and 41 % respectively, and in the NO and DO SOL by 127 % and 57 % respectively. The DC muscle was significantly lower in protein content than the NC muscle (180. 2 mg/g and 210. 1 mg/g respectively) when expressed per g of wet muscle weight. This significance disappears when expressed per g dry muscle weight. The overload caused a significant decrease in the protein content of only the NO group when expressed by both wet and dry tissue weights (171. 7 mg/g and 678. 3 mg/g rrespectively). The hydration of the DC group was significantly higher than the NC group. The overload resulted in a significant increase in the water content of only the NO muscle. The results of this study indicate that dystrophic muscle will hypertrophy as indicated by muscle weight data. However, the significance of the data from the total collagen and total protein determination of the overload groups was inconclusive due to the formation of scar tissue. This scar tissue resulted in high collagen content. The high glycine content in this collagen in turn resulted in low protein values. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E

A new approach to this problem using simul-taneous recording of left ventricular pressure and left ventricular volume (determined by echo-cardiography) was applied in 21 patients. Pressure-volume plots, constructed from pressure and volume values sampled at 20 or 40 msec intervals, had characteristic shapes for the states studied: <b>normal,</b> pressure <b>overload,</b> volume overload, and myocardial disease. These curves closely re-sembled pressure-volume plots previously deternined by others from quantitative angiography. The area inscribed by these plots was integrated to calculate left ventricular stroke work. Left ventricular stroke work index (gram-meters/M 2) was in the range previously reported for the var-ious states; normal- 41 + 12, pressure overload- 102 + 14, volume overload- 136 36, myocardial disease- 65 + 19. Inspection of the pressure-volume plots allowed assessment of valvular regurgi-tation by the characteristic deformation of the loop during "isovolumic " contraction and relaxa-tion.

Results show that, {{with an increase in}} elevation, the abutment forces and bending moment of the arch dam increase first and then decrease from the bottom {{to the top of the}} dam. Abutment forces and bending moment reach their maximum at the middle or middle-down portion of the dam. The distributions of abutment forces and moment do not change during overload.

However, the number of nucleated cells and CD 34 + cells recommended by the manufacturer for processing in a single procedure or with 1 vial of CD 34 reagent is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective evaluation of 643 CliniMACS CD 34 -selection procedures, we validated the capacity of CliniMACS tubing sets and CD 34 reagent. Endpoints {{of this study were}} the recovery and purity of CD 34 + cells, T-cell depletion efficiency and recovery of colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM). RESULTS: <b>Overloading</b> <b>normal</b> or large-scale tubing sets with excess numbers of total nucleated cells, without exceeding the maximum number of CD 34 + cells, had no significant effect on the recovery and purity of CD 34 + cells. In contrast, <b>overloading</b> <b>normal</b> or large-scale tubing sets with excess numbers of CD 34 + cells resulted in a significantly lower recovery of CD 34 + cells. Furthermore, the separation capacity of 1 vial of CD 34 reagent could be increased safely from 600 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells to 1000 x 10 (6) CD 34 + cells with similar recovery of CD 34 (+) cells.

30|$|The {{toxicity}} of CuCNPs to cancer cells was investigated and results {{demonstrated that the}} delivery vector itself, particles containing no Cu, was not toxic and that CuCNPs displayed significant toxicity depending on dosing (Figure 4 A). Furthermore, the delivery of Cu contained in CuCNPs was more toxic than an equivalent amount of free Cu dose implying that the phenomenon was particle mediated (see Additional file 4). This effect is likely attributable to the differences in modes of internalization for the two forms of Cu. Free copper would be {{taken up by the}} cell via normal metal trafficking pathways that utilize metal-binding proteins located on the cell surface. As the cell begins to experience metal overload, those receptors would be internalized and degraded to prevent further metal accumulation. CuCNPs would be expected to be internalized by an entirely different pathway that is not subject to the normal cellular mechanisms for controlling metal homeostasis. Thus, the cell's <b>normal</b> metal <b>overload</b> defenses were likely bypassed leading to unregulated Cu uptake. As the Cu-loading in CuCNPs was reduced, cell survival improved with little or no toxicity being observed for CuCNPs containing 3 or 5 wt.% Cu (Figure 4 B).

However, both groups showed that hepcidin displays only a weak antimicrobial activity.

These conclusions were drawn from two different methods used to measure (in vivo and in vitro) the average rates of protein synthesis and protein breakdown in these soleus muscles. Although the basal rates of synthesis were higher when measured in vivo, and the degradative rates higher in isolated muscle preparations incubated in vitro, both methods gave good agreement concerning the changes in protein turnover induced by tenotomy of the gastrocnemius. The possible involvement of passive stretch in inducing this additional growth is discussed. As an antagonist to the soleus, growth of the extensor digitorum longus muscle was decreased under the same conditions, presumably because of less usage. At 3 days after the cutting of the sciatic nerve, the previously <b>normal</b> or <b>overloaded</b> soleus muscles underwent rapid atrophy. Although in both cases RNA and protein were lost, while protein synthesis decreased and protein breakdown increased, denervation induced larger changes within these parameters of the formerly overloaded muscle. The slowing of growth in the tenotomized gastrocnemius, and its subsequent rapid atrophy after additional denervation, were explained by large increases in protein breakdown, with little or no change in the synthetic rate...|$|R

In later work, Beloglazov et al.

Similarly, the authors in [70] proposed a dynamic threshold approach that finds and adjusts thresholds at runtime. Zuo et al. [71] also use an adaptive threshold. The authors monitor 3 metrics: number of resource requests, resource service capacity and resource service strength, and propose a dynamic weighted evaluation, dividing the resource load into three states including <b>Overload,</b> <b>Normal</b> and Idle.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a novel combination of mechanical activity paradigms on the isomyosin distribution in rat hindlimb muscles. Thirty female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five experimental groups as follows: <b>normal</b> control, functional <b>overload</b> (OV) of the plantaris, OV in conjunction with hindlimb suspension (OV-S), and a combination of OV-S and either static standing weight-bearing activity (OV-SS) or high-incline treadmill exercise (OV-SE). OV of the plantaris resulted in significant hypertrophy and significant fast-to-slow isomyosin shifts. These changes were completely inhibited by the addition of hindlimb suspension (OV-S). Also, neither of the two weight-bearing regimes (OV-SS and OV-SE) was able to attenuate the suspension-induced atrophy. In the vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis, however, OV-SS was able to partially retard the atrophy associated with suspension. In both the plantaris and vastus intermedius, only OV-SS was able to partially reverse the slow-to-fast isomyosin transitions associated with suspension. These results suggest that the type of mechanical activity is important in determining adaptation to altered loading conditions, with OV-SS appearing more effective than OV-SE in reversing the effects of unweighting...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{case study}} on outlet {{cracking}} is first conducted for the Goupitan and Xiaowan arch dams. A nonlinear FEM method is then implemented to study effects of the outlets on integral stability of the Xiluodu arch dam under two loading conditions, i. e., <b>normal</b> loading and <b>overloading</b> conditions. On {{the basis of the}} case study and the numerical modelling, the outlet cracking mechanism, risk, and corresponding reinforcement measures are discussed. Furthermore, the numerical simulation reveals that (1) under the normal loading conditions, the optimal distribution of the outlets will contribute to the tensile stress release in the local zone of the dam stream surface and decrease the outlet cracking risk during the operation period. (2) Under the overloading conditions, the cracks initiate around the outlets, then propagate along the horizontal direction, and finally coalesce with those in adjacent outlets, where the yield zone of the dam has a shape of butterfly. Throughout this study, a dam outlet cracking risk control and reinforcement principle is proposed to optimize the outlet design, select the appropriate concrete material, strengthen the temperature control during construction period, design reasonable impounding scheme, and repair the cracks according to their classification...|$|R
