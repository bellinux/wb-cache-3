A well-known event in Spain that produced significant environmental damage, and that, having occurred before the new Law on Environmental Liability and to be resolved under the previous legislation, is causing countless problems for reimbursement of the substantial expenditures invested by the Spanish Public Administration inrepairing the damage. Posed a <b>negative</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between civil and administrative courts, the Special Chamber of Conflicts of Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court has just returned the matter back to the former.

40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon formulates ambitious {{goals for}} the European Union. It holds that the EU shall offer its {{citizens}} an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of citizens is guaranteed in combination with appropriate measures with respect to crime control. This wording – which explicitly establishes a relationship between citizenship, free movement and a common area of justice – raises certain expectations. Still, the promotion of free movement also induces <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> EU law further encourages those conflicts by obliging Member States to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction, {{in order to prevent}} <b>negative</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> These types <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> easily harm the position of the EU citizen. This contribution analyses this problem in light of the legality principle, a cornerstone of every criminal law system, which is also included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Its central argument is that with the transfer of powers from the national to the European level and the increasing horizontal intertwinement of national criminal justice systems and the resulting intensified cooperation, it is also increasingly difficult to protect EU citizens against arbitrary investigation, prosecution, conviction and punishment in Europe’s area of freedom, security and justice. EU Charter rights therefore need to be interpreted in light of their new, transnational setting. This contribution concludes with a series of recommendations for a revised European framework for choice of forum in criminal matters...|$|R

40|$|Employing {{systematic}} {{document analysis}} and other methods, {{this article analyses}} a long-standing and still relevant issue related to the interpretation and application of the law regulating relationships {{in the field of}} European Union criminal justice {{within the framework of the}} national criminal proceedings that are taking place in EU member states. The article places special emphasis on the explanation and application of the principle of mutual recognition within the framework of one of the newest instruments of international cooperation in the European Union criminal proceedings meant to prevent <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> and to solve issues arising between two or more member states. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> provided in this paper is not limited to a mere explanation of the concept as such, but includes an essential analysis of other related issues, such as the principle of mutual recognition, its influence on the recognition of criminal proceedings as parallel proceedings, and including other aspects related to the matching of the form of national criminal proceedings with the criminal proceedings taking place in another member state. Finally, significant attention is given to one of the objectives in terms of prevention and solution <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> namely, the ne bis in idem principle and its application in case of parallel criminal proceedings taking place in two or more member states. One of the key conclusions offered here is that in order to eliminate <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> positive law in the process <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> must become an effective measure in criminal justice; however, only on the condition that at least a minimum likelihood in the form of criminal proceedings adopted by different EU members states is ensured as a precondition necessary to enable a smooth application of the principle of mutual recognition...|$|R

It shares a theoretical perspective based on interpretative matrix of the political dynamics of the Old Regime Iberian. The analysis that follows will unfold in two case studies, both based on documentation that involves the Overseas Council: the first refers to <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between the Overseas Council and other Portuguese central councils {{in the early years}} of its operation; and the second concerns jurisdictions, not always well-defined and often <b>conflicting,</b> <b>of</b> governors of captaincies, governors-general and viceroys in Portuguese America...|$|R

Alas, this has otherwise been decided and negated by the civil court. Based on the case's decided, even though the jurisdiction to hear wakaf exclusively is under the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> the syariah court, yet the civil court vehemently decided otherwise, viz it is under their domain. This clearly negates the importance of article 121 (1 A) of the FC. This paper intends to study the decided cases involving wakaf since the inclusion of sub clause 1 A to article 121 of the FC, which has bestowed to the syariah courts, exclusive and unfettered jurisdiction and power to adjudicate and determine their own matters as provided the said provisions and to identify the real legal and jurisprudential issues, causes and stumbling blocks which had hitherto barred the syariah courts from having the freedom and ability to decide on wakaf and further to give suggestion and solution in the problem <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>of</b> between these courts, civil and syariah, in matters pertaining to the same. It is hoped that through the illumination of this paper on wakaf and its <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> between both courts in Malaysia, will give us some insights as to how issues on wakaf and its disputes were and are currently determined...|$|R

In particular, due attention is paid at both the relevant features, on the one hand the <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions,</b> on the other hand the principle of European ne bis in idem. The first chapter focuses on the lis pendens. After investigating the origins of such phenomenon, the Author examines the EU fundamental legislative drafts that led to the adoption of Framework Decision 2009 / 948 /JHA, “on prevention and settlement <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> exercise <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in criminal proceedings”. Special consideration is devoted to the matters of constitutional consistency to take into account when implementing the EU act in the national legal system. The rest of the study is centred on the European principle of ne bis in idem. The Author analyses the milestone steps for the establishment of such principle under EU law, alongside with the case-law of the European Court of Justice. The scrutiny of the ECJ decisions displays a critical approach, aimed at highlighting the unresolved questions and putting forward possible solutions...|$|R

In order {{to demonstrate that}} the influence still exists, at least in respect <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> a comparative analysis of the responsibility of the carriers of goods will be carried out in the light of international conventions. The thesis will consider the new evolution of maritime law, which today, in many aspects, follows air law. It will become clear that both systems face the same difficulties. In particular, the multiplication of international conventions has weakened the aim of uniformity by admitting different regimes of the carriers' liability. Once the causes <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> have been identified, the thesis will analyze how the conventions attempt to solve those <b>conflicts.</b> The use <b>of</b> forum shopping by the parties and the use of forum non conveniens by the courts, reveals that present international solutions are not satisfactory. The practice in maritime law is to consider a conflict prior to its existence and to permit jurisdiction as well as arbitration clauses. While the former clauses are forbidden in air law, arbitration clauses, although accepted in various international air conventions, have never been used until recently in air law, and only in respect of the financing of major projects. It is therefore possible to believe today, that the maritime approach can and will be followed in respect <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> carriage of goods by air, thus proving that maritime law does still influence the evolution of air law...|$|R
