[...] However, Kissinger warned that attempting to force Israel to disarm could have consequences, writing that [...] "Israel will not take us seriously on the nuclear issue unless they believe we are prepared to withhold something they very much need" [...] (Kissinger was referring to a pending sale of F-4 Phantom fighter jets to Israel). Kissinger wrote that [...] "if we withhold the Phantoms and they make this fact public in the United States, enormous political pressure will be mounted on us. We will be in an indefensible position if we cannot state why we are withholding the planes. Yet if we explain our position publicly, we will be the ones to make Israel’s possession of nuclear weapons public with all the international consequences this entails." [...] Among the suggestions Kissinger presented to Nixon was the idea of the United States adopting a policy of [...] "nuclear ambiguity", or pretending not to know about Israel's nuclear program.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTo what extent has the United States' guaranteed nuclear deterrent to Japan influenced the security relationship between China and Japan? The conventional wisdom holds {{that while the}} overall balance of U. S. influence has been to both ameliorate and exacerbate tensions between Tokyo and Beijing, Washington's nuclear guarantees in particular have served to reduce tensions by helping to prevent a nuclear-armed Japan. Much scholarly work has been dedicated to analyzing the U. S. impact on the China-Japan relationship generally and the prediction of increased tensions resulting from changes to the U. S. nuclear umbrella (namely, development of ballistic missile defense). However, {{little attention has been}} paid to assessing how the magnitude and direction of U. S. influence have varied over time and whether the predictions of a worsening Sino-Japanese security dilemma have come to fruition. Conducting a historical analysis of the period 1945 -present, this thesis finds that the influence of U. S. extended deterrence is more nuanced. While the strongest influence has been to ameliorate long-term hostilities, the influence most frequently felt was exacerbation of short-term tensions. This influence notwithstanding, this thesis finds that changes in the U.

40|$|To {{construct}} a political union with an autonomous Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), the European Union (EU) must "sooner or later" address {{the integration of}} the British and French deterrents within a credible West European nuclear consultation arrangement. However, there exists little consensus among Britain, France, and Germany on the creation of a European Security and Defense Identity (ESDI), much less the "course and speed" of integration within the EU. Indeed, the "conflict and contrast" of national interests have been most conspicuous when discussions at the highest levels have turned towards creating a combined European nuclear posture through the coordination of the British and French nuclear forces.

This thesis analyzes German perspectives on the international security environment and offers judgements about the probable future role of nuclear deterrence in Europe. The thesis begins with {{a survey of the}} role of nuclear deterrence in the security policy of the Federal Republic of Germanv during the period prior to reunification in 1989 - 1990. This is followed by an analysis of German views on the West European nuclear powers: the United Kingdom and France. German views on the U. S. nuclear presence and U.

For the short term, Germany will not change its present policies regarding nuclear deterrence in Europe. The German nation is likely to remain preoccupied with the reunification process for several years, and German politicians are not disposed to seek a debate on nuclear deterrence.

40|$|Throughout the Cold War, Italy {{was one of}} {{the most}} steadfast NATO allies in hosting American nuclear weapons on its territory. Such a policy could easily be {{construed}} as an example of almost automatic confidence in the US nuclear umbrella, yet only on the surface did extended deterrence appease Italian anxieties about the uncertainties of the American <b>nuclear</b> <b>guarantee.</b> The Italian rationale for accepting a large array of US nuclear weapon s did as a matter of fact involve a complex mix of reasons, ranging from trying to ensure that the Italian government would be consulted in the event of a major crisis, to willingness to enhance the country’s profile inside any Western multilateral fora. The paper will investigate this policy by looking at how the Italian government behaved at the height of the NATO nuclear sharing debate, between 1957 and 1962, arguably one of the historical moments in the Cold War when the concept of extended deterrence was most intensely discussed. Drawing upon hitherto classified archival sources as well as on some less-known public ones, the paper will show how Italian diplomats, military leaders and policymakers understood the dangers and political implications of US nuclear policies.

S. extended nuclear deterrence. policy implications • Washington still has the capacity to prevent further proliferation by revisiting U. S. policy toward the four principal nuclear drivers. • Of benefit would be for the U.

40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between nuclear postures and nonproliferation policies and the spread of nuclear weapons? At first blush, this might appear to be an obvious question. After all, states go to great lengths—extending <b>nuclear</b> security <b>guarantees</b> to nonnuclear weapon states, forward-deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of allies, sizing their own nuclear arsenals with the proliferation decisions of other states in mind, supporting international institutions in conducting inspections of nuclear facilities in nonnuclear weapon states, restricting the availability of sensitive nuclear technology, applying and enforcing sanctions against would-be prolifera-tors, conducting military strikes against nuclear facilities, and promoting nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes, among many other steps—to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It would be strange to imagine that states pursue such actions unless they can expect a policy payoff in terms of peace or security. Yet, there is little systematic evidence to suggest that nuclear postures and policies have a mean-ingful impact on the spread of nuclear weapons.

40|$|Why do {{some states}} that receive a <b>nuclear</b> {{security}} <b>guarantee</b> move towards, and some-times back away from, nuclear weapons? To answer these questions, I propose alliance compensation theory. I argue that allies become {{more likely to}} engage in nuclear behavior when they doubt the reliability of the security guarantees they receive from their major power patrons (e. g., the United States and the Soviet Union). Specifically, I show that allies evaluate the strength of these guarantees by referring to their patron’s overseas conventional military deployments and foreign policy doctrines – in short, its strategic posture. When the nuclear-armed patron implements undesirable conventional military redeployments (e. g., unilateral troop withdrawals), the ally loses confidence in the patron’s earlier pledges to provide it with military support in a future nuclear crisis. These doubts encourage the ally to adopt policies that range from signaling an interest in an nuclear arsenal to activating a nuclear weapons program. Allies that covertly undertake nuclear activities are seeking to produce an independent deterrent. Allies that overtly engage in nuclear behavior are also bargaining over the terms of their patron’s security guarantees. I further argue that the interaction of two variables – the ally’s economic and security dependence on the patron – affect the major power’s ability to force the ally to credibly renounce nuclear weapons acquisition. To test this argument, I include three main cases on West Germany, Japan, and South Korea in addition to narrower cases on the United Kingdom, France, and Soviet allies. I also draw on statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between conventional military withdrawals and the likelihood of US allies to engage in nuclear behavior...|$|R

Most of the presently used ultrasonic systems are already at a high quality level. However there is still a vived demand to increase the performance of UT systems considering reliability of the inspection, safety of the service personnel and economic aspects. The means to fulfil these requirements may be characterized by the following keywords:flexible data acquisition; quantitative evaluation; on-line data control; system self-check; compact and modular design; user friendly men/machine interface; easy maintenance. As a result of the quick progress in the development of more powerful highly integrated electronic circuits li ke gate arrays and digital signal processors, and because of the high performance of modern computers, the prerequisites are provided to build ultrasonic inspection systems with the required features. The integration of tools like CAD, data bases, numerical modeling techniques, and methods of artificial intelligence can provide an essential contribution to increase the reliability during all phases of an inspection, which results in a more quantitative NDE. The article explains the conception of a data acquisition and evaluation system for the automated ultrasonic inspection, that takes into account the mentioned aspects. The heart ot the system are densely packed electronic modules theat are parts of the Automated Modular Ultrasonic Inspection System (AMUS); the AMUS-technology allows a fast adaption of the system performance to the special needs of the customer at a moderate price...|$|R
40|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} from {{commercial}} power reactors is reprocessed at the COGEMA plant in La Hague. After shearing and {{dissolution of the}} fuel assemblies, the hulls and nozzles are sent to COGEMA's new compaction facility (ACC) to reduce the final volume of waste. Technological waste generated in the reprocessing plant is also sent to the ACC facility. Compacted waste is characterized by two measurement stations: a gamma spectrometry station and an active and passive neutron measurement station. The main purpose of these measurement stations {{is to determine the}} <b>guaranteed</b> <b>nuclear</b> parameters of the compacted waste and their associated uncertainties: (1) total U and Pu masses, (2) Pu, Cm, and total alpha activities, (3) 137 Cs, 90 Sr- 90 Y, 241 Pu beta activities, (4) decay heat. After giving a description of the measurement stations, this paper will describe the qualification tests performed {{in the context of the}} ACC project. The extensive calibration tests performed on site with different sources and different waste matrices will be described (approximately 500 neutron and gamma experiments). Hot tests that were conducted after hot start-up at the end of 2001 and prior to the start of commercial operation will be also presented. A number of drums produced by the upstream facilities were introduced one by one into the ACC facility in order to avoid mixing of different fuel assemblies. This procedure allows comparison between characterization performed in the upstream facilities on the basis of fuel data available before processing and the measurements performed on the new ACC stations. These comparisons showed good agreement between the different methods of characterization and thus validated the innovative technologies and methods used by COGEMA for compacted waste generated by the ACC facility...|$|R
40|$|Minimization of HLW {{inventories}} and U consumption are {{key elements}} <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy expansion. The integration of complex nuclear systems into a viable cycle yet constitutes a challenging multi-parametric optimization problem. The reactors and fuel cycle performance parameters may be strongly dependent on minor {{variations in the}} system's input data. Proven discrepancies in nuclear data evaluations could affect {{the validity of the}} system optimization metrics. This study first analyzes various advanced AP 1000 -VHTR fuel cycle scenarios by assessing their TRU destruction and their U consumption minimization capabilities, and by computing reactor performance parameters such as the time evolution of the effective multiplication factor keff, the reactors' energy spectrum or the isotopic composition/activity at EOL. The performance metrics dependence to prompt neutron fission spectrum discrepancies is then quantified to assess the viability of one strategy. Fission spectrum evaluations are indeed intensively used in reactors' calculations. Discrepancies higher than 10 % have been computed among nuclear data libraries for energies above 8 MeV for 235 U. TRU arising from a 3 wt% 235 U-enriched UO 2 -fueled AP 1000 were incinerated in a VHTR. Fuels consisting of 20 %, 40 % and 100 % of TRU completed by UO 2 were examined. MCNPX results indicate that up to 88. 9 % of the TRU initially present in a VHTR fueled with 20 % of TRU and 80 % of ThO 2 were transmuted. Additionally, the use of WgPu instead of RgPu should reduce the daily consumption of 235 U by 1. 3 and augment core lifetime. To estimate the system metrics dependence to fission spectrum discrepancies and validate optimization studies outputs, the VTHR 235 U fission spectrum distribution was altered successively in three manners. keff is at worst lowered by 1. 7 % of the reference value and the energy spectrum by 5 % between 50 meV and 2 MeV when a significantly distorted fission spectrum tail is used. 233 U, 236 Pu and 237 Pu inventories and activities are multiplied by 263, 523 and 34 but are still negligible compared to 239 Pu mass or the total activity. The AP 1000 -VHTR system is in conclusion not dependent on the selected fission spectrum variations. TRU elimination optimization studies in AP 1000 -VHTR systems will be facilitated by freeing performance metrics dependency from 1 input parameter...|$|R
