Among known <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> supersymmetry scenarios, we find that a model based on Higgs-gaugino mediation works with a mild fine-tuning Δ= 40 - 80. We propose two new <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> supersymmetry scenarios where the anomaly of the muon g- 2 is also explained. These scenarios are variants of the widely known <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> supersymmetry based on gravity mediation with universal scalar masses. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

However, the complex three-dimensional distribution of cells on LBC slides requires manual focusing, long scanning-times, and multi-layer scanning. Here, we present a solution that overcomes these limitations in two steps: first, we make sure that <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> are only set on cells. Secondly, we check the total slide focus quality. From a first analysis we detected that superficial dust can {{be separated from the}} cell layer (thin layer of cells on the glass slide) itself. Then we analyzed 2, 295 individual <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> from 51 LBC slides stained for p 16 and Ki 67. Using the number of edges in a <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> image, specific color values and size-inclusion filters, <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> detecting cells could be distinguished from <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> on artifacts (accuracy 98. 6 %). Sharpness as total focus quality of a virtual LBC slide is computed from 5 sharpness features. We trained a multi-parameter SVM classifier on 1, 600 images. On an independent validation set of 3, 232 cell images we achieved an accuracy of 94. 8 % for classifying images as focused. Our results show that single-layer scanning of LBC slides is possible and how it can be achieved. We assembled <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> analysis and sharpness classification into a fully automatic, iterative workflow, free of user intervention, which performs repetitive slide scanning as necessary. On 400 LBC slides we achieved a scanning-time of 13. 9 ± 10. 1 min with 29. 1 ± 15. 5 <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> In summary, the integration of semantic focus information into whole-slide imaging allows automatic high-quality imaging of LBC slides and subsequent biomarker analysis...|$|R

In the <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> gauge mediation, the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can be naturally explained even for multi-TeV stops. It is known that the <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> behavior appears if a ratio {{of the number of}} SU(2) doublet messengers to that of SU(3) triplet messengers is close to 5 / 2. Importantly, this ratio (effectively) appears in our scenario based on the PGU, if the messenger field is an adjoint representation of SU(5) gauge group. Therefore, our <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> scenario is very predictive. It is also pointed out the gravitino can be dark matter without spoiling the success of the thermal leptogenesis. The absence of the SUSY CP-problem is guaranteed in the case that the Higgs B-term vanishes at the messenger scale.

40|$|The {{development}} of eyespots {{on the wing}} surface of butterflies of the family Nympalidae {{is one of the}} most studied examples of biological pattern formation. However, little is known about the mechanism that determines the number and precise locations of eyespots on the wing. Eyespots develop around signaling centers, called foci, that are located equidistant from wing veins along the midline of a wing cell (an area bounded by veins). A fundamental question that remains unsolved is, why a certain wing cell develops an eyespot, while other wing cells do not. We illustrate that the key to understanding <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> selection may be in the venation system of the wing disc. Our main hypothesis is that changes in morphogen concentration along the proximal boundary veins of wing cells govern <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> selection. Based on previous studies, we focus on a spatially two-dimensional reaction-diffusion system model posed in the interior of each wing cell that describes the formation of <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> Using finite element based numerical simulations, we demonstrate that variation in the proximal boundary condition is sufficient to robustly select whether an eyespot <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> forms in otherwise identical wing cells. We also illustrate that this behavior is robust to small perturbations in the parameters and geometry and moderate levels of noise. Hence, we suggest that an anterior-posterior pattern of morphogen concentration along the proximal vein may be the main determinant of the distribution of <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> on the wing surface. In order to complete our model, we propose a two stage reaction-diffusion system model, in which an one-dimensional surface reaction-diffusion system, posed on the proximal vein, generates the morphogen concentrations that act as non-homogeneous Dirichlet (i. e., fixed) boundary conditions for the two-dimensional reaction-diffusion model posed in the wing cells. The two-stage model appears capable of generating <b>focus</b> <b>point</b> distributions observed in nature. We therefore conclude that changes in the proximal boundary conditions are sufficient to explain the empirically observed distribution of eyespot <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> on the entire wing surface. The model predicts, subject to experimental verification, that the source strength of the activator at the proximal boundary should be lower in wing cells in which <b>focus</b> <b>points</b> form than in those that lack <b>focus</b> <b>points.</b> The model suggests that the number and locations of eyespot foci on the wing disc could be largely controlled by two kinds of gradients along two different directions, that is, the first one is the gradient in spatially varying parameters such as the reaction rate along the anterior-posterior direction on the proximal boundary of the wing cells, and the second one is the gradient in source values of the activator along the veins in the proximal-distal direction of the wing cell...|$|R
