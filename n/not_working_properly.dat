500|$|Another {{factor in}} {{addition}} to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. [...] The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to <b>not</b> be <b>working</b> <b>properly.</b> The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform at maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor can be found in references.|$|R

As a consequence, most of the coastal pelagic fish community remained very close to the coast, thus not accessible to the pelagic gear samplers.

Outside the coastal area (> 90 m depth) main abundance fish species was mackerel with 380. 000 tonnes, corresponding to 1. 725 million fish. On the contrary, sardine distribution was scarce, and occurred in small schools (probably {{as a consequence of the}} bad weather condition), with only 3. 343 tonnes corresponding to 54. 0 million fish.

2500|$|Sam and Iceman, telepathically {{prompted}} by Emma Frost, attempted {{to recover the}} Destiny Diaries, which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. [...] The Marauder's master, Mister Sinister, used a reverse-engineered version of Xavier's Cerebro to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attacked Sam and Iceman and overtook them. After the battle, Sinister attempted to telepathically erase Sam's mind so that the X-Men would find him as an empty shell. This {{would serve as a}} lesson to them and to the Marauders as well. However, Sinister was distracted by Iceman, allowing Sam to activate his power to rocket {{his way out of the}} brewery and escape. Iceman was also able to escape, but it was revealed that Sam, who crashed through one of the brewery's walls, was seriously injured.

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to improve the}} reliability of query results based on error-prone sensors is to introduce redundant sensors. However, using multiple sensors to generate the value for a data item can be expensive, especially in wireless environments where continuous queries are executed. Moreover, some sensors may <b>not</b> be <b>working</b> <b>properly</b> and their readings need to be discarded. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach to decide which sensor nodes {{to be used to}} answer a query. In particular, we propose to solve the problem with the aid of continuous probabilistic query (CPQ), which is originally used to manage uncertain data and is associated with a probabilistic guarantee on the query result. Based on the historical data values from the sensor nodes, the query type, and the requirement on the query, we present methods to select an appropriate set of sensors and provide reliable answers for several common aggregate queries. Our statistics-based sensor node selection algorithm is demonstrated in a number of simulation experiments, which shows that a small number of sensor nodes can provide accurate and robust query results. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Este trabalho {{consiste}} no estudo da Torre de Absorção de SO 2 da empresa Soporcel, a qual se encontra com um funcionamento irregular. Com este estudo pretende-se que a coluna passe a funcionar corretamente, garantindo que as emissões deste soluto se encontram dentro dos limites exigidos pela legislação ambiental em vigor. A análise preliminar do processo foi fundamentada pelos dados facultados pela empresa, tendo-se verificado que apresenta problemas ao nível do humedecimento, os quais justificam o mau funcionamento desta. Além do estudo da torre real, o trabalho apresenta sugestões para superar o problema aproveitando o mesmo equipamento, assim como projeta uma nova torre de absorção.

In addition to the evaluation of the existing tower, this work presents suggestions to overcome the current problems whether by maintaining the same equipment structure or through a project of a new tower.

40|$|Components {{that have}} defects after release, but not during testing, are very {{undesirable}} as {{they point to}} " in the testing process. Either new components were not tested enough, or old ones were broken during enhancements and defects slipped through testing undetected. The latter is particularly pernicious, since customers are less forgiving when existing functionality is no longer working than when a new feature is <b>not</b> <b>working</b> quite <b>properly.</b> Rather than using capture-recapture models and curve-tting methods to estimate the number of remaining defects after inspection, these methods are adapted to estimate the number of components with post-release defects that have no defects in testing. A simple experience-based method {{is used as a}} basis for comparison. The estimates can then be used to make decisions on whether or not to stop testing and release software. While most investigations so far have been experimental or have used virtual inspections to do a statistical validation, our investigation is a case study. This case study evaluates how well the capture-recapture, curve-tting and experience-based methods work in practice. The results show that the methods work quite well. A further benet of these techniques is that they can be applied to new systems for which no historical data is available and to releases that are very dierent from each other. 1...|$|R

To limit the emission level a three way catalytic converter is used to post-treat exhaust gases produced by combustion.

In this paper, different innovative control strate-gies, designed for the warm-up phase, are presented.

Finally, a secondary air injection on the exhaust manifold is considered and the two con-trol strategies are implemented with this new control input...|$|R
