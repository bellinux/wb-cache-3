25|$|Over {{the years}} {{there have been}} several {{attempts}} to replace Gerber by formats containing more information than just the layer image, e.g. <b>netlist</b> or component information.

25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate <b>netlist</b> description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified <b>netlist</b> (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} new {{solution}} to the problem of eliminating hotspots from gate-level netlits as well as examines the effects of timing constraints on the temperature reduction and the overall temperature flattening on the chip. Our core technique consists of three steps. First, a thermal analysis is carried out for logic <b>netlists.</b> (The <b>netlists</b> are assumed to be either isolated or embedded in a larger system with macro-cells.) We then apply a new technique, called isothermal logic partitioning technique (LP-temp), to the <b>netlists,</b> which essentially builds isothermal logic clusters for the <b>netlists</b> and splits each of the logic clusters exceeding the maximum allowed temperature through its hottest point. This will enlarge a contact point for the hotspot to cool down. Finally, the entire system is replaced using a custom designed temperature-aware floorplanner so that the temperature across the entire system is reduced and flattened...|$|R
