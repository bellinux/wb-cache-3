40|$|LL. M. The Basel Capital Accords {{have been}} {{observed}} and implemented by banks throughout the world, although produced and formulated by a body which possesses no law making authority. Due {{to a lack of}} binding force the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is regarded as recommendations only and implemented and complied with on a voluntary basis. Against the backdrop of the recent global economic crisis and the development of banking supervision, I aim to come to a conclusion as {{to the nature of the}} Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework (Basel II), through a comparison between various possibilities of classification. The investigation of the legal nature and possible classification of Basel II is of significance as there is no real certainty regarding its current legal nature, except that it is a <b>non-binding</b> <b>accord</b> considered to be “soft law”. A further investigation will be performed on the development of banking supervision in the United States of America, South Africa and the United Kingdom and the impact of Basel II on each of these jurisdictions. A comparative study will be conducted which focuses primarily on the measures of implementation and impact which Basel II has had on the countries under consideration. The role which Basel II played in the recent world economic crisis deserves discussion due to the great impact that was felt by the banking industry on a global level, in particular the role which Basel II possibly played in the economic impacts felt by the United States of America, South Africa and the United Kingdom. By this study I wish to achieve clarity on the role which Basel II plays, its impact on banking law as a whole, as well as its nature...|$|E

40|$|In Minilateralism: How Trade Alliances, Soft Law, and Financial Engineering Are Redefining Economic Statecraft, Professor Chris Brummer {{embraces the}} {{complexity}} of the global economic system and its regulation by exploring the emerging role and dominance of varying strands of economic collaboration and regulation that he collectively refers to as “minilateralism. ” In describing the turn toward minilateralism, Brummer notes a number of key features of this new minilateral system, including a shift away from global cooperation to strategic alliances composed of the smallest group necessary to achieve a particular goal, a turn from formal treaties to informal <b>non-binding</b> <b>accords</b> and other soft law, and the willingness of governments to resort to financial engineering to achieve their goals. While doing so, Brummer’s book explores how and why this shift from multilateralism to minilateralism has occurred, and he discusses the issues associated with managing and shaping the healthy growth and development of this system. He advocates that policymakers and regulators use what he terms “smart minilateralism” to define policy objectives, choose the proper minilateral tools, and legitimize their actions by seeking the support of relevant stakeholders. This Review engages Brummer’s theories, complicates them, and in a variety of instances challenges them. It explores whether the world is merely experiencing the fine tuning of multilateralism, rather than a shift to minilateralism; whether minilateralism is simply better documented today {{than it has been in}} the past, rather than the emerging norm; and whether minilateralism is really a new phenomenon. It also challenges Brummer to offer his readers more on how multilateral and minilateral systems interact, how minilateral legitimacy might be achieved, and what role non-governmental entities do and should play in international economic regulation. In addition, this Review suggests that in various contexts minilateralism is doomed to fail and explores the implications of that failure. Thus, in a style of academic criticism, this Review criticizes the excellent and demands an unattainable level of perfection, especially because it would require Brummer to turn his readable and fully formed text into a multi-volume treatise...|$|R
50|$|Following the <b>non-binding</b> Copenhagen <b>Accord</b> {{put forth}} in 2009, {{international}} {{expectations for the}} COP16 conference were reduced. Four preparatory rounds of negotiations (i.e. sessions of the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA) were held during 2010. The first three of these were in Bonn, Germany, from 9 to 11 April, 1 to 11 June (in conjunction with the 32nd sessions of SBSTA and SBI), and 2 to 6 August. The Bonn talks were reported as ending in failure. The fourth round of talks in Tianjin, China, made minimal progress and was marked by a clash between the US and China. The Ambo declaration was adopted at the Tarawa Climate Change Conference on the 10th November 2010 by Australia, Brazil, China, Cuba, Fiji, Japan, Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands, New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Tonga. It calls for more and immediate action, and was slated to be presented at COP 16.|$|R
40|$|Climate finance is {{becoming}} a dark curve on the road from Copenhagen to Cancún. Poorer nations fear that richer ones will fulfil the US$ 30 billion ‘fast-start’ climate finance promises made in the <b>non-binding</b> Copenhagen <b>Accord</b> by relabelling or diverting basic development aid, or by simply delivering on past climate finance pledges. The problem is simple: contributor countries are operating with no clear baseline against which their promise of ‘new and additional’ funding can be counted – {{and they do not}} accept the baselines put forth by developing countries. A viable solution for the short term is to use projections of business-as-usual development assistance as baselines. The longer-term benchmark could be the provision of truly ‘new’ funds from new funding sources. Substantial up-front negotiations may be required, but seizing this opportunity to define baselines will build confidence on both sides and create predictability for future finance...|$|R
5000|$|After deliberating for ten days, {{the jury}} {{rendered}} its verdict {{at noon on}} March 6, 2007. It convicted Libby on {{four of the five}} counts against him — two counts of perjury, one count of obstructing justice in a grand jury investigation, and one of the two counts of making false statements to federal investigators — and acquitted him on one count of making false statements. Given current federal sentencing guidelines, which are not mandatory, the convictions could result in a sentence ranging from no imprisonment to imprisonment of up to 25 years and a fine of one million US dollars. Given those <b>non-binding</b> guidelines, <b>according</b> to lawyer, author, New Yorker staff writer, and CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on Anderson Cooper 360°, such a sentence could likely be between [...] "one and a half to three years". Sentencing was scheduled for June 2007. His lawyers have announced their intention to seek a new trial and, if that attempt fails, to appeal Libby's conviction.|$|R
40|$|The date, 18 December 2009, {{left the}} world perturbed, as global leaders {{failed to reach}} {{consensus}} on a legally binding climate deal in Copenhagen.

25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} to fight global warming found more {{success at the}} international level than in Congress. Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the <b>non-binding</b> Copenhagen <b>Accord</b> as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut its emissions by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor its emissions, and required each country to create a plan to reduce its emissions. Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLM (Environmental Law and Governance)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Climate {{change is}} a {{critical}} sustainable development issue with implications for the environment, economies and society as we know it. The problem of climate change is caused by some countries {{in parts of the}} world that has a direct effect on people and natural resources {{in other parts of the}} world. Climate change is the effect of increased production of Greenhouse gases (GHGs). Due to the vast complexity of the climate change regime the study does not attempt to be comprehensive or conclusive. The aim of the study is to critically evaluate and determine the purpose, enforceability, legal nature, shortcomings and strengths of the <b>non-binding</b> Copenhagen <b>Accord</b> and how the international climate change regime will evolve after the Copenhagen Accord. The study starts with a brief explanation of the international climate change regime and its development, including international environmental law principles, specifically the common but differentiated responsibility principle. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has the ultimate objective to achieve the stabilisation of GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The Conference of the Parties (COPs) is the ultimate decision-making and supreme body of the UNFCCC and is authorised to make and implement decisions to promote the implementation of the UNFCCC, it further has the power to adopt new protocols under the UNFCCC and plays a substantial role in the development of new obligations by the parties to the convention. Various COPs, their respective adopted decisions and resolutions which played an important role in the development of the climate change regime are discussed. This includes COP 1 that lead to the Berlin Mandate; COP 3 and the Kyoto Protocol; COP 7 and the Marrakech Accords; COP 11 that marked the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol; COP 13 and the Bali Action Plan. COP 15 in Copenhagen was internationally expected and intended to be the breakthrough in addressing the post 2012 period. As is evident from the content of this study the result of COP 15 at Copenhagen means different challenges for different countries and the “bottom up” architecture of the accord could help encourage and reinforce national actions. An overview of the effect of the Copenhagen Accord on the climate change regime, with specific reference to COP 16 in Cancun, is then done. The “bottom up” architecture of the Copenhagen Accord was brought into the official UNFCCC process by the Cancun Agreements that were reached at COP 16. The study mostly comprised of a literature study, which reviewed the relevant international environmental law dealing with climate change, taking into account customary international law; international treaties and conventions; government documents, policies and reports; textbooks and academic journals as well as electronic material obtained from various internet sources.
