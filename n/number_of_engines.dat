5|$|The JV6 engines {{used in the}} Jaguar racing {{cars were}} {{produced}} by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger, but delivering the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity. TWR formed a division, TWR Road Engines, to manage the design, development, construction and testing of the engines for the production cars. The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with the engines Heidegger built {{for use in the}} XJR racing cars, being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular, the European emissions requirements, which the race engines didn't have to meet.|$|E

25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick’s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.|$|E
25|$|The {{line through}} the low level {{platforms}} first opened in 1846 as a goods only branch as far as Thames Wharf. The bridge under the main line was too low for many locomotives, so a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> were equipped with hinged chimneys in order they could operate the line. On opening {{there was also a}} line that linked what is now known as the Great Eastern Main Line directly to the docks enabling through running from Colchester to Thames Wharf. The docks and associated railway networks expanded with passenger services to North Woolwich starting in 1847.|$|E
25|$|With {{these new}} uses being found, the class {{remained}} in {{use on the}} system, surviving {{to be taken into}} ownership by the Southern Railway from 1923 and by British Railways from 1948. Although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> dwindled following the Second World War as the work they were used for was either dieselised or lost to rail through the closure of branch lines and yards, a number continued in operation through into the 1960s, most famously on the Hayling Island Branch Line in Hampshire. The withdrawal of the final members of the class finally came in 1963, the line to Hayling having closed in November 1963.|$|E

25|$|The Vimy was {{powered by}} a range of {{different}} engines. Owing to engine supply difficulties, the prototype Vimys were tested {{with a number of}} different engine types, including Sunbeam Maoris, Salmson 9Zm water-cooled radials, and Fiat A.12bis engines, before production orders were placed for aircraft powered by the 230hp (170kW) BHP Puma, 400hp (300kW) Fiat, 400hp (300kW) Liberty L-12 and the 360hp (270kW) Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII engines, with a total of 776 ordered {{before the end of the}} First World War. Of these, only aircraft powered by the Eagle engine, known as the Vimy IV, were delivered to the RAF. Due to the diverse <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> used, there are multiple conflicting official reports on the production numbers of each sub-variant of the Vimy.|$|E
25|$|Around 1935, {{development}} of a version suitable for tanks was begun. This was called the M-17T and 7951 were built from 1936 to 1939. The advent of the Mikulin AM-34, which {{was intended as a}} replacement for the M-17, reduced the need for aircraft models and the Rybinsk factory was producing three tank engines for every aircraft engine by 1936, although production of the aircraft variants continued until the end of 1939 to replace worn-out engines on older aircraft. The M-17L was a version of the M-17T used to power the T-35 heavy tank and was the last model placed into production, 530 being built from 1940 to 1941. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> of various models were assembled from spare parts during World War II, but no records are available as to numbers and types.|$|E
500|$|The A330's origin {{dates to}} the mid-1970s as one of several {{conceived}} derivatives of Airbus's first airliner, the A300. [...] The A330 was developed in parallel with the four-engine A340, which shared many common airframe components but differed in <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines.</b> [...] Both airliners incorporated fly-by-wire flight control technology, first introduced on an Airbus aircraft with the A320, {{as well as the}} A320's six-display glass cockpit. In June 1987, after receiving orders from various customers, Airbus launched the A330 and A340. The A330 was Airbus's first airliner that offered a choice of three engines: General Electric CF6, Pratt & Whitney PW4000, and Rolls-Royce Trent 700.|$|E

500|$|Neither the Tu-4 nor the Tupolev Tu-80 {{were true}} {{intercontinental}} strategic bombers as they both lacked the range {{to attack the}} United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return. The Tu-85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel-efficient engines, a redesigned wing to increase the lift/drag ratio {{and the addition of}} more fuel. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> were considered before settling on the [...] Shvetsov ASh-2K, essentially two air-cooled ASh-82 radial engines paired together and the liquid-cooled [...] Dobrynin VD-4K six-bank inline engine, similar in configuration to the failed German Junkers Jumo 222. Both engines were given turbochargers and power-recovery turbines which converted them into turbo-compound engines. The Shvetsov design was preferred, but was not yet mature enough for use, and the VD-4K was selected. A lot of effort was put into refining the design of the wing in collaboration with TsAGI. It had an aspect ratio of 11.745 and a taper of 2.93 for optimum lift at high-altitudes. The Tu-85 carried [...] of fuel in 48 flexible tanks.|$|E

Claiming rule teams benefitted from less restrictive rules on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> {{that could be used in}} a season, and with larger fuel allowances during the races. Under the claiming rule, CRTs agree to allow up to four of their engines per season to be claimed, after a race, {{by one of}} the major manufacturer teams at a cost of €20,000 each including transmission, or €15,000 each for the engine alone. From the 2014 season, the CRT class was dropped in favour of an [...] "Open Class" [...] specification - allowing teams using the control ECU hardware and software certain benefits to increase their competitiveness.|$|E

The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> was increased to seven, six of [...] and one of [...] A third pumping station was soon required and was constructed between Water Street and the River Irwell. It had two accumulators, and six steam engines. Coal for the engines was delivered by boat, and it began operating on 14 October 1909. Although all three pumping stations were situated beside waterways, its water supply was obtained from boreholes. The borehole at Whitworth Street was [...] deep, and water at all three was raised by compressed air delivery systems, which lasted until 1948, when they were superseded by submersible pumps. By the 1930s, the system had grown to 35 miles (56km) of pipes working some 2400 machines.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the largest bore and stroke, the [...] AMX 390 motor also received heavier main bearing support webbing and a forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods. Forged cranks and rods were used for their known strength—there was inadequate time for testing cast parts for durability without delaying AMC's introduction schedule. Once forging dies were made it was not cost effective to test cast parts due to the relatively low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> produced. The use of these stronger components was also continued with the production of 401 engines. This is an advantage of these AMC engines when used in heavy-duty and high-performance applications {{because they have no}} problems with their rods breaking; unlike other domestic automakers' large displacement small block engines.

2500|$|For {{the small}} BMW business, the large orders {{received}} from the Reichswehr for the BMW IIIa engine were overwhelming. Under Karl Rapp, only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> had been produced and the manufacturing facilities were {{not in any way}} adequate to handle the mass production now required. Not only did BMW lack suitable machine tools but, to a very large degree, skilled manpower as well. However, the most serious drawback was in the small and aging workshops. Nevertheless, under the state-controlled war economy, officials in the relevant ministries were able to give BMW extensive practical support. So in a short time BMW got the skilled workers and machinery it needed. In addition, the Munich company received a high level of financial assistance, which enabled it to build a completely new factory from the ground up, in the immediate vicinity of the old workshops. [...] Due to the share capital being too small, both the building of the new plant and the working capital needed for materials and wages had to be financed with external funds, i.e. bank loans or state assistance. The war ministries of Bavaria and Prussia (then both separate kingdoms within the Kaiser’s Empire) did not, however, wish to go on supporting BMW with loans and guarantees, and therefore urged the flotation of a public limited company.|$|E

60|$|If you set a brick on end {{and thrust}} it over, you can predict with {{certainty}} in what direction it will fall, and what attitude it will assume. If, again setting it up, you put {{another on the}} top of it, you can no longer foresee with accuracy the results of an overthrow; and on repeating the experiment, no matter how much care is taken to place the bricks in the same positions, and to apply the same degree of force in the same direction, the effects will on no two occasions be exactly alike. And in proportion as the aggregation is complicated by the addition of new and unlike parts, will the results of any disturbance become more varied and incalculable. The like truth is curiously illustrated by locomotive engines. It is a fact familiar to mechanical engineers and engine-drivers, that out of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>engines</b> built as accurately as possible to the same pattern, no two will act in just the same manner. Each will have its peculiarities. The play of actions and reactions will so far differ, that under like conditions each will behave in a somewhat different way; and every driver has to learn the idiosyncrasies of his own engine before he can work it to the greatest advantage. In organisms themselves this indefiniteness of mechanical reaction is clearly traceable. Two boys throwing stones will always differ more or less in their attitudes, as will two billiard-players. The familiar fact that each individual has a characteristic gait, illustrates the point still better. The rhythmical motion of the leg is simple, and on the Cuvierian hypothesis, should react on the body in some uniform way. But in consequence of those slight differences of structure which consist with identity of species, no two individuals make exactly similar movements either of the trunk or the arms. There is always a peculiarity recognizable by their friends.|$|E
