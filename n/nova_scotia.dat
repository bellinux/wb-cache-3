5|$|The former {{hurricane}} passed near southern Quebec as {{a tropical}} depression, and later crossed southern <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> as an extratropical cyclone. Along Lake Ontario, winds reached 51mph (81km/h), and in Montreal, winds reached 21mph (33km/h). After a dry summer, the storm's accompanying rainfall was beneficial, reaching 4.4in (112mm) in Fredericton, New Brunswick and 2in (50mm) in Halifax, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> The rains helped farmers in Ontario and assisted firefighters in New Brunswick and <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> In Montreal, 2.4in (60mm) of rainfall flooded a tunnel. Gusty winds knocked down power lines in portions of Quebec, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia,</b> and <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> Overall effects were minor, limited to some utility damage and delays for shipping.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Fort Cumberland (also {{known as}} the Eddy Rebellion) was an attempt by {{a small number of}} militia {{commanded}} by Jonathan Eddy to bring the American Revolutionary War to <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> in late 1776.

5|$|As Helene {{approached}} Atlantic Canada in {{the process}} of transitioning into an extratropical storm, it produced heavy rainfall and strong winds along the islands. Passing just east of <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> on September29, Helene dropped at least 1in (25mm) across the entire province, peaking at 3.48in (88.5mm) in Cape Breton Island. Gusts peaked at 50mph (80km/h) across Cabot Strait, 70mph (115km/h) at CFB Shearwater and 60mph (100km/h) at Summerside, Prince Edward Island. The storm damaged power lines on the island but they were quickly repaired. The strong winds uprooted trees in the Halifax and Dartmouth, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> area. In <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia,</b> Helene's worst effects were felt in Cape Breton Island, where the storm was considered the worst in at least 21years. Only one communication line from the island to the mainland was effective after the storm passed. Numerous downed power lines resulted in minor fires, and schools were closed throughout the island. In Sydney, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia,</b> there was considerable property damage, and as many as 700people lost power. The lack of sufficient electricity forced the suspension of publications of the Cape Breton Post and disrupted normal restaurant cooking procedures. Damages in the community amounted to C$100,000. Offshore, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police cutter Fort Walsh, measuring 115ft (35m) in length, was washed ashore on the coast of Scatarie Island. The fishing wharf in Caribou, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> was destroyed by rough seas generated by Helene, and at least 1,000lobster traps were carried into the Northumberland Strait as a result. In New Brunswick, the hurricane's impacts were relatively minor, and rainfall peaked at 1.56in (39.5mm).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{gradually}} {{losing its}} tropical characteristics, Gustav brought heavy rain, storm and hurricane-force winds, and storm surges to areas of Atlantic Canada for several days. Strong winds knocked down trees and damaged docks in <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia,</b> and a wind gust of 75mph (122km/h) was reported on Sable Island. Gusts to over 60mph (100km/h) {{were reported in}} Newfoundland for several days after the center of Gustav {{moved out of the}} area. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 0.3–2.7inches (10–70mm), with a maximum of 4inches (102mm) in Ashdale, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> Several locations set new daily rainfall records. Localized flooding was reported in areas of Prince Edward Island, and 4,000people in Halifax, <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island were left without power. Despite the heavy rain and wind, there were no reports of deaths or significant damage in Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Eddy {{believed}} that with military {{assistance from the}} Thirteen Colonies, {{he might be able}} to bring down the strongly Loyalist administration of <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> Early in 1776, Eddy went to Massachusetts in an attempt to interest political and military leaders there in supporting action in <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia,</b> while Allan worked to raise interest in <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia.</b> Allan's work was made more difficult by the arrival of Colonel Goreham and his troops to refortify Fort Cumberland, and by the activities of Michael Francklin, a former Lieutenant Governor of <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> and a vocal Loyalist. Eddy returned empty-handed to <b>Nova</b> <b>Scotia</b> in June 1776, only to learn that Goreham had put a price on his head. The activities of Goreham's Fencibles in the Cumberland area were successful enough that Patriot activities there were effectively forced underground; the center of these activities was shifted to Maugerville in part as a consequence of this. Goreham, a veteran of the French and Indian War, was also able to blunt Patriot inroads in the native communities, where the Mi'kmaq refused to take sides, and the Maliseet and Passamaquoddy, at first supportive of the Patriots, ultimately did not turn out in the numbers Eddy had hoped for or been promised.|$|E
