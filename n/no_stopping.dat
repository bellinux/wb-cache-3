25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, there would be <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet {{there would be no}} real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that it was perfectly reasonable for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E
25|$|What they {{objected to}} was {{arbitrary}} obstacles, artificial limitations upon {{the freedom of}} each member of this frontier folk to work out his own career without fear or favor. What they instinctively opposed was the crystallization of differences, the monopolization of opportunity and the fixing of that monopoly by government or by social customs. The road must be open. The game must be played according to the rules. There must be no artificial stifling of equality of opportunity, no closed doors to the able, <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> the free game before it was played to the end. More than that, there was an unformulated, perhaps, but very real feeling, that mere success in the game, by which the abler men were able to achieve preëminence gave to the successful ones no right to look down upon their neighbors, no vested title to assert superiority {{as a matter of}} pride and to the diminution of the equal right and dignity of the less successful.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did {{not wait}} on the Revolution in France. The {{individuals}} in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by the}} revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E

Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> me. And I think some of the guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam toured relentlessly {{in support}} of Ten. Ament stated that [...] "essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour," [...] adding, [...] "We told the record company, 'We know we {{can be a great}} band, so let's just get the {{opportunity}} to get out and play.'" [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Madonna {{was working}} with {{producer}} Reggie Lucas on her debut album. She had already composed three songs, when Lucas brought {{one of his own}} compositions to the project, calling it [...] "Borderline". However, after recording the song, Madonna was unhappy with the final version. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. This led to a dispute between the two. After finishing the album, Lucas left the project without altering the songs to Madonna's specifications. Hence, Madonna brought her then boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix [...] "Borderline" [...] and two other recorded tracks. On hearing the final version, Seymour Stein, head of Sire Records declared, [...] "I dared to believe {{this was going to be}} huge beyond belief, the biggest thing I'd ever had, after I heard 'Borderline'... The passion that she put into that song, I thought, there's <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> this girl." ...|$|E

500|$|Blige's {{seasoned}} soul {{coupled with}} Bey's creamy delivery is a mood to behold." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that Beyoncé [...] "act as a Greek chorus" [...] to the song. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle noted that [...] "Love a Woman" [...] is a soulful, old-school ballad [...] "that {{brings out the}} best in both singers". Writing that Blige is [...] "particularly heavy" [...] on the R vibes of the song, Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine further commented that [...] "without a doubt, it's sure to gain some stream whenever radio DJs catch wind of it. Why? Because 'Love a Woman' features silky production, strong harmonies, and guest vocals from Beyoncé. Yeah, there's <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> this one." [...] Katie Hasty of HitFix commented that [...] "It's actually a pretty standard list of grievances and explanations, but the real guts of the thing is when the two light up, to bring out the best vocal performances in each other, shooting you straight back to the 1990s." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now gave a mixed review for the song saying that it aims [...] "for posterity rather than chemistry". Similarly, Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly described the duet as [...] "snoozy".|$|E
500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say {{he wanted to talk}} to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E

2500|$|A {{planning}} commission {{meeting was}} held on May 3 to decide if they would approve skyscrapers that break the height limit. Executive director of the commissioners, Barbara J. Kaplan, said the project had [...] "substantial merit" [...] and [...] "that {{there is an opportunity}} here we should not pass up." [...] She cited that the project would create 12,000 jobs and US$15 million in tax revenue. Opponent Lee Copeland, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Fine Arts, said the height limit was [...] "a kind of Philadelphia golden rule {{which is part of the}} spirit and tradition of our past." [...] The meeting ended with the commission deciding to prevent buildings taller than City Hall while it studies the issue for one year. In May, the Philadelphia City Council announced its support for the project because of the jobs it would create. On June 13, Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode came out in favor of the project. He proposed the creation of a special ordinance that would allow buildings taller than City Hall between 16th and 20th Streets and the north side of Chestnut Street and the south side of John F. Kennedy Boulevard. Upset at the mayor's support for the project, Edmund Bacon resigned from a commission about Philadelphia's future. Bacon called the complex [...] "a total disaster," [...] adding that, [...] "It absolutely decimates the scale of Center City, and once it's been done, there's <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Simpson {{starred in}} his own improv, hidden-camera prank TV show, Juiced. Typical of the genre, Simpson would play a prank on {{everyday}} people while secretly filming them {{and at the end}} of each prank, he would shout, [...] "You've been Juiced!" [...] Less typical, each episode opened with topless strippers dancing around Simpson, who is dressed as a pimp. He sings his own rap song, which includes the lyrics [...] "Don't you know there's <b>no</b> <b>stopping</b> the Juice / When I'm on the floor I'm like a lion on the loose / Better shoot me with a tranquilizer dart / Don't be stupid, I'm not a Simpson named Bart." [...] In one episode, Simpson is at a used car lot in Las Vegas where he attempts to sell his white Bronco (made famous during the chase in Los Angeles prior to his arrest). A bullet hole in the front of the SUV is circled with his autograph, and he pitches it to a prospective buyer by saying that if they [...] "ever get into some trouble and have to get away, it has escapability." [...] In another sketch called [...] "B-I-N-G-O.J.", Simpson pretends to be having an affair with another man's girlfriend. Later he transforms into an old white man whose dying wish is to call a game of bingo. [...] "Juiced" [...] aired as a one-time special on pay-per-view television and was later released on DVD.|$|E
