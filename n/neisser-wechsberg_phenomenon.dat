40|$|Although the <b>Neisserâ€”Wechsberg</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{resembles the}} {{inhibition}} of agglutination systems by excess antibody, the experimental results {{have indicated that}} with heat-inactivated antiserum the phenomenon results both from an excess of specific antibody and of non-specific anti-complementary activity. Complement (C) {{has been shown to}} be fixed in the presence of the excess antiserum which inhibits the bactericidal reaction. The inhibition was overcome by an excess of the third complement component factors indicating that the excess of antiserum interfered with the activation or function of the components acting at one of the late steps in the reaction sequence. The prozone phenomenon was relatively slight when unheated antiserum was used or when sensitized organisms were washed to remove serum substances unrelated to antibody. Non-specific anti-complementary activity, therefore, is a major contributor to the prozone phenomenon. Both IgM and IgG fractions of rabbit antisera elicited a prozone although the former had relatively greater bactericidal than inhibitory activity...|$|E
40|$|A {{photometric}} method {{was used to}} measure the bactericidal kinetics for Brucella abortus of freshly drawn rabbit blood during the time before clotting. This antibrucellar activity varied between rabbits in different immunologic states. Nonimmunized rabbits had moderate bactericidal activity after a lag of about 2 min. The blood of some immunized rabbits gave an immediate and strong kill, but in certain other immunized rabbits, especially when hyperimmunized, the bactericidal activity was inhibited. It appeared that serum bactericidins and complement are sometimes as active in unclotted blood as they are in serum. However, this bactericidal activity can be either increased or neutralized by immunization. The prozone bactericidal inhibition <b>phenomenon</b> (<b>Neisser-Wechsberg)</b> found in immune serum may, in fact, reflect inhibition taking place in vivo. Inhibition of the bactericidal activity in blood can contribute to the persistence of chronic infections and individual variations in resistance...|$|R
