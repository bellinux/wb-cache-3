40|$|Nitric oxide (NON) is {{generated}} by the innate immune response to neutralize pathogens. NON and its autoxidation products have an extensive biochemical reaction network that includes reactions with iron-sulfur clusters, DNA, and thiols. The fate of NON inside a pathogen depends on a kinetic competition among its many targets, and is of critical importance to infection outcomes. Due {{to the complexity of}} the NON biochemical network, where many intermediates are short-lived and at extremely low concentrations, several species can be measured, but stable products are non-unique, and damaged biomolecules are continually repaired or regenerated, kinetic models are required to understand and predict the outcome of NON treatment. Here, we have constructed a comprehensive kinetic model that encompasses the broad reactivity of NON in Escherichia coli. The incorporation of spontaneous and enzymatic reactions, as well as damage and repair of biomolecules, allowed for a detailed analysis of how NON distributes in E. coli cultures. The model was informed with experimental measurements of NON dynamics, and used to identify control parameters of the NON distribution. Simulations predicted that NON dioxygenase (Hmp) functions as a dominant NON consumption pathway at O 2 concentrations as low as 35 mM (microaerobic), and interestingly, loses utility as the <b>NON</b> <b>delivery</b> rate increases. We confirmed these predictions experimentally by measuring NON dynamics in wild-type and mutant cultures at different <b>NON</b> <b>delivery</b> rates and O 2 concentrations.

40|$|Summary	Distribution {{power systems}} {{experience}} {{a lot of}} faults due to high network utilisation and reduced investment in the infrastructure. Single phase faults are the most common. The standard distribution systems are radial operated. Failure of any one component in the series path would result into service disruption to all customers located downstream. Current methods used to localise faults are manual and lengthy. For permanent faults, {{it is a common}} practice to sectionalise a feeder to reduce the fault investigation area. The exact location of the fault is obtained by visual inspection. However, with the introduction of the new marketing policy resulting from deregulation and liberalisation of the power industry, utility companies are required to compensate consumers for <b>non</b> <b>delivery</b> of service. Distribution networks also records high growth rates due to new customer connections arising from increased demand for electric energy. An increase in consumption introduces transmission constraints on the distribution network, demanding for reinforcement on the main circuits. The penetration of distributed production facilities intends to curtail such investment costs and provide continuity of supply to the affected customers while the fault is being resolved. The objective of the thesis was to investigate the impacts caused by different power system configurations and parameters on automatic single phase fault localisation in power systems with distributed production using power frequency quantities. It was also required to reveal the present ground fault protection schemes and recommend requirements on a system with distributed generation. The approach used in the thesis included informal conversation, field research, literature review on similar topics, modelling and simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC software. A field research was conducted in Zambia on the pretext of understanding the problem from a practical perspective. The main focus was placed on power system configuration and layout, current methods used to localise faults and fault statistics. Secondary research on automated fault localisation methods for distribution systems based on fundamental power frequency quantities was done. Much of the literature available focuses on typical radial distribution feeders. In the thesis, two different methods were used in the simulation of distances to the fault location so that the findings could be consolidated. One of the methods is a standard approach used in numerical distance protection relays and the other, was derived, taking into account the presence of a distributed generator. The distribution system can be solidly grounded, ungrounded, grounded through an arc suppression coil or through a resistor. Each type of grounding configuration has its own impact on fault localisation. Different system grounding possibilities were used in the model when investigating the effect of parameter change, on fault localisation. Simulation results revealed that the distances to the fault locations are affected by all parameters selected for investigation. An increase in load with the same load angle was seen to have an impact of reducing the distance to the fault. An increase in the fault resistance had an effect of increasing the distance to the fault location. Moving the distributed generator away from the substation was seen to have had an effect of reducing the distance to the fault location. However, investigations were carried out without compensation for any of the parameters. This could have contributed to inaccuracies in the results obtained. While automatic localisation of ground faults is at the premium, it is required to minimise damages at the fault position and neighbouring equipment so that restoration of supply is prompt. This could be achieved with effective operation of the protection system. Integration of distributed production facilities can affect the dynamic behaviour of the distribution network and change the power flow. This affects operation of the conversional protection schemes deployed on the radial distribution systems. Therefore, protection schemes with a directional feature are recommended in order to improve selectivity. It can be deduced that precise ground fault localisation based on the use of power frequency quantities is a challenge due to many influencing parameters. However, automated fault localisation in power systems with distributed production is the future solution, especially from the operational perspective...|$|E

Compared to classical realtime media applications (voice over IP (VoIP) /conferencing) and <b>non</b> real-time file <b>delivery,</b> these interactive software applications have unique characteristics: 1) they are delay sensitive yet demand in order and reliable data delivery, and 2) the traffic is usually bursty. Traditional window based congestion control does not work well for interactive applications because the bursty arrival of data leads to bursty network traffic, which causes additional queuing delay and packet loss in the network which reduces its delay performance. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid window plus rate based congestion control technique. This algorithm improves the delay performance of interactive applications by preventing congestion induced loss and minimizing queuing delay while still fully utilizing network capacity and maintaining fairness across multiple flows.

The public policy practices of trying to internalize, regulate, or mitigate the consequences {{of economic and social}} exploitation have failed to define the true cost of exploitation. Public policy needs a different process of managing environmental assets that maintains biodiversity concurrent with economic and social sustainability. ^ This dissertation provides a public policy process for environmental asset management that incorporates scientific and cultural criteria. The model uses scientific criteria as a base for the cultural criteria of social organization. By using an open systems approach, a management model emerges that incorporates the requirements of sustainability for the ecosystem and the human community. ^ A Social Fabric Matrix approach is used to model the open systems which capture the deliveries and the levels of the interaction between human and environmental systems. Deliveries to the environmental system must be governed by scientific criteria, because ecosystems do not respond to monetary signals. Deliveries to the cultural system can be broken down into the receiving institutions. This allows value ranking to occur with the proper measurement, whether it be monetary, legal, or moral ranking. The value ranking of the deliveries based on the society 2 ̆ 7 s moral code is important to the well being of the community. ^ This dissertation provides two techniques, qualitative interviews and conjoint analysis, to incorporate the <b>non</b> monetary <b>deliveries</b> into the management of environmental assets.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{determine}} the care pathways {{and implications of}} offering mothers the choice of external cephalic version (ECV) at term for singleton babies who present with an uncomplicated breech pregnancy versus assisted breech delivery or elective caesarean. Design A prospective observational audit to construct a decision analysis of uncomplicated full term breech presentations. Setting The North Staffordshire NHS Trust. Subjects All women (n = 176) who presented at full term with a breech baby without complications during July 1995 and June 1997. Main outcome measures The study determined to compare the outcome {{in terms of the}} costs and cost consequences for the care pathways that resulted from whether a women chose to accept the offer of ECV or not. All the associated events were then mapped for the two possible pathways. The costs were considered only within the hospital setting, {{from the perspective of the}} health care provider up to the point of delivery. Results The additional costs for ECV, assisted breech delivery and elective caesarean over and above a normal birth were £ 186. 70, £ 425. 36 and £ 1, 955. 22 respectively. The total expected cost of the respective care pathways for "ECV accepted" and "ECV not accepted" (including the probability of adverse events) were £ 1, 452 and £ 1, 828 respectively, that is the cost of delivery through the ECV care pathways is less costly than the <b>non</b> ECV <b>delivery</b> care pathway. Conclusions Implementing an ECV service may yield cost savings in secondary care over and above the traditional delivery methods for breech birth of assisted delivery or caesarean section. The scale of these expected cost savings are in the range of £ 248 to £ 376 per patient. This converts to a total expected cost saving of between £ 43, 616 and £ 44, 544 for the patient cohort considered in this study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{resistance}} of pancreatic cancer cells is a wellknown phenomenon that occurs mainly {{as a result}} of active survival mechanisms sometimes associated with the <b>non</b> efficacious <b>delivery</b> of drugs due to the fibrosis which is the major constituent of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} organ functions - normally at a pH of approximately 7. 4 - are strongly affected by the disruption of pH homeostasis; this is due to the fact that the organs contain a large number of enzymes with pH sensitive catalytic activity. In contrast, the extracellular pH decreases to below 6. 5 in the central regions of solid tumors because of the accumulation of lactate, and this phenomenon is due to poor vascularization [4, 5] associated with an increase in tumor specific aerobic glycolysis combined with impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [6]. The diminished pH within the tumor is an additional cause of chemotherapy resistance for pancreatic tumors. Finally, other local pancreatic substances may participate in the spread of the tumors. For example, the local renin angiotensin system (RAS) promotes angiogenesis and proliferation via vascular endothelial growth factor expression or epidermal growth factor receptor expression [7, 8]. The synergistic inhibition of tumor growth has been demonstrated in experimental animals by combining the administration of gemcitabine and losartan which are able to cause vascular endothelial growth factor suppression [9] and induce apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells by the inhibition of RAS [10, 11]. Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative strategies and novel therapeutics for the effective treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer - which constitutes the major part of the currently diagnosed pancreatic ductal carcinomas [12] - and three papers recently published on these topics are of particular interest...|$|R

Beside endosome escape and nuclear import, plasmid DNA (pDNA) migration in the cytosol toward the nuclear envelope is also {{regarded as a}} limiting step for efficient DNA transfection with non-viral vectors. Here, the interaction between E 3 - 14. 7 K and FIP- 1 to favor migration of pDNA along microtubules is exploited. E 3 - 14. 7 K is an early protein of human adenoviruses that interacts via FIP- 1 (Fourteen. 7 K Interacting Protein 1) protein with the light-chain components of the human microtubule motor protein dynein (TCTEL 1). This peptide is conjugated with pDNA and mediates interaction of pDNA in vitro with isolated microtubules {{as well as with}} microtubules in cellulo. Videomicroscopy and tracking treatment of images clearly demonstrate that P 79 - 98 /pDNA conjugate exhibits a linear transport with large amplitude along microtubules upon 2 h transfection with polyplexes whereas control pDNA conjugate exhibits small non-directional movements in the cytoplasm. Remarkably, P 79 - 98 /peGFP polyplexes enhance by a factor 2. 5 (up to 76 %) the number of transfected cells. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that the transfection efficiency of polyplexes can be drastically increased when the microtubules migration of pDNA is facilitated by a peptide allowing pDNA docking to TCTEL 1.

In the study herein, we have investigated the usefulness of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to get structural data about five polycationic carbohydrates demonstrated as promising gene delivery agents. A particular {{attention was paid to}} determine the influence of charge states as well as both fluoranthene reaction time and supplementary activation (SA) on production of charge reduced species, fragmentation yield, varying from 2 to 62 %, as well as to obtain the most higher both diversity and intensity of fragments, according to charge states and targeted compounds. ETD fragmentation appeared to be mainly directed toward pending group rather than carbohydrate cyclic scaffold leading to a partial sequencing for building blocks when amino groups are close to carbohydrate core, but allowing to complete structural deciphering of some of them, such as those including dithioureidocysteaminyl group which was not possible with CID only. Such findings clearly highlight the potential to help the rational choice of the suitable analytical conditions, according {{to the nature of the}} gene delivery molecules exhibiting polycationic features. Moreover, our ETD-MS/MS approach open the way to a fine sequencing/identification of grafted groups carried on various sets of oligo-/polysaccharides in various fields such as glycobiology or nanomaterials, even with unknown or questionable extraction, synthesis or modification steps.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Effective {{treatment}} for atrophic (depressed) and icepick acne scars requires treatment of both epidermis—for roughness, texture and hyperpigmentation, and the dermis—for collagen remodeling. All first generation radiofrequency systems allow nonablative RF treatment {{while a few}} others allow simple bipolar Fractional RF skin resurfacing. The FDA cleared multisource radiofrequency therapy system (EndyMed PRO, EndyMed Ltd., Cesarea, Israel) allows, for the first time, phase controlled multisource RF for both deep (up to 11 mm) non ablative RF and fractional RF skin resurfacing on the same treatment device. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Ten subjects with atrophic acne scars {{were enrolled in the}} study. Patients were photographed using standardized methods. In each treatment session, each patient received a full face 3 DEEP non ablative skin tightening treatment followed by a Fractional skin resurfacing treatment. The treatment sessions were repeated once a month to a total of up to 4 treatments. Results: All subjects experienced mild-moderate edema and erythema as an immediate response to treatment. Edema resolved after up to three hours post treatment and erythema lasted up to 2 days. Micro ablative crusts were formed 1 - 2 days post treatments and lasted up to 5 days on facial areas. Patients' photographs—before each treatment session and 1 and 3 months after the last session—were graded according to the accepted Cosmetic Improvement Scale. All patients obtained significant skin improvement. Seventy percent of patients had 50 % - 75 % improvement one month after the third treatment session while the other thirty percent experienced a 25 % - 50 %. Discussion and Conclusions: The presented results describe {{for the first time a}} new treatment system (EndyMed PROTM) that allows both deep <b>non</b> ablative RF <b>delivery</b> and Fractional skin resurfacing on the same treatment platform. This work shows the synergy of combining these two applications for the improvement of acne scars, as well as for some secondary possible pigmentation and vascular improvement...|$|R
40|$|Background : Numerous {{research}} {{have been made}} to find out contributive factors of the exclusive breastfeeding. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} find out whether mothers’ nutritional status had any influence on the exclusivity of breastfeeding and  on the growth of their babies up to 4 months. Methods: This observational study was carried out with a prospective cohort design and lasted from November 2004 to May 2005. The subjects were 80 pairs of mother and baby treated at the Obstetric and Gynecology Unit (UPF) of Local Public Hospital (RSUD) Prof. Dr. W. Z. Johannes at Kupang – NTT. The subjects were divided into two groups namely Undernutrition status group marked by 23, 5 cm. Observed babies were those of normal or spontaneous <b>delivery,</b> <b>non</b> twin with > 2500 g birth weight. Follow up observations were made at family home and the data on breastfeeding characteristics were collected by interview, babies weight were measured by Secca baby scale with 0, 01 kg level of accuracy mid arm-circumference was measured by means of LILA tape, and body length was measured using length-board. Tools measure with 0, 1 cm level of accuracy. Some statistical tests were used namely Chi-Square; student’s t-test; and while Kaplan Meier log-rank test as needed. Results: More than 50 % of under-nutrition mothers were under 25 years old. Chi-Square test shows that significant difference between mother’s age was (p= 0, 04). More than 50 % of the KEK group gave birth for the first time or ‘primipara’ (p= 0, 25). Kaplan Meier analysis showed that  there was no difference between survival median of breastfeeding be- tween the both group (p= 0, 53). t-test showed that there were significant differences of the babies body weight of the both KEK and non KEK mothers, namely pd” 0, 01, p= 0. 01, and p= 0. 03 in the first, second, third, and the fourth month respectively. In terms of the average babies body length, the t-test also showed significant differences between both groups with p= 0. 02 and p= 0. 01 in the third and the fourth month respectively. Conclusion: I can be concluded that mother’ nutrition status did not have any influence on the exclusivity of breastfeeding, however, it did significantly influence babies growth from 0 - 4 month...|$|R
40|$|Establishing {{efficient}} {{methods for}} local administration of drugs {{to the inner}} ear has great clinical relevance {{for the management of}} inner ear disorders. However, the administration route remains a critical issue. The most feasible approach for a <b>non</b> invasive drug <b>delivery</b> to the inner ear is application of medication to the middle ear cavity on the promise that it will diffuse through the thin round window membrane (RWM) separating the inner ear from the middle ear cavity. Gene therapy represents a promising future in otology and offers an exciting therapeutic alternative as it could be used in prevention or management of cochlear disorders. Also for a gene therapy approach, RWM application seems most feasible administration route. Exploring and characterizing the RWM route of administration is thus a fundamentally important area of research for the development of future treatment of inner ear disorders. The objectives of the thesis were to evaluate the efficacy of two drug and gene delivering vehicles to the inner ear, sodium hyaluronate (HYA) and chitosans, which {{can be applied to the}} cochlea. Ultimate aim is to establish an efficient drug delivery system and gene transfection for the inner ear. HYA and chitosans loaded with the ototoxic drug neomycin as tracer for drug release have been instilled into the middle ear of the guinea pigs. Effects on RWM and cochlear hair cells were evaluated after a single instillation of HYA (day 7 and 28), chitosans and saline solution (day 7). The hearing organ was analysed for hair cell loss and the thickness and ultrastructural properties of the RWM were analysed by light and transmission electron microscopy. The in vitro transfection efficiency of chitosan was tested by exposing organotypic cultures of the organ of Corti, prepared from postnatal day 2 rats, to chitosan carrying plasmid DNA (pDNA). The in vivo transfection efficiency was tested at one day or seven days after infusing chitosan/pDNA polyplexes with the use of osmotic pumps into the cochlea of adult guinea pigs. Tissue analysis was made by immunohistochemsitry and RT-PCR. HYA and chitosans, especially glycosylated derivative, are safe vehicles that can be used for drug transport into the inner ear through the RWM. Both vehicles successfully released the loaded neomycin, which exerted toxic effects on cochlear hair cells in a degree depending on the concentrations used. The vehicles per se had no noxious effect on the cochlear hair cells but they provoked a comparable effect on the thickness and morphology of the RWM. The thickness of the RWM returned to normal 4 weeks after exposure to HYA. Chitosan as a carrier for inner ear transfection, was associated with inconsistent transfection in vitro and in vivo. The importance of the RWM as a portal for local therapy of inner ear disorders is highlighted in this thesis by focusing on efficiency and effects of the vehicles, applied to the RWM for delivering biologically active agents into the cochlea. The difficulties and variability associated with applying substances to the RWM were explored. The results of this thesis add new knowledge concerning mechanisms of passage of biologically active agents through the RWM and may help us to better understand the role of RWM in the local cochlear therapy and problems of local treatment of inner ear diseases...|$|R
