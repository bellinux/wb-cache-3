5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s {{to the early}} 1980s, a number of German, Dutch and Swiss {{settlers}} were attracted to Banagher, mainly because of its proximity to the River Shannon and associated lifestyle. A number of these are still resident in Banagher. As {{with the majority of}} towns and cities in Ireland, Banagher has seen an influx of foreign nationals, mostly of Eastern European origin, in recent years and these <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> just over 10% of the population.|$|E

25|$|Currently, a {{specialist}} physician in the United States may {{be described as}} an internist. Another term, hospitalist, was introduced in 1996, to describe US specialists in internal medicine who work largely or exclusively in hospitals. Such 'hospitalists' <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> about 19% of all US general internists, who are often called general physicians in Commonwealth countries.|$|E
25|$|Seedless cultivars <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the {{overwhelming}} majority of table grape plantings. Because grapevines are vegetatively propagated by cuttings, the lack of seeds does not present a problem for reproduction. It is an issue for breeders, who must either use a seeded variety as the female parent or rescue embryos early in development using tissue culture techniques.|$|E
25|$|The town of Telford {{was created}} by the merger and {{expansion}} of older, small towns to the north and east of The Wrekin. These towns now have sizeable populations that <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the population of Telford: Wellington (20,430), Madeley (17,935), Dawley (11,399) and Oakengates (8,517), but the Telford and Wrekin borough towns incentive aims to make Oakengates into the largest of the towns.|$|E

25|$|In 1872, the {{sparkling}} wine Cava {{was invented in}} the Penedès region and eventually became an internationally recognized wine style. When phylloxera hit the region {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, Catalonia's vineyards comprised over 80% red wine grapes. The growing Cava industry encouraged planting of more white wine grapes, in place of the diseased red rootstock, where they <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> nearly 70% of the region's vineyards.|$|E
25|$|Migrants from Punjab began {{settling}} in Karachi {{in large numbers}} in the 1960s, and <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> an estimated 14% of Karachi's population.

25|$|Red Deer is home {{to almost}} 1,800 recent {{immigrants}} (arriving between 2001 and 2006) who <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> just more than {{two percent of the}} population. About sixteen percent of these immigrants came from the Philippines, while about 14% came from Colombia, 8% came from India, seven percent came from the United States, and about five percent from each of South Africa and the United Kingdom, and about four percent from El Salvador.|$|E
25|$|About 290 {{million years}} ago, in the Carboniferous period, an ice age engulfed {{the area as}} glaciers {{advanced}} from the polar region eroding and transporting rocks. These rocks were deposited as extensive moraines and glacial till, or they sank in the sea while the glacier floated in a layer of ice. When the glacial sediments were turned into stone they formed the rocks that <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the Fitzroy Tillite Formation in the Falklands. Identical rocks are found in southern Africa.|$|E
25|$|The Jews in French North Africa {{were awarded}} French {{citizenship}} by the 1870 Crémieux Decree. They were therefore {{considered part of}} the European pieds noirs community in spite of having been established in North Africa for centuries, rather than subject to the Indigénat status imposed on their former Muslim neighbors. Most consequently moved to France in the late 1950s and early 1960s after Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria became independent, and they <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a majority of the French Jewish community.|$|E
50|$|Government House in Battleford, Saskatchewan {{served as}} the seat for the {{government}} of the Northwest Territories between 1878 and 1883 (the area that <b>now</b> <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> Saskatchewan was part of the Northwest Territories until the province was created in 1905).|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{small-scale}} Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries {{early in the}} 20th century with the only substantial aliyah coming from Yemen and Syria. Prior {{to the creation of}} Israel in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the Arab world. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled North Africa, 15–20% in the Kingdom of Iraq, approximately 10% in the Kingdom of Egypt and approximately 7% in the Kingdom of Yemen. A further 200,000 lived in Pahlavi Iran and the Republic of Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Another newer technology, {{thin-film}} PV, {{are manufactured}} by depositing semiconducting layers on substrate in vacuum. The substrate is often glass or stainless-steel, and these semiconducting layers {{are made of}} many types of materials including cadmium telluride (CdTe), copper indium diselenide (CIS), copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS), and amorphous silicon (a-Si). After being deposited onto the substrate the semiconducting layers are separated and connected by electrical circuit by laser-scribing. Thin-film photovoltaics <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> around 20% of the overall production of PV because of the reduced materials requirements and cost to manufacture modules consisting of thin-films as compared to silicon-based wafers.|$|E
25|$|After its quick {{industrial}} growth, Italy took a {{long time}} to confront its environmental problems. After several improvements, it now ranks 84th in the world for ecological sustainability. National parks cover about 5% of the country. In the last decade, Italy has become one of the world's leading producers of renewable energy, ranking as the world's fourth largest holder of installed solar energy capacity and the sixth largest holder of wind power capacity in 2010. Renewable energies <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> about 12% of the total primary and final energy consumption in Italy, with a future target share set at 17% for the year 2020.|$|E
50|$|The former town of Prescott, Massachusetts, {{was named}} in his honor. The town was disincorporated in 1938 {{as part of}} the {{building}} of the Quabbin Reservoir, and the land <b>now</b> <b>makes</b> <b>up</b> Prescott Peninsula, which divides the main branches of the reservoir.|$|R

25|$|Sino-Xenic or Sinoxenic pronunciations are regular {{systems for}} reading Chinese in Japan, Korea and Vietnam, {{originating}} in medieval {{times and the}} source of large-scale borrowings of Chinese words into the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, none of which are genetically related to Chinese. The resulting Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> {{a large part of the}} lexicons of these languages. The pronunciation systems are used alongside modern varieties of Chinese in historical Chinese phonology, particularly the reconstruction of the sounds of Middle Chinese. Some other languages, such as Hmong–Mien and Tai-Kadai languages, also contain large numbers of Chinese loanwords but without the systematic correspondences that characterize Sino-Xenic vocabularies.|$|E
25|$|Sydney {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} real estate markets globally. It is only second to Hong Kong with the average property costing 14 times the annual Sydney Salary as of December 2016. A range of heritage housing styles can be found throughout Sydney. Terrace houses are found in the inner suburbs such as Paddington, The Rocks, Potts Point and Balmain–many of which have been the subject of gentrification. These terraces, particularly those in suburbs such as The Rocks, were historically home to Sydney's miners and labourers. In the present day, terrace houses <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> some of the most valuable real estate in the city.|$|E
25|$|Tongyong Pinyin was the {{official}} romanization system in Taiwan, but its use was voluntary. The romanization system that one encounters in Taiwan {{varies according to}} the government authority that administers the facility. Street signs in most areas use Tongyong Pinyin, including the cities of Kaohsiung, Tainan, and surrounding counties. A contrast could be seen in the two entities that <b>now</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the municipality of Taichung—Taichung County used Tongyong Pinyin while Taichung City has used Hanyu Pinyin since at least 2004. Taipei uses only Hanyu Pinyin. Taipei County (now New Taipei City) used Tongyong Pinyin, but in Taipei Metro stations, Tongyong Pinyin was given in parentheses after Hanyu Pinyin. Modified Wade–Giles spellings are still popularly used for many proper names, especially personal names and businesses.|$|E
