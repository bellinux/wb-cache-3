The methodology presented in this paper inherits most of the advantages possessed by the 0 scheme.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 For cell-like upper semicontinuous(usc) decompositions G of finite {{dimensional}} manifolds M, the decomposition space M/G {{turns out}} to be an ANR provided M/G is finite dimensional ([Dav 07], page 129). Furthermore, if M/G is finite dimensional and has the Disjoint Disks Property (DDP), then M/G is homeomorphic to M ([Dav 07], page 181). For an infinite dimensional M modeled on I∞, we can construct cell-like usc decompositions G associated with defining sequences. But it is more complicated to check whether M/G is an ANR. We need an additional special property of the defining sequence. To check whether or not M/G is homeomorphic to M is even more difficult. We need M/G to be an ANR which has the DDP and which also satisfies the Disjoint Cech Carriers Property. We give a specific cell-like decomposition X of the Hilbert Cube Q with the following properties: The <b>nonmanifold</b> part N of X is complicated {{in the sense that it}} is homeomorphic to a Hilbert Cube of codimension 1 in Q. X is still a factor of Q because X × I² ≅ Q. If A is any closed subspace of N of codimension ≥ 1 in N, then the decomposition of Q over A is homeomorphic to Q. In particular, the <b>nonmanifold</b> nature of X is not detectable by examining closed subsets of codimension ≥ 1. This example is produced by combining mixing techniques for producing a <b>nonmanifold</b> space whose <b>nonmanifold</b> part is a Cantor set, with decompositions arising from a generalized Cantor function...|$|E

40|$|Summary. We {{present a}} data {{structure}} which {{is able to}} represent heterogeneous 3 -dimensional polytopal cell complexes and is general enough to also represent <b>nonmanifolds</b> without incurring undue overhead. Extending the idea of half-edge based data structures for two-manifold surface meshes, all faces, i. e. the two-dimensional entities of a mesh, are represented {{by a pair of}} oriented half-faces. The concept of using directed half-entities enables inducing an orientation to the meshes in an intuitive and easy to use manner. We pursue the idea of encoding connectivity by storing first-order top-down incidence relations per entity, i. e. for each entity of dimension d, a list of links to the respective incident entities of dimension d− 1 is stored. For instance, each half-face as well as its orientation is uniquely determined by a tuple of links to its incident halfedges or each 3 D cell by the set of incident half-faces. This representation allows for handling non-manifolds as well as mixed-dimensional mesh configurations. No entity is duplicated according to its valence, instead, it is shared by all incident entities in order to reduce memory consumption. Furthermore, an array-based storage layout i...|$|R

Although small angles {{inherent in the}} input geometry cannot be removed, one would like {{to find a way}} to triangulate a domain without creating any new small angles. Unfortunately, this problem is not always soluble. I discuss how mesh generation algorithms based on Delaunay refinement can be modified to ensure that they always produce a mesh, and to ensure that poor quality triangles or tetrahedra appear only near small input angles. 1 Introduction The Delaunay refinement algorithms for triangular mesh generation introduced by Jim Ruppert [4] and Paul Chew [1] are almost entirely satisfying in theory and in practice.

40|$|Implicit {{surfaces}} in 3 D geometric modeling {{are limited to}} two manifolds because the corresponding implicit fields are usually defined by real-valued functions which bisect space into interior and exterior. We present a novel method of modeling <b>nonmanifold</b> surfaces by implicit representation. Our method allows discontinuity of the field function and assesses the special meaning of the locus where the function is not differentiable. The enhancement can yield a non-manifold surface with such features as holes and boundaries. The discontinuous field function also enables multiple classification of the field, which {{makes it possible to}} represent branches and intersections of the implicit surfaces. The implicit field is polygonized by the algorithm based on the marching cubes algorithm, which is extended to treat discontinuous fields correctly.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{automatic}} generation of solid models {{based on a}} grammatical paradigm. It introduces a formalism, boundary solid grammars, for this purpose. In this formalism, a set of geometric rules is applied to an initial solid model to generate a language or family of solids. A rule may match on {{a portion of the}} boundary of a solid, and then modify the solid or add new solids. Genesis is presented as an implementation of the formalism. A number of grammars have been constructed to demonstrate the concepts and usefulness of the formalism. These grammars generate simple geometric forms including snodakes, recursive octahedra, “fractali mountains, and spirals. Another grammar generates stereo lithography support structures. Queen Anne houses have been characterized with a more extensive grammar. Grammars are also being developed to generate housings for small computers and structural designs for high rise buildings.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to broaden implicit surface modeling. The implicit surfaces usually employed in computer graphics are two dimensional manifolds because they are defined by real-valued functions that impose a binary regionalization of space (i. e., an inside and an outside). When tiled, these surfaces yield edges of degree two. The new method allows the definition of implicit surfaces with boundaries (i. e., edges of degree one) and intersections (i. e., edges of degree three or more). These non-manifold implicit surfaces are defined by a multiple regionalization of space. The definition includes a list of those pairs of regions whose separating surface is of interest. Also presented is an implementation that converts a <b>nonmanifold</b> implicit surface definition into a collection of polygons. Although following conventional implicit surface polygonization, there are significant differences that are described in detail. Several example surfaces are defined and polygonized.

40|$|Abstract — Methods that {{faithfully}} and robustly {{capture the}} geometry of complex material interfaces in labeled volume data are important for generating realistic and accurate visualizations and simulations of real-world objects. The generation of such multimaterial models from measured data poses two unique challenges: first, the surfaces must be well-sampled with regular, efficient tessellations that are consistent across material boundaries; and second, the resulting meshes must respect the <b>nonmanifold</b> geometry of the multimaterial interfaces. This paper proposes a strategy for sampling and meshing multimaterial volumes using dynamic particle systems, including a novel, differentiable representation of the material junctions that allows the particle system to explicitly sample corners, edges, and surfaces of material intersections.

Given a domain geometry and a node-spacing function, spheres are packed on geometric entities, namely, vertices, edges, faces, and volumes, in ascending order of dimension. Once the domain is filled with spheres, mesh nodes are placed at the centers of these spheres and are then connected by constrained Delaunay triangulation and tetrahedrization.
