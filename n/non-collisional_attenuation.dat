40|$|In {{the past}} three decades the thermal noise {{spectroscopy}} was recognized as a fruitful tool of space plasma diagnostics. Some examples of application of this diagnostic method can be found, for example, in [1]. It is well known that random irregularities of electron density always present in real plasma. Irregularities substantially change properties of the me-dium with relation to electromagnetic radiation and they may also influence quasi-thermal noise spectrum detected by antenna. What is the physical mechanism of this influence? It is known, that fluctuations in plasma are closely con-nected with plasma dissipative properties. From the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, random irregularities in plasma may be thought as non-thermal large-scale (in comparison with characteristic time and scale of particle motion) fluctua-tions. These may considerably change collisional term in kinetic equation and, consequently, velocity distribution func-tion. The change in distribution function will lead to change in the noise spectrum. From the viewpoint of electrody-namics, random irregularities change averaged dielectric properties of the medium. It means that in the media with ran-dom irregularities the roots of dispersion equation are shifted with relation to undisturbed values and even new roots may appear (see, for example, [2]). The imaginary part of these roots may also be considerably changed due to addi-tional <b>non-collisional</b> <b>attenuation</b> caused by scattering of waves in random medium. In the present paper we will assume that noise spectrum in the random me-dium may be calculated using the tensor of effective dielectric permittivity...|$|E
