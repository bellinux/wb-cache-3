Export non-migas, {{which is one of}} Indonesian 2 ̆ 7 s main exports, includes the horticulture sector. Indonesian 2 ̆ 7 s foreign trading operations will obviously {{have an impact on the}} development of the regional trading segments,without an exception for Bali Province.

We use {{data from the}} Consumer Expenditure Surveys of the 1980 s to {{consider}} the effect of demographic change on past and future U. <b>S.</b> saving <b>rates.</b> Our findings indicate that demographic change may significantly alter the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rate</b> of national saving and current account position over the next 50 years.

While demographics is a potentially very important factor in explaining saving, it does not appear to explain the drop in the U. <b>S.</b> saving <b>rate</b> in the 1980 s. What happened to U.

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, the {{performance}} of the labour market in Canada has improved both in absolute terms and relative to the United States. In 1995 the unemployment rate in Canada averaged 9. 6 per cent, a full 4. 2 percentage points above the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rate.</b> Seven years later in 2002, the unemployment rate in Canada was 7. 6 per cent, compared to 5. 8 per cent in the United States – a gap of only 1. 8 percentage points. 2 Other labour market indicators also reflect this relative improvement. The employment-to-population ratio, for example, rose in Canada from 58. 8 per cent in 1995 to 61. 5 per cent in 2002, while in the United States this ratio fell marginally over the same period from 62. 9 per cent to 62. 7. The relative improvement in Canada’s labour market in recent years contrasts with the relative underperformance over the previous 15 years. After tracking the U. <b>S.</b> unemployment <b>rate</b> quite closely through the 1950 s, 1960 s and 1970 <b>s,</b> the unemployment <b>rate</b> in Canada averaged about 2 per centage points above the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rate</b> in the 1980 s, and this gap widened to about 4 percentage points by the mid- 1990 s. 1 We are grateful for helpful comments and suggestions from Bob Fay, John Helliwell and participants at the June 2003 CEA Meetings in Ottawa.

40|$|California’s {{housing market}} ended on a {{stronger}} note in 2011 and {{shows signs of}} improvement for 2012. A robust recovery is not forecast until 2013. 1 Despite six years of decline in housing prices, the State still lacks an adequate supply and mix of housing, in the right locations, and affordable to families, the workforce and special needs populations. Furthermore, the affordability of rental housing in many markets has gradually deteriorated due to falling incomes and rising rents. Regarding affordability of ownership housing, financing remains difficult for many due to tight lending requirements. Prior to the foreclosure crisis and current economic downturn, frequently {{referred to as the}} Great Recession, California had experienced decades of undersupply, contributing to significant price escalation and worsening affordability. The University of Southern California (USC) Population Dynamics Research Group found that while the recession of the early 1990 s was most devastating with regard to poverty and unemployment, the housing price declines, construction downturn, and foreclosures have been worse in the Great Recession of the mid- 2000 s. This recession worsened the effect of long term inadequate supply and affordability problems and has not been offset by vacant units resulting from foreclosures, or from depressed market conditions. While the housing market is stabilizing, its recovery may be different from previous crises and is being shaped by new market conditions and shifting trends. Without fail, the supply and affordability issues are present more than ever. “We expect a modest growth in housing starts for the balance of the year at approximately one quarter of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>rate</b> … predominantly multifamily housing.
