5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin <b>nucleation</b> cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new <b>nucleation</b> core. Actin <b>nucleation</b> is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The <b>nucleation</b> core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a <b>nucleation</b> core. However, de novo <b>nucleation</b> followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 {{complex is}} {{composed}} of seven subunits: Arp2, Arp3, p41/ARPC1, p34/ARPC2, p21/ARPC3, p20/ARPC4, p16/ARPC5. The subunits Arp2 & Arp3 closely resemble monomeric actin allowing for a thermodynamically stable actin-like dimer. p41 has been proposed to interact with <b>nucleation</b> promoting factors (NPFs) because it is only known to have minor contacts with the mother filament {{and there is a}} major loss of <b>nucleation</b> efficiency in the absence of p41. p34 and p20 dimerize to form a structural backbone that mediates the interaction with the mother filament. p21 forms a bridge between Arp3 and the mother filament, increasing <b>nucleation</b> efficiency. p16 tethers Arp2 {{to the rest of the}} complex.|$|E
5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous <b>nucleation</b> of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate <b>nucleation</b> sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E
5|$|Dislocation {{diffusion}} {{occurs when}} adjacent sub-units of a cluster {{move in a}} row-by-row fashion through displacement of a dislocation. As shown in figure 11(a) the process begins with <b>nucleation</b> of the dislocation followed by what is essentially sequential displacement on a concerted basis.|$|E
5|$|Some ionic liquids, {{particularly}} with mixtures of anions or cations, can be cooled rapidly enough {{that there is}} not enough time for crystal <b>nucleation</b> to occur, so an ionic glass is formed (with no long-range order).|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 complex {{simultaneously}} controls <b>nucleation</b> of actin polymerization and branching of filaments. Moreover, autocatalysis {{is observed}} during Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. In this process, {{the newly formed}} filaments activate other Arp2/3 complexes, facilitating the formation of branched filaments.|$|E
5|$|The effect {{explains}} supersaturation of vapors. In {{the absence}} of <b>nucleation</b> sites, tiny droplets must form before they can evolve into larger droplets. This requires a vapor pressure many times the vapor pressure at the phase transition point.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous <b>nucleation,</b> where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous <b>nucleation,</b> where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
5|$|Two of its subunits, the Actin-Related Proteins ARP2 and ARP3 closely {{resemble}} {{the structure of}} monomeric actin and serve as <b>nucleation</b> sites for new actin filaments. The complex binds {{to the sides of}} existing ("mother") filaments and initiates growth of a new ("daughter") filament at a distinctive 70 degree angle from the mother. Branched actin networks are created {{as a result of this}} <b>nucleation</b> of new filaments. The regulation of rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton is important for processes like cell locomotion, phagocytosis, and intracellular motility of lipid vesicles.|$|E
5|$|Other headgroups {{are also}} present {{to varying degrees}} and can include {{phosphatidylserine}} (PS) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). These alternate headgroups often confer specific biological functionality that is highly context-dependent. For instance, PS presence on the extracellular membrane face of erythrocytes is a marker of cell apoptosis, whereas PS in growth plate vesicles {{is necessary for the}} <b>nucleation</b> of hydroxyapatite crystals and subsequent bone mineralization. Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic interactions of small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>nucleation</b> processes. Gases {{preferentially}} condense onto surfaces of pre-existing aerosol particles, known as heterogeneous <b>nucleation.</b> This process causes the diameter at the mode of particle-size distribution to increase with constant number concentration. With sufficiently high supersaturation and no suitable surfaces, particles may condense {{in the absence of a}} pre-existing surface, known as homogeneous <b>nucleation.</b> This results in the addition of very small, rapidly growing particles to the particle-size distribution.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{temperature}} – The {{surface temperature}} {{has a large}} effect on the <b>nucleation</b> density. Generally, the <b>nucleation</b> density decreases as the temperature is increased. Heating of the surface can involve a heating plate {{or the use of}} a CO2 laser.|$|E
25|$|In PLD, a large {{supersaturation}} {{occurs on}} the substrate during the pulse duration. The pulse lasts around 10–40 microseconds {{depending on the}} laser parameters. This high supersaturation causes a very large <b>nucleation</b> density on the surface as compared to molecular beam epitaxy or sputtering deposition. This <b>nucleation</b> density increases the smoothness of the deposited film.|$|E
25|$|A tectonic {{earthquake}} begins by an initial rupture {{at a point}} on the fault surface, {{a process known as}} <b>nucleation.</b> The scale of the <b>nucleation</b> zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the <b>nucleation</b> involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion make it very difficult to record information close to a <b>nucleation</b> zone.|$|E
25|$|Hoffmann has {{furthermore}} {{argued that}} a complex <b>nucleation</b> event as {{the origin of life}} involving both polypeptides and nucleic acid is compatible with the time and space available in the primitive oceans of Earth Hoffmann suggests that volcanic ash may provide the many random shapes needed in the postulated complex <b>nucleation</b> event. This aspect of the theory can be tested experimentally.|$|E
25|$|Water freezes to form ice {{crystals}} that provide sites for <b>nucleation,</b> accelerating gelling of the fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. Heterogeneous <b>nucleation</b> and tribonucleation {{are considered the}} most likely mechanism for bubble formation. Homogeneous <b>nucleation</b> requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, {{but it is not}} yet clear if these can grow to symptomatic dimensions as they are very stable.|$|E
25|$|Bubble {{formation}} {{occurs in}} the blood or other tissues. One of the hypothetical loci of bubble <b>nucleation</b> is in crevices in macromolecules.|$|E
25|$|Nucleating {{factors are}} {{necessary}} to stimulate actin polymerization. One such nucleating factor is the Arp2/3 complex, which mimics a G-actin dimer in order to stimulate the <b>nucleation</b> (or formation of the first trimer) of monomeric G-actin. The Arp2/3 complex binds to actin filaments at 70 degrees to form new actin branches off existing actin filaments. Arp2/3-mediated <b>nucleation</b> is necessary for directed cell migration. Also, actin filaments themselves bind ATP, and hydrolysis of this ATP stimulates destabilization of the polymer.|$|E
25|$|An initial {{burst of}} {{effervescence}} {{occurs when the}} sparkling wine contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate <b>nucleation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Application of {{a bubble}} model in 1985 allowed {{successful}} modelling of conventional decompressions, altitude decompression, no-stop thresholds, and saturation dives using one setting of four global <b>nucleation</b> parameters.|$|E
25|$|Substrate surface – The <b>nucleation</b> {{and growth}} can be {{affected}} by the surface preparation (such as chemical etching), the miscut of the substrate, as well as the roughness of the substrate.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{parameters}} – {{several factors}} such as the laser fluence , laser energy, and ionization degree of the ablated material will affect the film quality, the stoichiometry, and the deposition flux. Generally, the <b>nucleation</b> density increases when the deposition flux is increased.|$|E
25|$|The common {{ingredient}} {{appears to}} be cold temperatures, although the presence of traces of other chemicals such as <b>nucleation</b> inhibitors for anhydrous calcium carbonate may also be required. It has also been reported as forming in winter on Hokkaido at a saline spring.|$|E
25|$|Harrisite texture, first {{described}} from the locality of Harris Bay, Rùm, Scotland, is formed by <b>nucleation</b> of crystals {{on the floor}} of the lava flow chamber. Harrisites are known to form megacrystal aggregates of pyroxene and olivine up to 1 metre in length.|$|E
25|$|Moche {{history may}} be broadly {{divided into three}} periods – the {{emergence}} of the Moche culture in Early Moche (100–300 AD), its expansion and florescence during Middle Moche (300–600 AD), and the urban <b>nucleation</b> and subsequent collapse in Late Moche (500–750 AD).|$|E
25|$|Background {{pressure}} – Common in oxide deposition, {{an oxygen}} background {{is needed to}} ensure stoichiometric transfer from the target to the film. If, for example, the oxygen background is too low, the film will grow off stoichiometry which will affect the <b>nucleation</b> density and film quality.|$|E
25|$|As zeolites are metastable, certain {{frameworks}} may be inaccessible as <b>nucleation</b> cannot {{occur because}} more stable and energetically favourable zeolites will form. Post-synthetic modification {{has been used}} to combat this issue with the ADOR method, whereby frameworks can be cut apart into layers and bonded back together by either removing silica bonds or including them.|$|E
25|$|To make {{glass from}} {{materials}} with poor glass forming tendencies, novel techniques {{are used to}} increase cooling rate, or reduce crystal <b>nucleation</b> triggers. Examples of these techniques include aerodynamic levitation (cooling the melt whilst it floats on a gas stream), splat quenching (pressing the melt between two metal anvils) and roller quenching (pouring the melt through rollers).|$|E
25|$|Some cell types, such as plant cells, do {{not contain}} well defined MTOCs. In these cells, microtubules are {{nucleated}} from discrete sites in the cytoplasm. Other cell types, such as trypanosomatid parasites, have a MTOC but it is permanently found {{at the base of}} a flagellum. Here, <b>nucleation</b> of microtubules for structural roles and for generation of the mitotic spindle is not from a canonical centriole-like MTOC.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} tungsten deposition from the WF6/SiH4 are high speed, good adhesion and layer smoothness. The drawbacks are explosion hazard and high {{sensitivity of the}} deposition rate and morphology to the process parameters, such as mixing ratio, substrate temperature, etc. Therefore, silane is commonly {{used to create a}} thin tungsten <b>nucleation</b> layer. It is then switched to hydrogen, that slows down the deposition and cleans up the layer.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic ikaite was {{discovered}} {{in the nineteenth century}} in a study by Pelouze. Ikaite is only thermodynamically stable at moderate pressures, so when found near the earth’s surface is always metastable..6H2O) from 0° to 25 °C|volume=101 |year=1992 |pages= 21–33 |doi=10.1086/648194 |bibcode=1993JG....101...21B}}.6H2O (ikaite) |journal= Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume= 39 |pages=83–91 |doi=10.1016/0016-7037(75)90186-6 |bibcode = 1975GeCoA..39...83M }} Nevertheless, as it appears to be at least moderately common in Nature, {{it is clear that the}} conditions for metastable <b>nucleation</b> and growth cannot be too restrictive. Cold water is certainly required for formation, and <b>nucleation</b> inhibitors like phosphate ions for the growth of anhydrous calcium carbonate phases, such as calcite, aragonite, and vaterite probably aid its formation and preservation. It is thought that perhaps the structure of calcium carbonate in a concentrated aqueous solution also consists of an ion pair, and that this is why ikaite readily nucleates at low temperatures, outside of its thermodynamic stability range. When removed from its natural cold water environment, ikaite rapidly disintegrates into monohydrocalcite or anhydrous calcium carbonate phases and water, earning the nickname of the melting mineral.|$|E
25|$|Whereas mantle dentin forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the dental papilla, primary dentin forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous <b>nucleation</b> that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E
25|$|The bubbles {{which are}} {{small enough to}} pass through the lung {{capillaries}} may be small enough to be dissolved due to a combination of surface tension and diffusion to a lowered concentration in the surrounding blood, though the Varying Permeability Model <b>nucleation</b> theory implies that most bubbles passing through the pulmonary circulation will lose enough gas {{to pass through the}} capillaries and return to the systemic circulation as recycled but stable nuclei.|$|E
25|$|Settlement {{patterns}} {{as well as}} village {{plans in}} England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, nucleated villages across a swathe of central England. The chronology of nucleated villages is much debated and not yet clear. Yet there is strong {{evidence to support the}} view that <b>nucleation</b> occurred in the tenth century or perhaps the ninth, and was a development parallel to the growth of towns.|$|E
25|$|Closed {{shrinkage}} defects, {{also known}} as shrinkage porosity, are defects that form within the casting. Isolated pools of liquid form inside solidified metal, which are called hot spots. The shrinkage defect usually forms {{at the top of}} the hot spots. They require a <b>nucleation</b> point, so impurities and dissolved gas can induce closed shrinkage defects. The defects are broken up into macroporosity and microporosity (or microshrinkage), where macroporosity can be seen by the naked eye and microporosity cannot.|$|E
