5|$|The {{predictive}} or circadian system increases renal secretion {{of potassium}} during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, nighttime for rodents) {{independent of the}} presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.|$|E

The nuclei in the early pre-erythrocytic schizonts of Plasmodium cynomolgi are Feulgen-positive, notwithstanding an earlier report to the contrary...|$|R
5|$|WTTG and New York's WABD (later WNEW-TV, and now WNYW) survived as Metromedia-owned independents until 1986, when Metromedia was {{purchased}} by the News Corporation to form the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Fox Broadcasting Company. Clarke Ingram, who maintained a DuMont memorial site, has suggested that Fox {{can be considered a}} revival, or at least a linear descendant, of DuMont.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig in Estonia. S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E

5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of seepage of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American craton.|$|E
5|$|On February 4 and 5, Grant landed two {{divisions}} {{just north of}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. (The troops serving under Grant were the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union's successful Army of the Tennessee, although that name was not yet in use.) Grant's plan was to advance upon the fort on February 6 while it was being simultaneously attacked by Union gunboats commanded by Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote. A combination of accurate and effective naval gunfire, heavy rain, and the poor siting of the fort, nearly inundated by rising river waters, caused its commander, Brig. Gen. Lloyd Tilghman, to surrender to Foote before the Union Army arrived.|$|E

5|$|Other notable Irish {{physicists}} include Ernest Walton, {{winner of}} the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre Palace was altered {{frequently}} {{throughout the}} Middle Ages. In the 14thcentury, CharlesV converted the building into a residence and in 1546, FrancisI renovated {{the site in}} French Renaissance style. Francis acquired {{what would become the}} <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Louvre's holdings, his acquisitions including Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. After LouisXIV chose Versailles as his residence in 1682, constructions slowed; however, the move permitted the Louvre {{to be used as a}} residence for artists.|$|E

5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projectionâthe tuberoinfundibular pathway which {{goes to the}} pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{formed the}} <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Multinational Force Haiti (MNF Haiti) and Joint Task Force 190 (JTF 190) in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy. More than 8,600 of the division's troops deployed during this operation. On 19 September 1994, the 1st Brigade conducted the Army's first air assault from aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. This force consisted of 54 helicopters and almost 2,000 soldiers. They occupied the Port-au-Prince International Airport. This {{was the largest}} Army air operation conducted from a carrier since the Doolittle Raid in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The first Type UBI {{to enter}} service was UB-10, which formed the <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Flanders Flotilla, on 27 March 1915.

UB-10 was {{eventually}} joined in the Flanders Flotilla by UB-2, UB-4, UB-5, UB-6, UB-12, UB-13, UB-16, and UB-17; of these, only UB-2 made the journey to Flanders by sea rather than rail.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> cell bodies <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neurons <b>of</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{cranial nerves}} are {{contained}} {{in one or more}} nuclei in the brainstem. These nuclei are important relative to cranial nerve dysfunction because damage to these nuclei such as from a stroke or trauma can mimic damage to one or more branches of a cranial nerve. In terms of specific cranial nerve <b>nuclei,</b> <b>the</b> midbrain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brainstem has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oculomotor nerve (III) and trochlear nerve (IV); the pons has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trigeminal nerve (V), abducens nerve (VI), facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII); and the medulla has <b>the</b> <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), vagus nerve (X), accessory nerve (XI) and hypoglossal nerve (XII). <b>The</b> fibers <b>of</b> these cranial nerves exit the brainstem from these nuclei.|$|R

5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. The entorhinal cortex (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lithium atom verges on instability, {{since the}} two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The somatic motor fibers that {{innervate}} the laryngeal and pharyngeal {{muscles are}} located in the nucleus ambiguus and emerge from the medulla in the cranial root of the accessory nerve. Fibers cross over to and join the vagus nerve in the jugular foramen. Sensory cell bodies {{are located in}} the inferior jugular ganglion, and the fibers terminate in the solitary nucleus. Parasympathetic fibers to segments of the trachea and esophagus in the neck originate in the dorsal <b>nucleus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagus nerve.|$|E
