5|$|After {{months of}} speculation, on May 23, 1994, Top Rank {{successfully}} purchased the franchise for $152.5 million {{with the intention}} of relocating it to New Orleans. The purchase occurred following an agreement between Top Rank and Timberwolves ownership that allowed Top Rank to purchase the franchise if no local ownership groups were found by May 20, 1994. On June 6, 1994, Top Rank officially filed the paperwork to the NBA seeking to relocate the Timberwolves to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> the 1994–95 NBA season. The filings also identified Fred Hofheinz as the sole Top Rank stockholder, with Houston lawyer John O'Quinn and stockbroker Robert Higley serving as the team's major partners.|$|E
5|$|Fearful {{of arrest}} as a rebel once {{he left the}} Senate, Benjamin quickly {{departed}} Washington for New Orleans. On the day of Benjamin's resignation, the Provisional Confederate States Congress gathered in Montgomery, Alabama, and soon chose Davis as president.

At home in <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for,</b> it would prove, the last time, Benjamin addressed a rally on Washington's Birthday, February 22, 1861.

The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, becoming the group's tenth album {{to reach the top}} ten of the chart.

5|$|The New Orleans Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) {{were unable}} to play any home games for the entire 2005–06 season, after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, Louisiana on August 29, 2005, and caused {{extensive}} damage to the New Orleans Arena (now known as Smoothie King Center). The team temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, becoming the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets. After playing the majority of home games for both the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City, the Hornets returned to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in New Orleans {{began with the}} {{construction}} of the Hennan Building in 1895; this building, rising , is often regarded as the first skyscraper in New Orleans. The 20-story Hibernia Bank Building, constructed in 1921 at a height of , held the title of the tallest in <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> 44 years. But, for most of the 20th century, the skyline of New Orleans consisted of only low and mid-rise structures. The soft soils of New Orleans are susceptible to subsidence, and there was doubt about the feasibility of constructing large high-rises in such an environment.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, he {{remained}} at his alma mater, Minnesota, for one season {{as an assistant}} coach in 1914. Tulane University selected Shaughnessy as head football coach in 1915 over potential candidates Dana X. Bible and Charley Moran, among others. Notre Dame assistant coach Knute Rockne and Ray Morrison were both unable to travel to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> an interview, and Tulane officials required a face-to-face meeting with the applicants. The school offered Shaughnessy $1,875 ($ adjusted for inflation) to be its football, basketball, and track coach, and athletic director. When he arrived, he found the football field in a state of disrepair and the equipment to be woefully inadequate. Because the athletic department was in dire financial straits, Shaughnessy paid to purchase new equipment for the team. With only one opponent scheduled in the upcoming season, he wrote letters to sixty schools to secure additional games.|$|E

5|$|Destined {{to carry}} wheat and {{phosphate}} fertilizer, both ships sailed initially from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> St John's in October1941, {{to take on}} cargoes of wheat bound for Ireland. Since insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged higher premiums for ships not in convoy, the Irish Oak and the Irish Pine were painted war-time camouflage in preparation for sailing in-convoy. Irish Pine joined Convoy SC56 and arrived in Dublin on 11December1941. In contrast, Irish Oak experienced a number of serious mishaps and setbacks: Chief Engineer R. Marsh, of Dublin, {{suffered a heart attack}} and was hospitalised in New Orleans; another engineer, O’Keefe of Dún Laoghaire, was severely burned in a boiler room blow-back and hospitalised in StJohn; and a locally recruited Greek replacement engineer caused difficulties, was reported to the Canadian authorities by the captain, and jailed.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2010–11 season began, {{there was}} much {{anticipation}} around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami. Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw, but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler {{was traded to the}} Dallas Mavericks instead. Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright, and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless. Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns. Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis {{resigned}} his House seat {{in early}} June {{and raised a}} volunteer regiment, the 155th Infantry Regiment, becoming its colonel {{under the command of}} his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long enough for an important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles {{because it was the first}} to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014 off-season, Olshey signed center Chris Kaman and two-time former Blazer guard Steve Blake {{to bolster}} the bench. Expectations by sportswriters and analysts were high for the Trail Blazers going into the 2015 NBA season given their {{surprise}} success in 2013–14. The Blazers beat the reigning Northwest Division Champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 106–89, in their season opener at home on October 29, 2014. Like the season before, the Trail Blazers dominated the month of November, at one point winning nine straight games from November 9 to November 26 before being defeated by the Memphis Grizzlies. Injuries, which had not been significant the previous season, started to inflict themselves on various players. Starting center Lopez fractured his right hand {{in a game against}} the Spurs on December 15, 2014, and missed the next 23 games. Initially, the Blazers were much unfazed, winning 129–119 in triple overtime against the Spurs on December 19, a game that saw Lillard and Aldridge combine for 75 points on 29 field goals; Lillard netted a career-high 43 points. Four days later, Lillard hit a three-pointer to tie the game and force overtime against the Thunder en route to 40 points and a 115–111 victory. Three Blazers went to <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>for</b> the All Star Weekend: Matthews for the Foot Locker Three-Point Contest, Lillard as a reserve to the All-Star Game, and Aldridge as a starter to the All-Star game.|$|E
