5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit <b>nonvolatile</b> behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is sometimes {{the basis of}} accidental poisonings because the acid converts a <b>nonvolatile</b> cyanide salt into the gaseous HCN.|$|E
25|$|Plasticizers are, by mass, {{often the}} most {{abundant}} additives. These oily but <b>nonvolatile</b> compounds are blended in to plastics to improve rheology, as many organic polymers are otherwise too rigid for particular applications.|$|E
25|$|This salt is {{sometimes}} preferred over pure hydrazine {{because it is}} <b>nonvolatile</b> and less susceptible to atmospheric oxidation on storage. These properties have made it attractive {{for a variety of}} uses in the chemical industry and at some point as an alternative medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|To {{facilitate}} these tests, PCBs may {{be designed}} with extra pads to make temporary connections. Sometimes these pads must be isolated with resistors. The in-circuit test may also exercise {{boundary scan test}} features of some components. In-circuit test systems may {{also be used to}} program <b>nonvolatile</b> memory components on the board.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} route is by reaction of approximately equal masses of any nitrate salt such as sodium nitrate with 96% sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and distilling this mixture at nitric acid's boiling point of 83nbsp&°C. A <b>nonvolatile</b> residue {{of the metal}} hydrogen sulfate remains in the distillation vessel. The red fuming nitric acid obtained may be converted to the white nitric acid.|$|E
25|$|Another type of {{entrainer}} is {{one that}} has a strong chemical affinity for one of the constituents. Using again the example of the water/ethanol azeotrope, the liquid can be shaken with calcium oxide, which reacts strongly with water to form the <b>nonvolatile</b> compound, calcium hydroxide. Nearly all of the calcium hydroxide can be separated by filtration and the filtrate redistilled to obtain 100% pure ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission has}} yielded a {{significant}} science return, collecting {{a wealth of}} data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity. The VIRTIS spectrometer on board the Rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of <b>nonvolatile</b> organic macromolecular compounds everywhere {{on the surface of}} comet 67P with little to no water ice visible. Preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of concrete produces water vapor and carbon dioxide, which may further react with the metals in the melt, oxidizing the metals, {{and reducing the}} gases to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The {{decomposition of}} the concrete and volatilization of its alkali components is an endothermic process. Aerosols released during this phase are primarily based on concrete-originating silicon compounds; otherwise volatile elements, for example, caesium, can be bound in <b>nonvolatile</b> insoluble silicates.|$|E
25|$|Since at {{a minimum}} the {{starting}} code address vector must always be valid on reset, systems commonly included some <b>nonvolatile</b> memory (e.g. ROM) starting at address zero to contain the vectors and bootstrap code. However, for a general purpose system it is desirable for the operating system {{to be able to}} change the vectors at runtime. This was often accomplished by either pointing the vectors in ROM to a jump table in RAM, or through use of bank switching to allow the ROM to be replaced by RAM at runtime.|$|E
25|$|Saffron {{contains}} more than 150 volatile and aroma-yielding compounds. It also has many <b>nonvolatile</b> active components, {{many of which are}} carotenoids, including zeaxanthin, lycopene, and various α- and β-carotenes. However, saffron's golden yellow-orange colour is primarily the result of α-crocin. This crocin is trans-crocetin di-(β-D-gentiobiosyl) ester; it bears the systematic (IUPAC) name 8,8-diapo-8,8-carotenoic acid. This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin. Crocins themselves are a series of hydrophilic carotenoids that are either monoglycosyl or diglycosyl polyene esters of crocetin. Crocetin is a conjugated polyene dicarboxylic acid that is hydrophobic, and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is esterified with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are sugars, a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant α-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may comprise more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make α-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the <b>nonvolatile</b> fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl4) and bromide (RfBr4) {{as well as an}} oxychloride (RfOCl2). A decreased volatility was observed for [...] when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of <b>nonvolatile</b> [...] mixed salt.|$|E
500|$|Advancements in {{the field}} of {{chromatography}} arrived in 1953 with the invention of the gas chromatograph by Anthony T. James and Archer John Porter Martin, allowing for the separation of volatile liquid mixtures with components which have similar boiling points. [...] <b>Nonvolatile</b> liquid mixtures could be separated with liquid chromatography, but substances with similar retention times could not be resolved until the invention of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) by Csaba Horváth in 1970. [...] Modern HPLC instruments are capable of detecting and resolving substances whose concentrations are as low as parts per trillion.|$|E
500|$|High-performance liquid {{chromatography}} {{can be used}} to extract individual components from a mixture dissolved in a solution. [...] HPLC is used for <b>nonvolatile</b> mixtures that would not be suitable for gas chromatography. [...] This is useful in drug analysis where the pharmaceutical is a combination drug since the components would separate, or elute, at different times allowing for the verification of each component. [...] The eluates from the HPLC column are then fed into various detectors that produce a peak on a graph relative to its concentration as it elutes off the column. [...] The most common type of detector is an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer as the most common item of interest tested with HPLC, pharmaceuticals, have UV absorbance.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "green coffee bean" [...] {{refers to}} unroasted mature or {{immature}} coffee beans. These have been processed by wet or dry methods for removing the outer pulp and mucilage {{and have an}} intact wax layer on the outer surface. When immature, they are green. When mature, they have a brown to yellow or reddish color and typically weigh 300 to 330mg per dried coffee bean. <b>Nonvolatile</b> and volatile compounds in green coffee beans, such as caffeine, deter many insects and animals from eating them. Further, both <b>nonvolatile</b> and volatile compounds contribute to {{the flavor of the}} coffee bean when it is roasted. <b>Nonvolatile</b> nitrogenous compounds (including alkaloids, trigonelline, proteins, and free amino acids) and carbohydrates are of major importance in producing the full aroma of roasted coffee and for its biological action. Since the mid 2000s, green coffee extract has been sold as a nutritional supplement and has been clinically studied for its chlorogenic acid content and for its lipolytic and weight-loss properties.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} vendors, {{including}} Intel, Dell, and Microsoft, formed a Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface (NVMHCI) Working Group. The {{goal of the}} group is to provide standard software and hardware programming interfaces for <b>nonvolatile</b> memory subsystems, including the [...] "flash cache" [...] device connected to the PCI Express bus.|$|E
2500|$|... 2-Butoxyethanol is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula BuOC2H4OH (Bu = CH3CH2CH2CH2). This colorless liquid has a sweet, ether-like odor, as it {{derives from the}} family of glycol ethers, and is a butyl ether of ethylene glycol. [...] As a relatively <b>nonvolatile,</b> inexpensive solvent of low toxicity, it is used in many domestic and industrial products because of its properties as a surfactant.|$|E
2500|$|The matrix-assisted {{ionization}} (MAI) method uses matrix preparation {{similar to}} MALDI {{but does not}} require laser ablation to produce analyte ions of volatile or <b>nonvolatile</b> compounds. [...] Simply exposing the matrix with analyte to the vacuum of the mass spectrometer creates ions with nearly identical charge states to electrospray ionization. It is suggested that there are likely mechanistic commonality between this process and MALDI.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Krieger and Spitzer {{described}} dynamic doping of polymer and inorganic dielectric-like {{materials that}} improved the switching characteristics and retention required to create functioning <b>nonvolatile</b> memory cells. They used a passive layer between electrode and active thin films, which enhanced {{the extraction of}} ions from the electrode. It is possible to use fast ion conductor as this passive layer, which allows a significant reduction of [...] the ionic extraction field.|$|E
2500|$|These beetles {{make some}} use of pheromones to [...] "call" [...] each other, {{allowing}} for the large gatherings often seen in the autumn. [...] However, many cues are visual, both at long (picking out light-coloured structures that are distinct from their surroundings) and short (picking out pre-existing aggregations to join) ranges, while <b>nonvolatile</b> long-chain hydrocarbons laid down by previous aggregations also {{play a significant role}} in site selection. Both are more important than volatile pheromones.|$|E
2500|$|Stanford Robert Ovshinsky (November 24, 1922– October 17, 2012) was an American {{inventor}} and {{scientist who}} had been granted well over 400 patents over fifty years, mostly {{in the areas of}} energy and information. [...] Many of his inventions have had wide ranging applications. Among the most prominent are: an environmentally friendly nickel-metal hydride battery, which has been widely used in laptop computers, digital cameras, cell phones, and electric and hybrid cars; flexible thin-film solar energy laminates and panels; flat screen liquid crystal displays; rewritable CD and DVD discs; hydrogen fuel cells; and <b>nonvolatile</b> phase-change memory.|$|E
2500|$|A {{fossil fuel}} is a fuel formed by natural processes, such as {{anaerobic}} decomposition of buried dead organisms, containing energy originating in ancient photosynthesis. The {{age of the}} organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years. Fossil fuels contain high percentages of carbon and include petroleum, coal, and natural gas. [...] Other commonly used derivatives include kerosene and propane. Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon to hydrogen ratios like methane, to liquids like petroleum, to <b>nonvolatile</b> materials composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane {{can be found in}} hydrocarbon fields either alone, associated with oil, or in the form of methane clathrates.|$|E
2500|$|While on {{the surface}} or at snorkel depth, the {{submarine}} may use the submarine's auxiliary or emergency diesel generator for power or ventilation (e.g., following a fire). [...] The diesel engine in a 688 class can be quickly started by compressed air during emergencies or to evacuate noxious (<b>nonvolatile)</b> gases from the boat, although 'ventilation' requires raising a snorkel mast. During nonemergency situations, design constraints call for operators to allow the engine to reach normal operating temperatures before {{it is capable of}} producing full power, a process that may take from 20 to 30 minutes. However, the diesel generator can be immediately loaded to 100% power output, despite design criteria cautions, at the discretion of the submarine commander on the recommendation of the submarine's engineer, if necessity dictates such actions to: (a) restore electrical power to the submarine, (b) prevent a reactor incident from occurring or escalating, or (c) to protect the lives of the crew or others as determined necessary by the commanding officer.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>nonvolatile</b> acid (also {{known as}} a fixed acid or {{metabolic}} acid) is an acid produced in the body from sources other than carbon dioxide, and is not excreted by the lungs. They are produced from e.g. an incomplete metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. All acids produced in the body are <b>nonvolatile</b> except carbonic acid, which is the sole volatile acid. Common <b>nonvolatile</b> acids in humans are lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetoacetic acid, and beta-hydroxybutyric acid. Humans produce about 1-1.5 mmoles of H+ per kilogram per day. [...] The <b>nonvolatile</b> acids are excreted by the kidneys.
