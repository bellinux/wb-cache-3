25|$|They are low wing, T-tail {{airplanes}} with cabin pressurization, {{powered by}} two rear mounted turbofans. The landing gear is fully retractable {{and designed to}} be operated on paved runways only. The glass cockpit includes four multi-function displays. The operation is made through a flight management system with autopilot, autothrottle and closed-loop control and monitoring of flight controls Fly-By-Wire. The aircraft are certified for Day, <b>Night,</b> <b>VFR</b> and IFR <b>flights,</b> and are approved for reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) airspace and flight into known icing conditions, extended flight over water, Category II ILS, operations at high altitude airports up to 13800ft and steep approach operations.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> is permitted at night, {{and is known}} as <b>Night</b> <b>VFR.</b> This is generally permitted only under more restrictive conditions, such as maintaining minimum safe altitudes, and may require additional training as a pilot at night {{may not be able}} to see and avoid obstacles.|$|R
50|$|The ICAO {{definition}} of Special <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> is a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> cleared by {{air traffic control}} to operate within a control zone in meteorological conditions below visual meteorological conditions.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} procedures of <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> at high altitudes. It describes {{the division of}} airspace including the limitations applied and significant international organizations in relation to its management and organization. It also focuses on the rules for the execution of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights,</b> non-standard flights, and comparison of non-standard flights with adjacent states...|$|R
50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. IFR flights are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated from IFR flights and are provided traffic information about other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R

50|$|A few airways in less busy areas {{allowing}} mid-level military <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|Class D: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or <b>VFR.</b> All <b>flights</b> {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated from each other, and are given traffic information in respect of <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>Flights</b> operating under <b>VFR</b> are given traffic information in respect of all other flights.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not {{necessarily}} conducted on straight lines between ground-based radio navigation transmitters, the altitude restrictions for IFR flights are not applicable. Instead, a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> can be conducted using pilotage, watching landmarks to determine position and desired direction. In this situation, the minimum reception altitude becomes moot, and the over-riding concern is for obstacle clearance.|$|R
50|$|Class C: Operations may be {{conducted}} under IFR, SVFR, or VFR. All aircraft {{are subject to}} ATC clearance (country-specific variations notwithstanding). Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are separated {{from each other and}} from <b>flights</b> operating under <b>VFR,</b> but <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not separated from each other. <b>Flights</b> operating under <b>VFR</b> are given traffic information in respect of other <b>VFR</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the UK, airways are all class A below FL195 and {{therefore}} <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> are prohibited.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of SVFR is when a flight wishes to leave an airport in a control zone, to fly VFR in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, when the visibility is below the minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in the control zone but not below the lower minimum for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> in uncontrolled airspace. SVFR is never offered by Air Traffic Control. It must be requested by the Pilot in Command.|$|R
50|$|All {{aircraft}} entering class B airspace must obtain ATC clearance {{prior to}} entry {{and must be}} prepared for denial of clearance. Aircraft must be equipped with a two-way radio for communications with ATC and an operating Mode C transponder, furthermore aircraft overflying the upper limit of any class B airspace must have an operating Mode C transponder. Visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR)</b> <b>flights</b> may proceed under their own navigation after obtaining clearance but must obey any explicit instructions given by ATC. Some class B airspaces include special transition routes for <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> that require communication with ATC but may not require an explicit clearance. Other class B airspaces include VFR corridors through which <b>VFR</b> <b>flights</b> may pass without clearance (and without technically entering the class B airspace).|$|R
5000|$|Flights on visual <b>flight</b> rules (<b>VFR),</b> when in {{uncontrolled}} airspace, will [...] "squawk VFR" [...] (or conspicuity code in the UK, 1200 in the U.S., 7000 in Europe). Upon {{contact with}} an ATC unit, they will be told to squawk a certain unique code. When changing frequency, for instance because the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> leaves controlled airspace or changes to another ATC unit, the <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> will be told to [...] "squawk VFR" [...] again.|$|R

5000|$|The {{crash was}} {{investigated}} by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The investigation found that the crew, the aircraft and the carrier were properly certified and that the aircraft was properly loaded and fueled. They {{found that there was}} no malfunction of the aircraft and the engines were operating properly. The investigation also found that the crew filed a <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan when instrument weather conditions prevailed over the proposed route and that flight was conducted below the prescribed minimum altitude for <b>VFR</b> <b>night</b> operations. The probable cause was determined to be [...] "the captain's poor judgement in attempting a flight by visual reference during instrument weather conditions." ...|$|R

40|$|<b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC {{conditions}} {{accounts for}} over 10 % of general aviation fatalities each year. Recent {{research suggests that}} pilots may not properly assess weather conditions. New graphical weather information systems (GWISs) may positively or negatively influence pilot weather-related judgments. Since GWIS information is not always current {{it may not be}} veritical. In the current investigation twenty-four GA pilots made visibility and ceiling estimates of simulated weather conditions either with or without a GWIS display. Pilots generally overestimated weather conditions and their judgments were influenced by the GWIS. The results revealed an interaction between ceiling and visibility that suggests a new model for understanding <b>VFR</b> <b>flight</b> into IMC. The current results suggest an important area for future research into understanding pilots decisions to continue into deteriorating weather conditions. Results are discussed in terms of advancing aviation decision making models for understanding <b>VFR</b> into IMC <b>flight,</b> and the design of GWIS symbology to foster accurate assessments...|$|R
50|$|Flights must be {{conducted}} according to Visual Flight Rules (i.e. {{in sight of}} the ground and away from cloud). This includes both controlled and uncontrolled airspace.
