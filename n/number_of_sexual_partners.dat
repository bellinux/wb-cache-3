5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> {{resulting in a}} large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|HIV {{prevalence}} {{is increasing}} rapidly among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) in China and potentially associated with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> that each man has on average. This study estimates the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> male <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among Chinese MSM through a comprehensive review of English and Chinese published liter-ature. The overall median <b>number</b> <b>of</b> male sex-ual partners of Chinese MSM in the past 6 months China was estimated to be 1. 5 (95 % CI, 1. 1 - 1. 8) and 3. 8 (95 % CI 1. 5 - 6. 9) sexual part-ners in the past 6 -month and 12 -month periods respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{focus has}} been paid to the role of mental health among young people with regard to risky sexual {{behavior}} and HIV prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between poor mental health and risky sexual behavior (HIV/AIDS) among a population of university students in Uganda. METHODS: In 2005, 980 Ugandan university students completed a self-administered questionnaire (response rate 80 %) assessing sociodemographic and religious background factors, mental health, alcohol use, and sexual behavior. Mental health was assessed using items from the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist- 25 and the Symptom Checklist- 90. RESULTS: High scores on depression and high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among both males (odds ratio (OR) 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 2 - 3. 3) and females (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 8. 6) were significantly associated. Elevated anxiety scores among men were associated with high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 3) and inconsistent condom use (OR 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 3. 6). Psychoticism was also significantly associated with high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> among men. The associations remained statistically significant after controlling for sociodemographic factors and level of alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that previous conclusions on the association between sexual behavior and mental health from high- and middle-income countries also are valid in a low-income setting, such as in Uganda. This knowledge has implications for policy formation and HIV/AIDS preventive strategies. Coordinated youth-friendly mental health and sexual and reproductive health services to meet the needs of young people would be desirable...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{reliable}} and perplexing findings from surveys <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior is that men report substantially more <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> than women do. We use data from national sex surveys and studies of prostitutes and their clients in the United States to examine sampling bias as an explanation for this disparity. We find that prostitute women are underrepresented in the national surveys. Once their undersampling and very high <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> are factored in, the discrepancy disappears. Prostitution's role in the discrepancy is not readily apparent because men are reluctant to acknowledge that their reported partners include prostitutes...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at an earlier age have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} way of preventing STIs is by not having sex. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Safer sex practices such as use of condoms, having a smaller <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> and being in a relationship where each person only has sex with the other also decreases the risk. Circumcision in males may be effective to prevent some infections. Most STIs are treatable or curable. Of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis are curable, while herpes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and HPV are treatable but not curable. Resistance to certain antibiotics is developing among some organisms such as gonorrhea.|$|E
25|$|The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> {{people have}} had in their lifetimes varies widely within a population. A 2007 {{nationwide}} survey in the United States found the median number of female sexual partners reported by men was seven and the median number of male partners reported by women was four. The men possibly exaggerated their reported number of partners, women reported a number lower than the actual number, or a minority of women had a sufficiently larger number than most other women to create a mean {{significantly higher than the}} median, or all of the above (see Pareto principle). About 29% of men and 9% of women reported to have had more than 15 sexual partners in their lifetimes. Studies of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases consistently demonstrate {{a small percentage of the}} studied population has more partners than the average man or woman, and a smaller number of people have fewer than the statistical average. An important question in the epidemiology of sexually transmitted infections is whether or not these groups copulate mostly at random (with sexual partners from throughout a population) or within their social groups (assortative mixing).|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{epidemiological}} studies [...] have investigated sexual networks, {{and suggest that}} the statistical properties <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> networks are crucial {{to the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

2500|$|Risk {{factors include}} a [...] high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> (25% {{increase}} >= 6 partners), {{a history of}} oral-genital sex (125% >= 4 partners), or anal–oral sex, a female partner {{with a history of}} either an abnormal Pap smear or cervical dysplasia, chronic periodontitis, and, among men, decreasing age at first intercourse and history of genital warts.|$|E
2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of 115 program evaluations published in November 2007 by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy found that two-thirds of sex education programs focusing on both abstinence and contraception had {{a positive effect on}} teen sexual behavior.

2500|$|While abstinence-only sex {{education}} is a controversial subject, the fact that complete abstinence itself (even within marriage) {{is the most effective}} preventative measure against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections has never been in dispute.

[...] Various analyses show that abstinence-based programs have little to no effect on age of sexual initiation, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners,</b> or rates of abstinence, use of condoms, vaginal sex, pregnancy, or sexually transmitted diseases. In-depth research has shown that the A.O.U.M policy has little influence over preventing students from engaging in sexual activity, is ineffective in reducing [...] "sexual risk behaviors" [...] and fails to improve the health outcomes of increasing contraceptive use and decreasing teen pregnancy rates.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} and quantify the level <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> activity <b>of</b> the heterosexually active population of Quebec. METHODS: The data analysed included 2889 heterosexually active individuals aged 15 - 60 (agemed = 32) from a 1996 - 7 survey on the <b>sexual</b> lifestyles <b>of</b> {{the general population}} of Quebec. Various probability distributions were studied to assess their capacity to {{describe and}} quantify the lifetime and yearly <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> <b>of</b> the sampled population. To estimate the annual rates of new partner acquisition, a generalised linear model was fitted to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lifetime <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> as a function of age, years <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> activity, and sex. RESULTS: The mean and variance <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lifetime <b>sexual</b> <b>partners</b> for men (mean = 11, s 2 = 163) is higher than for women (mean = 6, s 2 = 72). The negative binomial and lognormal probability distributions give the most adequate fit to the lifetime <b>number</b> <b>of</b> partners for both agglomerated and stratified (by sex and age) data. The estimated annual rates of new partner acquisition provide two important results for prevention: (1) the first year <b>of</b> <b>sexual</b> activity represents the highest annual rate of new partner acquisition independent of age, (2) annual rates of new partner acquisitions increase through mid-life (ages 40 - 50) combined with a decrease in condom use. CONCLUSION: Problems caused by the use of large categories in the estimation of mean and variance cannot totally be overcome by fitting probability distributions to the empirical data despite good fits. Furthermore, we believe that adequate estimates of the annual rate of new partner acquisition should be a better measure of the risk of HIV infection than the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> partners since the first is a measure of incidence while the second is a measure of prevalence. ...|$|R
