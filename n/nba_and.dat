5|$|Following Jordan's departure, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, won the 1994 and 1995 NBA titles. During this period, Olajuwon {{became the}} only player in history to win the NBA MVP, NBA Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP awards in the same season. That was the only year that both the <b>NBA</b> <b>and</b> NHL finals went to seven games while {{involving}} teams from the same city, with the Rockets facing the New York Knicks in 1994. With their win in Game 7, the Rockets denied New York from winning both the <b>NBA</b> <b>and</b> NHL titles in the same year, as the New York Rangers won the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. After trading for Drexler midseason, the Rockets later swept an Orlando Magic team consisting of Shaquille O'Neal and Penny Hardaway in the 1995 Finals; Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP, and the Rockets became the fifth franchise to win back-to-back titles {{and became the first}} 6th-seeded team to win the title without enjoying home court advantage on any of their playoff series.|$|E

5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the <b>NBA</b> <b>and</b> FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
