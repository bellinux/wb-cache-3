25|$|Digital cameras sensors {{may have}} {{internal}} filters that block UV to improve color rendition accuracy.

25|$|Photolithography {{involves}} {{exposing a}} light source to a photoresist-coated silicon wafer; a mask with the desired pattern is {{place between the}} light source and the wafer, thereby selectively allowing light to filter through and create the pattern on the photoresist. Further development of the wafer brings out the pattern in the photoresist. Photolithography performed in the <b>near-UV</b> is often viewed as the standard for fabricating topographies on the micro-scale. However, because the lower limit for size {{is a function of}} the wavelength, this method cannot be used to create nanoscale features. In their 2005 study, Mahoney et al. created organized arrays of polyimide channels (11µm in height and 20–60µm in width) were created on a glass substrate by photolithography. Polyimide was used because it adheres to glass well, is chemically stable in aqueous solution, and is biocompatible. It is hypothesized that the microchannels limited the range of angles that cytoskeletal elements within the neurite growth cones could accumulate, assemble, and orient. There was a significant decrease in the number of neurites emerging from the soma; however, there was less decrease as the range of angles over which the neurites emerged was increased. Also, the neurites were on average two times longer when the neurons were cultured on the microchannels versus the controls on a flat surface; this could be due to a more efficient alignment of filaments.|$|E

50|$|In 2014, he {{discovered}} a functional endogenous optical network within the brain, mediated by neuropsin (OPN5). This self-regulating cycle of photon-mediated {{events in the}} neocortex involves sequential interactions among 3 mitochondrial sources of endogenously-generated photons during periods of increased neural spiking activity: (a) <b>near-UV</b> photons (~380 nm), a free radical reaction byproduct; (b) blue photons (~470 nm) emitted by NAD(P)H upon absorption of <b>near-UV</b> photons; and (c) green photons (~530 nm) generated by NAD(P)H oxidases, upon NAD(P)H-generated blue photon absorption.

If the yellow stripe is exposed to light, the potential difference between light and dark conditions increases. In dark conditions, the stripe decreases in electric potential.

In {{this case the}} survival curve for multicomplexes has no initial shoulder, suggesting that only the second recombinational repair process described above is active. The efficiency of repair by this process is indicated by the observation that a dose of MMC that allows survival of only 1 in 1,000 monocomplexes allows survival of about 70% of multicomplexes. Similar multicomplex survival curves (without shoulders) were also obtained for the DNA damaging agents P32 decay, psoralen plus <b>near-UV</b> irradiation (PUVA), N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) and nitrous acid.|$|E

50|$|Deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase (DNA photolyase) is a DNA repair enzyme. It binds to UV-damaged DNA {{containing}} pyrimidine dimers and, upon absorbing a <b>near-UV</b> photon (300 to 500 nm), {{breaks the}} cyclobutane ring joining the two pyrimidines of the dimer. DNA photolyase is an enzyme that requires two chromophore-cofactors for its activity: a reduced FADH2 and either 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTFH) or an oxidized 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (8-HDF) derivative (F420). The folate or deazaflavin chromophore appears {{to function as}} an antenna, while the FADH2 chromophore {{is thought to be}} responsible for electron transfer. On the basis of sequence similarities DNA photolyases can be grouped into two classes. The first class contains enzymes from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, the halophilic archaebacteria Halobacterium halobium, fungi and plants. Class 1 enzymes bind either 5,10-MTHF (E. coli, fungi, etc.) or 8-HDF (S. griseus, H. halobium).|$|E

The satellite carries a total of seven payloads with diverse objectives, including but not limited to, the coronal heating problem, solar wind acceleration, coronal magnetometry, origin and monitoring of <b>near-UV</b> solar radiation (which drives Earth's upper atmospheric dynamics and global climate), coupling of the solar photosphere to chromosphere and corona, in-situ characterizations of the space environment around Earth by measuring energetic particle fluxes and magnetic fields of the solar wind and solar magnetic storms that have adverse effects on space and ground-based technologies.|$|E
50|$|With {{nitrides}} containing aluminium, {{most often}} AlGaN and AlGaInN, even shorter wavelengths are achievable. Ultraviolet LEDs {{in a range}} of wavelengths are becoming available on the market. <b>Near-UV</b> emitters at wavelengths around 375-395 nm are already cheap and often encountered, for example, as black light lamp replacements for inspection of anti-counterfeiting UV watermarks in some documents and paper currencies. Shorter-wavelength diodes, while substantially more expensive, are commercially available for wavelengths down to 240 nm. As the photosensitivity of microorganisms approximately matches the absorption spectrum of DNA, with a peak at about 260 nm, UV LED emitting at 250-270 nm are to be expected in prospective disinfection and sterilization devices. Recent research has shown that commercially available UVA LEDs (365 nm) are already effective disinfection and sterilization devices.UV-C wavelengths were obtained in laboratories using aluminium nitride (210 nm), boron nitride (215 nm) and diamond (235 nm).|$|E

The application of IBBCEAS to isolated jet cooled gas-phase species was demonstrated in continuous supersonic jets almost a decade ago and recently, to pulsed jets. Arc lamps have been used for cavities as small as 80 mm to study optical absorption of liquids and very long cavities of 20 m length for sensitive in situ measurements of NO3 and NO2 concentrations in an atmospheric simulation chamber. Recent studies have demonstrated their application in Evanescent Wave-IBBCEAS using a mirror-prism-mirror cavity configuration to measure absorption spectra of metallo-porphyrins in thin solution layers. Other applications of Xe lamp based IBBCEAS include its combination with discharge flow tubes for absorption measurements of marine boundary layer species like I2, IO and OIO, and for measuring weak <b>near-UV</b> and visible gas phase absorption spectra.|$|E

5000|$|Depending on {{the gain}} of the medium, {{the amount of}} light the OC needs to reflect back can vary widely. Helium-neon lasers require around a 99% {{reflective}} mirror to lase, while nitrogen lasers have an extremely high gain (they are [...] "superradiant") and do not require any OC (0% reflective). The reflectivity of any OC will vary with wavelength. Metal-coated mirrors generally have good reflectivity over a wide bandwidth, but may not cover an entire portion of the spectrum. Silver has up to 99.9% reflectivity in the visual range, but is a poor reflector of ultraviolet. Aluminum does not reflect infrared well, but is a good reflector from the visual range through the <b>near-UV,</b> whereas gold is highly reflective to infrared light but a poor reflector of wavelengths shorter than yellow. A dielectric mirror may have a tuning range as low as a 10nm when designed for a specific wavelength, or can be designed with a wide range, spanning as much as 100nm, for tunable lasers. For this reason the spectral properties of the OC are important to consider when a laser cavity is being assembled.|$|E
