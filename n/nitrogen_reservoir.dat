A <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoir</b> with variable volume yields a spring with non-linear force-deflection characteristics. In this way the resulting system does not possess any eigenfrequencies and associated dynamic instabilities, which need to be suppressed through extensive damping in conventional suspension systems. The actuation of the nitrogen spring reservoir is performed through an incompressible hydraulic fluid inside a suspension cylinder. By adjusting the filled fluid volume within the cylinder, a leveling functionality is implemented. The nitrogen gas within the suspension sphere is separated from the hydraulic oil through a rubber membrane.|$|E

The breech of the gun is semi-automatic and fitted with a vertical sliding wedge breech block. The firing mechanism utilises a mechanical firing pin which was prone to sticking and malfunction in dusty climates.

Here we show a secular increase in continental crust nitrogen through Earth history recorded in glacial tills (2. 9 Ga to modern), which act as a proxy for average upper continental crust composition. Archean and earliest Palaeoproterozoic tills contain 66 ± 100 ppm nitrogen, whereas Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic tills contain 290 ± 165 ppm nitrogen, whilst the isotopic composition has remained constant at 4. Nitrogen has accumulated in the continental crust through time, likely sequestered from the atmosphere via biological fixation. Our findings support dynamic, non-steady state behaviour of nitrogen through time, and are consistent with net transfer of atmospheric N to geologic reservoirs over time.

We found no variations statistically significant given the observational and model uncertainties. The absence of latitudinal variations demonstrates that 15 NH 3 is not fractionated in Jupiter’s atmosphere, and that the measured 15 N/ 14 N repre-sents Jupiter’s global value. Our mean value for the global jovian 15 N/ 14 N ratio of (2. 22 ± 0. 52) × 10 − 3 agrees with previous measurements made by Fouchet et al. (2000, Icarus 143, 223 – 243) and Owen et al. (2001, Astrophys. J. 553, L 77 –L 79). We argue that the jovian isotopic 15 N/ 14 N ratio must represent the solar nitrogen isotopic composition. The solar 15 N/ 14 N ratio hence significantly differs from the terrestrial value: (15 N/ 14 N) ⊕ = 3. 68 × 10 − 3.

In the present study a three-dimensional plume model is used to investigate the photochemical evolution of a biomass- burning plume during the first tens of minutes after the fire emissions have been released into the atmosphere. The model results represent the evolution of the plume from the Quinault prescribed fire conducted during the Smoke, Cloud, and Radiation-C (SCAR- C) experiment. The modeled ozone concentrations of about 70 ppb are close to observations. The main <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoir</b> species downwind of the fire are HNO 3 and peroxyacetyl nitrate, accounting for about similar to 60 % and similar to 30 % of the total <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoir</b> species, respectively. Photolysis of formaldehyde, which is emitted from the fire, is the primary source of radicals in the plume. Omitting the emissions of oxygenated volatile organic compounds in the modeled fire plume leads to unrealistically low ozone concentrations in the simulations. A nonabsorbing aerosol as well as the lower emission of NOx in the simulations enhance the radical concentration, the photochemical ozone formation, and the oxidation efficiency, at least at the timescales considered here.

The Columbia River plume appeared to support a sizeable amount of phytoplankton production just south of the river mouth. Particulate nitrogen increased and particulate C/N ratio decreased as the water became more biologically productive. Chlorophyll, particulate nitrogen, and C/N ratio showed the effects of upwelling and the Columbia River plume on biological production.

Compositional differences between POM and DOM primarily reflected the selective incorporation of specific bacterial components into these reservoirs. Autotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial sources were not quantified separately, but the presence of D-aspartic acid (D-Asx) and D-serine (D-Ser) suggested that heterotrophic sources were substantial. The average reactivity of bacterial organic matter was comparable to that of the bulk organic carbon pool.

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{has brought}} about {{tremendous}} changes in the nuclear complex of the Department of Energy. One of the many changes has been the shutdown or decommissioning of many facilities that performed nuclear work. One of the steps {{in the process of}} decommissioning a facility involves the decontamination or removal of drain lines or pipes that may have carried radioactive materials at one time. The removal of all these pipes and drain lines to a nuclear disposal facility could be quite costly. It was suggested by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) that a germanium spectrometer could be built that could fit through straight pipes with a diameter as small as 5. 08 cm (2 inches) and pass through curved pipes with a diameter as small as 7. 6 cm (3 inches) such as that of a 3 -inch p-trap in a drain line. The germanium spectrometer could then be used to simultaneously determine all gamma-ray emitting radionuclides in or surrounding the pipe. By showing the absence of any gamma-ray emitting radionuclides, the pipes could then be reused in place or disposed of as non-radioactive material, thus saving significantly in disposal costs. A germanium spectrometer system has been designed by PNNL and fabricated by Princeton Gamma Tech (PGT) that consists of three segments, each 4. 84 cm in diameter and about 10 cm in length. Flexible stainless steel bellows were used to connect the segments.

However, the Earth was not permanently glaciated, an apparent contradiction known as the faint young Sun paradox. By implication, the Earth must have been warmed by a stronger greenhouse effect or a lower planetary albedo. Here we use a radiative–convective climate model to show that more N 2 in the atmosphere would have increased the warming effect of existing greenhouse gases by broadening their absorption lines. With the atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 levels estimated for 2. 5 billion years ago, a doubling of the present atmospheric nitrogen (PAN) level would cause a warming of 4. 4 °C. Our new budget of Earth’s geological <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoirs</b> indicates {{that there is a}} sufficient quantity of nitrogen in the crust (0. 5 PAN) and mantle (> 1. 4 PAN) to have supported this, and that this nitrogen was previously in the atmosphere.

We present peroxy radical observations acquired within a ponderosa pine forest during the summer 2010 Bio-hydro-atmosphere interactions of Energy, Aerosols, Carbon, H 2 O, Organics and Nitrogen – Rocky Mountain Organic Carbon Study (BEACHON-ROCS). Total peroxy radical mixing ratios reach as high as 180 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) and are among the highest yet recorded. Using the comprehensive measurement suite to constrain a near-explicit 0 -D box model, we investigate the sources, sinks and distribution of peroxy radicals below the forest canopy.

The diel profile of the second missing source peaks in the afternoon and suggests a process that generates RO 2 independently of sun-driven photochemistry, such as ozonolysis of reactive hydrocarbons.

Greater rates occurred in decayed logs than in mineral soils; rates at 4 cm in these substrates were significantly higher than rates at 20 cm. Strongest correlations were found between litter volumetric moisture content, temperature in litter, and respiration and/or nitrogenase activity. In general, positive correlations existed between substrate moisture content and respiration; substrate moisture content and nitrogenase activity were often significantly and positively correlated. Both respiration and nitrogenase activity correlated negatively with temperature. Regardless of substrate, few significant correlations existed between substrate moisture or temperature and mineralizable nitrogen.

40|$|Terrestrial {{nitrogen}} isotopic compositions {{are distinct}} from solar and cometary values and {{similar to those}} of primitive meteorites, suggesting that Earth's atmospheric nitrogen originates from a primordial cosmochemical source(1, 2). Prebiotic organic compounds containing nitrogen that formed in the solar protoplanetary disk, such as amino acids, {{may have contributed to the}} emergence of life on Earth(3, 4). However, the original reservoirs of these volatile compounds and the processes involved in their distribution and chemical modification before accretion remain unclear. Here we report the occurrence of the mineral carlsbergite (chromium nitride) within nanocrystalline sulphide inclusions of primitive chondritic meteorites using transmission electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. The characteristics and occurrence of carlsbergite are consistent with precipitation from a chromium-bearing metal in the presence of reactive ammonia. The carlsbergite crystals have nitrogen isotopic compositions that differ from ammonia in cometary ices, but are similar to Earth's atmospheric nitrogen. We suggest that the reactive ammonia proposed to have initiated formation of the carlsbergite came from ices within regions of the protoplanetary disk that were affected by the distal wakes of shock waves. Our findings imply that these primordial ammonia-bearing ices were a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoir</b> within the formation region of the chondritic meteorite parent bodies and could have been a source of volatiles for the early Earth...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this chapter}} we {{describe}} the remote sensing measurement of nitrogen-bearing species in Titan’s atmosphere by the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) on the Cassini spacecraft. This instrument, which detects the thermal in-frared spectrum from 10 – 1500 cm− 1 (1000 – 7 µm) is sensitive to vibrational emis-sions of gases and condensates in Titan’s stratosphere and lower mesosphere, per-mitting the measurement of ambient temperature and the abundances of gases and particulates. Three N-bearing species are firmly detected: HCN, HC 3 N and C 2 N 2, and their vertical and latitudinal distributions have been mapped. In addition, ices of HC 3 N and possibly C 4 N 2 are also seen in the far-infrared spectrum at high latitudes during the northern winter. The HC 15 N isotopologue has been measured, permitting the inference of the 14 N/ 15 N in this species, which differs markedly (lower) than in the bulk <b>nitrogen</b> <b>reservoir</b> (N 2). We also describe the search in the CIRS spectrum, and inferred upper limits, for NH 3 and CH 3 CN. CIRS is now observing seasonal transition on Titan and the gas abundance distributions are changing accordingly, acting as tracers of the changing atmospheric circulation. The prospects for further CIRS science in the remaining five years of the Cassini mission are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Observational and {{modeling}} {{studies have been}} conducted to examine the interaction between the chemical and dynamical processes that occur during springtime in the lower stratosphere of the Southern Hemisphere. The temporal evolution of the ozone distribution and the circulation during 1987 is contrasted with that for 1988 as an illustrative example of how dynamical processes and the resulting meteorological conditions modulate the ozone depletion. Concurrently with the observational analysis, an effort was initiated to simulate the ozone depletion during austral spring using a 3 D chemical/transport model. The model includes a parameterized representation of the heterogeneous processes thought to be important in this region. The simulation indicates that the inclusion of this additional chemistry, which results in the release of free chlorine and the redistribution of odd <b>nitrogen</b> into <b>reservoir</b> species, reproduces many aspects of the observations...|$|R
30|$|It {{is assumed}} that when N is limited in the medium, {{proteins}} and other N-rich compounds are broken and used as <b>nitrogen</b> cell <b>reservoir</b> to support time-restricted growth processes (Ikaran et al. 2015). Thus, the recycling of cellular components could explain the biomass increase occurred in LN treatments. However, low final biomass content drastically reduced the overall productivity of the cell. On the other hand, higher nitrogen concentrations become toxic for algal survival. As previously stated, {{this is because of}} increased nitrate reductase activity at higher concentrations of NaNO 3 leading to enhanced production of nitrite and ammonia that are accumulated in vivo (Dhup and Dhawan 2014). These accumulated nitrites and ammonia might act as toxins, resulting in decreased biomass production. Therefore, for higher biomass and lipid productivity can only achieved at MN concentration. These results were in consistent with the finding of Kim et al. (2016) and Lin and Lin (2011) that high biomass productivity can be attained at optimum N concentrations.|$|R
30|$|Purified Ac-AChBP and {{synthesized}} α-CTx LvIA {{were mixed}} at a molar ratio of 1 : 1.5 at 4 °C. After incubation for 2 h, {{the sample was}} loaded onto a Superdex 200 10 / 300 High Performance column (GE Healthcare). The peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ~ 20 mg/mL in HBS buffer for crystallization. Crystals were successfully grown at 18 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution. Crystals of Ac-AChBP/LvIA grew in buffer containing 1.2 mol/L DL-Malic acid pH 7.0, 0.1 mol/L BIS-TRIS propane pH 7.0. Prior to data collection, the crystals were cryocooled in liquid <b>nitrogen,</b> using <b>reservoir</b> solution plus 20 % (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at the BL 17 U beam line of the Shanghai Synchrotron Research Facility (Shanghai, China). Diffraction data were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL 2000 (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997).|$|R
