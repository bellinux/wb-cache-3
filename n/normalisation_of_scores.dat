40|$|Classical de Lange {{syndrome}} presents with {{a striking}} face, pronounced growth and mental retardation, and variable limb deficiencies. Over {{the past five}} years, a mild variant has been defined, with less significant psychomotor retardation, less marked pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, and an uncommon association with major malformations, although mild limb anomalies may be present. We have evaluated 43 subjects with de Lange syndrome, 30 with classical features, aged from birth to 21 years, and 13 with the mild phenotype, aged from 18 months to 30 years. In addition to assessment of gestalt and facial change with time, detailed craniofacial measurements have been obtained on each subject and composite pattern profiles compiled. The characteristic face of classical de Lange syndrome is present at birth and changes little throughout life, although there is some lengthening of the face with age and the jaw becomes squared. In mild de Lange syndrome, the characteristic classical appearance may be present at birth, but in some subjects it may be {{two or three years}} before the typical face is obvious. In general, the overall impression is less striking, perhaps because of increased facial expression and greater alertness. With age, the face loses the characteristic appearance, the nasal height increases, the philtrum does not seem as long, and the upper vermilion is full and everted, although the crescent shaped mouth with downturned corners remains. Eyebrows may be full and bushy. Objective comparison of the face in mild and classical de Lange syndrome, through the use of craniofacial pattern profiles, shows marked similarity of patterns at 4 to 9 years; both groups have microbrachycephaly, but the individual dimensions of the mild group are slightly closer to normal than their classical counterparts. The correlation coefficient is high (0. 83). In the adult groups, similarity of patterns remains but is less marked. The <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>scores</b> in the mild group is more dramatic. The correlation coefficient is lower (0. 71). These objective findings substantiate clinical impressions of a phenotypic dichotomy. Early in life, the craniofacial features in mild de Lange syndrome may be indistinguishable from the classical phenotype and alternative discriminators must be sought in order to identify those subjects in whom the prognosis is more optimistic. Birth weight of more than 2500 g and absence of major limb anomalies may help in this regar...|$|E
40|$|Learning {{to write}} {{software}} requires much practice and frequent assessment. Consequently, {{the use of}} computers to assist in the assessment of computer programs has been important in supporting large classes at universities. The main approaches to the problem are dynamic analysis (testing student programs for expected output) and static analysis (direct analysis of the program code). The former is very sensitive to all kinds of errors in student programs, while the latter has traditionally only been used to assess quality, and not correctness. This research focusses on the application of static analysis, particularly structural similarity, to marking student programs. Existing traditional measures of similarity are limiting in that they are usually only effective on tree structures. In this regard they do not easily support dependencies in program code. Contemporary measures of structural similarity, such as similarity flooding, usually rely on an internal <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>scores.</b> The effect is that the scores only have relative meaning, and cannot be interpreted in isolation, ie. they are not meaningful for assessment. The SimRank measure is shown to have the same problem, but not because of normalisation. The problem with the SimRank measure arises from the fact that its scores depend on all possible mappings between the children of vertices being compared. The main contribution of this research is a novel graph similarity measure, the Weighted Assignment Similarity measure. It is related to SimRank, but derives propagation scores from only the locally optimal mapping between child vertices. The resulting similarity scores may be regarded as the percentage of mutual coverage between graphs. The measure is proven to converge for all directed acyclic graphs, and an efficient implementation is outlined for this case. Attributes on graph vertices and edges are often used to capture domain specific information which is not structural in nature. It has been suggested that these should influence the similarity propagation, but no clear method for doing this has been reported. The second important contribution of this research is a general method for incorporating these local attribute similarities into the larger similarity propagation method. An example of attributes in program graphs are identifier names. The choice of identifiers in programs is arbitrary as they are purely symbolic. A problem facing any comparison between programs is that they are unlikely to use the same set of identifiers. This problem indicates that a mapping between the identifier sets is required. The third contribution of this research is a method for applying the structural similarity measure in a two step process to find an optimal identifier mapping. This approach is both novel and valuable as it cleverly reuses the similarity measure as an existing resource. In general, programming assignments allow a large variety of solutions. Assessing student programs through structural similarity is only feasible if the diversity in the solution space can be addressed. This study narrows program diversity through a set of semantic preserving program transformations that convert programs into a normal form. The application of the Weighted Assignment Similarity measure to marking student programs is investigated, and strong correlations are found with the human marker. It is shown that the most accurate assessment requires that programs not only be compared with a set of good solutions, but rather a mixed set of programs of varying levels of correctness. This research represents the first documented successful application of structural similarity to the marking of student programs...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{real-time}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (qRT-PCR) has been employed to study the gene expression profiles in human spermatozoa, but accurate analysis is dependent upon <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> data against an endogenous control. β-Actin (ACTB) and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are {{the most commonly used}} reference genes for <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> gene expression in human spermatozoa, but the expression of these genes in many tissues has considerable variation under different physiological, pathological and experimental conditions which limits their effectiveness in normalisation.

Although there were some discrepancies in the ranking of reference gene stability, each software program ranked B(2) M, ACTB, CYC 1 and 18 S RNA within the top 5 and recommended the combined use of at least two reference genes. <b>Normalisation</b> <b>of</b> qRT-PCR data for the cannabinoid receptor type 2 in spermatozoa using the different housekeeping genes demonstrated how, without validation, conflicting results are obtained.

40|$|Summary: Non-suppression of post {{dexamethasone}} cortisol is {{a feature}} <b>of</b> endogenous/melancholic depression. <b>Normalisation</b> <b>of</b> the DST response is {{a feature of}} remission and antidepressant treatment. Twelve consecutive depressed nonsuppressers were treated with rTMS. Six demonstrated normalisation and good clinical improvement which was sustained {{for at least one}} month. Thus, rTMS has some biological effects in common with other antidepressant treatments. Key Words: transcranial magnetic stimulation, dexamethasone suppression test The dexamethasone suppression test 1 is the most studied state marker of depression. 2, 3 1, 4 Non-suppression is associated with endogenous/melancholic features and indicates a need for somatic intervention. 5 Non-suppression occurs when patients are symptomatic and <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> response usually accompanies remission. 6 - 8 Failure to normalise indicates a poor prognosis. 2, 9 Recent animal 10 and clinical 8 studies suggest that <b>normalisation</b> <b>of</b> hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical function, as reflected in a return of DST suppression, i...|$|R
