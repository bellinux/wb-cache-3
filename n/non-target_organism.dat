40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} insecticidal {{properties of}} organic solvent extracts of Clerodendron inerme (C. inerme) leaves against larval stages of Aedes aegypti (Ae. aegypti) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Cx. quinquefasciatus) mosquito species. Methods: The sundried leaf powder of C. inerme was subjected for extraction using organic solvents viz. methanol, chloroform, petroleum ether and hexane extract, and were tested against third/fourth instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus species {{in accordance with}} WHO standard methods. Experiments were conducted in four replicates with control group containing water alone and positive control group containing respective solvent (dimethylsulfoxide/acetone) used for dissolving the extracts. Results: Among the four solvent extracts, hexane extract has effective growth disruptive activity against Ae. aegypti, and showed positive tests for presence of four groups of phytochemical constituents viz. tanin, phytosteriod, terpenoid and cardiac glycoside. The hexane extract was tested against field collected filarial vector Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae for growth disruptive activity. Adult emergence inhibition values for 50 percent suppression (EI 50) of the tested population for methanol, chloroform, petroleum ether and hexane extracts treated against third instar larvae of Ae. aegypti {{were found to be}} 37. 45, 14. 79, 2. 56 and 1. 96 mg/L respectively, while hexane extract treated against Cx. quinquefasciatus was found to be equally effective with EI 50 value of 3. 74 mg/L. Hexane extract treated against fourth instar larvae of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus showed EI 50 values of 8. 07 and 19. 55 mg/L respectively in comparison with that of standard insect growth regulator methoprene demonstrating EI 50 value of 0. 05 mg/L. Besides, the hexane extract was also found to possess toxic effect against <b>non-target</b> <b>organism</b> Gambusia affinis (a bio-control agent), however, the lethal concentration (LC 50 = 172. 7 mg/L for 24 h) against Gambusia affinis was much higher in comparison with that of tested concentrations against Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Conclusions: We conclude from the present investigation that the hexane extract of C. inerme has positive implications for its consideration in integrated control of dengue/filarial vectors due to their ecological distinctness in comparison with <b>non-target</b> <b>organism</b> and further due to ecofriendly nature of the extract in terms of easy biodegradabilit...|$|E

Results We identified 101 insecticidal RNAs sharing high sequence similarity with genomic regions in honey bees. The likelihood that off-target sequences were similar increased with the number of nucleotides in the dsRNA molecule. The similarities of non-target genes to the pesticidal RNA was unaffected by taxonomic relatedness of the target insect to honey bees, contrary to previous assertions. Gene groups active during honey bee development had disproportionately high sequence similarity with pesticidal RNAs relative to other areas of the genome. Discussion Although sequence similarity does not itself guarantee a significant phenotypic effect in honey bees by the primary dsRNA, in silico screening may help to identify appropriate experimental endpoints within a risk assessment framework for pesticidal RNAi...|$|E

As part of the environmental safety assessment of MIR 604 maize, risks to <b>non-target</b> <b>organisms</b> of mCry 3 A were assessed. The potential exposure of <b>non-target</b> <b>organisms</b> to mCry 3 A following cultivation of MIR 604 maize was determined, and the hypothesis that such exposure is not harmful was tested. The hypothesis was tested rigorously by making worst-case or highly conservative assumptions about exposure, along with laboratory testing for hazards using species taxonomically related to the target pest and species expected to have high exposure to mCry 3 A, or both. Further rigour was introduced by study designs incorporating long exposures and measurements of sensitive endpoints. No adverse effects were observed in any study, {{and in most cases}} exposure to mCry 3 A in the study was higher than the worst-case expected exposure. In all cases, exposure in the study was higher than realistic, but still conservative, estimates of exposure.

40|$|Background Neonicotinoid {{insecticides}} (NNIs) {{have been}} routinely used in arable crop protection since their {{development in the}} early 1990 s.

However, during the last 10 years the debate regarding their possible detrimental impact on <b>non-target</b> <b>organisms,</b> particularly pollinators, has become increasingly contentious and widely debated. Against this background, legislators and politicians in some countries, have been faced with a need to make decisions on the future registration of some or all of this class of insecticides, based on published evidence that in some areas is incomplete or limited in extent. This has created much concern in agricultural communities that consider that the withdrawal of these insecticides is likely to have significant negative economic, socio-economic and environmental consequences. Methods The proposed systematic map aims to address the following primary question: What is the available evidence for the effects of neonicotinoids used in arable crop production on <b>non-target</b> <b>organisms</b> and concentrations of residues in relevant matrices?

In 1997, a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeabNPV) was isolated from the balsam fir sawfly and, as no control measures were then available, NeabNPV was developed for the biological control of balsam fir sawfly.
