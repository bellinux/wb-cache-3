50|$|A 2-year-old Italian boy {{affected}} by tuberous sclerosis was infected by H. diminuta. Due to concerns over his neurological condition, {{the boy was}} treated with <b>niclosamide</b> rather than praziquantel. In this case, <b>niclosamide</b> treatment proved to be successful.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Niclosamide,</b> {{along with}} oxyclozanide, another anti-tapeworm drug, {{was found in}} a 2015 study to display [...] "strong in vivo and in vitro {{activity}} against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)". A 2016 drug repurposing screening study suggested that <b>niclosamide</b> may inhibit Zika virus replication in vitro.|$|E
50|$|Some {{synthetic}} taeniacides include diatrizoic acid, praziquantel, bunamidine and <b>niclosamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|Examples of piscicides include rotenone, saponins, TFM, <b>niclosamide</b> and Antimycin A (Fintrol).|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{commonly}} used {{for treatment of}} hymenolepiasis are praziquantel, <b>niclosamide,</b> and paromomycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niclosamide</b> {{inhibits}} glucose uptake, oxidative phosphorylation, and {{anaerobic metabolism}} in the tapeworm.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{treatment for}} diphyllobothriasis, {{as well as}} many other tapeworm infections is a single dose of Praziquantel, 5-10 mg/kg PO once for both adults and children. An alternative treatment is <b>Niclosamide,</b> 2 g PO once for adults or 50 mg/kg PO once. Praziquantel is not FDA approved for this indication and <b>Niclosamide</b> is not available for human use in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Niclosamide</b> {{given for}} one day at 2 grams {{followed}} by six days at 1 gram.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Niclosamide</b> {{given for}} one day at 1 gram {{followed}} by six days at 0.5 grams. 3 ...|$|E
50|$|If the {{infection}} is already present then {{use one of}} these drugs: Epsiprantel, Praziquantel, Mebendazole, <b>Niclosamide,</b> Bunamindine hydrochloride or Fenbendazole. This will kill the adult stage but not the cyst or egg stage, so several treatments may be needed. Daily doses of Praziquantel for about one to two weeks' time will be effective against larval cysticercosis in rabbits. One dose of <b>Niclosamide</b> or Praziquantel can be very effective in dogs.|$|E
50|$|Tapeworms {{are treated}} with {{medications}} taken by mouth, usually in a single dose. The drug of choice for tapeworm infections is praziquantel. <b>Niclosamide</b> can also be used.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{tapeworm}} infections, the drugs of choice are <b>niclosamide</b> or praziquantel. The {{best way to}} prevent human infection is to treat infected animals with products which aid in killing the fleas on the animal.|$|E
50|$|Derivatives of {{salicylanilide}} have {{a variety}} of pharmacological uses. Chlorinated derivatives including <b>niclosamide,</b> oxyclozanide, and rafoxanide are used as anthelmintics, especially as flukicides. Brominated derivatives including dibromsalan, metabromsalan, and tribromsalan are used as disinfectants with antibacterial and antifungal activities.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niclosamide,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Niclocide among others, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} tapeworm infestations. This includes diphyllobothriasis, hymenolepiasis, and taeniasis. It is not effective against other worms such as pinworms or roundworms. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
50|$|Side effects include nausea, vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, constipation, and itchiness. It may be {{used during}} pregnancy {{and appears to be}} safe for the baby. <b>Niclosamide</b> is in the anthelmintic family of medications. It works by blocking the uptake of sugar.|$|E
50|$|Upon diagnosis, {{treatment}} is quite simple and effective. The standard treatment for diphyllobothriasis, {{as well as}} many other tapeworm infections is a single dose of praziquantel, 5-10 mg/kg orally once for both adults and children. An alternative {{treatment is}} <b>niclosamide,</b> 2 g orally once for adults or 50 mg/kg (max 2 g) for children. Praziquantel is not FDA-approved for this indication and <b>niclosamide</b> is not available for human or even animal use in the United States. Reportedly, albendazole can also be effective. Another interesting potential diagnostic tool and treatment is the contrast medium, Gastrografin, introduced into the duodenum, which allows both visualization of the parasite, and has also been shown to cause detachment and passing of the whole worm.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{directly}} diagnosed by identifying proglottids in the faeces, or adult worms in the intestine upon autopsy. Broad-spectrum anthelmintics such as albendazole, fenbendazole, praziquantel, oxfendazole and <b>niclosamide</b> are all effective against the different species. The most effective control measure is {{disruption of the}} habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel has few side effects, many {{of which}} are similar to the {{symptoms}} of diphyllobothriasis. They include malaise, headache, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, nausea, rise in temperature and occasionally allergic skin reactions. The side effects of <b>Niclosamide</b> are very rare, {{due to the fact that}} it is not absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
50|$|Taenaisis {{is easily}} treated with {{praziquantel}} (5-10 mg/kg, single-administration) or <b>niclosamide</b> (adults and children over 6 years: 2 g, single-administration after a light breakfast, followed after 2 hours by a laxative; children aged 2-6 years: 1 g; children under 2 years: 500 mg). Albendazole is also highly effective {{for treatment of}} cattle infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niclosamide</b> (2 mg) is very {{effective}} against experimental infection in human. In general cestode infections {{are treated with}} praziquantel and albendazole. Atrabine is quite effective but indicates adverse effects in humans. The commonly used drugs for tapeworms, benzimidazoles are relatively ineffective. Praziquantel at a single dose of 150 mg {{is the most effective}} medication against T. asiatica without causing side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Niclosamide</b> was {{discovered}} in 1958. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.24 USD for a course of treatment. It is not commercially available in the United States. It is effective {{in a number of other}} animals.|$|E
5000|$|Cestodes (tapeworms), as an {{alternative}} to praziquantel or <b>niclosamide</b> for adult beef tapeworms (Taenia saginata) and as {{an alternative}} to praziquantel for pork tapeworms (T. solium). It is also given for infections by T. crassiceps. Though praziquantel is often better at treating tapeworm infections, albendazole is used more often in endemic countries due to being cheaper and having a broader spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|Oxyclozanide is a {{salicylanilide}} anthelmintic. It {{is used in}} {{the treatment}} and control of fascioliasis in ruminants mainly domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats. It mainly acts by uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in flukes. Along with <b>niclosamide,</b> another tapeworm drug, it has been recently found to display [...] "strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)".|$|E
50|$|Symptoms vary widely, as do {{treatment}} options, {{and these}} issues are discussed in detail in the individual articles on each worm. Praziquantel is an effective treatment for tapeworm infection, and is preferred over the older <b>niclosamide.</b> Cestodes can also be treated with certain kinds of antibiotics. While accidental tapeworm infections in developed countries are quite rare, some US dieters have risked intentional infection {{for the purpose of}} weight loss.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} drug {{option is}} Tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but its use has been superseded by new antihelminthic drugs (like Praziquantel). A 1978 study {{also looked at}} the efficacy of several drugs on metagonimiasis infection, including bithionol, <b>niclosamide,</b> nicoflan, and Praziquantel. All drugs showed lower prevalence of eggs in feces, however only Praziquantel showed complete radical cure. Therefore, the authors concluded Praziquantel was the most highly effective, was very well tolerated, and was the most promising drug against metagonimiasis.|$|E
50|$|There {{is not an}} officially {{established}} treatment due to {{rarity of}} disease. Most are misdiagnosed anyway and treated with general medicines against cestodes. One record of treatment in a Bertiella case in Equatorial Guinea, documented a patient treated with praziquantel in a 40 mg/kg body weight, in a single dose, followed by a second, similar dose 20 days later. From then, the proglottid excretion and oesophageal pain desisted.In another instance of B. studeri infection, <b>niclosamide</b> was recommended as an appropriate anti-helminthic therapy.|$|E
50|$|Fenbendazole (Hoechst {{brand names}} Panacur and Safe-Guard, Intervet Panacur and Panacur Rabbit) {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} benzimidazole anthelmintic used against gastrointestinal parasites including: giardia, roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, the Taenia genus of tapeworms (but not effective against Dipylidium caninum, a common dog tapeworm), pinworms, aelurostrongylus, paragonimiasis, strongyles and strongyloides and can be administered to sheep, cattle, horses, fish, dogs, cats, rabbits and seals. Drug interactions may occur if salicylanilides like dibromsalan and <b>niclosamide</b> are co-administered. Abortions in cattle and death in sheep have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Infection is {{diagnosed}} by identifying proglottids in the faeces. Dibutyltin dilaurate {{is one of}} the earliest drugs found to be effective. Commercially, praziquantel (such as EzotecÂ® 10 at the dosage of 6.00 mg/kg of body weight, in a single dose) is the drug of choice. It is 100% effective at 10 mg/kg and is well tolerated by chickens, and treated birds showed no clinical complications at various doses tested. Oxfendazole and <b>niclosamide</b> are equally effective and safe. The most effective control measure is disruption of the habitat of intermediate hosts near poultry farms.|$|E
50|$|Niclosamide's {{metabolic}} {{effects are}} relevant to wide ranges of organisms, and accordingly it has been applied as a control measure to organisms other than tapeworms. For example it is an active ingredient in some formulations for killing lamprey larvae, as a molluscide, and as a general purpose piscicide in aquaculture. <b>Niclosamide</b> has a short half-life in water in field conditions; this makes it valuable in ridding commercial fish ponds of unwanted fish; it loses its activity soon enough to permit re-stocking {{within a few days}} of eradicating the previous population.|$|E
50|$|Oral anti-parasitic {{drugs such}} as {{praziquantel}} are the treatment of choice. Treatment with praziquantel has {{been approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is quite effective against these parasites. Usual treatments are with praziquantel (5-10 mg/kg, single-administration) or <b>niclosamide</b> (adults and children over 6 years: 2 g, single-administration after a light breakfast, followed after 2 hours by a laxative; children aged 2-6 years: 1 g; children under 2 years: 500 mg). Albendazole is also highly effective. Atrabine is quite effective but has adverse effects in humans.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are easily}} {{indicated}} by infected sheep and cattle {{as they become}} severely anorexic or inefficiently digest food, and become unthrifty. Fetid diarrhoea is an obvious indication so that fluid faeces are examined for immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on control of the snail population. Drugs shown to be effective are resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, ivermectin, <b>niclosamide,</b> bithional and levamisole. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes.|$|E
50|$|Amphistomiasis is {{considered}} a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Therefore, management of infestation is based mainly on control of the snail population, which transmit the infective larvae of the flukes. However, there are now drugs shown to be effective including resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, ivermectin, <b>niclosamide,</b> bithional and levamisole. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes. Since the juvenile flukes are the causative individuals of the disease, effective treatment means control of the immature fluke population. Prophylaxis is therefore based on disruption of the environment (such as proper drainage) where the carrier snails inhabit, or more drastic action of using molluscicides to eradicate the entire population. For treatment of the infection, drugs effective against the immature flukes are recommended for drenching. For this reason oxyclozanide is advocated as the drug of choice. It effectively kills the flukes {{within a few hours}} and it effective against the flukes resistant to other drugs. The commercially prescribed dosage is 5 mg/kg body weight or 18.7 mg/kg body weight in two divided dose within 72 hours. <b>Niclosamide</b> is also extensively used in mass drenching of sheep. Successfully treated sheep regain appetite within a week, diarrhoea stops in about three days, and physiological indicators (such as plasma protein and albumin levels) return to normal in a month.|$|E
5000|$|Adult Taenia solium {{are easily}} treated with <b>niclosamide,</b> and is most {{commonly}} used in taeniasis. However cysticercosis is a complex disease and requires careful medication. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice. In neurocysticercosis praziquantel is widely used. Albendazole {{appears to be more}} effective and a safe drug for neurocysticercosis. [...] In complicated situation a combination of praziquantel, albendazole and steroid (such as corticosteroids to reduces the inflammation) is recommended. In the brain the cysts can be usually found on the surface. Most cases of brain cysts are found by accident, during diagnosis for other ailments. Surgical removals are the only option of complete removal even if treated successfully with medications.|$|E
5000|$|Praziquantel, 20 mg/kg body weight, {{three times}} a day. Praziquantel causes immobilized {{contraction}} of the worm, such that {{it can no longer}} grasp the intestinal walls, and can be eliminated from the bodyThree 2-g doses of <b>niclosamide</b> or two 50 mg/kg doses of bithionol have also proven to be effective when Praziquantel was either not available or treatment was refused. [...] However, a single 2-g dose of niclosamine proved to be ineffective treatment therapy, as did 100 mg orally of mebendazole twice a day for three days.If diarrhea recurs, general supplements must also be provided in order to maintain electrolyte balance and meet nutritional requirements.|$|E
50|$|The two {{drugs that}} have been well-described for the {{treatment}} of hymenolepiasis are praziquantel and <b>niclosamide.</b> Praziquantel, which is parasiticidal in a single dose for all the stages of the parasite, is the drug of choice because it acts very rapidly against H. nana. Although structurally unrelated to other anthelminthics, it kills both adult worms and larvae. In vitro, the drug produces vacuolization and disruption of the tegument in the neck of the worms, but not in more posterior portions of the strobila. Praziquantel is well absorbed when taken orally, and it undergoes first-pass metabolism and 80% of the dose is excreted as metabolites in urine within 24 hours.Repeated treatment is required for H. nana at an interval of 7-10 days.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms {{are usually}} {{visible on the}} {{behaviour}} of the host. Infected sheep and cattle become severely anorexic or digest food inefficiently and become unthrifty. Continuous diarrhoea is an obvious indication of heavy infection in the digestive system, thus a primary diagnosis. The fluid faeces are examined to identify immature flukes. Paramphistomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with no prescription drug for treatment and control. Thus management of infection is based mainly on to reduce the host snail population. There are some treatment strategies demonstrated. A common regime is to drench with hexachloroethane-bentonite-water suspension, which is highly effective against adult parasites. Treatments with reported success (efficacies >90%) are resorantel, oxyclozanide, clorsulon, ivermectin and the combination of bithional and levamisole. Most important commercial anthelmintics are shown to be practically useles, including albendazole, praziquantel, nitroxynil, triclabendazole, profenophos and netobimin; while <b>niclosamide</b> has high efficacy (99%) against immature fluke but not adult fluke, and 2-tertiary-butyl benzthiazole compound (CGA 72630), hexachlorophene and resorantel are highly effective against both adult and immature flukes. An in vitro demonstration shows that plumbagin exhibits high efficacy on adult flukes.|$|E
