5|$|The promotional {{tour for}} the album {{included}} both rock shows in stadiums and acoustic gigs in smaller venues. Reviews for In Your Honor were mostly positive, praising {{the composition and}} sound, although some critics found the album overlong and inconsistent. The album was also nominated for five Grammy Awards, and topped the charts in five countries—including Australia—and reached the top five in five more, including number two in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In Your Honor also broke the band's consecutive streak of Grammy Award for Best Rock Album wins that began in 1999 with There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Left</b> <b>to</b> Lose.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

With <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> live for, and {{a sizable}} severance check from his boss, he heads to Las Vegas to drink himself to death. As he drives drunkenly down the Las Vegas Strip, he nearly hits a woman, Sera, on the crosswalk. She chastises him and walks away.|$|E

25|$|After {{recording}} for There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Left</b> <b>to</b> Lose was completed, {{the band}} auditioned {{a number of}} potential guitarists, and eventually settled on Chris Shiflett, who performs with Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, and previously performed with California punk band, No Use for a Name. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth album.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> explain. In particular, {{there is no such thing}} as a perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E

25|$|White sailed for England in late 1587, {{although}} {{crossing the}} Atlantic {{at that time}} of year was a considerable risk. Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain's refusal to return during the winter, and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo-Spanish War. Every able English ship joined the fight, leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time. In the spring of 1588, White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke; however, his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits). They themselves were captured and their cargo seized. With <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> deliver to the colonists, the ships returned to England.|$|E
25|$|With <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> {{play for}} the Colts played host to the Tennessee Titans {{in the regular season}} finale. This was the last regular season game for the Colts in the RCA Dome. The Titans needed a win to qualify for the playoffs. The Colts {{starters}} only played 3 series and produced 3 points before the back ups came in. The Titans would strike first when Chris Brown would go in for 8yard touchdown run. Adam Vinatieri then hit a 37-yard field goal early in the second quarter. That would be the last score of the half as the Titans led 7–3 at the break. With 9:09 left in the third quarter backup quarterback Jim Sorgi throw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Craphonso Thorpe to give the Colts a 10–7 lead. Rob Bironas would then nail 3 consecutive field goals and the Titans defense would shut the Colts out to give Tennessee a 16–10 victory. With the win the Titans made the playoffs and knocked Cleveland out of contention.|$|E
25|$|At one time, Floyd Mayweather Sr. {{negotiated}} {{to train}} Oscar De La Hoya {{and be in}} his corner during the fight, but De La Hoya decided to train with Freddie Roach. Mayweather won the fight by a split decision in 12 rounds, capturing the WBC title. However, many analysts and ringside observers felt Mayweather should have received a unanimous decision. During the early rounds De La Hoya had some success cutting off the ring, attempting to pound Mayweather on the inside. Despite his activity on the inside, however, many of De La Hoya's punches were ineffective and landed on Mayweather's arms or shoulders. By {{the middle of the}} fight, it was seen as an even bout by the announcers. Mayweather turned the tide in the middle and late rounds, often hitting De La Hoya at will. Official scorecards read 116–112 (Mayweather), 115–113 (Mayweather), and 115–113 (De La Hoya). CompuBox had Mayweather out-landing De La Hoya 207–122 in total punches and 134–82 in power punches, with better accuracy throughout the fight. After the bout Mayweather contemplated retirement, saying he had <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> prove in the boxing world.|$|E

25|$|The {{dismissal}} fell {{heavily on}} the still vibrant, energetic Konstantin, leaving him adrift without any proper role. He was an enthusiastic chess player and his chess problems were published in international journals, {{but that was not}} a substitute for the position he once had at the center of affairs. He spent increasingly more time with his second family, further humiliating his legitimate wife. With <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> do, Konstantin retired to Pavlovsk, spending most of his time abroad or on his Crimean estate of Oreanda. In August 1881 a fire completely destroyed Oreanda. The palace was never rebuilt and Konstantin lived from then on in a wooden pavilion. Tragedy struck him again while living there. In April 1885, his two surviving illegitimate sons died days apart of scarlet fever. Of the five children Constantin had had with Kousnetzova, only the two daughters, Marina and Anna, thrived; Konstantin showered them with affection. He was also particularly close to his eldest daughter Olga whom he visited in Greece in 1883. His grandson Prince Christopher of Greece remembered him for his sharp and loud voice, which Konstantin enjoyed using, usually for new servants and preferably in the presence of guests. Without any reason he would glare at the new servant and then scream the servant's name. Some were used to the trick and remained calm, while others dropped the dishes in terror, which amused him.|$|E

Known to spend time at his local library, Shero enjoyed the works of William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens, and prided himself for being [...] "the very first New York Ranger ever to hold a New York Public Library card."

[...] In December, the band felt they were done with recordings; Butler said [...] "there was absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> try", and {{walked away from the}} project.

But when there was <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> upgrade, Hearn wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the innovation is confined to the first few hours".

500|$|During {{the court}} {{proceedings}} Davidson continued to officiate at Stiffkey and Morston, although his erratic attendance meant that substitutes {{often had to}} be arranged. On 12 June 1932 the Reverend R.H. Cattell arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests wrestled with the book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: [...] "As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> do but to withdraw." [...] The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the Archdeacon of Lynn to issue a statement deploring the [...] "media circus" [...] and asking that [...] "the full spirit of worship" [...] be restored to Sunday services.|$|E
500|$|Grohl's garage was {{equipped}} with microphones, sound baffles on the garage door and behind the drums to prevent sound leakings, and a carpet under the drum kit {{to make it sound}} less [...] "loud and bright". To reduce the cymbal bleed, the microphones were rearranged and the crash cymbal was traded for a [...] "shorter-decay Zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it". A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on the backyard, and a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room. The equipment was the same the band employed to record the albums There Is <b>Nothing</b> <b>Left</b> <b>to</b> Lose and One by One at Grohl's former house in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|E

When Bond raises {{the purpose of}} his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that the Japanese have already penetrated the British information source and Bond has <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing [...] "Garden of Death" [...] in an ancient castle; people flock there to commit suicide. After examining photos of Shatterhand and his wife, Bond discovers that [...] "Shatterhand" [...] {{and his wife are}} Tracy's murderers, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma Bunt. Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and think as a mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond [...] "Taro Todoroki" [...] for the mission.|$|E
