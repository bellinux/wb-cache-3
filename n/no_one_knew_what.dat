5|$|The script {{called for}} the {{creation}} of the Enterprise-C. In the first season, illustrator Andrew Probert– who had designed the Enterprise-D– was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk's Enterprise to The Next Generations much larger ship, which was realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge. Like most others, Probert assumed that the Enterprise-B was an Excelsior-class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior-class predecessor and its Galaxy-class successor, Picard's ship. During this lineage project, Probert also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise-C, but he left {{at the end of the}} season and his absence meant that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the drawing was intended to be.|$|E
25|$|Schwartz and Ballard were {{introduced}} to Keith Prater at the University of Texas chemistry department, and sold him {{on the idea of}} developing a new rechargeable lithium battery technology with them. Prater was able to quickly determine that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the product of the lithium-salt reactions in existing batteries were, and guessed that it was lithium dithionite, which he was able to synthesize. Working in a trailer, Ballard and Schwartz built a simple battery and Prater brought a sample of the lithium dithionite, and when they were placed together and charged, a weak current was produced. After further development the system was able to be recharged about a dozen times.|$|E

[...] During the 22nd Congress, he served on the Committee on Military Affairs. [...] During his term, he made only one speech, and it was so inaudible that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> position he was advocating. [...] The House reporter speculated that it concerned mounting Federal troops on horseback. [...] He did not run for re-election in 1833, and left public life for good.|$|E

500|$|Lawrence's health {{caused her}} to miss several rehearsals, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was wrong with her. When the tryout opened in New Haven, Connecticut on February 27, 1951, the show was nearly four hours long. Lawrence, {{suffering}} from laryngitis, had missed the dress rehearsal but managed {{to make it through}} the first public performance. The Variety critic noted that despite her recent illness she [...] "slinks, acts, cavorts, and in general exhibits exceedingly well her several facets for entertaining", but the Philadelphia Bulletin printed that her [...] "already thin voice is now starting to wear a great deal thinner". [...] Leland Hayward came to see the show in New Haven and shocked Rodgers by advising him to close it before it went any further. [...] Additionally, when the show left New Haven for Boston for more tryout performances, it was still at least 45minutes too long.

500|$|Depots were {{established}} inland {{rather than in}} the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A [...] speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with [...] of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some [...] of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.|$|E

James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, [...] "they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden early on in their romance, so he did not reciprocate the gesture. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration though Aden realises she meant it.|$|E

500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> I was going through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|His final race of 2016 was the Winter Challenge Stakes at Los Alamitos, {{the only}} time the horse had ever run at the track that had been his home {{training}} base. [...] In a race of a mile and a sixteenth against light competition, where he was as much as 6 horses wide, he won easily by 12 lengths and set a track record. The final race of his career was the Pegasus World Cup on January 28, 2017, where he drew the far outside post and ran a surprisingly poor race, was eased in the stretch, and finished ninth, well behind the winner, Arrogate. Arrogate's jockey, Mike Smith, commented, [...] "Chrome just didn't fire his race today at all." [...] Sherman commented [...] "This was the first bad race he has run for me." [...] The horse had fluid on his right knee after the race, and although the injury did not appear serious, Sherman theorized about the cause: [...] "It looks like he scrambled away from there and couldn't get his footing." [...] Arrogate's trainer, Bob Baffert, was also disappointed: [...] "I kept waiting for the matchup with Chrome, but he just didn't bring his race today. It's too bad." [...] X-rays taken after the race showed no bone injury, but California Chrome was a bit [...] "off" [...] in his gait. [...] Frank Taylor explained that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> exactly happened, [...] "We don't know if he just wrenched it or strained it, but it had a little filling, fluid and heat in it." [...] An equine chiropractor got a small [...] "pop" [...] when he stretched out the horse's leg. Clinical signs of injury went down, and he was shipped to Taylor Made Farm the next day, Sunday. By Monday he was allowed to go out and exercise in a paddock.|$|E
500|$|Nicole's {{best friend}} during her initial storylines was Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). After Brendan Austin (Kain O'Keeffe) caused Roman to go blind, {{he took his}} anger out on Nicole and Aden. Subsequently they became [...] "each other's support network" [...] and Lasance {{said it was not}} long {{afterward}} that they [...] "slipped between the sheets". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience. In January2010, Nicole and Aden [...] "get up close and personal" [...] and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together. They shared a kiss and James told TV Week that there are [...] "a lot of complications" [...] for them. She said that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was going to happen with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James explained that Nicole's pairing with Aden was [...] "a bit more serious and in-depth than her usual relationships." [...] James opined that Aden was the [...] "nicer guy" [...] for Nicole, but Liam may have had [...] "the edge she's after." [...] Nicole and Aden then embarked on a relationship. James thought that Nicole and Aden's relationship was great and said [...] "They started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden, however he did not reciprocate.

2500|$|Davidson {{comments}} that [...] "the {{position of the}} tree in the centre {{as a source of}} luck and protection for gods and men is confirmed" [...] by these rituals to Warden Trees. Davidson notes that the gods are described as meeting beneath Yggdrasil to hold their things, and that the pillars venerated by the Germanic peoples, such as the pillar Irminsul, were also symbolic of the center of the world. Davidson details that {{it would be difficult to}} ascertain whether a tree or pillar came first, and that this likely depends on if the holy location was in a thickly wooded area or not. Davidson notes that there is no mention of a sacred tree at Þingvellir in Iceland yet that Adam of Bremen describes a huge tree standing next to the Temple at Uppsala in Sweden, which Adam describes as remaining green throughout summer and winter, and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> type of tree it was. Davidson {{comments that}} while it is uncertain that Adam's informant actually witnessed that tree is unknown, but that the existence of sacred trees in pre-Christian Germanic Europe is further evidenced by records of their destruction by early Christian missionaries, such as Thor's Oak by Saint Boniface.|$|E
2500|$|Booster and Skeets {{appeared}} {{as members of}} the Justice League in the DC animated universe series Justice League Unlimited voiced by Tom Everett Scott, while Skeets was voiced by Billy West. Booster appeared in several episodes with non-speaking roles. He spoke in one episode, [...] "The Greatest Story Never Told", which focused on him. In the episode, a self-promoted Booster, who was excluded from the League's fight against Mordru and was assigned to crowd control during the battle, noticed that physicist Dr. Tracy Simmons' experiment had gone wrong, causing her partner Dr. Daniel Brown, to uncontrollably walk around while having a black hole on his chest. Booster tried to stop Daniel on his own, but repeatedly failed. Realizing he could not be a hero just looking for fame, he decided to become a true hero and finally stopped Daniel and closed the black hole, which had almost swallowed the city. Despite finally being heroic, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he had achieved. Following Mordru's defeat, Batman approached Booster wondering why he left crowd control. When he is unable to explain what happened while the other superheroes were fighting Mordru, Batman tells him that he will speak to him later. To Booster's delight, Tracy asks him out to thank him. In his subsequent appearances in the series, Booster performs his duties in a more professional manner.|$|E
