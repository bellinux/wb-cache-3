2500|$|Protease inhibitors {{block the}} viral {{protease}} enzyme necessary to produce mature virions upon budding from the host membrane. [...] Particularly, these drugs prevent the cleavage of gag and gag/pol precursor proteins. [...] Virus particles {{produced in the}} presence of protease inhibitors are defective and mostly non-infectious. Examples of HIV protease inhibitors are lopinavir, indinavir, <b>nelfinavir,</b> amprenavir and ritonavir. Darunavir and atazanavir are currently recommended as first line therapy choices. Maturation inhibitors have a similar effect by binding to gag, but development of two experimental drugs in this class, bevirimat and vivecon, was halted in 2010. [...] Resistance to some protease inhibitors is high. Second generation drugs have been developed that are effective against otherwise resistant HIV variants.|$|E
2500|$|Haseltine and his {{laboratory}} quickly showed that damage {{to any of}} the viral genes that specify the virus capsid, polymerase, protease, ribonuclease, integrase and envelope genes killed the virus and therefore that proteins specified by each gene were good targets for anti-viral drugs. [...] Over the next several years {{his laboratory}} isolated each of the genes and their proteins in pure form and developed methods that were used by the pharmaceutical companies to discover new anti viral drugs. The first HIV specific protease inhibitor <b>Nelfinavir,</b> was developed {{as a part of a}} three way collaboration between the Haseltine laboratory, Cambridge BioSciences, a company Haseltine and his colleagues created, and Agouron Pharmaceuticals. The combination of an HIV polymerase inhibitor such as AZT and an anti protease drug lead to the first long term survival of those infected with HIV. Haseltine proposed the use of combination chemotherapy, the use of multiple drugs targeted against different viral proteins would be the basis for effective therapy. Today those ideas have proven out; The pharmaceutical industry has developed more than forty drugs that inhibit the HIV polymerase, protease, integrase, and envelope proteins. Combinations of these drugs have transformed HIV infection from a near universally fatal disease to one that with proper management can usually be successfully treated for decades.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> was {{the first}} {{protease}} inhibitor that was not peptidomimetic. In the design process of <b>nelfinavir,</b> an orally bioavailable and nonpeptidic inhibitor, iterative protein cocrystal structure analysis of peptidic inhibitors was used {{and parts of the}} inhibitors were replaced by nonpeptidic substituents. <b>Nelfinavir</b> contains a novel 2-methyl-3-hydroxybenzamide group, whereas its carboxyl terminal contains the same DIQ group as saquinavir. <b>Nelfinavir</b> was marketed in 1997 and {{was the first}} protease inhibitor to be indicated for pediatric AIDS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> {{should be}} taken with food. The {{bioavailability}} of <b>Nelfinavir</b> is increased 2.5 to 5 times when taken with food. Taking the drug with food also decreases the risk of diarrhea as a side effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> (brand name Viracept) is an {{antiretroviral}} drug used in {{the treatment}} of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). <b>Nelfinavir</b> belongs to the class of drugs known as protease inhibitors (PIs) and like other PIs is almost always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.|$|E
50|$|Since 2009, <b>nelfinavir</b> {{has been}} under {{investigation}} for potential use as an anti-cancer agent. When applied to cancer cells in culture (in vitro), it can inhibit {{the growth of a}} variety of cancer types and can trigger cell death (apoptosis). When <b>Nelfinavir</b> was given to laboratory mice with tumors of the prostate or of the brain, it could suppress tumor growth in these animals. At the cellular level, <b>nelfinavir</b> exerts multiple effects to inhibit cancer growth; the two main ones appear to be inhibition of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress with subsequent unfolded protein response.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{about three}} dozen {{clinical}} trials are being conducted (or have been completed) {{in order to}} determine whether <b>nelfinavir</b> is effective as a cancer therapeutic agent in humans. In some of these trials, <b>nelfinavir</b> is used alone in monotherapy fashion, whereas in others it is combined with other modes of cancer therapy, such as well-established chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> {{and simple}} {{derivatives}} {{have been found}} to inhibit the production of the virulence factor streptolysin S, a cytolysin produced by the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. <b>Nelfinavir</b> and these related molecules did not exhibit detectable antibiotic activity, but did also inhibit the production of other biologically active molecules, including plantazolicin (antibiotic), listeriolysin S (cytolysin), and clostridiolysin S (cytolysin), by other bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> {{inhibits}} maturation {{and export}} of the Herpes Simplex 1 virus [...] and the Kaposi's Sarcoma virus.|$|E
50|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} whether protease inhibitors {{could possibly be}} used to treat cancer. For example, <b>nelfinavir</b> and atazanavir are able to kill tumor cells in culture (in a Petri dish). This effect {{has not yet been}} examined in humans; but studies in laboratory mice have shown that <b>nelfinavir</b> is able to suppress the growth of tumors in these animals, which represents a promising lead towards testing this drug in humans as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> is a {{protease}} inhibitor: it inhibits HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. HIV protease is an aspartate protease which splits {{viral protein}} molecules into smaller fragments, {{and it is}} vital to both the replication of the virus within the cell, and also to the release of mature viral particles from an infected cell. <b>Nelfinavir</b> is a competitive inhibitor (2 nM) which is designed to bind tightly and is not cleaved due to the presence of a hydroxyl group as opposed to a keto group in the middle amino acid residue mimic, which would be otherwise S-phenylcysteine. All protease inhibitors bind to the protease, the precise mode of binding determines how the molecule inhibits the protease. The way <b>Nelfinavir</b> binds the enzyme may be sufficiently unique to reduce cross-resistance between it and other PIs. Also, not all PIs inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases.|$|E
50|$|Ranolazine {{should not}} be used with drugs like ketoconazole, clarithromycin, and <b>nelfinavir</b> that {{strongly}} inhibit CYP3A nor with drugs that activate CYP3A like rifampin and phenobarbital.|$|E
50|$|Nelfinavir's {{interaction}} {{profile is}} similar to that of other protease inhibitors. Most interactions occur at the level of the Cytochrome P450 isozymes 3A4 and CYP2C19, by which <b>nelfinavir</b> is metabolised.|$|E
50|$|Ivabradine is {{contraindicated}} in sick sinus syndrome, {{and should}} not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, including azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics, nefazodone and the antiretroviral drugs <b>nelfinavir</b> and ritonavir.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> mesylate (Viracept, {{formerly}} AG1343) is {{a potent}} and orally bioavailable human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 protease inhibitor (Ki=2nM) and is widely prescribed in combination with HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection.|$|E

50|$|Brazilian Health Minister Jose Serra {{announced}} in 2001 that his government {{could find no}} {{way to pay for}} the cost of patented HIV drugs, and would produce Hoffmann-La Roche's <b>Nelfinavir</b> in violation of international patent laws in order to save the lives of their citizens.|$|E
50|$|Vorapaxar is {{eliminated}} primarily by metabolism by the CYP3A enzymes. It {{is best to}} avoid any strong CYP3A4 inhibitors(ex: ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, <b>nelfinavir,</b> indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and conivaptan). CYP3A4 inducers(Carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John's Wort, and Phenytoin) should also be avoided.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> was {{developed}} by Agouron Pharmaceuticals {{as part of a}} joint venture with Eli Lilly and Company. Agouron Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Warner Lambert in 1999 and is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. It is marketed in Europe by Hoffman-La Roche and elsewhere by ViiV Healthcare.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications include: atherosclerosis, Buerger's syndrome, {{coronary}} artery disease, hepatic disease, pregnancy, pruritus, Raynaud's syndrome, and renal disease.It's also contraindicated if patient is taking Macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin), certain HIV protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir, <b>nelfinavir,</b> indinavir), certain azole antifungals (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) delavirdine, efavirenz or a 5-HT1 agonist (eg, sumatriptan).|$|E
50|$|Abiraterone acetate is a CYP3A4 {{substrate}} {{and hence}} {{should not be}} administered concurrently with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone,saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, <b>nelfinavir,</b> voriconazole) or inducers such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital. It also inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 and likewise {{should not be taken}} concurrently with substrates of any of these enzymes that have a narrow therapeutic index.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Nelfinavir</b> {{can produce}} a range of adverse side effects. Flatulence, {{diarrhea}} or abdominal pain are common (i.e. experienced {{by more than one}} in one hundred patients).

Nephrolithiasis, arthralgia, leukopenia, pancreatitis or allergic reactions may occur, but are rare (less than one in one thousand patients) [...]|$|E
50|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of increased central nervous system depression when it is used with eszopicolone including anti-psychotics, sedative/hypnotics, antihistamines, opioids, and antidepressants. There is also increased risk of increased risk of central nervous system depression with other medications that inhibit the metabolic activities of the CYP3A4 enzyme system of the liver. Medications that inhibit this enzyme system include <b>nelfinavir,</b> ritonavir, ketoconazole, itraconazole and clarithromycin. Alcohol also has an additive effect when used concurrently with eszopicolone. Eszopicolone is more effective if it is not taken before a heavy meal.|$|E

50|$|Throughout his career, Holson {{served as}} a key advisor to {{numerous}} product development programs (INDs, NDAs, TCSA consent orders, FIFRA registrations and international product registrations) and was the principal investigator in more than 600 safety assessment studies. In these studies he emphasized his longstanding principles of holistic evaluation of data, inclusion of pharmacokinetic endpoints where possible, robust and creative experimental designs, determination of the statistical power of the study relative to known variability in endpoints, and cognizance of comparative ontogeny of development. In addition to LSD, FD&C Red No. 2, and 2,4,5-T, he was instrumental in significant developmental, reproductive, and/or nonclinical juvenile toxicity assessments of Mirex, inorganic Arsenic, <b>Nelfinavir</b> (Viracept, an antiretroviral drug used to treat AIDS), Fluoxetine (Prozac), two silicon-based ingredients found in breast implants and numerous personal care products (D4 and D5), Methyl iodide, and HBOC-201 (a bovine hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier).|$|E
50|$|Over 100 single gene point {{mutations}} {{have been}} described, of {{which at least}} 26 are specific to protease inhibitors. Of these, there are about 15 primary or major mutations that are significant enough to change drug activity.Many mutated residues {{have been found in}} HIV-1 protease which cause drug resistance, for example Leu33 changes to Ile, Val, or Phe; Val82 to Ala, Phe, Leu, or Thr; Ile84 to Val; and Leu90 to Met. Different mutations affects different protease inhibitors. For instance, mutations at Leu90 evidently affect saquinavir and <b>nelfinavir</b> while indinavir activity is affected by mutations at Met46, Val82, and Ile84, and fosamprenavir is affected when Ile50 changes to Val and at Ile84. A combination of mutations can render high-level drug resistance but single mutations normally do not equate with drug resistance to protease inhibitors.The mutations can be divided into primary mutations and secondary mutations. Primary mutations often have only a small effect on resistance. The chemical structures of most protease inhibitors are quite similar, so {{it is not surprising that}} some primary mutations lead simultaneously to resistance to multiple protease inhibitors. Cross-resistance is one of the major problems of protease inhibitor treatment. Additional mutations emerging in the protease during continuous protease inhibitor therapy are commonly referred to as secondary mutations. This can lead to high-level protease inhibitor resistance.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The study {{describes}} the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the protease inhibitor <b>nelfinavir</b> and its active metabolite M 8 {{in children and}} evaluates the influence of patient-related factors on <b>nelfinavir</b> plasma levels. METHODS: HIV- 1 -infected children treated with <b>nelfinavir</b> every 8 h (q 8 h) were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. 0 - 8 h intensive plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) sampling was performed at steady state. <b>Nelfinavir</b> maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve in 0 - 8 h (AUC 0 - 8), trough level at the 8 h time point (C 8) and relative apparent oral clearance (CI*F/kg) were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-four children (median age: 4. 5 years, median <b>nelfinavir</b> dose: 28 mg/kg q 8 h) were included. <b>Nelfinavir</b> PK were highly variable: 10 / 24 children had an AUC 0 - 8 below the value of 12. 5 mg/l x h, which has previously been {{associated with an increased}} virological failure rate in children. With children aged 0. 69 mg/l predicted an AUC 0 - 8 > 12. 5 mg/l x h with 71 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. Dose of <b>nelfinavir</b> per body surface area was a better predictor of AUC 0 - 8 than dose per body weight. CONCLUSION: <b>Nelfinavir</b> PK show high interindividual variability in children. Children < 2 years old tend to be at increased risk for low <b>nelfinavir</b> levels. These data show that the <b>nelfinavir</b> dose of 20 mg/kg q 8 h is inadequate in most children. Also, these data suggest that paediatric dosing of <b>nelfinavir</b> based on body surface area should be considered. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can detect abnormal plasma levels and is therefore useful in optimizing <b>nelfinavir</b> therapy in HIV-infected children. However, {{further research is needed to}} more firmly establish a therapeutic range for <b>nelfinavir</b> in children...|$|E
40|$|A study {{explored}} the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir (300 mg administered once daily) and <b>nelfinavir</b> (1, 250 mg twice daily) when coadministered in 29 healthy volunteers. Tenofovir, <b>nelfinavir,</b> and M 8 pharmacokinetics was unaltered when tenofovir and <b>nelfinavir</b> were coadministered, and tenofovir {{administration did not}} affect the M 8 /nelfinavir area under the concentration-versus-time curve over the dosing interval (AUCtau) ratio. No interaction between tenofovir and <b>nelfinavir</b> was observed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} {{sources of}} variation in plasma concentrations of <b>nelfinavir</b> and its active metabolite M 8 and {{to evaluate the use}} of therapeutic drug monitoring for <b>nelfinavir</b> treatment. METHODS: Plasma samples and patient's characteristics were obtained from outpatient clinic. Differences between groups of patients were studied by comparing the observed plasma concentrations with the corresponding concentration on a pharmacokinetic population curve based on median plasma levels. RESULTS: Plasma samples (618) were available from 355 patients taking 1250 mg <b>nelfinavir</b> twice daily. The median ratio between M 8 and <b>nelfinavir</b> concentrations was 0. 29. This ratio appeared to be independent of the time after ingestion. Statistically significantly lower M 8 concentrations were found in Black and Asian patients, or when comedication with CYP 3 A 4 inducers was used. Coadministration of CYP 2 C 19 inhibitors, such as omeprazole, decreased the median M 8 /nelfinavir ratio. Nevertheless, <b>nelfinavir</b> concentrations and summed concentrations of <b>nelfinavir</b> and M 8 were only marginally affected in these patients. Diarrhoea was identified as a cause for lower <b>nelfinavir</b> concentrations, without changing the M 8 /nelfinavir ratio. In a number of patients with suspected therapy failure or intoxication, abnormal <b>nelfinavir</b> plasma concentrations were found. Dose adjustments based on <b>nelfinavir</b> plasma levels were helpful in a number of patients. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the total concentration of <b>nelfinavir</b> and M 8 together is not significantly influenced when variation in M 8 levels occurs. Consequently, measuring M 8 concentrations in addition to <b>nelfinavir</b> concentrations is not required for the purpose of therapeutic drug monitoring for this drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the anti-proliferative activity of <b>nelfinavir</b> in HIV-free models has encouraged its investigation as anticancer drug. Although the molecular mechanism by which <b>nelfinavir</b> exerts antitumor activity is still unknown, its effects have been related to Akt inhibition. Here we tested the effects of <b>nelfinavir</b> on cell proliferation, viability and death in two human breast cancer cell lines and in human normal primary breast cells. To identify the mechanism of action of <b>nelfinavir</b> in breast cancer, we evaluated {{the involvement of the}} Akt pathway as well as the effects of <b>nelfinavir</b> on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and ROS-related enzymes activities. <b>Nelfinavir</b> reduced breast cancer cell viability by inducing apoptosis and necrosis, without affecting primary normal breast cells. The antitumor activity of <b>nelfinavir</b> was related to alterations of the cell redox state, coupled with an increase of intracellular ROS production limited to cancer cells. <b>Nelfinavir</b> treated tumor cells also displayed a downregulation of the Akt pathway due to disruption of the Akt-HSP 90 complex, and subsequent degradation of Akt. These effects resulted to be ROS dependent, suggesting that ROS production is the primary step of <b>nelfinavir</b> anticancer activity. The analysis of ROS-producers and ROS-detoxifying enzymes revealed that nelfinavir-mediated ROS production was strictly linked to flavoenzymes activation. We demonstrated that ROS enhancement represents the main molecular mechanism required to induce cell death by <b>nelfinavir</b> in breast cancer cells, thus supporting the development of new and more potent oxidizing molecules for breast cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Nelfinavir</b> {{exhibits}} potent anticancer properties {{against a}} range of tumours. However, in 2006 / 2007, <b>nelfinavir</b> supplies were accidently contaminated with a carcinogen. This analysis investigated the association between <b>nelfinavir</b> use and cancer risk in HIV-positive persons. Design: Observational cohort study. Methods: D:A:D study data was analysed using Poisson regression models to examine associations between cancer incidence and cumulative <b>nelfinavir</b> exposure, current <b>nelfinavir</b> exposure, and exposure to <b>nelfinavir</b> between 1 July 2006 - 30 June 2007. Results: A total of 42 006 individuals (50 % white, 73 % male) contributed 303 005 person-years of follow-up between 1 January 2004 and 1 February 2014. At study enrolment, median age was 40 [interquartile range (IQR) 33 - 46] years and 8305 individuals {{had a history of}} <b>nelfinavir</b> use [median duration 1. 7 (IQR 0. 7 - 3. 4) years]. During follow-up, <b>nelfinavir</b> was used by 2476 individuals for a median of 1. 7 (IQR 0. 7 - 3. 8) years; 1063 were exposed to <b>nelfinavir</b> between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007. Overall, 2279 cancers were diagnosed at a rate of 0. 75 [95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 0. 72 - 0. 78] per 100 person-years. Neither greater cumulative exposure to <b>nelfinavir</b> [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 0. 93 for every additional 5 years, 95 % CI 0. 82 - 1. 06, P= 0. 26] nor current use of <b>nelfinavir</b> (aRR 0. 98 vs other protease inhibitor use, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 1. 41, P= 0. 92) were associated with cancer risk. The adjusted risk of cancer for participants exposed to <b>nelfinavir</b> between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007 compared to those receiving other treatment over this period was 1. 07 (95 % CI 0. 78 - 1. 46, P= 0. 68). Conclusion: <b>Nelfinavir</b> use was not associated with a lower cancer incidence than other protease inhibitor regimens. As of February 2014, exposure to the 2006 / 2007 contamination of <b>nelfinavir</b> {{does not appear to be}} associated with increased cancer incidence.
