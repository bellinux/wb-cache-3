A sample of 434 adults with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were administered the University of California, San Diego, Performance-Based Skills Assessment (UPSA), which assesses functional skills in 5 areas of life functioning (eg, finances and planning). Through use of factor analysis, we developed the UPSA-Brief, which consists of 2 subscales (communication and financial) from the original UPSA. UPSA-Brief scores were correlated with cognitive functioning, symptoms of psychosis, age, and education. We further tested the sensitivity and specificity of the UPSA-Brief for predicting residential independence using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Finally, sensitivity to change was assessed through comparison of 2 interventions for improving UPSA-Brief scores. UPSA-Brief scores were highly correlated with scores on the full version of the UPSA (r[*]=[*]. 91), with overall cognitive functioning (r[*]=[*]. 57), and with negative symptoms (r[*]=[*]−. 32). The discriminant validity of the UPSA-Brief was adequate (ROC area under the curve [AUC][*]=[*] 0. 73; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 67 – 0. 78), with greatest dichotomization for the UPSA-Brief at a cutoff score of 60. The UPSA-Brief was significantly better than the Dementia Rating Scale, Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndromes</b> Scale positive, and Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndromes</b> Scale <b>negative</b> at predicting residential independence (all P values <. 05).

40|$|Objective: The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} correlates of cognition among patients with schizophrenia. Methods: Over a three month period, in-patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 50) and mood disorders (n = 50) were recruited into the study. Both groups of patients were assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN), the Annett Hand Preference Questionnaire (AHPQ) and the Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF). Patients with schizophrenia were further assessed using the Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndromes</b> Scale, PANSS and the Clinical Global impression (CGI). The cognitive screen section of SCAN (comprising Verbal Trails Test and Mini Mental State examination, MMSE) and the cognitive factor of PANSS {{were used to}} assess cognitive function. Results: No differences were found in the cognitive profile of patients with schizophrenia and mood disorder. Among patients with schizophrenia, poor verbal performance was associated with the <b>negative</b> or mixed <b>syndrome</b> (p = 0. 004), left or mixed handedness (p = 0. 013), greater illness severity (p = 0. 030) and lower GAF scores (p = 0. 039). Poor performance on MMSE correlated with higher total PANSS score (p = 0. 022) and was also associated with the <b>negative</b> or mixed <b>syndrome</b> (p = 0. 003) and lack of clinical improvement (p = 0. 035).

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to explore neurocognitive, {{clinical}} and community functioning variables in order to predict “social reasoning” in a sample of patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenic disorder.

40|$|In this study, the {{hypothesis}} that haloperidol would lead to an amelioration of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -induced 'psychotomimetic' effects was investigated. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, partial three-way crossover ascending dose {{study the effects of}} THC, haloperidol and their combination were investigated in 35 healthy, male mild cannabis users, measuring Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Scale, Visual Analogue Scales for alertness, mood, calmness and psychedelic effects, saccadic and smooth pursuit eye measurements, electroencephalography, Body Sway, Stroop test, Visual and Verbal Learning Task, hormone levels and pharmacokinetics. Compared with placebo, THC significantly decreased smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales alertness, Stroop test performance, immediate and delayed word recall and prolactin concentrations, and significantly increased positive and general Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Scale score, Visual Analogue Scales feeling high, Body Sway and electroencephalography alpha. Haloperidol reversed the THC-induced positive Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Scale increase to levels observed with haloperidol alone, but not THC-induced 'high' feelings. Compared with placebo, haloperidol significantly decreased saccadic peak velocity, smooth pursuit, Visual Analogue Scales mood and immediate and delayed word recall and significantly increased Body Sway, electroencephalography theta and prolactin levels. THC-induced increases in positive Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Scale but not in Visual Analogue Scales feeling high were reversed by haloperidol. This indicates that psychotic-like effects induced by THC are mediated by dopaminergic systems, but that other systems are involved in 'feeling high'. Additionally, the clear reductions of psychotic-like symptoms by a clinically relevant dose of haloperidol suggest that THC administration may be a useful pharmacological cannabinoid model for psychotic effects in healthy volunteers...|$|E

Sixty-nine patients who fulfilled DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were assessed by means of Brazilian versions of PANSS (Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndrome</b> Scale) and DAS (Disability Assessment Scale). Males presented an earlier onset of the disease and were less likely to have ever married. With respect to social disabilities, males fared worse than females on three items of DAS: self-care, under-activity and work performance. the adjusted scores of Section 1 (Overall Behavior) and Section 2 (Social Role Performance) were submitted to multiple regression analysis using the variables of sex, age of onset, age at examination, educational level, number of psychiatric admissions and the total scores of the positive and negative syndromes. Three variables explained a substantial part (45 %) of the variance of overall behavior. These three were sex, age at examination, and <b>negative</b> <b>syndrome</b> total score. the higher the <b>negative</b> <b>syndrome</b> total score, the greater the disabilities for both sexes. Three variables explained 38 % of the variance of social role performance. These were sex, negative symptoms and an interaction between sex and positive symptoms. the higher the <b>negative</b> <b>syndrome</b> total score, the greater the role impairment, regardless of sex. in women, but not in men, we found that the higher the positive syndrome total score, the greater the impairment in social role performance.

Five hundred patients with DSM-IV or ICD- 10 diagnoses of psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, schizoaffective or non-affective psychosis) from independent samples from Netherlands, United Kingdom and Israel completed the Relationship Questionnaire. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and <b>Negative</b> <b>Syndromes</b> Scale. We used both categorical and dimensional approach to attachment data, which were analyzed using ANOVA with post-hoc tests, Pearson's correlations and multiple regression analysis. The conservative level of statistical significance was established (p < 0. 001) to control for multiple testing. After adjustment for possible confounders, attachment anxiety predicted severity of positive symptoms as well as affective symptoms.

40|$|Early-onset {{schizophrenia}} (EOS) {{offers a}} unique opportunity to study pathophysiological mechanisms and development of schizophrenia. Using 26 drug-naive, first-episode EOS patients and 25 age- and gender-matched control subjects, we examined intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) deficits underlying EOS. Due to the emerging inconsistency between behavior-based psychiatric disease classification system and the underlying brain dysfunctions, we applied a fully data-driven approach to investigate whether the subjects can be grouped into highly homogeneous communities according to the characteristics of their ICNs. The resultant subject communities and the representative characteristics of ICNs were then associated with the clinical diagnosis and multivariate symptom patterns. A default mode ICN was statistically absent in EOS patients. Another frontotemporal ICN further distinguished EOS patients with predominantly negative symptoms. Connectivity patterns of this second network for the EOS patients with predominantly positive symptom were highly similar to typically developing controls.

Confirmatory factor analysis verified that the three BaPS subscales (negative beliefs about paranoia, paranoia as a survival strategy, and normalizing beliefs) were an adequate fit of the data. Ordinal regression showed that positive beliefs about paranoia as a survival strategy and negative beliefs were both associated with severity of suspiciousness. This was the first study to show that the co-occurrence of positive and negative beliefs was associated with increased suspiciousness.

40|$|If, as {{is widely}} believed, {{schizophrenia}} {{is characterized by}} abnormalities of brain functional connectivity, then {{it seems reasonable to}} expect that different subtypes of schizophrenia could be discriminated in the same way. However, evidence for differences in functional connectivity between the subtypes of schizophrenia is largely lacking and, where it exists, it could be accounted for by clinical differences between the patients (e. g. medication) or by the limitations of the measures used. In this study, we measured EEG functional connectivity in unmedicated male patients diagnosed with either positive or <b>negative</b> <b>syndrome</b> schizophrenia and compared them with age and sex matched healthy controls. Using new methodology (Medkour et al., 2009) based on partial coherence, brain connectivity plots were constructed for positive and <b>negative</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients and controls.

The poorer the performance on WMS-III letter number sequencing, the greater the positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology. Conclusion Compared to controls, patients showed large effect sizes on measures of executive functioning, intelligence, working memory, verbal comprehension and speed of processing. The findings suggest that impairment in executive functioning and performance IQ is associated with length of illness, while impairment in working memory is associated with heightened symptom severity...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous {{infusion}} of physostigmine (a centrally active anticholinesterase agent) in normal subjects {{leads to a}} syndrome of psychomotor inhibition; this has been proposed {{as a model for}} selected symptoms of depression. In view of its similarity to the <b>negative</b> schizophrenic <b>syndrome,</b> we compared the `physostigmine syndrome' to the negative symptom profile by evaluating the behavioral effects of intravenous physostigmine infusion in seven normal volunteers. Observer ratings and self description revealed significant withdrawal, apathy, alogia, lethargy, decreased energy, slowed thoughts, diminished affective responsivity, and reduced hedonic capacity. Subjects did not report sadness, ideas of hopelessness, worthlessness, or guilt. These findings support the implication of cholinergic hyperactivity as one mechanism in the pathophysiology of negative schizophrenic symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{abnormalities}} in 15 q 11 - 13 imprinted {{region and}} UBE 3 A mutation {{are the two}} major mechanisms for molecularly confirmed Angelman Syndrome. However, there is 10 % of clinically diagnosed Angelman <b>Syndrome</b> remaining test <b>negative.</b> With the advancement of genomic technology like array comparative genomic hybridization and next generation sequencing methods, {{it is found that}} some patients of these test <b>negative</b> Angelman-like <b>Syndromes</b> actually have alternative diagnoses. Accurate molecular diagnosis is paramount for genetic counseling and subsequent management. Despite overlapping phenotypes between Angelman and Angelman-like Syndrome, there are some subtle but distinct features which could differentiate them clinically. It would provide important clue during the diagnostic process for clinicians...|$|R
