5|$|A {{reorganisation}} of Australian cricket {{took place}} {{in the wake of the}} tour. The first <b>national</b> <b>body</b> to control the game, the Australasian Cricket Council (ACC), was formed to co-ordinate the Australian Test team. Previously, private entrepreneurs and the players themselves organised international cricket. Lord Sheffield donated money to the ACC, which was used to purchase a trophy for the champion domestic team. Trott appeared in Victoria's inaugural Sheffield Shield match, against New South Wales in December 1892. He scored 63 and 70 not out in a winning effort. The ACC appointed Trott as one of the six players to select the touring team for England.|$|E
5|$|The Boy Scouts Association {{was formed}} in 1910, {{in order to provide}} a <b>national</b> <b>body</b> in the United Kingdom which could organise and support the rapidly growing number of Scout Patrols and Troops, which had begun to form spontaneously {{following}} the publication of Scouting for Boys and The Scout magazine in 1908. It was also the wish of Baden-Powell to wrest control of Scouting from his book's publishers as it was felt the Scout Movement was not given the status it deserved as the publisher C. Arthur Pearson Limited controlled much of Scouting.|$|E
5|$|The DLM {{operates}} under a decentralized {{framework in}} which internal movements are encouraged and represented in a <b>national</b> <b>body.</b> The party's constituency elects a National Assembly, the principal decision-making body, through proportional representation, where every internal movement forms a list.

Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

5|$|Downes was {{chairman}} of the Masseurs' Registration Board, a councillor of the Victorian division of the Australian Red Cross, and chairman of the Red Cross National Council. He was Victorian State Commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade for 25 years. He was also president of the St John Ambulance Association for eight years, and chairman of the Victorian Civil Ambulance Service from 1937 to 1938. In 1930, he was appointed a Commander of the Venerable Order of Saint John, and later became a Knight of Grace of the order in 1937. At the same time, Doris became an Officer of the Order of Saint John, in recognition for her fund raising efforts for the Victorian branch. She also later served as a member of its council from 1942 to 1953. Downes was instrumental in persuading the various state branches to come together as a national organisation, arguing that without a <b>national</b> <b>body,</b> the organisation would be eclipsed by the Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 {{a team of}} New Zealanders, {{organised}} by the Canterbury {{player and}} administrator William Millton, and Dunedin businessman Samuel Sleigh, was selected to tour New South Wales. This is now officially regarded as the first New Zealand representative rugby side. Warbrick was included in a squad that was selected from throughout the country; the entire endeavour was performed without the oversight of a <b>national</b> <b>body</b> – several provincial rugby unions existed, but the New Zealand Rugby Football Union was not formed until 1892. The squad's 19 players were expected to assemble in Wellington before disembarking for Sydney on 21 May, however Warbrick missed his ship from Auckland and so travelled to Sydney alone. Millton was elected captain, and Sleigh managed the team. The side won all eight of their matches on tour, including the three games against New South Wales. Warbrick appeared in seven matches and scored three drop goals; {{one of the goals}} was reportedly kicked from well inside his own half. He played at both fullback and three-quarter, and was noted for his good ball handling and speed, as well as his ability to drop kick.|$|E
