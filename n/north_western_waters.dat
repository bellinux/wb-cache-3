40|$|The third {{edition of}} the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (NWW) Atlas is a joint {{publication}} between the Marine Institute and the NWW Advisory Council. This Atlas is intended for policy makers, managers and interested stakeholders and aims to provide a broad overview of the ecosystem of the NWW Advisory Council (AC) area. We have {{tried to make the}} science as clear and concise as possible, and keep technical language to a minimum. The information has been presented through a blend of text, tables, figures and images. There is a glossary of terms and a list of more detailed scientific references for those interested in following up certain issues. The first and second editions of the Atlas, published in 2009 and 2011 respectively under the MEFEPO project, were extremely well received and this new edition has been modified in response to stakeholder feedback to provide updated information on the physical and chemical features, habitat types, biological features, birds, mammals, fishing activity and other human activities taking place within the NWW region. We have received valuable contributions from non-governmental organisations, which use citizen science to collect information on the marine ecosystem around us. Whenever citizen science is used to complement the existing knowledge, this is clearly marked in the relevant sections. The <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (NWW) area is situated in the north east Atlantic off the west coast of Ireland and Scotland, and extends into the Celtic Sea, Irish Sea and the English Channel.

40|$|AbstractThe idea of {{maritime}} border protection has been prominent in recent Australian political discourse {{because of its}} coincidence with asylum seekers arriving at Australian territories by boat. Yet this construct is misleading. There is no maritime “border” and asylum boats, although the current challenge {{are not necessarily the}} most difficult problem faced in managing Australia 2 ̆ 7 s maritime domain. This task is shaped by the geographic, legislative and administrative environment, which governs how this management occurs and how emerging challenges are tackled. The resulting arrangements have benefits but also inherent weaknesses at the points of intersection in a system of co-operation and coordination. The influx of asylum boats into Australia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>north</b> <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> since 2009 has greatly stressed these arrangements and may have brought them close to breaking point...|$|E
40|$|MEFEPO (Making the European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan Operational) is a {{group of}} ecologists, economists, {{management}} experts and fisheries scientists who are trying to make ecosystem based fisheries management a reality in Europe. This Atlas is intended for policy makers, managers and interested stakeholders. Its purpose is to provide an ecosystem overview of the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> area (NWW) Regional Advisory Council (RAC) area. The Atlas includes general summary information on the physical and chemical features, habitat types, biological features, birds, mammals, fishing activity and other human activities of the NWW region. Background material on four NWW case study fisheries is presented (North East Atlantic Mackerel, Northern Hake, Dublin Bay Prawn and Scallops).

This study was conducted to determine impacts of extreme weather on sea surface temperature in the <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera and the southern waters of Java in June 2016. Daily surface wind (2007 - 2016), sea surface temperature (1987 - 2016), sea wave height (1 - 10 June 2016) and surface current (1994 - 2016) were analyzed using anomaly analysis to assess the impact of surface winds on surface ocean. The result showed that in June 2016 extreme weather occurred in these waters that was characterized by sea wave height reached 2. 6 m. Impacts of extreme weather in these waters cause upwelling intensity weakened that was marked by increase of sea surface temperature. The increases of sea surface temperature in the middle to <b>north</b> of <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera reached 0. 9 OC, in the middle to south of <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Sumatera reached 1. 8 OC and in the southern waters of Java reached 1. 6 OC...|$|R
40|$|Atlantic chub {{mackerel}} (Scomber colias, Gmelin, 1978) is a middle-sized pelagic fish distributed in warm and temperate Northeast Atlantic waters. The {{bulk of the}} catches takes place in <b>north</b> <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Africa, but landing are significantly increased {{in the most recent}} years in the Iberian Peninsula, resulting a new target species for both Portuguese and Spanish purse seiner fleets which partially replaces the important drop of sardine landings in both countries. Given this increasing importance and the lack, for the time being, of any scientific assessment, nor management plan and in order to update the available biological and catch information on this specie in Spanish Atlantic waters, this paper working document compile, review and analyze the existing data of biology, fisheries, and surveys to further enhance knowledge on {{chub mackerel}} in Atlantic Iberian waters (ICES Subdivisions 9. a South & North and Division 8. c), specifically: (i) stock structure, (ii) spatial distribution (iii) growth and reproduction and (iv) fisheries exploitation. This analysis suggests an increasing trend in Atlantic waters (9 a) in both spatial distribution and abundance, mainly due to the strength of the 2015 and 2016 cohorts. This area, besides, could be considered as a nursery area while the Cantabrian Sea (8 c) is rather main spawning area. The increase of such availability is also discussed within the frame of the North East Atlantic warming...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the reform}} of the EU Common Fisheries Policy in 2002, effort {{has been devoted to}} {{addressing}} the governance, scientific, social and economic issues required to introduce an ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM) in Europe. Fisheries management needs to support the three pillars of sustainability (ecological, social and economic) and Fisheries Ecosystem Plans (FEPs) have been developed as a tool to assist managers considering the ecological, social and economic implications of their decision. Building upon previous studies (e. g. the FP 5 -funded European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan project), the core concept of the Making the European Fisheries Ecosystem Plan Operational (MEFEPO) project is to deliver operational frameworks (FEPs) for three regional seas. The project focus is on how best to make current institutional frameworks responsive to an EAFM at regional and pan-European levels in accordance with the principles of good governance. The regional seas selected for the project are the North Sea (NS), <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (NWW) and South Western Waters (SWW) RAC regions. The aim of this work package (WP 5) was to develop operational objectives to achieve the ecological objectives identified for the 3 regional seas in WP 2. This report describes {{the development and implementation of}} a transparent and formal process that should lead to identification of the “best” operational management strategies for an EAFM, based on sound scientific information and stakeholder involvement (e. g. regional industry groups, citizen groups, managers and other interest groups) ...|$|E
40|$|The landing {{obligation}} {{is a key}} element of the reform to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) which came into force on 1 st January 2014. Other key changes include regionalised fisheries management and a legal commitment to fish sustainably. A ban on discarding comes into force for pelagic fisheries first, on 1 st January 2015. Subsequently, it will cover demersal fisheries between 2016 and 2019. It only applies to fish stocks which are managed by catch limits, or quotas. Non-quota stocks are not covered by the discard ban. The {{landing obligation}}, {{often referred to as the}} discard ban, is a ban on discarding fish which are subject to catch limits, so that all catches must be brought ashore, except where they are subject to specific exemptions. This means that quotas now control what is caught at sea, rather than what is landed onshore. Article 14 of the new CFP basic regulation stipulates that “Member States may produce a “discard atlas” showing the level of discards in each of the fisheries covered by the landing obligation”. For the North Sea, the ‘Scheveningen Group’ developed a discard atlas to document the current knowledge of how much discards are generated in the North Sea and to assemble information on strategies to mitigate discards. This latest report presents an analogous document, following the format of the North Sea work, to produce a discards atlas for the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (NWW) region – specifically, for demersal fisheries. The principle of the landing obligation is to provide a limit on total catch, whereby all catches of regulated species are landed, and once any of the quotas in a fishery are reached, fishing activities cease on species whose quotas are exhausted. It is anticipated this will motivate changes in fishing behaviour and practices. To maximize revenue from their catch, fishermen will attempt to avoid catching fish that will result in a curtailment of the fishing season (sometimes referred to as ‘choke species’) and avoid catching undersized, and low-value fish, which would be deducted from their quota for little or no profit. The level of incentive, and the potential impact for vessel operators, will be dependent on their catch and discard patterns and the quota availability. The purpose of this discard atlas is to provide evidence of discard patterns for different fishing fleets in the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> region. This information may be used to assist regional managers with the identification of fisheries which may need more focussed attention in the transition to the landing obligation, and in the formulation of a Discard Plan and Multi-Annual Plans (MAPs). There is substantial detail presented in this atlas. The NWW Atlas is intended to be interrogated by regional managers to enable comparisons between fishing vessel groups (fleet segments), fisheries and species, and in turn facilitate priority setting. It is not the intention of the atlas to articulate different management options; hence there is limited analysis and discussion of the content. With this purpose in mind, it is important to understand the quality of the data. The NWW Atlas is derived from the best available data. The results presented are based on the official STECF database which holds information on landings and discards between 2003 and 2012. The information on effort,landings and discards in EU fisheries are derived from two sources - effort and landings from the national fisheries statistics, and discards data collected under the EU Data Collection Framework (DCF, EEC, 2000). Discard data are sampled and recorded for less than 2 % of all fishing operations, and these data are extrapolated to the fleet level. Where no data exist for a fishery, fill-ins are used from data from related fisheries, as is standard practice. If an estimate is largely derived from such filled-in data it may be less accurate. As with the North Sea atlas, the data quality of discard estimates was assessed by calculating the proportion of the discard estimate derived from actual observations relative to the overall amount of discards. However, this does not account for the level of initial extrapolation from the samples to the fleet, which can mean estimates are based on low samples. Known uncertainties in the data are described in the text that support the tables. The STECF database was used to compile landings and discards data for some of the most-commonly caught species in the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> (STECF 2013 a) using data from 2010 to 2012. The data presented are from the west of Scotland (VIa), Irish Sea (VIIa) and the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VII b-c and e-k). The data for the Eastern Channel (VIId) was compiled for the Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries and can be found in Annex 8. Discard ratios were used to express the percentage proportion of the catch that consisted of discards. Data are presented in the same format as that in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ - estimated totals of landings and discards (in tonnes) by year and species, country and fisheries. The analysis of the pelagic fisheries was conducted prior to, and separately from, the demersal fisheries. The ‘Discard Atlas of the <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Waters</b> Pelagic and Industrial Fisheries’ can be found here. Included within the NWW Discard Atlas is a review of some of the legislation introduced and research conducted to mitigate discards. To improve mitigation strategies, it is important to know the reasons for discarding. Unfortunately, precise reasons are often unknown, because they are not recorded by fishers, and also because a mix of market- and regulatory conditions may influence decisions to discard. Inferences on the drivers for discarding can be made based on the length of the fish and the presence of different regulations. This is further elaborated upon in the ‘Discard Atlas of North Sea Fisheries’ which can be found here. The various reasons for discarding will necessitate different solutions. It should be understood that the methods most effective at mitigating discards of larger fish, driven by quota restrictions, will be different to discards that are undersized and are driven by the selective properties of fishing gears. Therefore, the data presented here should be used as a start point to identify fisheries which require more attention in the implementation of the CFP. More detailed analysis of the discard patterns in these fisheries is then required to determine appropriate mitigation and management strategies. It should also be noted that historical discard patterns (2010 - 12) indicate the potential issues under the future landing obligation, but pulses in recruitment or changing distributions of species may create different issues for fishing vessel operators than those that can be deduced from the historical data presented here...|$|E

40|$|Phytoplankton {{underpin}} {{the marine}} food web in shelf seas, with some species having properties that are harmful {{to human health}} and coastal aquaculture. Pressures such as climate change and anthropogenic nutrient input are hypothesized to influence phytoplankton community composition and distribution. Yet the primary environmental drivers in shelf seas are poorly understood. To begin to address this in <b>North</b> <b>Western</b> European <b>waters,</b> the phytoplankton community composition was assessed in light of measured physical and chemical drivers during the "Ellett Line" cruise of autumn 2001 across the Scottish Continental shelf and into adjacent open Atlantic waters. Spatial variability existed in both phytoplankton and environmental conditions, with clear differences not only between on and off shelf stations but also between different on shelf locations. Temperature/salinity plots demonstrated different water masses existed in the region. In turn, principal component analysis (PCA), of the measured environmental conditions (temperature, salinity, water density and inorganic nutrient concentrations) clearly discriminated between shelf and oceanic stations {{on the basis of}} DIN:DSi ratio that was correlated with both salinity and temperature. Discrimination between shelf stations was also related to this ratio, but also the concentration of DIN and DSi. The phytoplankton community was diatom dominated, with multidimensional scaling (MDS) demonstrating spatial variability in its composition. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to investigate the link between environment and the phytoplankton community. This demonstrated a significant relationship between community composition and water mass as indexed by salinity (whole community), and both salinity and DIN: DSi (diatoms alone). Diatoms of the Pseudo-nitzschia seriata group occurred at densities potentially harmful to shellfish aquaculture, with the potential for toxicity being elevated by the likelihood of DSi limitation of growth at most stations and depths...|$|R
