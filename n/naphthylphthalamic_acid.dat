40|$|Certain {{members of}} the phytotropin class of auxin {{transport}} inhibitors are shown to bind with high affinity to the known <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> binding sites in maize (Zea mays) coleoptiles. The binding site is, thus, a phytotropin binding site. In general, the degree of binding correlates with the phytotropin structure activity rules and with physiological activities of model compounds. It is argued that the binding site may be a receptor, and it also may be the receptor involved in {{the control of the}} auxin transport process. The possibility is raised that the binding sites may be intrinsic receptors for endoanalog(s) of the phytotropins...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} how auxin regulates sensitivity of abscission zone (AZ) tissues to ethylene, {{we used a}} polymerase chain reaction-based subtractive approach to identify gene transcripts in Mirabilis jalapa AZs that changed in abundance during the time the zones became competent to abscise in response to exogenous ethylene. Transcript expression was then examined in leaf and stem AZs over the period they became ethylene competent following indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) depletion either by leaf deblading, treatment with the IAA transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> or cutting the stem above a node (decapitation). Transcripts down-regulated by deblading/decapitation included Mj-Aux/IAA 1 and Mj-Aux/IAA 2, encoding Aux/IAA proteins, and three other transcripts showing highest identity to a polygalacturonase inhibitor protein, a β-expansin, and a β-tubulin. Application of IAA to the cut end of petioles or stumps inhibited abscission, and prevented {{the decline in the}} levels of transcripts in both AZs. Transcripts up-regulated in the AZ following deblading/decapitation or treatment with <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> were isolated from plants pretreated with 1 -methylcyclopropene before deblading to help select against ethylene-induced genes. Some of the up-regulated transcripts showed identity to proteins associated with ethylene or stress responses, while others did not show homology to known sequences. Sucrose infiltration of stem stumps enhanced abscission following ethylene treatment and also enhanced the induction of some of the up-regulated genes. Our results demonstrate a correlation between acquisition of competence to respond to ethylene in both leaf and stem AZs, and decline in abundance of auxin regulatory gene transcripts...|$|E
40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of the gravity sensing mechanism in maize root caps were investigated using a bioelectric current {{as an indicator of}} gravity sensing. This technique involves the measurement of a change in the current density which arises at the columella region coincidently with the presentation time. Two inhibitors of auxin transport, triiodobenzoic acid and <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> blocked gravitropic curvature but not the change in current density. Two inhibitors of calmodulin activity, compound 48 / 80 and calmidazolium, blocked both curvature and gravity-induced current. The results suggest that auxin transport is not a component of gravity sensing in the root cap. By contrast, the results suggest that calmodulin plays an intrinsic role in gravity sensing...|$|E
40|$|Indole {{acetic acid}} (IAA) is an {{important}} regulator of adventitious rooting via the activation of complex signaling cascades. In animals, carbon monoxide (CO), mainly generated by heme oxygenases (HOs), is a significant modulator of inflammatory reactions, affecting cell proliferation {{and the production of}} growth factors. In this report, we show that treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> prevented auxin-mediated induction of adventitious rooting and also decreased the activity of HO and its by-product CO content. The application of IAA, HO- 1 activator/CO donor hematin, or CO aqueous solution was able to alleviate the IAA depletion-induced inhibition of adventitious root formation. Meanwhile, IAA or hematin treatment rapidly activated HO activity or HO- 1 protein expression, and CO content was also enhanced. The application of the HO- 1 -specific inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX) could inhibit the above IAA and hematin responses. CO aqueous solution treatment was able to ameliorate the ZnPPIX-induced inhibition of adventitious rooting. Molecular evidence further showed that ZnPPIX mimicked the effects of <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> on the inhibition of adventitious rooting, the down-regulation of one DnaJ-like gene (CSDNAJ- 1), and two calcium-dependent protein kinase genes (CSCDPK 1 and CSCDPK 5). Application of CO aqueous solution not only dose-dependently blocked IAA depletion-induced inhibition of adventitious rooting but also enhanced endogenous CO content and up-regulated CSDNAJ- 1 and CSCDPK 1 / 5 transcripts. Together, we provided pharmacological, physiological, and molecular evidence that auxin rapidly activates HO activity and that the product of HO action, CO, then triggers the signal transduction events that lead to the auxin responses of adventitious root formation in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) ...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{roots of}} maize (Zea mays L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) exhibit strong {{positive}} gravitropism. In both species, gravistimulation induces polar movement of calcium across the root tip {{from the upper}} side to the lower side. Roots of onion (Allium cepa L.) are not responsive to gravity and gravistimulation induces little or no polar movement of calcium across the root tip. Treatment of maize or pea roots with inhibitors of auxin transport (morphactin, <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid) prevents both gravitropism and gravity-induced polar movement of calcium across the root tip. The results indicate that calcium movement and auxin movement are closely linked in roots and that gravity-induced redistribution of calcium across the root cap may {{play an important role}} in the development of gravitropic curvature...|$|E
40|$|To test if expansins, wall {{loosening}} {{proteins that}} disrupt binding between microfibrils and cell wall matrix, {{participate in the}} differential elongation of graviresponding roots, Zea mays L. cv. Merit roots were gravistimulated and used for immunolocalization with anti-expansin. Western blots showed cross-reaction with two proteins of maize, one of the same mass as cucumber expansin (29 kDa), the second slightly larger (32 kDa). Maize roots contained mainly the larger protein, but both were found in coleoptiles. The expansin distribution in cucumber roots and hypocotyls {{was similar to the}} distribution in maize. Roots showed stronger expansin signals on the expanding convex side than the concave flank as early as 30 min after gravistimulation. Treatment with brefeldin A, a vesicle transport inhibitor, or the auxin transport inhibitor, <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> showed delayed graviresponse and the appearance of differential staining. Our results indicate that expansins may be transported and secreted to cell walls via vesicles and function in wall expansion...|$|E
40|$|Sites in maize (Zea mays L.) {{coleoptile}} homogenates that reversibly bind naphthalene- 1 -acetic acid {{with high}} affinity and may represent receptor sites for auxins are located primarily on cellular membranes {{that show the}} enzymic and buoyant density characteristics of membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The sites remain attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes after the ribosomes have been stripped off them. Binding sites for <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> an inhibitor of auxin transport, are located on membranes different from those that carry the naphthalene- 1 -acetic-acid (NAA) -binding sites, and which are probably plasma membrane. The two kinds of binding sites can be largely separated by appropriate density gradient centrifugation. The results raise the possibility that primary auxin action occurs at ER membranes and could represent facilitation of the transfer of hydrogen ions and nascent secretory protein into the ER lumen followed by secretory transport of these products to the cell exterior via the Golgi system...|$|E
40|$|Roots of {{the tomato}} (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill.) mutant (diageotropica (dgt) exhibit an altered phenotype. These roots are agravitropic and lack lateral roots. Relative to {{wild-type}} (VFN 8) roots, dgt roots are less sensitive to growth inhibition by exogenously applied IAA and auxin transport inhibitors (phytotropins), and the roots exhibit {{a reduction in}} maximal growth inhibition in response to ethylene. However, IAA transport through roots, binding of the phytotropin, tritiated <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> ([3 H]NPA), to root microsomal membranes, NPA-sensitive IAA uptake by root segments, and uptake of [3 H]NPA into root segments are all similar in mutant and wild-type roots. We speculate that the reduced sensitivity of dgt root growth to auxin-transport inhibitors and ethylene is an indirect result of the reduction in sensitivity to auxin in this single gene, recessive mutant. We conclude that dgt roots, like dgt shoots, exhibit abnormalities indicating they have a defect associated with or affecting a primary site of auxin perception or action...|$|E
40|$|In roots two {{distinct}} polar movements of auxin {{have been reported}} that may control different developmental and growth events. To test the hypothesis that auxin derived from the shoot and transported toward the root controls lateral root development, the two polarities of auxin transport were uncoupled in Arabidopsis. Local application of the auxin-transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) at the root-shoot junction decreased the number and density of lateral roots and reduced the free indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels in the root and [3 H]IAA transport into the root. Application of NPA to the basal half of or at several positions along the root only reduced lateral root density in regions that were in contact with NPA or in regions apical {{to the site of}} application. Lateral root development was restored by application of IAA apical to NPA application. Lateral root development in Arabidopsis roots was also inhibited by excision of the shoot or dark growth and this inhibition was reversible by IAA. Together, these results are consistent with auxin transport from the shoot into the root controlling lateral root development...|$|E
40|$|The Cholodny-Went {{hypothesis}} of gravitropism {{suggests that the}} graviresponse {{is controlled by the}} distribution of auxin. However, the mechanism of auxin transport during the graviresponse of roots is still unresolved. To determine whether the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is participating in auxin transport, the cytoskeleton was examined and the movement of 3 H-IAA measured in intact and excised taxol, oryzalin, and <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) -treated roots of Zea mays cv. Merit. Taxol and oryzalin did not inhibit the graviresponse of roots but the auxin transport inhibitor NPA greatly inhibited both auxin transport and graviresponse. NPA had no effect on MT organization in vertical roots, but caused MT reorientation in horizontally placed roots. Regardless of treatment, the organization of MTs in intact roots differed from that in root segments. The MT inhibitors, taxol and oryzalin had opposite effects on the MTs, namely, depolymerization (oryzalin) and stabilization and thickening (taxol), but both treatments caused swelling of the roots. The data indicate that the MT cytoskeleton does not directly interfere with auxin transport or auxin-mediated growth responses in maize roots...|$|E
40|$|Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill.) roots were {{analyzed}} during growth on agar plates. Growth of these roots was inhibited by the auxin transport inhibitors <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) and semicarbazone derivative I (SCB- 1). The effect of auxin transport inhibitors on root gravitropism was analyzed by {{measurement of the}} angle of gravitropic curvature after the roots were reoriented 90 degrees from the vertical. NPA and SCB- 1 abolished both the response of these roots to gravity {{and the formation of}} lateral roots, with SCB- 1 being the more effective at inhibition. Auxins also inhibited root growth. Both auxins tested has a slight effect on the gravity response, but this effect is probably indirect, since auxins reduced the growth rate. Auxins also stimulated lateral root growth at concentration where primary root growth was inhibited. When roots were treated with both IAA and NPA simultaneously, a cumulative inhibition of root growth was found. When both compounds were applied together, analysis of gravitropism and lateral root formation indicated that the dominant effect was exerted by auxin transport inhibitors. Together, these data suggest a model for the role of auxin transport in controlling both primary and lateral root growth...|$|E
40|$|Phototropic {{response}} in etiolated pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Alaska) seedlings is poor. However, the curvature induced by unilateral blue light can be hastened and increased in magnitude by a previously administered red light pulse followed by {{several hours of}} darkness. Phytochrome {{is involved in the}} red light effect. Phototropic response was almost completely inhibited by removal of the apical bud and hook, but it was restored if exogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid was applied apically to the cut stump. Therefore, the stem contains both the phototropic photoreceptor and response mechanism. Perception of gravity and gravitropic response were also localized in the stem, but gravitropism was scarcely inhibited by decapitation. It was also observed that the kinetics and curvature pattern of gravitropism differed greatly from those of phototropism. Like phototropism, stem nutation required auxin and was promoted by red light. Unlike phototropism, photoenhanced nutational curvature required the apical hook and was propagated as a wave down the stem. <b>Naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited, in order of decreasing effect, nutation, phototropism/gravitropism, and growth. Phototropism, gravitropism, and nutation appear to represent distinct forms of stem movement with fundamental differences in the mechanisms of curvature development...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether actin microfilament (MF) organization is correlated with differential elongation, primary roots of Zea mays cv Merit maintained vertically or reoriented horizontally for 15 to 120 min were stained with rhodamine phalloidin and examined with a confocal microscope. Root curvature {{was measured with}} a computer-controlled video digitizer. In vertical roots bundles of MFs in the elongation and maturation zone were oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of cells. MFs in the vascular parenchyma cells were more abundant than in the cortex and epidermis. Epidermal and proendodermal cells in the meristematic region contained transverse cortical MFs. The organization of MFs of graviresponding roots {{was similar to that}} of vertical roots. Application of cytochalasin B or cytochalasin D resulted in extensive disruption of MFs in the cortex and epidermis, but only partially affected MFs in the stele. Despite the cytochalasin B-induced depolymerization of MFs, gravicurvature exceeded that of controls. In contrast, the auxin transport inhibitor N- 1 <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> suppressed root curvature but had no observable effect on the integrity of the MFs. The data indicate that MFs may not be involved in the graviresponse of maize roots...|$|E
40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin controls {{processes such as}} cell elongation, {{root hair}} development and root branching. Tropisms, growth curvatures triggered by gravity, light and touch, are also auxin-mediated responses. Auxin is synthesized in the shoot apex and transported through the stem, but the molecular mechanism of auxin transport is not well understood. <b>Naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) and other inhibitors of auxin transport block tropic curvature responses and inhibit root and shoot elongation. We have isolated a novel Arabidopsis thaliana mutant designated roots curl in NPA (rcn 1). Mutant seedlings exhibit altered responses to NPA in root curling and hypocotyl elongation. Auxin efflux in mutant seedlings displays increased sensitivity to NPA. The rcn 1 mutation was transferred-DNA (T-DNA) tagged and sequences flanking the T-DNA insert were cloned. Analysis of the RCN 1 cDNA reveals that the T-DNA insertion disrupts a gene for the regulatory A subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A-A). The RCN 1 gene rescues the rcn 1 mutant phenotype and also complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PP 2 A-A mutation, tpd 3 - 1. These data implicate protein phosphatase 2 A in the regulation of auxin transport in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|The heterotrimeric protein {{phosphatase}} 2 A (PP 2 A) complex comprises a catalytic subunit {{and regulatory}} A and B subunits that modulate enzyme activity and mediate interactions with other proteins.

All three A subunit isoforms accumulate in the organs of seedlings and adult plants, suggesting extensive overlap in expression domains. We have isolated pp 2 aa 2 and pp 2 aa 3 mutants and found that their phenotypes are largely normal and do not resemble that of rcn 1. Whereas rcn 1 pp 2 aa 2 and rcn 1 pp 2 aa 3 double mutants exhibit striking abnormalities in all stages of development, the pp 2 aa 2 pp 2 aa 3 double mutant shows only modest defects. Together, these data suggest that RCN 1 performs a cardinal role in regulation of phosphatase activity and that PP 2 AA 2 and PP 2 AA 3 functions are unmasked only when RCN 1 is absent...|$|E
40|$|Auxin {{transport}} {{has been}} reported to occur in two distinct polarities, acropetally and basipetally, in two different root tissues. The goals of this study were to determine whether both polarities of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) transport occur in roots of Arabidopsis and to determine which polarity controls the gravity response. Global application of the auxin transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) to roots blocked the gravity response, root waving, and root elongation. Immediately after the application of NPA, the root gravity response was completely blocked, as measured by an automated video digitizer. Basipetal [(3) H]IAA transport in Arabidopsis roots was inhibited by NPA, whereas the movement of [(14) C]benzoic acid was not affected. Inhibition of basipetal IAA transport by local application of NPA blocked the gravity response. Inhibition of acropetal IAA transport by application of NPA at the root-shoot junction only partially reduced the gravity response at high NPA concentrations. Excised root tips, which do not receive auxin from the shoot, exhibited a normal response to gravity. The Arabidopsis mutant eir 1, which has agravitropic roots, exhibited reduced basipetal IAA transport but wild-type levels of acropetal IAA transport. These results support the hypothesis that basipetally transported IAA controls root gravitropism in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Lanthanum (La) {{is one of}} {{rare earth}} {{elements}} that {{was used as a}} crop growth stimulants; however, high concentration of La markedly inhibited plant growth. Our previous study indicated that, although La induced the expression of auxin biosynthesis-related genes, it markedly repressed primary root (PR) elongation by reducing auxin accumulation in PR tips. In this study, we exhibited that La reduces the abundances of auxin carriers. Treatment with La markedly inhibited the auxins IAA-, 2, 4 -D-, and NAA-induced elevation of DR 5 :GUS activity in the roots, suggesting that La inhibited auxin transport through both the influx and efflux transporters. Supplementation with auxin transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> in La-treated seedlings did not further reduce PR growth compared with that of the La treatment alone, further confirmed that auxin transport is involved in La-induced inhibition of PR growth. Analysis of the protein abundances using the transgenic AUX 1 -YFP and PIN 1 / 2 / 4 / 7 -GFP marker lines indicated that La treatment reduced the abundances of all these auxin carriers in the PR tips. La also increased the stabilization of Aux/IAA protein AXR 3. Taken together, these results indicated that La treatment inhibits PIN-mediated auxin transport and subsequently impairs auxin distribution and PR growth via reducing auxin carrier abundances...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} influence (5 – 180 min) of 50 lM Al on {{cell division}} {{was investigated in}} root tips of two Zea mays L. varieties differing in Al-resistance. The incor-poration of bromodeoxyuridine into S-phase nuclei was visualized by immunofluorescence staining using con-focal laser fluorescence microscopy. In Al-sensitive plants 5 min Al exposure was enough to inhibit cell division in the proximal meristem (250 – 800 lm from the tip). After 10 or 30 min with Al only, a few S-phase nuclei {{were found in the}} cortical initials. By contrast, cell division was stimulated in the distal elongation zone (2. 5 – 3. 1 mm). After 180 min the protrusion of an incipient lateral root was observed in this zone. These observations suggest a fast change in cell patterning rather than a general cariotoxic effect after exposure to Al for a short time. No such changes were found in Al-resistant maize. This is the first report showing such fast Al-induced alterations in the number and the position of dividing cells in root tips. The observation that similar changes were induced by a local supply of <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> to the distal transition zone suggests that inhibition of auxin transport plays a role in the Al-induced alteration of root cell patterning...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of 4, 4, 4 -trifluoro- 3 -(indole- 3 -) butyric acid (TFIBA), a {{recently}} described root growth stimulator, and 5, 6 -dichloro-indole- 3 -acetic acid (DCIAA) on growth and microtubule (MT) organization in roots of Lactuca sativa L. DCIAA and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) inhibited root elongation and depolymerized MTs in the cortex of the elongation zone, inhibited the elongation of stele cells, and promoted xylem maturation. Both auxins caused the plane of cell division to shift from anticlinal to periclinal. In contrast, TFIBA (100 micromolar) promoted elongation of primary roots by 40 % and stimulated the elongation of lateral roots, even {{in the presence of}} IBA, the microtubular inhibitors oryzalin and taxol, or the auxin transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, TFIBA inhibited the formation of lateral root primordia. Immunostaining showed that TFIBA stabilized MTs orientation perpendicular to the root axis, doubled the cortical cell length, but delayed xylem maturation. The data indicate that the auxin-induced inhibition of elongation and swelling of roots results from reoriented phragmoplasts, the destabilization of MTs in elongating cells, and promotion of vessel formation. In contrast, TFIBA induced promotion of root elongation by enhancing cell length, prolonging transverse MT orientation, delaying cell and xylem maturation...|$|E

IAA 0. 1 and 2. 0 % applied {{on the place}} of removed flower bud of sprouted precooled tulip bulbs and after excision of all leaves induced growth of all internodes; IAA 0. 1 % induced stem growth in higher degree than IAA 2. 0 %. NPA 0. 2 % applied on the 4 th, 3 rd and 2 nd internodes strongly inhibited the growth of internodes induced by IAA 0. 1 and 2. 0 %; the inhibition was stronger in case of IAA 0. 1 than lAA 2. 0 %. The inhibitory effect of NPA on stem growth induced by IAA was restored by additional application of IAA below NPA treatment. Tulip stem growth induced by flower bud after excision of all leaves was also inhibited by NPA below its application. The inhibitory effect of NPA on stem growth promoted by IAA and that additional application of IAA below NPA trealment restored the growth indicate on crucial role of auxin in tulip stem growth...|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{influences}} {{a number}} of processes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) through the action of five receptors. In this study, we used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging to examine {{the long-term effects of}} ethylene on growing, etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. These measurements revealed that ethylene stimulates nutations of the hypocotyls with an average delay in onset of over 6 h. The nutation response was constitutive in ctr 1 - 2 mutants maintained in air, whereas ein 2 - 1 mutants failed to nutate when treated with ethylene. Ethylene-stimulated nutations were also eliminated in etr 1 - 7 loss-of-function mutants. Transformation of the etr 1 - 7 mutant with a wild-type genomic ETR 1 transgene rescued the nutation phenotype, further supporting a requirement for ETR 1. Loss-of-function mutations in the other receptor isoforms had no effect on ethylene-stimulated nutations. However, the double ers 1 - 2 ers 2 - 3 and triple etr 2 - 3 ers 2 - 3 ein 4 - 4 loss-of-function mutants constitutively nutated in air. These results support a model where all the receptors are involved in ethylene-stimulated nutations, but the ETR 1 receptor is required and has a contrasting role from the other receptor isoforms in this nutation phenotype. <b>Naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> eliminated ethylene-stimulated nutations but had no effect on growth inhibition caused by ethylene, pointing to a role for auxin transport in the nutation phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Proteins that {{interact}} with the actin cytoskeleton often modulate the dynamics or organization of the cytoskeleton or use the cytoskeleton to control their localization. In plants, very few actin-binding proteins have been identified and most are thought to modulate cytoskeleton function. To identify actin-binding proteins that are unique to plants, {{the development of new}} biochemical procedures will be critical. Affinity columns using actin monomers (globular actin, G-actin) or actin filaments (filamentous actin, F-actin) have been used to identify actin-binding proteins {{from a wide variety of}} organisms. Monomeric actin from zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) hypocotyl tissue was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and shown to be native and competent for polymerization to actin filaments. G-actin, F-actin and bovine serum albumin affinity columns were prepared and used to separate samples enriched in either soluble or membrane-associated actin-binding proteins. Extracts of soluble actin-binding proteins yield distinct patterns when eluted from the G-actin and F-actin columns, respectively, leading to the identification of a putative F-actin-binding protein of approximately 40 kDa. When plasma membrane-associated proteins were applied to these columns, two abundant polypeptides eluted selectively from the F-actin column and cross-reacted with antiserum against pea annexins. Additionally, a protein that binds auxin transport inhibitors, the <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> binding protein, which has been previously suggested to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, was eluted in a single peak from the F-actin column. These experiments provide a new approach that may help to identify novel actin-binding proteins from plants...|$|E
40|$|Auxin and polar auxin {{transport}} {{have been}} implicated in controlling embryo development in land plants. The goal of these studies {{was to determine if}} auxin and auxin transport are also important during the earliest stages of development in embryos of the brown alga Fucus distichus. Indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) was identified in F. distichus embryos and mature tissues by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. F. distichus embryos accumulate [(3) H]IAA and an inhibitor of IAA efflux, <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA), elevates IAA accumulation, suggesting the presence of an auxin efflux protein complex similar to that found in land plants. F. distichus embryos normally develop with a single unbranched rhizoid, but growth on IAA leads to formation of multiple rhizoids and growth on NPA leads to formation of embryos with branched rhizoids, at concentrations that are active in auxin accumulation assays. The effects of IAA and NPA are complete before 6 h after fertilization (AF), which is before rhizoid germination and cell division. The maximal effects of IAA and NPA are between 3. 5 and 5 h AF and 4 and 5. 5 h AF, respectively. Although, the location of the planes of cell division was significantly altered in NPA- and IAA-treated embryos, these abnormal divisions occurred after abnormal rhizoid initiation and branching was observed.

40|$|Auxin {{transport}} {{is required}} for important growth and developmental processes in plants, including gravity response and lateral root growth. Several lines of evidence suggest that reversible protein phosphorylation regulates auxin transport. Arabidopsis rcn 1 mutant seedlings exhibit reduced protein phosphatase 2 A activity and defects in differential cell elongation. Here we report that reduced phosphatase activity alters auxin transport and dependent physiological processes in the seedling root. Root basipetal transport was increased in rcn 1 or phosphatase inhibitor-treated seedlings but showed normal sensitivity to the auxin transport inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA). Phosphatase inhibition reduced root gravity response and delayed the establishment of differential auxin-induced gene expression across a gravity-stimulated root tip. An NPA treatment that reduced basipetal transport in rcn 1 and cantharidin-treated wild-type plants also restored a normal gravity response and asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression, indicating that increased basipetal auxin transport impedes gravitropism. Increased auxin transport in rcn 1 or phosphatase inhibitor-treated seedlings did not require the AGR 1 /EIR 1 /PIN 2 /WAV 6 or AUX 1 gene products. In contrast to basipetal transport, root acropetal transport was normal in phosphatase-inhibited seedlings {{in the absence of}} NPA, although it showed reduced NPA sensitivity. Lateral root growth also exhibited reduced NPA sensitivity in rcn 1 seedlings, consistent with acropetal transport controlling lateral root growth. These results support the role of protein phosphorylation in regulating auxin transport and suggest that the acropetal and basipetal auxin transport streams are differentially regulated...|$|E
40|$|Exogenously {{supplied}} auxin (1 -naphthaleneacetic acid) inhibited light-induced activity {{increase of}} polyamine oxidase (PAO), a hydrogen peroxide-producing enzyme, {{in the outer}} tissues of maize (Zea mays) mesocotyl. The same phenomenon operates at PAO protein and mRNA accumulation levels. The wall-bound to extractable PAO activity ratio was unaffected by auxin treatment, either in the dark or after light exposure. Ethylene treatment did not affect PAO activity, thus excluding an effect of auxin via increased ethylene biosynthesis. The auxin polar transport inhibitors N 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid or 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid caused a further increase of PAO expression in outer tissues after light treatment. The small increase of PAO expression, normally occurring in the mesocotyl epidermis during plant development in the dark, was also inhibited by auxin, although {{to a lesser extent}} with respect to light-exposed tissue, and was stimulated by N 1 - <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> or 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid, thus suggesting a complex regulation of PAO expression. Immunogold ultrastructural analysis in epidermal cells revealed the association of PAO with the secretory pathway and the cell walls. The presence of the enzyme in the cell walls of this tissue greatly increased in response to light treatment. Consistent with auxin effects on light-induced PAO expression, the hormone treatment inhibited the increase in immunogold staining both intraprotoplasmically and in the cell wall. These results suggest that both light and auxin finely tune PAO expression during the light-induced differentiation of the cell wall in the maize mesocotyl epidermal tissues...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{parameters}} of auxin transport in suspension-cultured soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) root cells were investigated. The same {{processes that are}} responsible for polar indoleacetic acid (IAA) transport in other plant tissues were found to occur in soybean root cells. These include (a) passive diffusion of the undissociated auxin molecule across the plasma membrane, (b) uptake via a specific, saturable carrier, and (c) phytotropin-sensitive efflux. Metabolism of exogenously added IAA was rapid; {{at the end of a}} 15 -minute uptake period > 80 % of the IAA taken up had been converted to other compounds. The time course of [14 C]IAA uptake in the first 90 seconds revealed two phases, the first corresponding to a rate of uptake approximately twice as large as the second phase. The transition to the second phase was delayed in the presence of the phytotropins triiodobenzoic acid or <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> suggesting that an increase in the efflux of label as IAA accumulates in the cytoplasm is responsible for the transition. Carrier-mediated uptake contributes between 50 and 60 % to the total rate of auxin uptake from a 0. 28 micromolar IAA solution, with passive diffusion accounting for the remainder. Kinetic analysis of carrier-mediated uptake revealed a pH optimum of 5. 0 and a Michaelis-Menten constant of 0. 4 micromolar at pH 5. 5. Because phytotropins had no effect on the initial rate of uptake, the efflux carrier does not appear to be involved in the uptake process...|$|E
40|$|Land plants orient {{their growth}} {{relative}} to light and gravity through complex mechanisms that require auxin redistribution. Embryos of brown algae use similar environmental stimuli to orient their developmental polarity. These {{studies of the}} brown algae Fucus distichus examined whether auxin and auxin transport are also required during polarization in early embryos and to orient growth in already developed tissues. These embryos polarize with the gravity vector {{in the absence of}} a light cue. The auxin, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), and auxin efflux inhibitors, such as <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA), reduced environmental polarization in response to gravity and light vectors. Young rhizoids are negatively phototropic, and NPA also inhibits rhizoid phototropism. The effect of IAA and NPA on gravity and photopolarization is maximal within 2. 5 to 4. 5 h after fertilization (AF). Over the first 6 h AF, auxin transport is relatively constant, suggesting that developmentally controlled sensitivity to auxin determines the narrow window during which NPA and IAA reduce environmental polarization. Actin patches were formed during the first hour AF and began to photolocalize within 3 h, coinciding with the time of NPA and IAA action. Treatment with NPA reduced the polar localization of actin patches but not patch formation. Latrunculin B prevented environmental polarization in a time frame that overlaps the formation of actin patches and IAA and NPA action. Latrunculin B also altered auxin transport. Together, these results indicate a role for auxin in the orientation of developmental polarity and suggest interactions between the actin cytoskeleton and auxin transport in F. distichus embryos...|$|E
40|$|In Arabidopsis, NAC (NAM, ATAF and CUC) {{transcription}} {{factors have}} been found to promote lateral root number through the auxin signaling pathway. In the present study, the role of water stress–inducible soybean GmNAC 003 and GmNAC 004 genes in the enhancement of lateral root development under water deficit conditions was investigated. Both genes were highly expressed in roots, leaves and flowers of soybean and were strongly induced by water stress and moderately induced by a treatment with abscisic acid (ABA). They showed a slight response to treatment with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D). The transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing GmNAC 004 showed an increase in lateral root number and length under non-stress conditions and maintained higher lateral root number and length under mild water stress conditions compared to the wild-type (WT), while the transgenic plants overexpressing GmNAC 003 did not show any response. However, LR development of GmNAC 004 transgenic Arabidopsis plants was not enhanced in the water-stressed compared to the well-watered treatment. In the treatment with ABA, LR density of the GmNAC 004 transgenic Arabidopsis was less suppressed than that of the WT, suggesting that GmNAC 004 counteracts ABA-induced inhibition of lateral root development. In the treatment with 2, 4 -D, lateral root density was enhanced in both GmNAC 004 transgenic Arabidopsis and WT plants but the promotion was higher in the transgenic plants. Conversely, in the treatment with <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA), lateral root density was inhibited and {{there was no difference in}} the phenotype of the GmNAC 004 transgeni...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of excised hypocotyl segments to indoleacetic acid (IAA) in two assays, ethylene production and elongation, was determined in the ethylene-requiring tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) mutant, diageotropica (dgt), and its isogenic parent, cv VFN 8. Endogenous (uninduced) ethylene synthesis rates were slightly lower in dgt hypocotyls than in VFN 8 hypocotyls. Ethylene production was essentially unaffected by IAA in dgt, but was stimulated up to 10 -fold by 10 micromolar IAA in VFN 8. Elongation of dgt hypocotyls was also insensitive to concentrations of IAA {{as high as}} 100 micromolar, as compared to significant elongation of VFN 8 hypocotyls in response to 0. 1 micromolar IAA. A range of IAA analogs active in VFN 8 was also ineffective in stimulating elongation of dgt hypocotyls, suggesting that the differences were not due to rapid metabolism of IAA by dgt tissues. Auxin-induced elongation of VFN 8 hypocotyls was unaffected by 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid and <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> indicating that polar auxin transport was not a factor in these experiments. Exogenous and auxin-induced ethylene {{had no effect on}} the elongation respone of either genotype, nor did exogenous ethylene restore the {{sensitivity of}} dgt hypocotyls to IAA. Despite their apparent insensitivity to auxin, dgt hypocotyls elongated dramatically and synthesized ethylene rapidly in response to 1. 2 micromolar fusicoccin. These results suggest that the primary effect of the dgt mutation is to reduce the sensitivity of the tissue to auxin. As altered regulation of ethylene synthesis is only one symptom of this fundamental deficiency, dgt should more properly be considered to be the auxin-insensitive tomato mutant...|$|E
40|$|The gravitropic bending {{of plants}} {{has long been}} linked to the changes in the {{transport}} of the plant hormone auxin. To understand the mechanism by which gravity alters auxin movement, it is critical to know how polar auxin transport is initially established. In shoots, polar auxin transport is basipetal (i. e., from the shoot apex toward the base). It is driven by the basal localization of the auxin efflux carrier complex. One mechanism for localizing this efflux carrier complex to the basal membrane may be through attachment to the actin cytoskeleton. The efflux carrier protein complex is believed to consist of several polypeptides, including a regulatory subunit that binds auxin transport inhibitors, such as <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA). Several lines of experimentation have been used to determine if the NPA binding protein interacts with actin filaments. The NPA binding protein has been shown to partition with the actin cytoskeleton during detergent extraction. Agents that specifically alter the polymerization state of the actin cytoskeleton change the amount of NPA binding protein and actin recovered in these cytoskeletal pellets. Actin-affinity columns were prepared with polymers of actin purified from zucchini hypocotyl tissue. NPA binding activity was eluted in a single peak from the actin filament column. Cytochalasin D, which fragments the actin cytoskeleton, was shown to reduce polar auxin transport in zucchini hypocotyls. The interaction of the NPA binding protein with the actin cytoskeleton may localize it in one plane of the plasma membrane, and thereby control the polarity of auxin transport...|$|E
40|$|Protein dephosphorylation by the serine/threonine protein {{phosphatase}} 2 A (PP 2 A) modulates a {{broad array}} of cellular functions. PP 2 A normally acts as a heterotrimeric holoenzyme complex comprising a catalytic subunit bound by regulatory A and B subunits. Characterization of the regulatory A subunit isoforms (ROOTS CURL IN <b>NAPHTHYLPHTHALAMIC</b> <b>ACID</b> 1 [RCN 1], PP 2 AA 2, and PP 2 AA 3) of Arabidopsis thaliana PP 2 A has shown that RCN 1 plays a primary role in controlling root and hypocotyl PP 2 A activity in seedlings. Here we show that hypocotyl and root growth exhibit different requirements for RCN 1 -mediated regulation of PP 2 A activity. Roots of rcn 1 mutant seedlings exhibit characteristic abnormalities in cell division patterns at the root apical meristem, as well as reduced growth under ionic, osmotic, and oxidative stress conditions. We constructed chimeric A subunit genes and found that restoration of normal root tip development in rcn 1 plants requires both regulatory and coding sequences of RCN 1, whereas the hypocotyl elongation defect of rcn 1 plants can be complemented by either RCN 1 or PP 2 AA 3 transgenes. Furthermore, the RCN 1 and PP 2 AA 3 proteins exhibit ubiquitous subcellular localization patterns in seedlings and both associate with membrane compartments. Together, these results show that RCN 1 -containing PP 2 A has unique functions that cannot be attributed to isoform-specific expression and localization patterns. Postembryonic RCN 1 function is required to maintain normal auxin distribution and stem cell function at the root apex. Our data show that RCN 1 -regulated phosphatase activity plays a unique role in regulating postembryonic root development and stress response...|$|E
40|$|Polar {{transport}} of the auxin indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) {{has recently been}} shown to occur in Arabidopsis (Arabidopis thaliana) seedlings, yet the physiological importance of this process {{has yet to be}} fully resolved. Here we describe the first demonstration of altered IBA transport in an Arabidopsis mutant, and show that the resistant to IBA (rib 1) mutation results in alterations in growth, development, and response to exogenous auxin consistent with an important physiological role for IBA transport. Both hypocotyl and root IBA basipetal transport are decreased in rib 1 and root acropetal IBA transport is increased. While indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) transport levels are not different in rib 1 compared to wild type, root acropetal IAA transport is insensitive to the IAA efflux inhibitor <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> in rib 1, as is the dependent physiological process of lateral root formation. These observed changes in IBA transport are accompanied by altered rib 1 phenotypes. Previously, rib 1 roots were shown to be less sensitive to growth inhibition by IBA, but to have a wild-type response to IAA in root elongation. rib 1 is also less sensitive to IBA in stimulation of lateral root formation and in hypocotyl elongation under most, but not all, light and sucrose conditions. rib 1 has wild-type responses to IAA, except under one set of conditions, low light and 1. 5 % sucrose, in which both hypocotyl elongation and lateral root formation show altered IAA response. Taken together, our results support a model in which endogenous IBA influences wild-type seedling morphology. Modifications in IBA distribution in seedlings affect hypocotyl and root elongation, as well as lateral root formation...|$|E
40|$|The roots curl in <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> 1 (rcn 1) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {{has altered}} auxin transport, gravitropism, and {{ethylene}} response, providing {{an opportunity to}} analyze the interplay between ethylene and auxin in control of seedling growth. Roots of rcn 1 seedlings were previously shown to have altered auxin transport, growth, and gravitropism, while rcn 1 hypocotyl elongation exhibited enhanced ethylene response. We have characterized auxin transport and gravitropism phenotypes of rcn 1 hypocotyls and have explored the roles of auxin and ethylene in controlling these phenotypes. As in roots, auxin transport is increased in etiolated rcn 1 hypocotyls. Hypocotyl gravity response is accelerated, although overall elongation is reduced, in etiolated rcn 1 hypocotyls. Etiolated, but not light grown, rcn 1 seedlings also overproduce ethylene, and mutations conferring ethylene insensitivity restore normal hypocotyl elongation to rcn 1. Auxin transport is unaffected by treatment with the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid in etiolated hypocotyls of wild-type and rcn 1 seedlings. Surprisingly, the ethylene insensitive 2 - 1 (ein 2 - 1) and ein 2 - 5 mutations dramatically reduce gravitropic bending in hypocotyls. However, the ethylene resistant 1 - 3 (etr 1 - 3) mutation does not significantly affect hypocotyl gravity response. Furthermore, neither the etr 1 nor the ein 2 mutation abrogates the accelerated gravitropism observed in rcn 1 hypocotyls, indicating that both wild-type gravity response and enhanced gravity response in rcn 1 do not require an intact ethylene-signaling pathway. We therefore conclude that the RCN 1 protein affects overall hypocotyl elongation via negative regulation of ethylene synthesis in etiolated seedlings, and that RCN 1 and EIN 2 modulate hypocotyl gravitropism and ethylene responses through independent pathways...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the contribution of}} polar auxin transport (PAT) to auxin accumulation and to adventitious root (AR) formation in the stem base of Petunia hybrida shoot tip cuttings, the level of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) was monitored in non-treated cuttings and cuttings treated with the auxin transport blocker <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) and was complemented with precise anatomical studies. The temporal course of carbohydrates, amino acids and activities of controlling enzymes was also investigated. Analysis of initial spatial IAA distribution in the cuttings revealed that approximately 40 and 10 % of the total IAA pool was present in the leaves and the stem base as rooting zone, respectively. A negative correlation existed between leaf size and IAA concentration. After excision of cuttings, IAA showed an early increase in the stem base with two peaks at 2 and 24 h post excision and, thereafter, a decline to low levels. This was mirrored by the expression pattern of the auxin-responsive GH 3 gene. NPA treatment completely suppressed the 24 -h peak of IAA and severely inhibited root formation. It also reduced activities of cell wall and vacuolar invertases in the early phase of AR formation and inhibited the rise of activities of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphofructokinase during later stages. We propose a model in which spontaneous AR formation in Petunia cuttings is dependent on PAT and on the resulting 24 -h peak of IAA in the rooting zone, where it induces early cellular events and also stimulates sink establishment. Subsequent root development stimulates glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Amir H. Ahkami, Michael Melzer, Mohammad R.

40|$|Fruit-set in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) {{depends on}} {{gibberellins}} and auxin (GAs). Here we show, using the cv MicroTom, that application of N- 1 - <b>naphthylphthalamic</b> <b>acid</b> (NPA) (an inhibitor of auxin transport) to unpollinated ovaries induced parthenocarpic fruit-set, {{associated with an}} increase of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) content, and that this effect was negated by paclobutrazol (PAC; an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis). NPA-induced ovaries contained higher content of GA 1 (an active GA) and transcripts of GA biosynthetic genes (SlCPS, SlGA 20 ox 1 and - 2). Interestingly, application of NPA to pollinated ovaries prevented their growth, potentially due to supraoptimal IAA accumulation. Plant decapitation, and inhibition of auxin transport by NPA from the apical shoot, also induced parthenocarpic fruit growth of unpollinated ovaries. Application of IAA to the severed stump negated the plant decapitation effect, indicating that the apical shoot prevents unpollinated ovary growth through IAA transport. Parthenocarpic fruit growth induced by plant decapitation was associated {{with high levels of}} GA 1 and was counteracted by PAC treatment. Plant decapitation also produced changes in transcript levels of genes encoding enzymes of GA biosynthesis (SlCPS and SlGA 20 ox 1) in the ovary, quite similar to those found in NPA-induced fruits. All these results suggest that auxin can have opposing effects on fruit-set, either inducing (when accumulated in the ovary) or repressing (when transported from the apical shoot) that process, and that GAs act as mediators in both cases. The effect of NPA application and decapitation on fruit-set induction was also observed in MicroTom lines bearing introgressed D (DWARF) and Sp (SELT 23 PRUNING) wild type alleles.
