5|$|Arthur Lennig {{asserted}} that MGM's official budget for Greed was suspiciously high {{for a film}} with <b>no</b> <b>stars,</b> no built sets, a small crew and inexpensive film stock. Lennig suspects that MGM averaged the film's cost with the more expensive The Merry Widow {{in order to prevent}} von Stroheim from getting a percentage of the more profitable film. The Merry Widow ended up being a hit and earned more profits than Greed had lost; it cost $614,961 but earned $996,226 on its initial run.|$|E
5|$|While not {{a bright}} constellation, Corona Australis is {{nonetheless}} distinctive {{due to its}} easily identifiable pattern of stars, which {{has been described as}} horseshoe- or oval-shaped. Though it has <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> brighter than 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (brighter than magnitude 5.5). Nicolas Louis de Lacaille used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. Mu Coronae Australis, a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21, was labelled by Johann Elert Bode and retained by Benjamin Gould, who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.|$|E
25|$|Q, {{the ratio}} of the {{gravitational}} energy required to pull a large galaxy apart to the energy equivalent of its mass, is around 10−5. If it is too small, <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> can form. If it is too large, <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> can survive because the universe is too violent, according to Rees.|$|E

25|$|<b>No</b> <b>stars</b> {{brighter}} than 3rd magnitude {{are located in}} Sculptor.

25|$|In {{the early}} post-war years the {{lingering}} effects of wartime shortages led Michelin to impose an upper limit of two stars; by 1950 the French edition listed 38 establishments judged {{to meet this}} standard. The first Michelin Guide to Italy was published in 1956. It awarded <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> in the first edition. In 1974, the first guide to Britain since 1931 was published. Twenty-five stars were awarded.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> {{brighter}} than 4th magnitude in this constellation. The brightest star in Vulpecula is Alpha Vulpeculae, a magnitude 4.44m red giant {{at a distance}} of 297 light-years. The star is an optical binary (separation of 413.7") that can be split using binoculars. The star also carries the traditional name Anser, which refers to the goose the little fox holds in its jaws.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scientific}} theories {{indicating that}} {{the age of the}} universe might be finite were the studies of thermodynamics, formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of entropy dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.|$|E
25|$|Following the Match-Up segment, another {{traditional}} question round was played with all six celebrities for $50 per match (like the pilots above, <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> were eliminated from play for matching {{in the first}} round). Contestants each then played one final round of Match-Up (choosing from the remaining 4 and 3 panelists, respectively) for 45 seconds, with matches paying off at $100 each. The contestant ahead {{at the end of}} the second Match-Up round won the game and kept any money earned.|$|E

25|$|Lacaille gave Bayer designations to 27 stars now named Alpha to Omega Fornacis, {{labelling}} {{two stars}} 3.5 degrees apart as Gamma, three stars Eta, two stars Iota, two Lambda and three Chi. Phi Fornacis was added by Gould, and Theta and Omicron were dropped by Gould and Baily respectively. Upsilon, too, was later {{found to be}} two stars and designated as such.

25|$|The {{design on}} the obverse (or front) of the seal is the {{coat of arms}} of the United States. The shield, though {{sometimes}} drawn incorrectly, has two main differences from the American flag. First, it has <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> on the blue chief (though other arms based on it do: {{the chief of the}} arms of the United States Senate may show 13 or 50, and the shield of the 9/11 Commission has, sometimes, 50 mullets on the chief). Second, unlike the American flag, the outermost stripes are white, not red; so as not to violate the heraldic rule of tincture.|$|E

The Star Wheel was slightly modified for this Match Game series, as the contestant did not spin the actual wheel and there were <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> under the celebrities' names. Instead the wheel was fixed in place and the contestant spun a green arrow attached to its rim {{in order to determine}} the celebrity. Each celebrity had two red dots placed under their name and the stake was doubled if the wheel landed on one of them.|$|E

25|$|On February 16, 2010, King {{announced}} on his website that his next book {{would be a}} collection of four previously unpublished novellas called Full Dark, <b>No</b> <b>Stars.</b> In April of that year, King published Blockade Billy, an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered American Vampire, a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work. King wrote the background history {{of the very first}} American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.|$|E

500|$|Current cosmological {{models of}} the early Universe {{are based on the}} Big Bang theory. About 300,000 years after this event, atoms of {{hydrogen}} and helium began to form, in an event called recombination. Nearly all the hydrogen was neutral (non-ionized) and readily absorbed light, and <b>no</b> <b>stars</b> had yet formed. As a result, this period has been called the [...] "dark ages". It was from density fluctuations (or anisotropic irregularities) in this primordial matter that larger structures began to appear. As a result, masses of baryonic matter started to condense within cold dark matter halos. These primordial structures would eventually become the galaxies we see today.|$|E
