40|$|An {{increased}} reactivity {{to stress}} {{in the context of}} daily life is suggested to be an independent risk factor underlying the positive symptoms of psychotic disorder. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether positive symptoms moderate the association between everyday stressful events and negative affect (<b>NA),</b> <b>known</b> as stress reactivity. This hypothesis was put to the test in patients with a diagnosis of psychotic disorder. Method The Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (CASH) and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) were used to assess positive and negative symptoms.

25|$|The {{two large}} {{proteins}} {{found on the}} outside of viral particles are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is a protein that mediates binding of the virion to target cells and entry of the viral genome into the target cell, while NA is involved in the release of progeny virions from infected cells. These proteins are usually the targets for antiviral drugs. Furthermore, they are also the antigen proteins to which a host’s antibodies can bind and trigger an immune response. Influenza type A viruses are categorized into subtypes based on the type of these two proteins {{on the surface of the}} viral envelope. There are 16 subtypes of HA and 9 subtypes of <b>NA</b> <b>known,</b> but only H 1, 2 and 3, and N 1 and 2 are commonly found in humans.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the heavy metal and trace element {{composition of the}} powdered aerial parts of Origanum sipyleum L. and its water extract. Methods: The heavy metal and trace elements content of the powdered plant material and 2 % aqueous extract were evaluated by x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy with silicon drift detector SDD at a resolution of 145 eV and 10, 000 pulses. The process conditions were 0. 1 g sample weight, process time of 300 s at a voltage of 25 kV and 50 kV, and at a current of 0. 5 and 1. 0 mA under helium atmosphere. Results: The major elements, K, Ca and <b>Na,</b> <b>known</b> as macronutrients, constituted 11990, 10490 and 970 ppm of the powdered drug and 8910, 2991 and 810 ppm of the water extract, respectively. Among other constituents, arsenic, lead and uranium levels were < 1, 2. 1 and < 3 ppm, respectively, in the powdered material while in the aqueous extract, the levels were < 1, < 2 and 200 ppm, respectively. Conclusion: O. sipyleum is a potential source of macro- and micronutrients from which useful food additives and health supplements can be derived...|$|R
40|$|We have {{identified}} a virus, B/Perth/ 211 / 2001, with a spontaneous mutation, D 197 E in the neuraminidase (NA), which confers cross-resistance to all NA inhibitors. We analyzed enzyme properties of the D 197 and E 197 NAs and compared these to a D 197 N <b>NA,</b> <b>known</b> to arise after oseltamivir treatment. Zanamivir and peramivir bound slowly to the wild type NA, but binding of oseltamivir was more rapid. The D 197 E/N mutations resulted in faster binding of all three inhibitors. Analysis of the crystal structures of D 197 and E 197 NAs with and without inhibitors showed that the D 197 E mutation compromised the interaction of neighboring R 150 with the N-acetyl group, common to the substrate sialic acid and all NA inhibitors. Although rotation of the E 275 in the NA active site occurs upon binding peramivir in both the D 197 and E 197 NAs, this does not occur upon binding oseltamivir in the E 197 NA. Lack of the E 275 rotation would also account {{for the loss of}} slow binding and the partial resistance of influenza B wild type NAs to oseltamivir...|$|R
