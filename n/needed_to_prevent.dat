5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is also <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in those with an underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused to let him go. The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E

50|$|Post-wait {{synchronization}} {{is another}} implementation form of release consistency. As {{shown in the}} code to the right, correctness can be ensured if post operations occur only after all memory access are complete, especially the store to ‘a’. Apart from that, read operation should not be executed until the wait operation has completed. S2 acts as a release synchronization and S3 acts as an acquire synchronization. Therefore, S2 <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> previous execution from occurring after it, and S3 <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> any later execution from occurring before it. S2 does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> later execution from occurring before it, Likewise, S3 does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> any previous execution from occurring after it.|$|R

25|$|For example, {{when the}} {{atmosphere}} is understood as a global commons, it is seen to belong to everybody despite its physical presence at the national, local and regional levels. In this case, overarching rules are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> this resource from being overused (see “tragedy of the commons”). Other examples include the overfishing of the oceans or the exploitation of wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Studies using {{electrophysiology}} and radioactive-labeled dopamine {{have confirmed}} that the dopamine transporter is similar to other monoamine transporters in that one molecule of neurotransmitter can be transported across the membrane {{with one or two}} sodium ions. Chloride ions are also <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a buildup of positive charge. These studies have also shown that transport rate and direction is totally dependent on the sodium gradient.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospects}} for self-government or independence for Singapore was initially {{deemed to be}} less than optimistic. Within Singapore itself, there was little demand for self-government, let alone independence. The communists were the only group that wanted the British to leave, and the communist party was illegal. In fact, the independence movement led by the communists convinced non-communists that British presence was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the communists from taking over the government.|$|E

30|$|The use {{of higher}} tidal volumes, based on older {{strategies}}, arose from a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> atelectasis. PEEP strategies are now better understood {{and the risk}} of over distension better appreciated. So, this need has lessened.|$|R
25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} {{combination}} with estrogen {{as a component of}} HRT for menopausal symptoms. A progestogen is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> endometrial hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer caused by unopposed estrogen in women with intact uteruses. In addition, progestogens, including progesterone, are able to treat and improve hot flashes. Progesterone, both alone and {{in combination}} with estrogen, also has beneficial effects on skin health and is able to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women.|$|E
25|$|The terms atomic battery, nuclear {{battery and}} {{radioisotope}} battery are used interchangeably {{to describe a}} device which uses the radioactive decay to generate electricity. These systems use radioisotopes that produce low energy beta particles or sometimes alpha particles of varying energies. Low energy beta particles are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the production of high energy penetrating bremsstrahlung radiation that would require heavy shielding. Radioisotopes such as plutonium-238, curium-242, curium-244 and strontium-90 have been used. Tritium, nickel-63, promethium-147, and technetium-99 have been tested.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July, the 279-man Thai {{artillery}} battalion {{arrived at}} Muang Soui from Korat with one 155mm howitzer and five 105mm howitzers. They {{had been brought}} in because the Neutralist gunners were incapable of serving their own cannons. Bad weather intervened to delay arrival of the regimental-sized reinforcements of Group Mobile 16 (Mobile Group 16) at Muang Soui until 15 July; they were <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the possibility of fleeing Pathet Lao fleeing down Route 7 and overrunning the Neutralist outpost.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{was inaugurated}} in 1933, drought and erosion {{combined}} {{to cause the}} Dust Bowl, shifting {{hundreds of thousands of}} displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest. From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms.|$|E
25|$|Since carotenes are hydrophobic, {{sufficient}} fat must {{be present}} in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is usually coupled to an unbalanced diet (see also Vandana Shiva's arguments below). Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of RDA for healthy children. The RDA levels advocated in developed countries are far in excess of the amounts <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> blindness.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the relief force began its advance, von der Goltz's Sixth Army could field two corps of infantry: XIII and XVIII Corps. Because Townshend's {{intentions}} were still unknown to the Sixth Army, von der Goltz had to commit {{a substantial portion of}} his command to maintaining the siege lines. This was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Townshend's troops from attempting a breakout in coordination with Aylmer's offensive. In January 1916, the siege was being maintained by XVIII Corps, under the command of Colonel Kazime Pasha, was composed of the 45th and 51st Infantry Divisions.|$|E

50|$|For gardening, Lewisia {{species are}} usually planted in rockeries because this mimics their natural habitat. Rockeries also provide the free {{drainage}} that Lewisias <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> their roots rotting.

25|$|To be effective, however, a culvert fence must be {{surrounded}} by enough water that the beavers will need to dam the entire fence perimeter. In areas where the stream bed is narrow rather than wide, the fence must be narrow {{so that it is}} surrounded by water. Being narrow loses one advantage of the trapezoidal shape, but it can still deter beavers from damming the culvert. Since beavers are excellent diggers, a fence floor is usually <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> beaver tunneling under the fence. The fence walls need to be only 24inches above the water line since beavers do not climb.|$|E
25|$|By {{determining}} an object's {{acceleration and}} integrating over time, {{the velocity of}} the object can be calculated. Integrating again, position can be determined. The simplest accelerometer is a weight that is free to move horizontally, which {{is attached to a}} spring and a device to measure the tension in the spring. This can be improved by introducing a counteracting force to push the weight back and to measure the force <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the weight from moving. A more complicated design consists of a gyroscope with a weight on one of the axes. The device will react to the force generated by the weight when it is accelerated, by integrating that force to produce a velocity.|$|E
25|$|The immunosuppressants {{that are}} <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> organ {{rejection}} also introduce some risks. By lowering the body's ability {{to mount an}} immune reaction, these medicines also increase the chances of infection. Antibiotics may be prescribed in order to treat or prevent such infections. In turn, infection may {{increase the risk of}} rejection, and generally an interaction may prevail between both risks. Certain medications may also have nephrotoxic or other potentially harmful side-effects. Other medications may also be prescribed in order to help alleviate these side effects. There is also the risk that a patient may have an allergic reaction to the medications. Close follow-up care is required in order to balance the benefits of these drugs versus their potential risks.|$|E
50|$|Corporations {{say that}} they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> seed piracy, <b>to</b> fulfill {{financial}} obligations to shareholders, and to finance further development.

25|$|Measles is endemic worldwide. Although it was {{declared}} {{eliminated from the}} U.S. in 2000, high rates of vaccination and good communication with persons who refuse vaccination are <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> outbreaks and sustain the elimination of measles in the U.S. Of the 66 cases of measles reported in the U.S. in 2005, slightly over half were attributable to one unvaccinated individual who acquired measles {{during a visit to}} Romania. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{legislative}} activity has stemmed from Purdue Pharma’s decision in 2011 to begin a modification of Oxycontin’s composition {{to make it more}} difficult to crush for snorting or injecting. The new formulation, OxyNeo, is intended to be preventative in this regard and retain its effectiveness as a painkiller. Since introducing its Narcotics Safety and Awareness Act, Ontario has committed to focusing on drug addiction, particularly in the monitoring and identification of problem opioid prescriptions, as well as the education of patients, doctors, and pharmacists. This Act, introduced in 2010, commits to the establishment of a unified database to fulfil this intention. Both the public and medical community have received the legislation positively, though concerns about the ramifications of legal changes have been expressed. Because laws are largely provincially regulated, many speculate a national strategy is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> smuggling across provincial borders from jurisdictions with looser restrictions.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{most of the}} slates {{were removed}} to prevent more gables {{collapsing}} from pressure on the walls. Three magnolia trees are growing out of {{the foundations of the}} east wing and cover the exterior, which has lost two gables. The east wing contains a ground floor room with no windows, a concrete ceiling and a steel door which remains unopened since the estate offices closed in 1972. In September 2010, a collapse in the west wing caused further damage to the 1832 stairwell. The rooms above the parlour were destroyed as the roof and wall collapsed and the drawing room's rear wall partially collapsed. English Heritage assessed the damage as urgent and structural work was <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> further collapse. In November 2011 contractors for the HTNW dismantled the north wing porch as the gable was at risk of collapse. Decorative masonry was removed for an exhibition that was held in Nelson in 2012 by the HTNW.|$|E
