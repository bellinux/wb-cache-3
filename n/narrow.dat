5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} <b>narrow</b> {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the <b>narrow</b> view. Haworth (1831) using a <b>narrow</b> view treated many species as separate genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively <b>narrow</b> circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E

Unification and rewriting, the central operations in <b>narrowing,</b> are often implemented on graph-like data structures to exploit sharing of common subexpressions.

40|$|<b>Narrowing</b> {{provides}} an operational semantics for languages combining functional and logic programming. Unification and rewriting, the central operations in <b>narrowing,</b> are in practice often implemented on graph-like data structures {{in order to}} discard copying of subexpressions in favour of sharing subexpressions. This improves the efficiency of <b>narrowing</b> not only in space but also in time, since duplication of work in unification and rewrite steps is avoided. In this paper, we study the completeness of <b>narrowing</b> in non-copying implementations. We show by a counterexample that the well-known condition for the completeness of <b>narrowing</b> on trees, viz. a confluent and normalizing term rewrite relation, is not sufficient for non-copying implementations. Instead, one has to require that the implementing graph rewrite relation is confluent and normalizing. We provide completeness results for three <b>narrowing</b> strategies in non-copying implementations: minimally collapsing <b>narrowing,</b> maximally collapsing <b>narrowing</b> and basic <b>narrowing.</b> While minimally collapsing and basic <b>narrowing</b> are complete whenever the underlying graph rewrite relation is confluent and normalizing, maximally collapsing <b>narrowing</b> requires confluence and termination.
