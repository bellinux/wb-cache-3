The paper focuses on seven benchmark years: 1913, 1927, 1936, 1960, 1972, 1983, and 2001. For each benchmark year, the top 250 companies (50 <b>financials</b> and 200 <b>non</b> <b>financials)</b> by total assets have been selected.

This paper studies the liquidity management in India from 1998 to 2010 and analyses the determinants of liquidity in India. The focus is on the liquidity in banks and nonbanking financial institutions. The finding indicates that the average increase in liquidity of banks was 2. 77 % per quarter from 1998 to 2010. The average increase in liquidity in <b>non</b> banking <b>financial</b> institutions from 1998 to 2010 was observed to be 1. 13 % per quarter. In all cases for banks, periods of liquidity decline were followed by periods of increase in liquidity but it was not the same with nonbanking financial institutions which suffered a cumulative liquidity decline of 27. 7 % between 2007 and 2010. Nonbanking financial institutions were affected more in terms of liquidity decline during global financial crisis as compared to banks in India. Discount rates and SLR have a negative influence on liquidity for banks while an increase in cash reserve ratio has a positive influence on liquidity of banks.

An example of an organization that used long term incentive programs was Hughes Aircraft and was highly successful until the government forced its divestiture from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

50|$|In recent years, {{the role}} of the CFO has evolved significantly. Traditionally being viewed as a {{financial}} gatekeeper, {{the role of}} the CFO has expanded and evolved to a strategic partner and advisor to the CEO. In fact, in a report released by McKinsey, 88 percent of 164 CFOs surveyed reported that CEOs expect them to be more active participants in shaping the strategy of their organizations. Half of them also indicated that CEOs counted on them to challenge the company’s strategy. However a 2016 survey of CFOs suggests that their new role has been overhyped with 52% of CFOs still finding themselves bogged down in the basics of traditional accounting practices such as transaction reporting and unable to make time for business partnering. The rise of digital technologies and a focus on data analytics to support decision making impacting almost every industry and organisation will only add more pressure for CFOs to address this tension on finding the time to make the time to meet the expectations of their C-Suite colleagues. Many organisations have embarked on the journey to help achieve this by creating a finance function based on 4 distinct pillars - An Accounting organisation structured as a shared service, an FP&A organisation responsible to drive financial planning processes as well as driving increased insight into financial and <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> KPIs that drive business performance, a Finance Business Partnering organisation that supports the leadership of divisions, regions, functions to drive performance improvement and, last but not least, expertise centres around the areas of Tax, Treasury, Internal Audit, M&A etc.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the concept}} of {{selective}} investment was not a new one with the demand side of the investment market having {{a long history of}} those wishing to control the effects of their investments, what began to develop {{at the turn of the}} 21st century was a response from the supply-side of the equation. The investment market began to pick up on the growing need for products geared towards what was becoming known as the Responsible Investor. In 1998 John Elkington, co-founder of the business consultancy SustainAbility, published Cannibals with Forks: the Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business in which he identified the newly emerging cluster of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> considerations which should be included in the factors determining a company or equity’s value. He coined the phrase the [...] "triple bottom line", referring to the financial, environmental and social factors included in the new calculation. At the same time the strict division between the environmental sector and the financial sector began to break down. In the City of London in 2002, Chris Yates-Smith a member of the international panel chosen to oversee the technical construction, accreditation and distribution of the Organic Production Standard and founder of one if the City of London’s leading Branding Consultancies, established one of the first environmental finance research groups. The informal group of financial leaders, city lawyers and environmental stewardship NGOs became known as The Virtuous Circle, its brief was to examine the nature of the correlation between environmental and social standards and financial performance. Several of the world’s big banks and investment houses began to respond to the growing interest in the ESG investment market with the provision of sell-side services, among the first were the Brazilian bank Unibanco, and Mike Tyrell’s Jupiter Fund in London which used ESG based research to provide both HSBC and Citicorp with selective investment services in 2001.|$|E

The study employed qualitative approach and case study design in which data were generated by using in–depth interviews, focus group discussions, documentary analysis and field observation [...] The study used an analytical framework to explain the relationship between <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation and the challenges of applying it.

Besides, there is no transparency, especially with regard to promotion and recognition. Based on these findings, the study concludes that TPF has not shown any effort of doing away challenges and establishing best principles of applying <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation to its employees. The study recommends that proper application of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation can be achieved by participating the entire workforce on recognition through meeting and seminars to avoid complaints. Also the challenges of the application of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation can only be reduced by avoiding favouratism during the time of choosing an employee to be motivated...|$|E
