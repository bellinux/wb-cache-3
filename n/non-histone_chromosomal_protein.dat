40|$|By {{selective}} dissociation of histones {{with the}} ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate, we {{have demonstrated that}} these basic chromosomal polypeptides, which are effective inhibitors of transcription, are more tenaciously bound to DNA in mitotic than in S-phase chromatin. Evidence is presented which suggests that cell-cycle-stage-specific <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> can account for such variations in the association of histones with DNA. When chromatin is reconstituted with DNA and histones are pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins,</b> a preferential extraction of histones with sodium deoxycholate from chromatin reconstituted with S-phase rather than mitotic <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> is observed. In contrast, the extractability of histones with sodium deoxycholate from nucleohistone complexes reconstituted with DNA pooled from S-phase and mitotic cells and either S-phase or mitotic histones is identical. Since <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> rather than histones {{are responsible for the}} differences in chromatin template activity during S-phase and mitosis, we propose that <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> may modify gene expression during the cell cycle by mediating the binding of histones to DNA...|$|R

The following experimental procedure was applied: 1. Dissociation of chromatin under different conditions (variable parameters: ion strength, dissociation agents, shearing, pH), 2. cation exchange chromatography over Bio Rex, 3. preparative fractionation of those <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> which are not adsorbed on Bio Rex 70 in a Fj/mef-electrofocusing apparatus, 4. micro-electrophoresis of the focused proteins in microgels containing a continuous gradient of polyacrylamide, 5. two-dimensional electrophoresis of the strongly basic <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins.</b> There are qualitative differences {{with respect to the}} components of this class of proteins between proliferative and secretory endometrium and endometrial carcinoma.

40|$|The partial N-terminal {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of the antimicrobial peptide reported in the present paper has been submitted to the TrEMBL database under the accession number P 83338. A 6. 7 kDa antimicrobial peptide was isolated from trout skin secretions using acid extraction followed by cation-exchange chromatography, (t) C(18) solid-phase extraction, and C(18) reversed-phase HPLC. The molecular mass of this peptide, which is tentatively named oncorhyncin III, is 6671 Da, as determined by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization MS. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the first 13 residues of oncorhyncin III are identical {{with those of the}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> H 6 from rainbow trout. Hence these data combined with the MS results indicate that oncorhyncin III {{is likely to be a}} cleavage product of the <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> H 6 (residues 1 - 66) and that it probably contains two methylated residues or one double methylation. The purified peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations in the submicromolar range. The peptide is sensitive to NaCl, and displays no haemolytic activity towards trout erythrocytes at concentrations below 1 microM. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that oncorhyncin III does not cause direct disruption of bacterial cells. Reconstitution of the peptide in planar lipid bilayers strongly disturbs the membranes, but does not induce the formation of stable ion channels. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that oncorhyncin III plays a role in mucosal innate host defence...|$|E

Studies of nuclease resistance of chromatin DNA after dissociation and reconstitution of chromatin proteins and ethanol extraction of chromatin indicate that the histones protect the DNA from nuclease attack.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} specific for the <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> HMG 17 {{were used}} to isolate oligonucleosomes from the transcriptionally active chromatin of chicken liver and oviduct.

In the vitellogenin II gene (active in liver) and the lysozyme and ovalbumin genes (active in oviduct) HMG 17 was found only downstream from the respective starting points of transcription. The transition from HMG 17 -free to HMG 17 -containing chromatin is located at the transcription start. This directly demonstrates that the distribution of an abundant nuclear protein correlates with the observation of moderate DNase I-sensitivity in upstream regions and of high sensitivity in the coding regions of active genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of the problem of understanding the structure/function relationships of eukaryotic chromosomes can be appreciated {{from the fact that the}} human diploid genome contains more than 2 meters of DNA packaged into 46 chromosomes, each at metaphase being several microns in length.

In addition to the DNA, chromosomes contain an equal weight of histones and an equal weight of <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins.</b> These histones are the major <b>chromosomal</b> structural <b>proteins.</b> The <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> are involved in the DNA processes of transcription and replication, in chromosome organization and in nuclear architecture.

40|$|Histone-gene {{expression}} was studied during the cell cycle of continuously dividing HeLa S 3 cells and after stimulation of confluent monolayers of WI- 38 human diploid fibroblasts to proliferate. The presence of histone-mRNA sequences was assayed by hybridization to a 3 H-labelled single-stranded DNA complementary to histone-mRNA molecules. In HeLa S 3 cells histone mRNA sequences {{were found in}} the nucleus and associated with polyribosomes during S-phase, but not during G 1 -phase. Transcripts of S-phase chromatin contained histone-mRNA sequences, but those of G 1 -phase chromatin did not. Similarly, in WI- 38 cells association of histone-mRNA sequences with polyribosomes and transcription of histone-mRNA sequences from chromatin parallel DNA replication. Taken together these results suggest that the regulation of histone-gene expression resides, at least in part, at the transcriptional level. Chromatin-reconstitution studies provide evidence that <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> {{play a key role in}} activation of histone-gene transcription during the period of the cell cycle when DNA is replicated.

40|$|High {{mobility}} group protein 1 (HMG 1) is {{an abundant}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> which {{plays a role}} in several nuclear events involving DNA. Here we demonstrate that HMG 1 physically interacts with the human adeno-associated virus (AAV) Rep protein. HMG 1 promotes the formation of Rep-DNA complexes and stimulates the activity of Rep in site- and strand-specific cleavage of DNA and the hydrolysis of ATP, functions required for viral gene regulation, replication and site-specific integration of viral DNA into human chromosome 19. We show that HMG 1 enhances Rep-mediated repression of the AAV p 5 promoter in transfected cells, suggesting that HMG 1 and Rep also interact in vivo. HMG 1, Rep and DNA can be immunoprecipitated as a ternary complex. Kinetic studies indicate that complexes of Rep with DNA have similar stabilities in the presence and absence of HMG 1. These results suggest that the effect of HMG 1 on Rep binding is exerted at the step of complex formation and thereby may reflect an activity of HMG 1 in promoting the assembly of complex cellular nucleoprotein structures...|$|E

40|$|Nuclear {{aggregates}} of polyamines (NAPs) are supramolecular compounds {{generated by}} the self-assembly of protonated nuclear polyamines (spermine, spermidine and putrescine) and phosphate ions. In the presence of genomic DNA, the hierarchical process of self-structuring ultimately produces nanotube-like polymers that envelop the double helix. Because of their modular nature and their aggregation-disaggregation dynamics, NAPs confer plasticity and flexibility to DNA. Through the disposition of charges, NAPs also enable a bidirectional stream of information between the genome and interacting moieties. High mobility group (HMG) B 1 is a <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> that binds to DNA and that influences multiple nuclear processes. Because genomic DNA binds to either NAPs or HMGB 1 protein, we explored the ability of in vitro self-assembled NAPs (ivNAPs) to mediate the DNA-HMGB 1 interaction. To this end, we structured DNA-NAPs-HMGB 1 and DNA-HMGB 1 -NAPs ternary complexes in vitro through opportune sequential incubations. Mobility shift electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy showed that the DNA-ivNAPs-HGMB 1 complex had conformational assets supposedly more suitable those of the DNA-HGMB 1 -ivNAPs {{to comply with the}} physiological and functional requirements of DNA.

40|$|Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) is a <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> in Drosophila with dosage-dependent {{effects on}} heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. An {{evolutionarily}} conserved {{amino acid sequence}} in the N-terminal half of HP 1 (the 'chromo domain') shares > 60 % sequence identity with a motif found in the Polycomb protein, a silencer of homeotic genes. We report here that point mutations in the HP 1 chromo domain abolish the ability of HP 1 to promote gene silencing. We show that the HP 1 chromo domain, like the Polycomb chromo domain, has chromosome binding activity, but to distinct chromosomal sites. We constructed a chimeric HP 1 -Polycomb protein, consisting of the chromo domain of Polycomb {{in the context of}} HP 1, and show that it binds to both heterochromatin and Polycomb binding sites in polytene chromosomes. In flies expressing chimeric HP 1 -Polycomb protein, endogenous HP 1 is mislocalized to Polycomb binding sites, and endogenous polycomb is misdirected to the heterochromatic chromocenter, suggesting that both proteins are recruited to their distinct chromosomal binding sites through protein-protein contacts. Chimeric HP 1 -Polycomb protein expression in transgenic flies promotes heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing, supporting the view that the chromo domain homology reflects a common mechanistic basis for homeotic and heterochromatic silencing...|$|E
40|$|Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) was {{originally}} {{described as a}} <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> and is required for transcriptional gene silencing {{and the formation of}} heterochromatin. Although it is localized primarily at pericentric heterochromatin, a scattered distribution over a large number of euchromatic loci is also evident. Here, we provide evidence that Drosophila HP 1 is essential for the maintenance of active transcription of euchromatic genes functionally involved in cell-cycle progression, including those required for DNA replication and mitosis. Depletion of HP 1 in proliferating embryonic cells caused aberrant progression of the cell cycle at S phase and G 2 /M phase, linked to aberrant chromosome segregation, cytokinesis, and an increase in apoptosis. The chromosomal distribution of Aurora B, and the level of phosphorylation of histone H 3 serine 10 were also altered in the absence of HP 1. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we further demonstrate that the promoters of a number of cell-cycle regulator genes are bound to HP 1, supporting a direct role for HP 1 in their active transcription. Overall, our data suggest that HP 1 is essential for the maintenance of cell-cycle progression and the transcription of cell-cycle regulatory genes. The results also support the view that HP 1 is a positive regulator of transcription in euchromati...|$|E

After castration of adult male rats, both total and specific binding activities decrease. Administration of 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone to castrated rats stimulates both total and specific DNA-binding activities of prostate non-histones; specific binding is stimulated {{to a greater extent}} than total DNA, indicating that the specific binding proteins constitute a larger fraction of the non-histone proteins in the presence of androgens.

Using pattern searches and position-dependent matrices, we have extracted the AT-hook motifs present in a non-redundant protein sequence database. We have classified these motifs into three types according to their sequence similarity and have found that they are prevalent in many eukaryotic nuclear proteins in single or multiple copies. Furthermore, AT-hook motifs are frequently associated with known functional domains seen in chromatin proteins and in DNA-binding proteins (e. g. histone folds, homeodomains and zinc fingers). In general, it appears that the AT-hook motif is an auxiliary protein motif cooperating with other DNA-binding activities and facilitating changes in the structure of the DNA either as a polypeptide on its own [e. g. HMG-I(Y) ] or as part of a multidomain protein [e. g. Swi 2 p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae or HRX (ALL- 1) in Homo sapiens].

Methods The expression level of HMGA 2 in 59 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 10 patients with benign lesions was detected by immunohistochemistry. Expression differences of HMGA 2 and its relationship with the patients survival were analyzed with c 2 test, Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox regression. Results There were 47 cases expressing HMGA 2 (78 ％), positive rates for HMGA 2 expression in pulmonary squamous, adenocarcinoma and squamous-adenocarcinoma were 70. 4 %, 82. 1 % and 100 %, respectively. But there was no HMGA 2 expression in the benign lesions. Differences of HMGA 2 expression were significant between the two groups (P= 0. 013). It was also more highly expressed in the cases with lymphonode metastasis (P= 0. 007).

In contrast with a previous report [Smerdon & Isenberg (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4242 [...] 4247], it was found, by using equilibrium-sedimentation analysis, that protein HMG 1 binds to all three histone H 1 subfractions CTL 1, CTL 2, and CTL 3, arguing against there being a specific interaction between protein HMG 1 and {{only two of the}} subfractions, CTL 1 and CTL 2. Raising the ionic strength of the solutions prevents binding of protein HMG 1 to total histone H 1 and the three subfractions, suggesting that the binding in vitro is simply a non-specific ionic interaction between acidic regions of the non-histone protein and the basic regions of the histone. Protein HMG 1 binds to histone H 5 also, supporting this view. The above conclusions are supported by n. m. r. studies of protein HMG 1 /histone H 1 subfraction mixtures. When the two proteins were mixed, there was little perturbation of the n. m. r. spectra and there was no evidence for specific {{interaction of}} protein HMG 1 with any of the subfractions.

A direct role for HMGI-C in tumorigenesis has been demonstrated by the finding that the HMGI-C gene on human chromosome 12 q 15, is rearranged in a variety of solid tumors, resulting in ectopic expression. In lipomas, the LPP g ne on chromosome 3 q 27 - 28 is the preferential translocation partner. It was shown to encode a novel, proline-rich, LIM domain containing protein and HMGI-C/LPP fusion transcripts have been identified in lipomas. Moreover, in overexpression experiments, the tumor-derived aberrant HMGI-C protein products are able to induce neoplastic transformation. In complementary studies, i t was shown that targeted inactivation of Hmgi-c in mice disrupts both pre- and postnatal growth, resulting in the pygmy phenotype. When cultured in v i t ro, pygmy mouse-derived embryonic fibroblasts display a lower growth rate. In addition, anti-sense HMGI-C expression has been shown to inhibit retrovirall...|$|E
40|$|Interaction of SV 40 DNA {{with three}} {{different}} HeLa cell extracts capable of directing correct initiation of transcription leads {{to the formation of}} ordered nucleoprotein complexes that are structurally similar to SV 40 minichromosomes and eukaryotic chromatin. These nucleoprotein complexes can be conveniently purified by band sedimentation or gel filtration. Their sedimentation and elution properties resemble those of SV 40 minichromosomes. Electron microscopy of purified complexes shows beaded structures that are sensitive to proteases, resulting in recovery of naked, largely undegraded DNA. Contour lengths and compaction ratios of these nucleoprotein complexes {{are similar to those of}} authentic SV 40 minichromosomes. Their digestion patterns with micrococcal nuclease and pancreatic DNase I resemble those of SV 40 minichromosomes. Such nucleosome-like structures can also be obtained with linear SV 40 DNA. Unlike nucleosomes, no histones could be detected in the purified nucleoprotein complexes. <b>Non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> fractions (high mol. wt. and free of high mobility group proteins) prepared from the HeLa cell extracts can also generate similar ordered structures. We conclude that ordered nucleoprotein structures with certain common characteristics can be formed by interaction of DNA with non-histone chromosomal proteins as well as with histones. Only the former structures are generated in currently used cell-free transcription systems. It appears that only those purified nucleoprotein complexes containing the promoter can be actively transcribed in the presence of additional cell-free extract, suggesting that such structures and their protein components may be important in transcription...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{synthesis}} of <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> in simian virus (SV) 40 -infected African green monkey kidney cells was analyzed by polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis {{to see whether}} the changes in <b>chromosomal</b> <b>protein</b> metabolism are involved in the viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA. During the prereplicative phase of infection, the rate of histone synthesis was decreased until 15 h postinfection, whereas that of non-histone protein synthesis was increased after 5 h postinfection and reached a maximum at 10 to 15 h postinfection when viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA began to be observed. Stimulation of non-histone protein synthesis was also observed in the infected cells treated with cytosine arabinoside and was dependent on the multiplicity of infection. Stimulation occurred in almost all species of non-histone proteins. These results suggest that the stimulation of non-histone protein synthesis is caused by an early SV 40 function and occurs prior to the viral-induced synthesis of cellular DNA and mRNA. During the replicative phase of infection, a marked increase in the rate of synthesis was observed in the non-histone proteins with molecular weights of about 48, 000, 35, 000, and 23, 000, which were subsequently found to be SV 40 capsid proteins...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{heterochromatin}} protein  1 (HP 1)  α, HP 1 β and HP 1 γ {{are closely}} related <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> that function in gene silencing, presumably by organizing higher order chromatin structures. Here, we show by co-immunoprecipitation that HP 1 α, but neither HP 1 β nor HP 1 γ, forms a complex with the BRG 1 chromatin-remodeling factor in HeLa cells. In vitro, BRG 1 interacts directly and preferentially with HP 1 α. The region conferring this preferential binding has been mapped to residues 106 – 180 of the HP 1 α C-terminal chromoshadow domain. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified three amino acid residues I 113, A 114 and C 133 in HP 1 α (K, P and S in HP 1 β and HP 1 γ) that are essential for the selective interaction of HP 1 α with BRG 1. Interestingly, these residues were also shown to be critical for the silencing activity of HP 1 α. Taken together, these results demonstrate that mammalian HP 1 proteins are biochemically distinct and suggest an entirely novel function for BRG 1 in modulating HP 1 α-containing heterochromatic structures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe high {{mobility}} group (HMG) I <b>proteins</b> are small, <b>non-histone</b> <b>chromosomal</b> <b>proteins</b> {{that promote}} gene activation during development and within rapidly dividing cells. They {{do so by}} facilitating enhanceosome formation on inducible genes, via both protein/DNA and protein/protein interactions. The HMG I-C gene is tightly regulated, normally being expressed exclusively during embryonic development. However, HMG I-C expression is also observed frequently {{in a number of}} tumor types, and this expression has been shown to contribute to the malignant transformation process. With the aim of dissecting pathways that lead to aberrant expression of HMG I-C in tumor cells, we have analyzed HMG I-C gene regulation in the human hepatoma cell line PLC/PRF/ 5. One of the two HMG I-C transcripts detected in this cell line originates from a novel downstream initiation site at nucleotide − 161 relative to the first methionine. Transcription from the downstream initiation site is mediated by a PRE located between nt − 222 and − 217. We show here that the Sp 1 and Sp 3 transcription factors interact with the PRE and transactivate the HMG I-C promoter in a cooperative fashion. This study provides the first characterization of this downstream HMG I-C promoter...|$|R
