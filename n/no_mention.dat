These men surrendered with Pickett at Appomattox. Regarding Pickett and his division, no source can be produced which asserts anything otherwise.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of this incident {{in any of the}} many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of the sun.|$|E

5|$|Sources make <b>no</b> <b>mention</b> of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to {{head the}} mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's {{knowledge}} of the Bible, so Augustine was evidently well educated.
