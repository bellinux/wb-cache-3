25|$|If two {{individuals}} desire the same thing, there {{will soon be}} a third, then a fourth. This process quickly snowballs. Since from the beginning desire is aroused by the other (and not by the object) the object is soon forgotten and the mimetic conflict transforms into a general antagonism. At {{this stage of the}} crisis the antagonists will no longer imitate each other's desires for an object, but each other's antagonism. They wanted to share the same object, but <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to destroy the same enemy. So, a paroxysm of violence would tend to focus on an arbitrary victim and a unanimous antipathy would, mimetically, grow against him. The brutal elimination of the victim would reduce the appetite for violence that possessed everyone a moment before, and leaves the group suddenly appeased and calm. The victim lies before the group, appearing simultaneously as the origin of the crisis and as the one responsible for this miracle of renewed peace. He becomes sacred, that is to say the bearer of the prodigious power of defusing the crisis and bringing peace back. Girard believes this to be the genesis of archaic religion, of ritual sacrifice as the repetition of the original event, of myth as an account of this event, of the taboos that forbid access to all the objects at the origin of the rivalries that degenerated into this absolutely traumatizing crisis. This religious elaboration takes place gradually {{over the course of the}} repetition of the mimetic crises whose resolution brings only a temporary peace. The elaboration of the rites and of the taboos constitutes a kind of empirical knowledge about violence.|$|E
500|$|In early 2006, the character's [...] "wacky" [...] {{personality}} {{was deemed}} to have [...] "proved such a hit, that Holby bosses got him back {{for two more}} episodes, shown in September and December (2005). And <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to make Abra a permanent fixture in the show." [...] Series producer Emma Turner {{said at the time}} that [...] "(Abra) made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in" [...] and expressed her delight that Edmondson had agreed to reprise the role. [...] TV critic Jim Shelley satirised the unrealistic storyline given to the character upon his return, deeming Abra's line [...] "Essentially, it's an experiment and illegal." [...] when explaining to the sister of a patient that he intended to transplant a pig's kidney into her brother's body, his televisual 'Bad news of the week'. However, Digital Spy's Dek Hogan was more positive about the plot strand, and especially the role of Abra therein, stating: [...] "It’s been a cracking take this, another example of the excellent form that medical drama has been in this year, thanks in no small part to Adrian Edmondson marvellous turn as maverick surgeon Abra." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 20, it was {{revealed}} that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. [...] City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read [...] "Mr. Wallenda shall pay... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity". [...] Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to [...] "a gift of public funds". [...] Wallenda called the request [...] "disgusting and sad," [...] saying [...] "This was a great thing for the area... gave me a key to the city, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to ask for more money?" [...] He noted that the city staged a downtown festival {{to take advantage of the}} crowds, and said he should not have to pay the security costs related to the festival. [...] His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. [...] He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. [...] Senator Maziarz called the city's position [...] "shortsighted" [...] and accused Dyster of being [...] "disingenuous". [...] He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. [...] On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4-1 margin. [...] Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking [...] "Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it". [...] He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion.|$|E

25|$|Although bearing some {{resemblance}} to the jet powered Avro Tudor 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the experimental Avro Ashton first flying in 1950), Floyd's design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner. The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> the aircraft to cruise at , and they increased the fuel requirements to allow for wider diversions.

The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything.
