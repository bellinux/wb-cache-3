5|$|Following its {{foundation}} in the United Kingdom, Scouting {{spread around the}} globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile in May 21, 1909 after a visit to Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues {{to be seen as}} part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.|$|E

It is <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 80 years old. Although no valid records exist about its date of birth, this alligator, officially named Muja, is considered the oldest alligator living in captivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{first of}} the new light rail systems in North America began {{operation}} in 1978 when the Canadian city of Edmonton, Alberta, adopted the German Siemens-Duewag U2 system, followed three years later by Calgary, Alberta, and San Diego, California.

25|$|Besides JSL {{there are}} also Pidgin Signed Japanese and Signed Japanese. Both of these are signed forms of the Japanese language. The first is used between {{non-native}} signers, and the latter is sometimes used in schools for the deaf. However, up to 2002, most Japanese schools for the deaf emphasized oral education, i.e. teaching through lip-reading. Even <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> officially, JSL is not taught. It has been only a decade since the official school ban {{on the use of}} JSL was lifted.|$|E
25|$|As no {{evidence}} indicates passerines were flightless {{when they arrived}} on New Zealand (that apomorphy is extremely rare and unevenly distributed in Passeriformes), they are not required by present theories to have been distinct in the Mesozoic. As unequivocal Passeriformes are known from Australia some 55 Mya, the acanthisittids' ancestors likely arrived in the Late Paleocene from Australia or the then-temperate Antarctic coasts. Plate tectonics indicate that the shortest distance between New Zealand and those two continents was roughly 1,500km (1,000 miles) at that time. New Zealand's minimum distance from Australia {{is a bit more}} today – some 1,700km/1,100 miles - whereas it is <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 2,500km (1,550 miles) from Antarctica.|$|E

500|$|Slow lorises are a {{group of}} several species of nocturnal strepsirrhine {{primates}} {{that make up the}} genus Nycticebus. Found in Southeast Asia and bordering areas, they range from Bangladesh and Northeast India in the west to the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines in the east, and from Yunnan province in China in the north to the island of Java in the south. [...] Although many previous classifications recognized as few as a single all-inclusive species, there are <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> [...] eight that are considered valid: the Sunda slow loris (N.coucang), Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis), pygmy slow loris (N.pygmaeus), Javan slow loris (N.javanicus), Philippine slow loris (N.menagensis), Bangka slow loris (N.bancanus), Bornean slow loris (N.borneanus), and Kayan River slow loris (N.kayan). The group's closest relatives are the slender lorises of southern India and Sri Lanka. Their next closest relatives are the African lorisids, the pottos, false pottos, and angwantibos. They are less closely related to the remaining lorisoids (the various types of galago), and more distantly to the lemurs of Madagascar. Their evolutionary history is uncertain since their fossil record is patchy and molecular clock studies have given inconsistent results.|$|E

2500|$|Far from [...] "disregarding {{principles}} {{of due process}} and the jury trial right," [...] O'Connor argued, the guidelines system honored them. Under the former sentencing scheme, a defendant like Blakely could have received anything from probation to 10 years in prison. Under the guidelines, he knows what range of sentence he might receive based on the conduct in which he engaged. [...] "Criminal defendants still face the same statutory maximum sentences, but they <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> know, much more than before, the real consequences of their actions." [...] The guidelines also reduce disparities, particularly those based on race, which was a concern of some critics of the pre-guidelines system.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{traditionally}} monolithic kernels are <b>now</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> adding (if {{not actively}} exploiting) the module capability. The most well known of these kernels is the Linux kernel. The modular kernel essentially can have {{parts of it}} that are built into the core kernel binary or binaries that load into memory on demand. It {{is important to note}} that a code tainted module has the potential to destabilize a running kernel. Many people become confused on this point when discussing micro kernels. It is possible to write a driver for a microkernel in a completely separate memory space and test it before [...] "going" [...] live. When a kernel module is loaded, it accesses the monolithic portion's memory space by adding to it what it needs, therefore, opening the doorway to possible pollution. A few advantages to the modular (or) Hybrid kernel are: ...|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim {{from many}} music critics. Nick Levine from BBC Music wrote a positive review, commenting: [...] "She's {{a natural and}} charismatic vocal presence, {{so much so that}} Want U Back even creates a recurring hook from – how to put this? – the sound of her ‘frustrated grunts’." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic wrote that the song is [...] "an infectious example of cutesy pure pop that recall Britney before she lost her innocence." [...] Alex Denney from NME considered it [...] "a sassy bit of bubble-drunk pop from Britney songwriter Max Martin." [...] Danner had previously written in another NME review that the song is [...] "a peachy-keen pop number that goes pining after an ex, Cher drawing comfort from the fact that, even if her beloved is going out with someone else <b>now,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> they’re only getting sloppy seconds." [...] Joe Rivers from No Ripcord wrote that [...] "It's packed with hooks and has Cher’s personality stamped all over it." ...|$|E
