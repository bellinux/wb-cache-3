5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and <b>nanoscience</b> studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube, boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} summit, {{the winners}} of the first Kavli Prizes were {{announced}} in a simulcast linking New York City and Oslo. The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden-Bell for their pioneering work on quasars. Louis E. Brus and Sumio Iijima shared the <b>nanoscience</b> prize for their contributions to the science of quantum dots and carbon nanotubes, respectively. Pasko Rakic, Thomas Jessell and Sten Grillner were awarded the neuroscience prize for their research into how neuronal networks develop and communicate.|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] jumptype=rssInternational audienceThis literature review {{provides an overview of}} recent studies on the introduction of <b>nanosciences</b> and nanotechnologies in secondary education. Four salient research topics have emerged: questions and reflections preceding curriculum development on <b>nanosciences</b> and nanotechnologies lessons; research on students' conceptualisations of nano-related concepts; the use of haptic tools to teach <b>nanosciences</b> and nanotechnologies; and professional development for secondary schools teachers. In a final critical discussion, the lack of studies in the literature considering <b>nanosciences</b> and nanotechnologies as a socioscientific issue in secondary education is emphasised. In addition, implications for future research as well as suggestions for <b>nanosciences</b> and nanotechnologies curriculum development are considered...|$|R

5|$|One notable academic, who {{is known}} for his work in Nanotechnology, is Ravi Silva. Ravi Silva is the current Director of the Advanced Technology Institute at the university. In 2003, he was awarded the Albert Einstein Silver Medal and the Javed Husain Prize by UNESCO for {{contributions}} to electronic devices. The 2011 Clifford Paterson Lecture was given by Silva for his outstanding contributions to basic science and engineering in the field of carbon <b>nanoscience</b> and nanotechnology. The lecture is given annually on any aspect of engineering. The General Electric Company Limited endowed the lecture in 1975 in honour of Clifford Paterson who undertook the creation of the GEC Research Laboratories in 1919. Other notable academics who have delivered the lecture include Frank Kelly and Richard Friend, both from the University of Cambridge.|$|E
