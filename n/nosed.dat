5|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is habitat disturbance, {{both natural and}} human caused. They are also under great threat of white <b>nosed</b> syndrome, {{pollution}} (especially water pollution) and human disturbance during hibernation. Very low levels of light, noise and heat are sufficient enough to wake hibernating bats. Once awoke the bats begin to expend energy and deplete critical fat reserves. If these disturbances are repeated bats, especially juveniles become very susceptible to death. White <b>nosed</b> syndrome is a fungal infection that attacks bats while they hibernate. 7 million bats of 6 different species are estimated to have been killed since 2006. There has been a 12 percent decline in eastern small-footed bats from white <b>nosed</b> syndrome alone. Due to their dependency on rare ecological features where they nest they are at particularly high risk from mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, highway construction, wind energy {{and other forms of}} agricultural industrial and residential development.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Theodore Gill {{elevated}} Hypoprion to {{the rank}} of full genus and also placed the Pondicherry shark in its own genus, Hypoprionodon, based on the relative positions of the dorsal and pectoral fins. Subsequent authors generally accepted Gill's first revision but not his second, and thus this species became known as Hypoprion hemiodon. In 1985, Jack Garrick followed up on earlier taxonomic work by Leonard Compagno and synonymized Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. Another common name for the Pondicherry shark is long <b>nosed</b> shark.|$|E
5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, <b>nosed</b> close inshore and took up station across the bow of Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were battered by the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags as an indication that they had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and set it on fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Nose</b> {{detection}} is {{an important}} part of a 3 D face recognition process. Knowledge of the <b>nose</b> location will enable us to align an unknown 3 D face with those in a face database. Besides that, the head pose can be deduced from information obtained from the <b>nose.</b> In this paper, a method is proposed to detect the <b>nose</b> tip from a three-dimensional face range image. This method identifies potential <b>nose</b> tip candidates by investigating the surrounding pixels. The <b>nose</b> tip is then identified from the potential candidates by their mean and variance values as well as their location which must be within the <b>nose</b> area. The proposed method has the ability to locate the <b>nose</b> tip without any manual input from the user, requires no training and is able to locate the <b>nose</b> tip for faces at different angles.

25|$|Testing of the 40.08 Luftkreuzer {{began on}} 8 June 1916 {{at the airport}} in Aszód. It was {{immediately}} clear that the machine suffered from a centre of gravity that was too high and too far forward. The aircraft was damaged when it <b>nosed</b> over during ground testing and was redesigned with a third wheel under the nose, similar to the Zeppelin-Staaken R.XIV, to prevent tipping forward.In October 1916 Oberleutnant Antal Lany-Lanczendorfer attempted the first flight but the aircraft was unable to leave the ground. Early in November the Fliegerarsenal (FlArs) considered reducing the bomb load, and in December additional chassis rails were added to the main undercarriage. Development continued slowly but many of the design flaws would never be solved. Lloyd applied for a revision of the airplane in March 1917, but the application was denied and all work halted. The Luftkreuzer was placed in storage and in January 1918 it was ordered to be transported to the aircraft scrapyard at Cheb.|$|E

He picked up another family friend, racer Red Farmer, {{en route to the}} track. Allison was attempting to land the helicopter inside a fenced-in area of the track infield when the craft <b>nosed</b> up suddenly, then crashed. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed the crash on Allison's inexperience in helicopters, coupled with the decision to attempt a landing. Neil Bonnett freed the semi-conscious Farmer from the wreckage, but Allison was unresponsive and could not be freed until paramedics arrived. Farmer went on to a lengthy but successful recovery, but Allison never regained consciousness after sustaining a critical head injury. He was pronounced dead at 7:00a.m. the next morning by a neurosurgeon at Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Birmingham after a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain proved unsuccessful.|$|E
