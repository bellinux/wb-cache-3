60|$|Thus, therefore, {{did this}} harbinger of evil <b>news</b> <b>resume</b> the situation. Caligula {{was in his}} palace, {{surrounded}} by the slaves of his household and guarded by a few soldiers against a raging mob--an hundred thousand or more strong--who had formed a ring around the Palatine, and was clamouring for the Cæsar's death. The legionaries, {{under the command of}} faithful Centurions, were cut off from the Palatine and from their Cæsar by the mob whose solid ranks they had hitherto been unable to break. The Augustas and their slaves were also safe within their palaces.|$|E
50|$|Reports were {{published}} only in French until 2001, when the SPS website was opened. On March 2001, news {{started to be}} published also in Spanish. On April 20, 2003, the news were also published in English on the website. In 2005, SPS added Arabic to the language options of their site. On September 2010, SPS started releasing a weekly <b>news</b> <b>resume</b> bulletin in PDF format. On 1 July 2012 news started {{to be published in}} Russian as well.|$|E
5000|$|WAPA-TV {{uses the}} same logo for Noticentro (formerly Noticentro 4), {{changing}} the word WAPA to Noticentro, but with the same red strips at the right. The music package previously used for the newscast was News Authority by 615 Music and has been used since 2004. In the past, the station used Newswatch 24, News One, Impact among others. Noticentro now {{uses the same}} music for all its segments and bumpers except for its <b>news</b> <b>résumé</b> [...] "En Una Semana" [...] ("In One Week"), which used the Noticentro 4 graphics and music package from 1999, but now uses the current graphics and music package.|$|E
50|$|Overnight occurs {{anywhere}} from midnight to 5:00 a.m., and features mostly reruns, home shopping advertorials and religious programs. From around 4:00 a.m. until local <b>news</b> <b>resumes,</b> the three networks air the three U.S. breakfast shows (Today, Good Morning America and CBS This Morning) in a condensed format with continuity meant for American local television stations removed (the U.S. Today show is retitled NBC Today in Australia, to avoid confusion with the Australian {{program of the}} same name, which airs on another network than the U.S. show).|$|R
50|$|In September 2010, {{just before}} the 2010 Swedish general election, the <b>news</b> site <b>Résumé</b> {{reported}} that Zytomierska was being paid to promote the Moderate Party on her blog.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{controversy}} has died {{down in the}} <b>news,</b> Chick-fil-A has <b>resumed</b> donations to some allegedly anti-LGBT organizations, including the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which rejects homosexual members, and Paul Anderson Youth Home, whose teachings include that homosexuality {{is a symptom of}} child abuse, according to 2015 tax returns. However, as of 2016, Chick-fil-A has not resumed donations to anti-LGBT lobbying groups.|$|R
50|$|NBCUniversal would reverse {{course in}} 2010, due to {{conditions}} it agreed upon to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) while seeking approval of its then-ongoing acquisition by Comcast, {{when it began}} <b>resuming</b> in-house <b>news</b> production at the affected stations {{as part of a}} clause in the agreement to make improvements in its stations' news operations through a benefits package by NBCUniversal. On February 1, when <b>news</b> production <b>resumed</b> at KTMD and San Francisco sister station KSTS, KXTX launched an early-evening newscast at 5:00 p.m. weeknights, replacing network programming during that half-hour; in addition, the 10:00 p.m. newscast was reformatted to focus upon a single topic among the day's headlines in-depth, in addition to featuring short-form news reports.|$|R
5000|$|Many famous {{names in}} Australian {{broadcasting}} and television either began their career at 2LF or worked there, including Ken Sutcliffe and Ray Warren of Channel Nine. 2LF only became a 24-hour radio {{service in the}} late 1980s. Prior to this it finished broadcasting for {{the day after the}} midnight <b>news</b> and <b>resumed</b> with a test broadcast after 5am (which involved playing an album) before officially starting with the national anthem leading into the 5:30am news. When 2LF went [...] "24 hours" [...] it took programming from the co-owned 2WG Wagga Wagga with the on air branding of 2WG/2LF. 2WG itself took overnight satellite music programming from 2UW in Sydney which at that time provided radio network services to about 80 stations nationally.|$|R
5000|$|As Zion's Herald, it was {{published}} as an insert in the Southern New England Reporter from 1979-1992. It returned to being published on its own from 1992-1996, with the United Methodist Review included as an insert. From 1997-1998, it {{was published}} as {{a section of the}} Cross Currents <b>news</b> magazine before <b>resuming</b> publication in 2000 as an independent magazine and changing its name in 2006 to The Progressive Christian. [...] The name change was suggested by a marketing consultant in order to attract more readers and subscribership grew 50% in the following year.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, KMPH {{launched}} its first news department and began producing a nightly primetime newscast; {{the program was}} discontinued in 1980. The station would not <b>resume</b> <b>news</b> programming for seven years until 1987, when channel 26 debuted a 10:00 p.m. newscast, which {{has gone on to}} become the longest-running primetime newscast in the Fresno market. On October 6, 2003, the station debuted a three-hour weekday morning newscast, titled Great Day; that same date, the station also launched a half-hour midday newscast at 11:30 a.m. In the spring of 2007, Great Day was expanded to five hours, running from 5-10 a.m.|$|R
50|$|In March 2004, both Akoitai and Neville {{claimed to}} be the {{legitimate}} leader of the party. By April, the two were largely leading separate factions, with Akoitai claiming to lead a four-member URP with Smith, Nakmai and Duma, and Neville claiming that he remained leader. This left the party with some members aligned with the government and some with the opposition. In June 2004, Peter Launa, a candidate for the Neville faction, was elected in a by-election for the Chimbu Regional seat. In July 2004, Speaker Jeffrey Nape ruled that only Akoitai and Launa would be recognised as URP MPs; however, Akoitai and Neville continued to publicly wrangle over the leadership. In November, the Registrar of Political Parties and Speaker Nape recognised different people as being the URP leader, leading to an angry stoush between Nape and Neville in parliament. After mid-2005, the split ceased making <b>news,</b> with Akoitai <b>resuming</b> the leadership and Neville eventually returning to being an independent MP; however, both Akoitai and Neville lost their seats at the 2007 election.|$|R
50|$|The station {{would not}} <b>resume</b> <b>news</b> {{programming}} until {{the establishment of}} an in-house news department - based out of the satellite facility at the Ronson Road studios - on December 27, 1999, when it debuted a 35-minute newscast at 10:00 p.m.; the program competed against an established prime time newscast on KUSI-TV and another newly launched 10:00 p.m. newscast on KSWB-TV that launched three months earlier in September 1999. Much of the news department's original on-air staff consisted of younger anchors and reporters (most of whom were in their early 30s, with a median staff age of 32) and its story content incorporated more sensationalistic feature reporting designed to appeal to Fox's young-skewing demographic. In September 2000, the station expanded its news programming with the debut of a three-hour weekday morning newscast - originally titled Fox in the Morning (later renamed San Diego 6 News in the Morning in August 2008, Wake Up San Diego in November 2014 and finally CW6 News in the Morning in January 2016) - from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m., and a half-hour newscast at noon.|$|R
50|$|ABC {{affiliates}} KDNL-TV (channel 30) in St. Louis and WXLV-TV (channel 45) in Greensboro, North Carolina (which respectively replaced KTVI and WGHP (channel 8) as the ABC {{outlets for}} those markets {{as a result}} of Fox's agreement with then-KTVI owner New World and Fox Television Stations' purchase of WGHP due to FCC national ownership caps that forced New World to divest that station) also experienced difficulty with their newscasts. KDNL, which is currently one of ABC's weakest affiliates (perhaps the weakest among the 50 largest markets in sharp contrast to KTVI, which - although it ranked in third place locally for much of its tenure with the network - was one of ABC's strongest stations), shut down its news department in October 2001 after six years, a move widely blamed on a sharp ratings decline resulting from a transmitter problem that caused the station to go dark for several days. From January 3, 2011, to January 31, 2014, NBC affiliate KSDK (channel 5) produced weeknight-only newscasts for KDNL through a news share agreement (the agreement also allowed KDNL to air weekend rebroadcasts of KSDK's tourism/lifestyle program Show Me St. Louis); afterward, KDNL began airing weather cut-ins during Good Morning America, which are now provided by Columbus, Ohio sister station WSYX (channel 6). KDNL <b>resumed</b> <b>news</b> production on January 13, 2015, with the debate-driven news program The Allman Report, hosted by KFTK-FM radio host Jamie Allman. WXLV, which shut down its first news department on January 11, 2002, began producing an 11:00 p.m. newscast from 2004 to 2005 through owner Sinclair Broadcast Group's controversial News Central experiment; it was cancelled after Sinclair discontinued the local/national hybrid format due to poor ratings. In February 2012, News 14 Carolina (now Spectrum News North Carolina after Charter's acquisition of Time Warner Cable in May 2016) began producing daily newscasts for WXLV, as part of a retransmission consent dispute settlement between Time Warner Cable and Sinclair.|$|R
