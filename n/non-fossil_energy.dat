40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-carbon}} economy, China {{has committed to}} reducing its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions per unit {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) by 40 %– 45 % by 2020 from 2005 levels and increasing the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to approximately 15 %. It is necessary to investigate whether this plan is suitable and how this target may be reached. This paper verifies the feasibility of achieving the CO 2 emission targets by energy and industrial structure adjustments, and proposes applicable measures for further sustainable development by 2020 through comprehensive simulation. The simulation model comprises three sub-models: an energy flow balance model, a CO 2 emission model, and a socio-economic model. The model is constructed based on input-output table and three balances (material, value, and energy flow balance), and it is written in LINGO, a linear dynamic programming language. The simulation results suggest that China’s carbon intensity reduction promise can be realized and even surpassed to 50 % and that economic development (annual 10 % GDP growth rate) can be achieved if energy and industrial structure are adjusted properly by 2020. However, the total amount of CO 2 emission will reach a relatively high level— 13. 68 billion tons—which calls for further sound approaches to realize a low carbon economy, such as energy utilization efficiency improvement, technology innovation, and <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy’s</b> utilization...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} why CO 2 {{emissions from}} heavy road freight transports increase {{in spite of}} higher fuel prices. Swedish time series data for the period 1990 - 2011 are analyzed with help of indicators. The logistic efficiency of the road transports improved especially in the 1990 -ties due to the allowance of heavier trucks. Also the energy efficiency increased during that period. Since then there have been improvements but no major efficiency gains have been realized. Today potentially cost effective technologies exist to further reduce the CO 2 emissions from heavy road freight transport. However, technical, institutional and financial barriers reduce the incentives for the transport firms to imply these. Split incentives caused by contract structures or ownership patterns can impede the employment of these technologies, as the firms that invest in the technologies {{have little incentive to}} do so. If fuel savings are realized rebound effects can appear that cancel out improved energy efficiency. The internalisation of the social marginal costs can lead to modal shifts to less carbon intensive modes, but shippers minimize their total costs and take into account quality aspects when choosing transport solutions. There are obstacles for the increase of the share of <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energies</b> in form of access to raw material, infrastructure for vehicles that can use the alternative fuels etc. On the national and international road freight transport markets staff costs are often more important than taxes and fees.

50|$|The {{carbon in}} proven {{conventional}} {{oil and gas}} reserves {{was estimated to be}} much less than the cumulative carbon emissions associated with atmospheric stabilization of CO2 concentrations at levels of 450 ppmv or higher. The Third Assessment Report suggested that the future makeup of the world's energy mix would determine whether or not greenhouse gas concentrations were stabilized in the 21st century. The future energy mix might be based more on the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas (e.g., oil sands, shale oil, tight oil, shale gas), or more on the use of <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> sources, like renewable energy.|$|E
30|$|As {{energy sources}} and {{consumption}} patterns are critical towards overall {{environmental impacts of}} energy consumption practices, environmentally friendly energy sources should be promoted. For example, fossil fuel based energy such as energy generated from coal, has more adverse environmental impacts than that of <b>non-fossil</b> based <b>energy</b> sources. Similarly, anthropogenic emissions due to fossil fuel have comparatively higher emission and negative environmental impacts, than that of biogenic emission from burning wood materials (Bergman and Bowe 2008). Therefore, while choosing energy sources for the timber production process, {{there needs to be}} proper care in the use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuel-based energy techniques. Even if fossil fuel based energy source are to be used, efforts must be made to use as little energy as possible.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper explores whether Japanese {{economy can}} {{continue}} to grow without extensive dependence on fossil fuels. The paper conducts time series analysis using a multivariate model of fossil fuels, <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy,</b> labor, stock and GDP to investigate the relationship between fossil fuel consumption and economic growth in Japan. The results of cointegration tests indicate long-run relationships among the variables. Using a vector error-correction model, the study reveals bidirectional causality between fossil fuels and GDP. The results also {{show that there is}} no causal relationship between <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> and GDP. The results of cointegration analysis, Granger causality tests, and variance decomposition analysis imply that <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> may not necessarily be able {{to play the role of}} fossil fuels. Japan cannot seem to realize both continuous economic growth and the departure from dependence on fossil fuels. Hence, growth-oriented macroeconomic policies should be re-examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{stringency}} of China's {{energy and}} climate targets in 2030 {{and the policy}} needed to realize these targets are full of controversy, mainly {{as a result of}} multiple future uncertainties. This study has developed a stochastic energy-economy-environment integrated model, to assess China's energy and climate targets in 2030, with a particular focus on the carbon intensity reduction, carbon emission peaking, and <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> development. The probabilities of realizing the targets are obtained, and the nexus among different targets is explored. It's argued that carbon emission management and policy-making should be implemented from the perspective of risk management, and policy makers can take corresponding policy measures based on the degree of confidence required under multiple future uncertainties. It is found that the probabilities of realizing carbon emission-peaking target and <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> target are low, with the business-as-usual efforts, and additional policies may still be needed. More specific, carbon pricing {{plays a major role in}} curbing and peaking carbon emissions, while the policy mix of carbon pricing and <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> subsidies can peak the carbon emission with relatively low cost compared to the single carbon pricing policy. It is also found that the carbon intensity reduction target is most likely to be attained, followed by the carbon-peaking target, and then the <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> target, given the same policy efforts. This indicates that, China may not deliberately increase carbon emissions rapidly over the next decade to make the carbon emission peak as high as possible; otherwise, it may be difficult to achieve the <b>non-fossil</b> <b>energy</b> target...|$|E
40|$|As {{the result}} of climate change and deteriorating global {{environmental}} quality, nations are under pressure to reduce their {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} per unit of GDP.

40|$|China has {{submitted}} its nationally determined {{contribution to}} peak its energy-related emissions around 2030. To understand how China might develop its economy while controlling CO 2 emissions, this study surveys {{a number of}} recent modeling scenarios that project the country’s economic growth, energy mix, and associated emissions until 2050. Our analysis suggests that China’s CO 2 emissions will continue to grow until 2040 or 2050 and will approximately double their 2010 level without additional policy intervention. The alternative scenario, however, suggests that peaking CO 2 emissions around 2030 requires the emission growth rate to be reduced by 2 % below the reference level. This step would result in a plateau in China’s emissions from 2020 to 2030. This paper also proposed a deep de-carbonization pathway for China that is consistent with China’s goal of peaking emissions by around 2030, which can best be achieved through a combination of improvements in energy and carbon intensities. Our analysis also indicated that the potential for energy intensity decline will be limited over time. Thus, the peaking will be largely dependent on the share of <b>non-fossil</b> fuel <b>energy</b> in primary energy consumption...|$|R
