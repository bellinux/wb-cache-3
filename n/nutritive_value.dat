5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low <b>nutritive</b> <b>value,</b> of high toxicity, and high in dietary fibre. The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
5|$|The sauropods {{were the}} largest and {{heaviest}} dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger {{than anything else in}} their habitat, and the largest were an order of magnitude more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric mammals such as Paraceratherium (the largest land mammal ever) were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only modern whales approach or surpass them in size. There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but {{it may be that the}} most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in rock formations interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

There were imported from neighboring provinces, such as Rajaburi and Bangkok. The attitude between government officers and local manufacturers were conflicted by government officers were intended to improve quality of products, therefore, local manufacturers were interested to promote health benefits and product styles. The collected samples were angled gourd (Luffa acutangula Linn.), holly basil (Ocimum sanctum), Seablite (Suaeda maritima), karanda (Carissa carandas Linn.), Tahitian noni leaves and fruits (Morinda citrifolia), Indian camphorweed (Pluchea indica Less.), sea holly (Acanthus ebracteatus Vahl.), blue thunbergia (Thunbergia laurifolia Linn.) and betel pepper (Piper betle Linn.), which were analyzed to determine <b>nutritive</b> <b>values,</b> such as, water content, protein, fat, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, calcium, beta-carotenes and vitamin C. From the results, we were suggest that some of local vegetables, seablite was possess highly <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> for health benefits, which, were ability to processing as functional foods.

25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of butyric acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle.

25|$|Milk {{is not an}} {{important}} source of vitamins B12 or E in the North American diet, so the effects of pasteurization on the adult daily intake of these vitamins is negligible.. However, milk is considered {{an important}} source of vitamin A, and because pasteurization appears to increase vitamin A concentrations in milk, the effect of milk heat treatment on this vitamin is a not a major public health concern. Results of meta-analyses revealed that pasteurization of milk leads to a significant decrease in vitamin C and folate, but milk also is not {{an important source of}} these vitamins. However, we did find a significant decrease in vitamin B2 concentrations after pasteurization. Vitamin B2 is typically found in bovine milk at concentrations of 1.83mg/liter. Because the recommended daily intake for adults is 1.1mg/day, milk consumption greatly contributes to the recommended daily intake of this vitamin. With the exception of B2, pasteurization {{does not appear to be}} a concern in diminishing the <b>nutritive</b> <b>value</b> of milk because milk is often not a primary source of these studied vitamins in the North American diet.|$|E
25|$|Prosopis cineraria is much valued as a fodder tree. The {{trees are}} heavily lopped {{particularly}} during winter months when no {{other green fodder}} {{is available in the}} dry tracts. There is a popular saying that death will not visit a man, even at the time of a famine, if he has a Prosopis cineraria, a goat and a camel, since the three together are some what said to sustain a man even under the most trying condition. The forage yield per tree varies a great deal. On an average, the yield of green forage from a full grown tree is expected to be about 60kg with complete lopping having only the central leading shoot, 30kg when the lower two third crown is lopped and 20kg when the lower one third crown is lopped. The leaves are of high <b>nutritive</b> <b>value.</b> Feeding of the leaves during winter when no other green fodder is generally available in rain-fed areas is thus profitable. The pods have a sweetish pulp and are also used as fodder for livestock.|$|E

The addition of several new herbicides labeled for pastures or hayfields has led many growers to question their options for weed management in these environments. In addition, {{little is known about the}} influence of common pasture weed species on total biomass yield and <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> in a pasture or hayfield setting. Therefore, research was conducted to 1) evaluate the effect of various herbicides on the control of tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis subsp. altissima (L.)), common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), and tall ironweed (Vernonia gigantea (Walt.) Trel), 2) evaluate the effect of herbicides on total biomass yield and <b>nutritive</b> <b>values,</b> and 3) evaluate the effects of increasing densities of common ragweed and common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium L.) on total biomass yield and <b>nutritive</b> <b>values.</b> Results from these experiments indicate that a variety of herbicide treatments will provide good control of several common pasture weed species, but that infestations of these weeds may not necessarily reduce the <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> or yield of the total biomass harvested. For example, biomass yield increased from 1 to 6 kg ha⁻¹ and crude protein decreased by 0. 4 g kg⁻¹ as common ragweed or common cocklebur density increase within a tall fescue stand. In all experiments, <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> of pure weed species samples revealed that most pasture weed species provide greater values than pure tall fescue when forage harvests occur in June. Additional research is necessary to investigate why these species are not consumed by cattle and continue to be a problem in Missouri tall fescue pastures and hayfields...|$|R

40|$|Improvement of {{fermented}} bagasse {{quality as}} animal feed by fermentation through administration of sago flour at different levels) ABSTRACT. Feed {{plays an important}} role in livestock production system. Due to limitation of pasture and forege areas, it needs to find new feed alternative as replacement of forage as animal feed. One of feed alternatives as replacement of forage is bagasse. Bagasse has low nutritive content and digestibility. One of the efforts to improve bagasse quality is by fermentation. The purpose of this experiment was to improve <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> of bagasse by fermentation method by using Trichoderma harzianum as inoculum. This research was conducted at Animal Nutrition Laboratory, Animal Husbandry Department, Agricultural Faculty, Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh from January to April 2015. The experiment was designed by completely randomized design (CRD) with 4 treatments (addition of sago flour at defferent levels); R 1 control (0 % sago flour), R 2 (5 % sago flour), R 3 (10 % sago flour), R 4 (15 % sago flour) of fermented material. Each treatment has 4 replications, therefore there were 16 units of treatment. Parameters observed in this experiment were <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> of fermented bagasse including the contents of dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber and ash. The results of the experiments indicated that fermented bagasse with Trichoderma harzianum by addition of various levels of sago flour had significantly effect (P 0, 05) on dry matter and crude protein contents. In conclusion, addition of various levels of sago flour by using Trichoderma harzianum at fermented bagasse was able to improve <b>nutritive</b> <b>values</b> of fermented bagasse...|$|R
