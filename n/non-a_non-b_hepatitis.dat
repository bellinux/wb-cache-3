40|$|Abstract. We {{reviewed}} {{the medical records}} of 177 patients who at 31 December 1985 had been on dialysis treatment {{for at least one}} year. Fifty cases of <b>non-A,</b> <b>non-B</b> <b>hepatitis</b> were found: 33 in 70 patients dialysed at the centre and 17 in 107 outpatients (/>< 0. 0001). The difference was not related to blood transfusions but to the high prevalence of non-A, non-B in hospital patients who had not been transfused. The time on dialysis before the onset of <b>non-A,</b> <b>non-B</b> <b>hepatitis</b> became gradually shorter, from an average of 82 months before 1980 to 5. 7 months in the patients starting haemodialysis after 1983. At follow-up, 7 % of patients had abnormal hepatic enzymes 5 years from the onset of acute illness. The epidemiology of <b>non-A,</b> <b>non-B</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in haemo-dialysis patients appears to be similar to that of hepatitis B.

This pathology resembles Sjögren syndrome, which also is suggested to have a possible association with chronic hepatitis C. These observations suggest that HCV might be involved in the pathogenesis of sialadenitis in humans and that this transgenic mouse system would be a good animal model for the study of HCV infection...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is {{well known}} for its {{aetiological}} role in chronic <b>non‐A,</b> <b>non‐B</b> viral <b>hepatitis,</b> liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; in addition, the virus has also been implicated in a number of extra‐hepatic “autoimmune” disease manifestations. A causative association between HCV and non‐Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was postulated relatively recently and {{has been the subject of}} intense investigation, as well as some debate. On the strength of epidemiological data, emerging biological investigations and clinical observations, HCV appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of at least a proportion of patients with NHL. Morphologically, HCV‐associated lymphomas represent a variety of histological subtypes including marginal zone lymphoma (splenic, nodal and extranodal), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma. Remarkably, some HCV‐associated NHL appears to be highly responsive to antiviral therapy, providing some clinical evidence for this relationship, as well as the prospect for novel therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiology of {{hepatitis}} C virus in lymphomas Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an RNA virusand {{is a member}} of the Flaviviridaefamily. It is the most common cause of sporadic <b>non-A</b> <b>non-B</b> and post-transfu-sion <b>hepatitis</b> (Kuo et al, 1989) and a major cause of chronic liver diseases, including liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcino-ma. In addition to the direct liver injury, various extrahepatic manifestations inclu-dine autoimmune disorders, glomerular injury, vasculitis, sicca syndrome, and type-II cryoglobulinemia (MCII) may occur in these patients. MCII is a systemic vasculi-tis often characterized as “benign ” B-cell proliferation that evolves into B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in 8 - 10 % o...|$|R
