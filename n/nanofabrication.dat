25|$|The {{manufacture}} of microarrays relies on micro and <b>nanofabrication</b> techniques. Microarrays for transcriptomics typically fall {{into one of}} two broad categories: low-density spotted arrays or high-density short probe arrays. Transcript presence may be recorded with single- or dual-channel detection of fluorescent tags.|$|E
25|$|Advances in <b>nanofabrication</b> {{techniques}} {{and concerns about}} energy shortage make people interested in this idea. The main challenge is to increase efficiency, which is now only a few percent, compared with efficiencies of up to about 95 per cent for standard rotational electromagnetic generators.|$|E
25|$|Monash {{is home to}} over 120 {{research}} centres and institutes.

25|$|Optical fibers {{can be used}} as {{sensors to}} measure strain, temperature, {{pressure}} and other quantities by modifying a fiber so that the property to measure modulates the intensity, phase, polarization, wavelength, or transit time of light in the fiber. Sensors that vary the intensity of light are the simplest, since only a simple source and detector are required. A particularly useful feature of such fiber optic sensors is that they can, if required, provide distributed sensing over distances of up to one meter. In contrast, highly localized measurements can be provided by integrating miniaturized sensing elements with the tip of the fiber. These can be implemented by various micro- and <b>nanofabrication</b> technologies, such that they do not exceed the microscopic boundary of the fiber tip, allowing such applications as insertion into blood vessels via hypodermic needle.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may be hundreds of times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for <b>nanofabrication</b> because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E
500|$|Research in {{condensed}} matter physics {{has given}} rise to several device applications, such as the development of the semiconductor transistor, laser technology, and several phenomena studied in the context of nanotechnology.
