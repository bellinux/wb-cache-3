At the nozzle exit plane, the emerging flow strongly influences downstream flow development and so factors which impact upon the emitted flow are worthy of study.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1999 The aerospike, of plug, nozzle {{is being}} {{proposed}} for future {{space launch vehicle}} applications. The design of the nozzle involves complex wake structures that directly affect engine performance. In particular, the closed or open wake condition of the flow determines the dependence of the base pressure on the ambient environment, and therefore affects overall thrust. An experimental, numerical, and analytical investigation characterized the transition of the wake between closed and numerical, and analytical investigation characterized the transition of the wake between closed and open conditions {{in order to determine}} the physical mechanism leading to wake closure. A common feature between different modes of wake closure was the presence of a shock structure that forced changes to the wake critical point. Wake closure is defined as the limiting condition at which external pressure gradients change the properties and location of the critical point. Changes to critical point directly influence the <b>nozzle</b> <b>base</b> pressure due to the critical point's uniqueness property.

50|$|Selecting a <b>nozzle</b> <b>based</b> on {{the pattern}} and other spray {{characteristics}} {{that are required}} generally yields good results. Since spray nozzles are designed to perform under many different spraying conditions, more than one nozzle may meet the requirements for a given application. Surfaces may be sprayed with any pattern shape. Results are fairly predictable, {{depending on the type}} of spray pattern specified. If the surface is stationary, the preferred nozzle is usually some type of full cone nozzle, since its pattern will cover a larger area than the other styles. Spatial applications, in which the objective is not primarily to spray onto a surface, are more likely to require specialized spray characteristics. Success in these applications is often completely dependent on factors such as drop size and spray velocity. Evaporation, cooling rates for gases and solids, and cleaning efficiency are examples of process characteristics that may depend largely on spray qualities.|$|R

40|$|The Multiple Use Plug Hybrid (for) Nanosats is a {{prototype}} thruster {{is being developed}} to fill a niche application for NanoSat-scale spacecraft propulsion. When fully developed, the MUPHyN thruster will provide an effective and low-risk propulsive capability that could enable multiple NanoSats to be independently re-positioned after deployment from a parent launch vehicle. Because the environmentally benign, chemically-stable propellants are mixed only within the combustion chamber after ignition and the flow rate of the fuel is determined by a pyrolysis mechanism that is nearly independent of pressure or fuel grain defects, the system is inherently safe and can be piggy-backed near a secondary payload {{with little or no}} overall mission risk increase to the primary payload. The MUPHyN thruster uses safe-handling and inexpensive nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) as propellants. Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a direct digital manufacturing process, is used to fabricate short-form-factor solid fuel grains with multiple helical combustion ports from ABS thermoplastic. This manufacturing process allows for the rapid development and manufacture of complex fuel grain geometries that are not possible to extrude or cast using conventional methods. This technology enables the construction of fuel grains with length-to-diameter ratios appropriate for incorporation into CubeSats while maintaining high surface areas and regression rates that allow the system to maintain a near optimal oxidizer to fuel ratio. The MUPHyN system provides attitude control torques by using secondary-injection thrust vectoring on a truncated aerospike nozzle. This configuration allows large impulse delta V burns and small impulse attitude control firings to be performed with the same system. To ensure survivability during extend duration burns, the MUPHyN incorporates a novel regenerative cooling design where the N 2 O oxidizer flows through a cooling path embedded in the aerospike nozzle before being injected into the combustion chamber near the <b>nozzle</b> <b>base...</b>|$|E
40|$|THERE is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} flow physics of aerospike nozzles in line with change in launcher stage design from the tandem to parallel configuration, as the main stage engine is now expected to fulfill {{a wide range of}} operating conditions during the launchers ascent. Studies show that aerospike nozzles deliver the best performance at all altitudes 1 which was first reported on, in the 60 s and 70 s 2 - 6. The wall of an aerospike (which serves as the inner wall of the conventional bell nozzle) is always exposed to an ambient pressure (which acts like an invisible outer wall) and thus allows the ambient pressure to govern the expansion process. Several types of aerospike nozzles are in use for aerospace vehicle applications. Among them are annular aerospike nozzles (either full length or truncated spike nozzles) and the two-dimensional linear aerospike nozzles. These nozzles typically run overexpanded during takeoff which is thus the condition of interest for such flows. Ruf and McConnaughey 7 reported that most of the thrust on the spike is generated over the first quarter so that the remaining three quarters can be truncated without much loss in total thrust. Additionally, the thrust lost by removing some portion of the spike can be made up by <b>nozzle</b> <b>base</b> pressure acting on the base area. Such a truncated plug nozzle configuration has added advantages of reduction in engine size and weight which can then be used to increase the payload capacity of the launch vehicle and hence, an overall gain in system performance. Altitude compensating effects still occur for such a plug configuration as the flow structure downstream of the plug is significantly modified and hence, studies on plug nozzle configuration with and without afterbody flows are needed. Recently Verma 8 has carried out investigations on the performance characteristics of both full length and truncated spike nozzles in the absence and presence of freestream flows and documents the decrease in performance from the ideal due to truncation and freestream effects. Since jet noise mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} sensitive to nozzle exit conditions, the acoustics of aerospike nozzles, which have very different exit geometry can be expected to be different. It is thus pertinent to investigate the acoustic behavior of such modifications to the nozzle, in order to estimate parameters like the acoustic loading of the structure during launch...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{the initial}} spray {{characteristics}} of sprinklers is critical for fire suppression performance analysis. Although numerous tests and {{studies have been conducted}} on fire sprinkler sprays, measurements were mostly conducted in the far-field due to spray diagnostics limitations. Although these far-field measurements are useful for evaluating the ultimate sprinkler performance, they are convoluted by the dispersion process and yield little useful information regarding the initial sprinkler discharge characteristics. With the development of advanced non-intrusive spray diagnostics, high fidelity initial spray measurements are possible, providing sprinkler discharge characteristics which are useful alone for nozzle development or together with analytical tools for prediction of suppression performance. In this study, a laser diagnostic technique based on Shadowgraphy was used to characterize the initial spray for actual fire sprinklers and nozzles having more basic configurations. The shadowgraphs revealed important information on the effect of nozzle geometry on sheet formation (from the injected jet) and sheet fragmentation into drops. Three breakup modes were observed depending on the injection conditions quantified through the We and the geometric details of the <b>nozzle.</b> <b>Based</b> on these breakup modes, scaling laws were developed to quantify the effect of nozzle geometry and injection condition on sheet breakup distance and drop size. The sheet breakup location followed a We - 1 / 3 power law for all observed breakup modes.
