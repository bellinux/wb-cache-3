40|$|Introduction: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) can be {{congenital}} or acquired. Congenital AVF {{are less}} common while acquired fistula {{are most frequently}} the result of penetrating trauma or iatrogenic action. Acquired common carotid jugular fistulas are uncommon {{in the head and}} neck region, accounting only 4 to 7 % of all the traumatic AVFs encountered throughout the body that is not usually detected during the acute injury phase. Objective: For the first time in our center we diagnose and treat a carotid jugular vein fistula due to <b>neck</b> <b>stab</b> wound. Case Description: A 48 years old man with <b>neck</b> <b>stab</b> wound and strangulation was treated as an outpatient in a clinic with suturing the wound. he was stable and discharged without apparent neurologic deficit, after two days he was referred to our center due to left hemiparesis. in our assessment, Brain imaging showed right side hemodynamic infarct, in carotid duplex the flow was bidirectional and low RI, in angiography there was fistula from Right ICA to jugular vein, in left ICA angiography there was reversible flow from Right distal ICA to the fistula. After two times of brachychardia and asystolic cycle the patient was intubated and CPR was done. Cardiac arrest maybe because of cardiac problems dueto carotid jugular fistula. Approach: Due to carotid injury and high flow fistula, the Right ICA jugular fistula was obliterated by Balloon and ICA was also sacrificed. in left ICA Angiography the flow to Right ICA was stopped and MCA  and ACA got flow from left side. the patient was stable and after few days he could be extubated and he was discharged with stable condition. Discussion: Carotid jugular fistula is a rare complication of neck trauma, because its symptoms appear late, with neurologic deficit many times neurologist was suspect to dissection and maybe MRA and CTA report Carotid occlusion but Duplex is an efficient device to differentiated between these two disease. in dissection  there is prestenotic pattern and we can see the Flap flow in pseudolumen but in Carotid jugular fistula there is bidirectional and low resistance flow in proximal ICA. Meanwhile jugular vein have pulsatile flow due to direct carotid arterial flow. we presented a case of carotid-jugular fistula following cervical trauma. we are implicating on the role of carotid duplex for evaluation of cervical trauma. Duplex could efficiently differentiate between the two major  complication of trauma that is cervical arteries dissection and carotid-jugular fistula...|$|R

40|$|Suicides {{are divided}} into simple and complex, the complex one {{referring}} to suicide {{by a combination of}} more than one method. In general, unplanned complex suicides occur where several different methods are used consecutively because the first method has not achieved the desired effect. In this study, we present a unique unplanned complex suicide case where corrosive ingestion and stabbing were the suicide methods. A 50 -year-old woman was found unconscious by her husband and daughter in the garden of her house {{in the middle of the}} night. She was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead upon arrival. The investigation revealed that there was a half-filled bottle of scale dissolver containing nitric acid in the kitchen of the house. The deceased was said to have been suffering from depression for two weeks. There were corrosive burns around the lips, on the chin and on the right side of the <b>neck,</b> three <b>stab</b> wounds and six tentative cuts above the umbilical region. This is the first case report of unplanned complex suicide by corrosive ingestion and stabbing in the literature. It is thought that the woman first swallowed nitric acid, and after feeling unbearable pain around her epigastric region, she stabbed herself in the abdomen.

Thenmozhi returns to her father's home to deliver her first child. Ulaganthan wins the election, but as neither of the parties receives a clear majority, the rival party bribes Ulaganathan to join them instead. When Thenmozhi returns after the birth of their child, she is disappointed over the transformation of her husband and refuses to live with him. To spite her, Ulagnathan brings home Alangaram (Pavithra) as his mistress. Alangaram and her mother slowly take control over the household, which leads to Thenmozhi leaving her family. Ulagnathan's atrocities go beyond her tolerance when he plans to organise a communal riot in the village in order to safeguard himself from the critics. When Thenmozhi finds out about this, she goes to have a talk with him. But Ulaganathan defends himself by saying that political murders are not ethically wrong. The following day (Independence Day), a statue of Mahatma Gandhi is to be unveiled by Ulaganathan. During the ceremony, Ulagnathan makes a speech on his and his party's accomplishments.
