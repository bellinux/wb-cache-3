5000|$|Vincent Dole (18 May 1913 in Chicago - 1 August 2006) was an American doctor, who, {{along with}} his wife Dr Marie Nyswander (died 1986), pioneered the {{practice}} of using the synthetic <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonist</b> methadone to treat heroin addiction. Drs. Dole & Nyswander, in establishing Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), revolutionized addiction medicine which for a century had been based on the conventional and widely held view (circa 1965) that narcotic addiction was the result of an intractable moral defect. His work resulted in the partial re-legalization of opioid maintenance in the United States. For this contribution he was a recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for Medicine, sometimes referred to as [...] "America's Nobel Prize".|$|E
40|$|It was {{confirmed}} that morphine administration in vivo produced a selective {{decrease in the}} calcium content of synaptosomal fractions prepared from rat cerebral cortices. This effect was prevented by naloxone. 2 After morphine or naloxone, there were no changes in the sodium, potassium and magnesium contents {{of any of the}} seven subcellular fractions tested. 3 Since the selective calcium loss was found to occur from fractions similar to those reported to exhibit opiate receptor binding, it is concluded that calcium {{may play a role in}} the action of <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonist</b> drugs...|$|E
40|$|Injection of opioids {{into the}} {{epidural}} space produces postoperative analgesia by acting on receptors in lamina 11, IV, and V of the substantia gelatinosa (1). Morphine, {{due to its}} low lipid solubility produces numerous side effects when injected into the epidural space; most notably delayed respiratory depression (2). Fentanyl, a highly lipid soluble <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonist,</b> has a more rapid onset of action and a significantly lower incidence of side effects than those of mor-phine. In a dose-response study in patients after cesarean delivery, 50 pg of epidural fentanyl was found to provide maximal analgesia with minimal incidence of side effects (3). The effect of varying the volume of injectate on the onset, duration, and incidence of side effects produced by 50 pg of fenta-nyl has not been reported. This standard dose of fentanyl diluted in larger volumes could increase the surface area of drug exposure and thus augment the number of opioid receptors affected. Conversely, diluting the opioid in greater volume may reduce the concentration gradient between {{the central nervous system}} and epidural space and thereby decrease both the rapidity of onset and duration of analgesia. Fen-tanyl is being given epidurally in several different dilutions. To determine the most effective diluent volume, a double-blind, randomized study was un-dertaken with varying volumes of normal saIine solution to dilute a single 50 pg dose of epidural fentanyl...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the use of}} a naloxone infusion at a rate of 300 micrograms/h to provide constant antagonism of the respiratory depressant effects of a near fatal nor-methadone dose in a 2 year old boy. The terminal half-life for nor-methadone was calculated to be 13. 5 h. The results indicate that a single dose of a narcotic antagonist with a short half-life (e. g. naloxone) will probably be inadequate to provide long lasting reversal of the effects of overdoses of long half-life <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonists,</b> and that continuous infusion may be the preferable to repeated bolus doses...|$|R

The effects of morphine, butorphanol, cyclazocine, ketocycla-zocine, ethylketocyclazocine, and SKF- 1 0, 047 were tested, alone and {{in conjunction with}} naloxone or naltrexone, in rats responding under a fixed-interval, 5 -mm schedule of food presentation. Except for naloxone and naltrexone, all of the drugs decreased the average rate of responding in a dose-dependent manner. The rate-decreasing effects of morphine were markedly antagonized by naltrexone, while the effects of SKF- 1 0, 047 or high doses of cyclazocine were not antago-nized by naltrexone or naloxone. Naltrexone and naloxone were able to antagonize the effects of butorphanol, ketocycla...|$|R

The effects of acute morphine, methadone, nalorphine, naloxone, pentazocine and cyclazocine were studied in control rats (morphine-free rats) and in rats maintained on 200 mg/kg daily oral injections of morphine (morphine-maintained rats). The effects of morphine, nalorphine and naloxone also were studied in rats that were drinking a 0. 5 mg/ml of morphine solution (morphine-drinking rats) {{in the experimental}} apparatus. All six drugs decreased drinking in the morphine-free rats. Pentazocine and naloxone increased lever-pressing rates in the morphine-free rats, while morphine, methadone, nalorphine and cyclazo-cine only decreased lever-pressing rates.

40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} the narcotic agonist-antagonist, cyclazocine (1. 25 mg/kg), from saline or the pure <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonist,</b> morphine (10 mg/kg), from saline. In the cyclazocine discriminating animals, the interoceptive stimuli produced by cyclazocine {{were found to be}} dose related and largely based on central opiate systems in that these effects were reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The discriminative stimulus produced by cyclazocine was found to be completely generalized to nalorphine, ethylketocyclazocine, pentazocine and morphine while a lesser degree of generalization was seen to the experimental compounds, U- 49, 274 A and U- 50, 788 E. The cyclazocine discriminative stimulus did not generalize to apomorphine, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, d-butaclamol, 1 -butaclamol, clonidine, desipramine, amitriptyline, aceperone and butorphanol. Cyclazocine generalization to morphine was completely antagonized by naloxone at a dose one-twentieth that required to antagonize the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus itself. At no dose tested did naloxone completely antagonize cyclazocine generalization to nalorphine. A possible dopaminergic component of the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by attenuation of stimulus strength with the neuroleptics haloperidol, benperidol and d-butaclamol. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine was also found to be a dose related effect based upon central opiate mechanisms as demonstrated by naloxone reversibility. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine only partially generalized to cyclazocine and ethylketocyclazocine. Naloxone antagonized the generalization of morphine to cyclazocine but at a dose four times that required to antagonize the morphine discriminative stimulus itself. A possible dopaminergic component of the morphine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by haloperidol attenuation of stimulus strength. Cyclazocine analgesia, demonstrated using the mouse tail flick procedure, was found to be maximal approximately five minutes following cyclazocine administration. Some analgesic potency was also ~easurable 35 minutes post cyclazocine. The analgesic effects of cyclazocine were found to be reversed by naloxone. Pretreatment with the neuroleptics oxiperomide, clozapine and dexclamol before cyclazocine was found to enhance the analgesic potency of cyclazocine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Acute i. p. {{administration}} of morphine or cocaine produced increase in locomotor activity in Swiss-Webster female mice that were maximal at 32 - 100 mg/kg for morphine and at 32 mg/kg for cocaine. WIN 35, 197 - 2 produced dose-dependent decreases in locomotor activity from 3. 2 - 32 mg/kg. Chronic ad-ministration of WIN 35, 197 - 2 {{led to a}} 6 - 10 fold shift to the right in the locomotor activity decreasing effect of the drug, but WIN 35, 197 - 2 -tolerant mice retained their sensitivity to the locomotor stimulant effects of morphine and cocaine. Acute {{administration of}} WIN 35, 197 - 2 failed to sensitize mice to naloxone-induced jumping, although morphine did so. Chronic administration of WIN 35, 197 - 2 did lead to sensiti-zation to naloxone, but WIN 35, 197 - 2 was much less efficacious in this regard than morphine. These behav-ioral effects of WIN 35, 197 - 2 may be helpful in the classification of modes of action of different <b>narcotic</b> <b>agonists...</b>|$|R

50|$|Thebacon is an opioid <b>agonist</b> <b>narcotic</b> {{analgesic}} of {{the middle}} range and a strong antitussive, primarily used in Europe, although {{it is no longer}} in common use. Currently, dihydrocodeine and nicocodeine are used as second-line codeine replacements. Thebacon was invented in Germany in 1924, four years after the first synthesis of hydrocodone. The other dihydromorphinone used as an antitussive is hydromorphone (Dilaudid cough syrup); the other narcotic antitussives are either more directly related to codeine or not related at all (open chain methadone relatives and thiambutenes).|$|R
40|$|Results {{of studies}} on the discriminative {{stimulus}} effects of narcotics {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that multiple receptors mediate the effects of these compounds. In the rat, at least three subsets of discriminative effects exist, although some drugs appear to have effects that transcend more than one subset. The discriminative effects of morphine-like <b>narcotics</b> ([mu] <b>agonists),</b> for example, are often clearly distinguishable from the discriminative effects produced by [kappa] agonists, such as ketazocine, and from those produced by phencyclidine-like agonists, such as SKF- 10, 047 and cyclazocine. Cyclazocine, however, has been reported to have discriminative effects in common with morphine (45) and fentanyl (17) and appears to have [kappa]-like, in addition to phencyclidine-like, discriminative effects. The relative ability of pure narcotic antagonists to block the discriminative effects of these compounds also provides evidence for distinct pharmacologic actions of these drugs. In the rat, the discriminative effects of morphine are blocked by doses of naloxone that are considerably smaller than those that are needed to block the discriminative effects of cyclazocine (44). The discriminative effects of phencyclidine are not altered at all by naltrexone (63) ...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{concentrations}} {{and clinical}} {{effects of a}} single i. v. dose of buprenorphine 0. 3 or 0. 6 mg were studied in patients recovering from surgery. Analgesic and hormonal effects were greater with the greater dose without a parallel increase in respiratory depression. A comparison with previous work suggests that increased efficacy results either {{from the use of}} the larger dose or equivalently if the first required postoperative dose of 0. 3 mg has been preceded by a similar loading dose. The pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine (Temgesic, Reckitt and Colman), a synthetic <b>narcotic</b> analgesic with <b>agonist</b> and antagonist properties, have recently been described (Bulling-ham et al., 1980, 1981). Results were presented for different routes of administration but only a single dose was used. A trial was designed to study the kinetics of buprenorphine given at two different i. v. doses. Simultaneous measurements were made of the clinical effects. This paper reports the analgesic, metabolic and respiratory effects in this trial. These are of particular interest because of the mixed agonist-antagonist properties of the drug, which may not produce straightforward dose-effect relationships (Houde and Wallenstein, 1956...|$|R
