The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of butadiene rubber), functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer chains, and embedded in styrene-acrylonitrile matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the weathering resistance and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. <b>n-Butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate.

For this purpose, different compositions of poly (<b>n-butyl</b> methacrylate-co-methyl <b>acrylate)</b> (PBMAMA) and a particular composition of poly(n-butyl methacrylate-co-ethyl acrylate) (PBMAEA) and poly(n-butyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) (PBMABA) were synthesized and characterized. The {{thermal degradation}} of polymers shows that the poly(alkyl acrylates) degrade in a single stage by random chain scission and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) degrades in two stages. The number of stages of thermal degradation of copolymers was same as the majority component of the copolymer. The activation energy corresponding to random chain scission increased and then decreased with an increase of n-butyl methacrylate fraction in copolymer. The effect of methyl acrylate content, alkyl acrylate substituent, and solvents on the ultrasonic degradation of these copolymers was investigated. A continuous distribution kinetics model {{was used to determine}} the degradation rate coefficients. The degradation rate coefficient of PBMAMA varied nonlinearly with n-butyl methacrylate content. The degradation of poly (<b>n-butyl</b> methacrylate-co-alkyl <b>acrylate)</b> followed the order: PBMAMA < PBMAEA < PBMABA. The variation in the degradation rate constant with composition of the copolymer was discussed in relation to the competing effects of the stretching of the polymer in solution and the electron displacement in the main chain.

Therefore, {{it is surprising that}} being also the least expensive organic solvent after methanol, so far it has not become a common solvent for metal catalyzed living radical polymerizations. Here we report the elaboration of acetone-water biphasic mixtures as solvents for ultrafast single electron transfer living radical polymerization (SET-LRP) that provides close to 100 % conversion of methyl and <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylates</b> to the corresponding polymers with near quantitative chain-end functionality in 20 to 35 min reaction time at room temperature. Two methodologies were elaborated for this process. The first involves the generation of Cu(0) nano-colloidal particles as catalysts via the in situ reduction of Cu(II) Br- 2 with NaBH 4 by two different procedures. The second involves the use of non-activated Cu(0) wire as a catalyst. Control experiments for the organic reactions of acetone and monomers with CuBr 2 and other reagents have been used to eliminate the bromination of acetone and monomers, the aldol condensation of acetone, and the hydrolysis of CuBr 2 to Cu(OH) (2). Control experiments have also established that the most probable deactivating species, at least {{in the case of the}} first methodology, may not be CuBr 2, but bromocuprates.

In both cases, Onyx embolization provided effective preoperative tumor devascularization after the initial prolonged particulate embolization with Embospheres made little overall impact.

Preoperative embolization of vascular spinal tumors mini-mizes perioperative hemorrhage and facilitates resection. 1 Particulate agents, including Embosphere (BioSphere Medi-cal, Rockland,Mass) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are favored, because they penetrate the capillary bed beyond potential ar-teriolar anastomoses. 2 A small number report successful use of polymerizing liquid agents, such as <b>n-butyl</b> cyano <b>acrylate</b> (n-BCA; Cordis Neurovascular, Miami Lakes, Fla), in embolizing head and neck neoplasms. 3 Onyx (ev 3, Irvine, Calif) is a novel, nonpolymerizing liquid agent, composed of ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolyme...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{elastomers}} can be actuated under {{electric field}} responding to electrostatic force. Compared with other electrical actuation technologies, {{the advantages of}} dielectric elastomer actuators include: light weight, good compliancy, large actuation strain, high energy density, quiet operation and low cost. As the active part of an actuator device, the dielectric elastomer material plays a central role. However, most popular elastomers used for dielectric actuation are commercial products designed for other applications. And their confidential formulations also {{make it difficult to}} understand the mechanism and further improve the actuation performances. Therefore, the development of new dielectric elastomers from molecular level is of great importance. One subject in this dissertation is the synthesis of a group new dielectric elastomers from molecular level which demonstrate high actuation strains. These dielectric elastomers are polyacrylate formulations with <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylates</b> as the based monomer and formed through ultra-violet polymerization. The influences of acrylic acid in the formulation on the mechanical and dielectric properties are investigated. The optimal formulation demonstrates an area actuation strain of 186 %, a dielectric strength of 222 MV/m and an energy density as high as 1. 4 MJ/m 3. As the dielectric constant of a dielectric elastomer plays a significant role in its actuation performances, one focus of this dissertation is to improve the dielectric constant by utilizing nanocomposites. Aluminum nanoparticles with a self-passivated oxide shell are used as the conductive fillers to increase the dielectric constant of a polyacrylate elastomer while retaining a high dielectric strength. With the addition of 4 vol% Al nanoparticles, the nanocomposite has a dielectric constant as high as 8. 4 with a maximum actuation strain of 56 %, a dielectric strength of 140 MV/m and a maximum actuation pressure of 1. 5 MPa. Another focus of this dissertation is the innovation of a dielectric elastomer with tunable stiffness. This novel elastomer contains furan-maleimide Diels-Alder adduct moieties as the dynamic bonding. The moduli of these elastomers can be tuned reversibly and incrementally through modulating their crosslinking densities via thermal treatments at moderate temperatures.

The chain extension of the macro-star-RAFT agents with either styrene or <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> by bulk free radical polymerization at 60 °C gives narrowly distributed polymer (final polydispersities close to 1. 2) increasing linearly in molecular weight with increasing monomer-to-polymer conversion.

Most frequently, the release kinetics is such that antimicrobially-effective concentrations are only reached within the first days to weeks after implantation, leaving no local antimicrobial release available when a biomaterial-associated infection occurs later. Here we compare the ad libitum release of chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine from a central venous catheter with their release from a new, on-demand release coating consisting of a temperature-sensitive copolymer of styrene and <b>n-butyl</b> (meth) <b>acrylate.</b> The copolymer can be loaded with an antimicrobial, which is released when the temperature is raised above its glass transition temperature. Ad libitum release of chlorhexidine and silver-sulfadiazine from a commercially-purchased catheter and associated antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus was limited to 16 days. Consecutive temperature-triggers of our on-demand coating yielded little or no antimicrobial efficacy of silver-acetate release, but antimicrobially-effective chlorhexidine concentrations were observed over a time period of 60 - 80 days. This attests to the clear advantage of on-demand coatings above ad libitum releasing coatings, that may have released their antimicrobial content before it is actually needed.

As complexing ligand either a commercially available ligand (triphenyl phosphine) (PPh 3) or synthetic aliphatic amines were used. As initiators, methyl 2 -bromopropionate, ethyl 2 -bromoisobutyrate, α,α-dichloroacetophenone, and poly(ethylene oxide) macroinitiator were employed. Block copolymerization of <b>n-butyl</b> methacrylate-b-tert-butyl <b>acrylate</b> (BMA-b-tBA) was performed by two-step ATRP method. The results showed that, for well-defined copolymers, a low conversion macroinitiator (conversion 35 %) is preferable to a high conversion one. Four tetradentate nitrogen ligands, viz. dichloro{[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (1), {[N,N'-dioctyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (2), {[N,N'-dibenzyl-N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) ]- 1, 2 -ethylene diamine} (3), and (1 R, 2 R) -(-) -N,N'-di(quinoline- 2 -methyl) diiminocyclohexane (4), were synthesised at the University of Helsinki, and used as complexing ligands in iron-mediated polymerization of methyl methacrylate. High to moderate conversions (87 %, 43 %) were obtained in relatively short times (90  min for 1 and 30  min for 2), which indicates an efficient catalyst system. When the bulkiness of the substituents was significantly increased, as in ligand 3, polymerization rate was decreased and control was lost. Ligand 4 was less efficient than the other ligands, probably because the ethylene bridge was replaced by cyclohexane bridge. Poly(ethylene oxide) monochloro macroinitiators and poly(ethylene oxide) telechelic macroinitiators (Cl-PEO-Cl) were prepared from monohydroxy functional and dihydroxy functional poly(ethylene oxide) {{in the presence of}} 2 -chloro propionyl chloride and applied to the polymerization of styrene (S) or methyl methacrylate (MMA). The polymerization of styrene was carried out in bulk at 140  °C and catalysed by copper(I) chloride (CuCl) in the presence of 2, 2 ' -bipyridine (bipy) ligand (CuCl/ bipy), but the polymerization of MMA was carried out in the presence of (FeCl 2. 4 H 2 O) / (PPh 3) catalytic system. With most of the macroinitiators, the living nature of the polymerizations led to block copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn  90 % by mass) allowed the preparation of water-soluble/water-dispersible block copolymers.

The radiation vulcanization of latex can be optimized at low vulcanization dose (VD) and at high concentration of n-BA. This relationship can be estimated by the following model...|$|E
40|$|Herein, we {{demonstrate}} {{the synthesis of}} well-defined poly(n-alkyl acrylate) s via copper(0) -mediated radical polymerisation in a self-generating biphasic system. During the polymerisation of <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> in DMSO, the polymer phase separates to yield a polymer-rich layer with very low copper content (ICP-MS analysis: 0. 016 wt%). The poly(n-butyl acrylate) has been characterized by a range of techniques, including GPC, NMR and MALDI-TOF, to confirm both the controlled character of the polymerisation and the end group fidelity. Moreover, we have successfully chain extended poly(n-butyl acrylate) in this biphasic system several times with <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> to high conversion without intermediate purification steps. A range of other alkyl acrylates have been investigated and the control over the polymerisation is lost as the hydrophobicity of the polymer increases due {{to the increase in}} alkyl chain length indicating that {{it is important for the}} monomer to be soluble in the polar solvent...|$|E
40|$|The rubber {{composites}} {{with good}} thermal conductivity contribute to heat dissipation of tires. Graphite filled natural rubber composites {{were developed in}} this study to provide good thermal conductivity. Graphite was coated with polyacrylate polymerized by monomers including methyl methacrylate, <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> and acrylic acid. The ratios between a filler and acrylate polymerization emulsion and those between monomers were varied. Eight types of surface modification formulas were experimentally investigated. Modification formula can affect coating results and composite properties greatly. The best coating type was achieved by a ratio of 1 : 1 between methyl methacrylate and <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate.</b> The coating of graphite was thermally stable in a running tire. Filled with modified graphite, the tire thermal conductivity reached up to 0. 517 - 0. 569 W. m(- 1). K- 1. In addition, the mechanical performance was improved with increased crosslink density, extended scorch time and short vulcanization time...|$|E
40|$|This thesis work {{is part of}} {{a larger}} {{synthesis}} project about alkyd resins from natural sources, copolymerized with methyl acrylate and n-butyl acrylates, which wil be used for coatings purpose. The aim is to control the copolymerization of methyl acrylate and <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> in RAFT miniemulsion. The research was divided into three parts. First the homopolymerization of methyl methacrylate and <b>n-butyl</b> <b>acrylate</b> was studied by varying different parameters such as the amount of surfactant, the amount of initiator, pH, and especially the RAFT agent. Then two macro RAFT agents were synthesized, as suggested by the existing literature. Finally, the two monomers were copolymerized using both the RAFT used for the homopolymerization and those synthesized in the second stage. To verify the obtained control over the polymerization, the synthesized polymers were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography, GPC, thus finding their molecular weight and its polydispersity. ...|$|E
