5|$|After serving 40 years, Red is paroled. He {{struggles to}} adapt to life outside prison and fears that he <b>never</b> <b>will.</b> Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache {{containing}} money, and a letter asking {{him to come to}} Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border into Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.|$|E
5|$|Python {{does not}} support tail call {{optimization}} or first-class continuations, and, according to Guido van Rossum, it <b>never</b> <b>will.</b> However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided in 2.5, by extending Python's generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; information was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5, {{it is possible to}} pass information back into a generator function, and from Python 3.3, the information can be passed through multiple stack levels.|$|E
5|$|Marita {{reports to}} the Syndicate, which {{expected}} colonization at a much later date. Krycek offers Dmitri to the Syndicate in exchange for all their research on a vaccine. Meanwhile, Scully talks to Mulder about his meeting with Cassandra. She realizes that she has {{much in common with}} Cassandra, including being abducted at Skyland Mountain and having an implant inserted in the base of her neck. Scully visits Cassandra, who immediately realizes that she's a fellow abductee. Scully tells her not to remove the implant. Cassandra assures Scully that she <b>never</b> <b>will,</b> as she looks forward to being abducted again.|$|E

5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> {{you find them}} spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often {{seems to have a}} life of its own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E
5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents {{only a portion of}} the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E

25|$|The Dvaita sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, {{founded in}} medieval era, Ishvara {{is defined as}} a creator God that is {{distinct}} from Jiva (individual souls in living beings). In this school, God creates individual souls, but the individual soul never was and <b>never</b> <b>will</b> become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to exactly define the single function or goal of {{the phenomenon of the}} Mafia. Until the early 1980s, mafia was generally considered a unique Sicilian cultural attitude and form of power, excluding any corporate or organisational dimension. Some even used it as a defensive attempt to render the Mafia benign and romantic — not a criminal association, but the sum of Sicilian values that outsiders <b>never</b> <b>will</b> understand.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but <b>never</b> <b>will</b> those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] It never has been and it <b>never</b> <b>will</b> be. Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ said you have to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E

Farmer's third wife died from cancer in 1992; speaking three years later, he remarked that [...] "I guess I <b>never</b> <b>will</b> really recover from that because we had been together for over 20 years when she died". After his own death, he was described as being survived by his companion and manager, Lynne Mueller, and son.|$|E

A subsequent search of the Lokensgard home reveals other bodies, including the bug specialist, cocooned but survived, and Dylan's father, who supposedly ran off years earlier. After leaving with his mother, Dylan sends Natalie one last message in the form of fireflies: [...] "I love you." ...|$|E

500|$|Motley {{thought he}} could come back and play a ninth season in 1954, and showed up to {{training}} camp to prove it. Paul Brown, however, thought otherwise. Dogged by injuries and 34 years old, Motley quit before the season began, after Brown said he would otherwise be cut from the team. [...] "Marion realized that his knee was weak and {{did not feel that}} it was coming around," [...] Brown said at the time. [...] "He was one of the truly fine fullbacks in his prime, the type that comes along once in a lifetime.
