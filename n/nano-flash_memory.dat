40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation of an SOI <b>nano-flash</b> <b>memory</b> device. The device {{is composed of}} a triangular quantum wire channel P-MOSFET with a self-aligned nano-floating gate embedded in the gate oxide. The simulation is carried out by combining TSUPREM- 4 [1] and a two-dimensional (2 -D) self-consistent solution of the Poisson and Schrodinger equations. The fabrication process as well as quantum physics are taken into account. Hole distribution in the inversion layer of the triangular channel section. is calculated in terms of wave functions and energy subbands. The threshold voltage shift between the programming and erasing of the device is investigated. In this paper, we show that the channel shape {{plays a crucial role}} in the programming voltage and the threshold voltage shift. Based on the fact that the holes are confined mainly at the top of the triangular channel section, we explain why our triangular channel device can be operated at relatively low programming voltage despite of a thick gate oxide and tunnel oxide. The threshold voltage shift in the triangular channel device is compared with that in a rectangular channel device. The result shows that the triangular channel device exhibits the larger threshold voltage shift...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main {{achievements}} towards {{the realization of}} memories where the information is stored by an individual electron: the so-called single-electron memories. The different routes followed are presented, ranging from multidot devices to single-dot <b>nano-flash</b> <b>memories</b> and single-electron transistor based memory cells. Finally, we illustrate the issues involved in single-electron memories by presenting a new single-dot memory device with a self-aligned nano-floating gate {{on top of a}} triangular SOI-MOSFET channel that shows persistent memory operation at room temperature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the process optimization {{of a single}} electron <b>nano-flash</b> electron <b>memory.</b> Self aligned single dot memory structures have been fabricated using a wet anisotropic oxidation of a silicon nano-wires. One of the main issue was to clarify the process conditions for the dot formation. Based on the process modeling, the influence of various parameters (oxidation temperature, nano-wire shape) have been investigated. The necessity of a sharp compromise between these different parameters to ensure {{the presence of the}} memory dot has been established. In order to propose an aggressive memory cell, the downscaling of the device has been carefully studied. Scaling rules show that the size of the original device could be reduced by a factor two. This point has been previously confirmed by the realization of single electron memory devices.
