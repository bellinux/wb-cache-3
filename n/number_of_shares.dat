The Singapore flotation looked to be gaining traction in August 2011, when it emerged that the club had applied to list its shares on the Singapore Exchange; approval for the listing was given in September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its dissolution, Andover Football Club was {{run as a}} Private Limited Company.

5|$|In 2004, Bondevik's Second Cabinet and Liberal Minister of Transport Torild Skogsholm {{decided that}} all ferry {{services}} in Norway would become subject {{to public service}} obligation (PSO). Innherredsferja held a concession {{until the end of}} 2006, but would have to bid for the service from 1 January 2007. The company would need expertise in both bidding and increased share capital to succeed in the bidding. By then, Fosen Trafikklag had bought 25% of the company, and the county and the municipality sold their shares to Fosen. Following this, a meeting was held on Ytterøy, where Fosen succeeded in securing a sufficient <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> from the private owners to purchase the entire company. This valued the company at NOK23.1 million. Private owners were given the option to be paid in Fosen shares. From 1 July 2005, Innherredsferja was made a subsidiary of Fosen, but the company remained a separate limited company with its own board.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by Glazer to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated {{with the}} GWR on 1 January 1876. It {{had already made}} a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task {{completed}} through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station here had been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although {{there was also a}} small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{hypergraph}} partitioning algorithm that jointly optimizes the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hyperedge cuts and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> vertices in nonlinear constrained optimization problems. By exploiting the localities of constraints {{with respect to their}} variables, we propose to partition the constraints into subproblems. We use a relaxed global search to solve the subproblems and resolve those violated global constraints across the subproblems by updating the corresponding penalties. As resolving violated global constraints is computationally expensive, we propose to reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> global constraints by increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> variables. This trade-off is advantageous because the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> global constraints in many benchmarks can be significantly reduced by having a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> variables <b>shared</b> across the subproblems. Partitioning in this context can be achieved by partitioning the corresponding hypergraph. We improve hMETIS to jointly optimize the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hyperedge cuts and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> vertices. Our experimental results demonstrate improved solution quality with similar computational overhead on some VLSI cell placement benchmarks. ...|$|R
