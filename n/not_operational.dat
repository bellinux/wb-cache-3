5|$|The Embraer {{started calling}} on the {{emergency}} frequency, 121.5MHz, immediately after the collision, but as it was later determined in the CENIPA report, the emergency transceivers in the area were <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> and thus the crew was unable to reach ATC on that frequency.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were <b>not</b> <b>operational.</b> The Navy did have five s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past Gibraltar to Pola led to a hasty decision to sell them to Germany, a severe setback for Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet.|$|E

5|$|Air strikes {{continued}} {{throughout the}} day, and Southern Command received optimistic reports {{during the afternoon}} from the IAF, which claimed seven bridges knocked out of action, with the remaining ones to be destroyed by evening. In fact, several of the bridges that had been destroyed were decoys. The real bridges meanwhile, had their damaged sections quickly repaired and returned to service. Ten heavy bridges had been laid during the crossing (two bridges in the south were laid but <b>not</b> <b>operational).</b> Now, on October 7, five of these bridges were removed and placed with the two already in reserve, leaving each division with one heavy bridge and one light bridge.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I, U-2 was <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> because she was in drydock awaiting replacement diesel engines. With her new engines and a new conning tower installed by June 1915, U-2 conducted reconnaissance cruises out of Trieste but was declared obsolete in early 1918. U-2 remained in service as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni, but was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war. She was ceded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. U-2 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|Paul Jacobi {{spent most}} of 1943 {{inactive}} in the Arctic before returning to Germany in September for another refit. She was badly damaged by Allied air attacks on Kiel and was <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> again until late 1944. She {{spent most of}} the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how to dispose of the captured German ships.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were <b>not</b> <b>operational.</b> When it became apparent that the war would not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whiteheadâ€™s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{returned}} to Norway in mid-1942, but was badly damaged {{when she ran}} aground in July and did not return until April 1943. Hans Lody participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle and then spent {{the next six months}} on convoy duties in southern Norway. The ship began a lengthy refit in April 1944 and was <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> for the next year. She spent April 1945 escorting convoys in Danish waters before making one voyage to rescue refugees in East Prussia in May. Hans Lody was assigned to the Royal Navy after the war and used as a training ship and then a barracks ship before being broken up for scrap in 1949.|$|E

5|$|With a small {{fleet of}} six U-boats at the {{beginning}} of World War I, two of which were <b>not</b> <b>operational,</b> the Austro-Hungarian Navy acted to bolster its fleet. They reluctantly ordered four U-20 boats in 1915 because construction could start immediately, even though the Havmanden-class design was largely obsolete {{by the beginning of the}} war. Political considerations caused the order to be split between Austrian and Hungarian firms, which contributed to construction problems and delays, keeping any of the boats from being operational until the middle of 1917.|$|E
5|$|With few fixed {{structures}} in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days when the market was <b>not</b> <b>operational.</b> Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the Craft Guilds at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution {{of many of the}} mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|E

5|$|The River Rother {{rises from}} several springs near Empshott in Hampshire. The main one {{supplies}} watercress beds, before passing under Mill Lane, {{to the south}} of the village. It continues eastwards, to reach Greatham Mill. The mill, together with the mill house and an attached barn, date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and are built of brick. Now Grade II listed. All of the original machinery of the mill is still in situ, but is <b>not</b> <b>operational,</b> as the water supply has been diverted. The stream turns to the south-east, and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass, and Greatham Bridge, on the old route. It is joined by other streams, and turns south to reach Liss railway station. The railway and the river follow the same general route, and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet. At the northern edge of the village, the river is joined by the Ashford Stream, and there is another mill. After passing under the A272 road, to the east of the village, it reaches Sheet Mill.|$|E
5|$|U-1 {{was laid}} {{down at the}} navy yard at Pola in July 1907, {{launched}} in February 1909, and underwent trials throughout 1910. She was commissioned in April 1911 {{and served as a}} training boat through 1914. Her periscope was damaged when she was accidentally rammed by an Austro-Hungarian cruiser in January 1914. At the beginning of World War I, U-1 was <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> because she was in drydock awaiting new batteries and replacement diesel engines. When the engine swap had been completed, U-1 served as a training boat for the Austro-Hungarian Navy through October 1915. From November that same year she conducted reconnaissance cruises out of Trieste and Pola until she was declared obsolete in early 1918. U-1 remained in service as a training boat at the submarine base on Brioni, but was at Pola {{at the end of the}} war. She was awarded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and scrapped at Pola. U-1 did not sink any ships during the war.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plant}} was started up for testing on {{schedule}} in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of}} the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was <b>not</b> <b>operational</b> until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E

5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, Â£400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was <b>not</b> <b>operational,</b> and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it is hoped the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E
