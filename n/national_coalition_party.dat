5|$|Most {{notably the}} True Finns saw a {{significant}} rise {{since the last}} election, {{becoming one of the}} top four parties. According to Taloustutkimus, the True Finns polled 6.4% in January 2010 and 17.2% in March 2011, while all the traditional top-three parties, the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> the Centre Party and the Social Democrats, lost popularity.|$|E
5|$|The {{incumbent}} Speaker of Parliament Sauli Niinistö of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> {{did not run}} for parliament, despite {{receiving a}} record number of votes in the 2007 election. It was anticipated that he would be the National Coalition Party's presidential candidate in 2012; which he won. Overall there were 38 MPs not seeking re-election.|$|E
50|$|On 21 June 2016, Jokinen {{was chosen}} as the {{chairman}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> parliamentary group.|$|R
50|$|In 2007-2011 Tiura {{worked in}} the {{parliament}} as the first deputy chairman of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> parliamentary group {{and chairman of the}} Committee on Future. She was {{also a member of the}} finance committee.|$|R
50|$|Kekkonen's two opponents, the centre-right <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> {{candidate}} Director of the National Commercial Bank Matti Virkkunen and {{the populist}} Finnish Rural Party's leader Veikko Vennamo, criticized him for governing Finland in a too autocratic way.|$|R
5|$|The Centre Party, the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> the Social Democratic Party and the Green League held party {{conferences}} in May or June 2010 where they elected the party leadership {{for the election}} and approved their election manifestoes. The Left Alliance held its conference in 2009, when they elected Paavo Arhinmäki chairman after the previous chairman resigned in 2009 due the party's poor result in the European Parliament election.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{election}} there were 17 registered parties (a party has to collect signatures from at least 5,000 eligible voters in order to be accepted on the official party register, which is maintained by the Ministry of Justice). Eight of the parties were represented in the current parliament: the Centre Party, <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> (NCP), Social Democratic Party (SDP), Left Alliance, Green League, Swedish People's Party (SPP), Christian Democrats and True Finns. The MP representing Åland sits with the Swedish People's Party in the parliament.|$|E
5|$|The Kajaani City Council {{consists}} of 51 members {{and following the}} 2012 municipal election the seats are divided for the Centre Party (13), the Finns Party (9), the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> (8), the Left Alliance (8), the Social Democratic Party (7), independent (3), the Green League (2) and the Christian Democrats (1). The chairperson of the City Council is Jaana Sankilampi from the Finns Party. The City Government, which includes all parties {{with the exception of}} the Christian Democrats and independents, is headed by Marjatta Immonen. The Mayor, whose duty is that of a civil servant independent of the city council, is Jari Tolonen.|$|E
50|$|Lahti {{finished}} last out of {{the eight}} candidates {{in the first round}} of the election on January 15, getting a vote share of 0.4% (12,989 votes). Following the first round, he endorsed the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> candidate Sauli Niinistö in the runoff election between Niinistö and incumbent Tarja Halonen on January 29.|$|R
5000|$|Repo {{resigned}} in 1969, {{but according to}} Yle, the [...] "political mandate" [...] remained, as Erkki Raatikainen was named director directly from the Social Democratic Party office. Subsequently, all directors after him until 2010 were Social Democrats. This was ended by appointment of the right-wing <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> Lauri Kivinen as director in 2010.|$|R
25|$|After nine {{political}} parties supported Kekkonen's candidacy in the 1978 Presidential election, including the Social Democratic, Centre and <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>parties,</b> no serious rivals remained. He humiliated his opponents by not appearing in televised presidential debates {{and went on}} to win 259 out of the 300 electoral college votes, with his nearest rival, Raino Westerholm of the Christian Union, receiving only 25.|$|R
5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government. Small differences in the opinion polls for the traditional three big parties (the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{resulted in}} a breakthrough for the populist True Finns, which came head-to-head with the three big parties, while every other parliamentary party in mainland Finland, excluding Åland, lost popularity. The <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> (NCP) also ended up as the biggest party {{for the first time}} in its history. The total turnout rose to 70.5% from 67.9% in the previous election; and corruption scandals also {{resulted in a}}n anti-incumbency vote. The incumbent, Centre Party-led coalition, which included the NCP, Green League and Swedish People's Party (SPP), lost its majority by two seats and their Prime Minister Mari Kiviniemi of the Centre Party signaled that her party would then sit in opposition.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory Swedish is {{supported}} by most political parties in Finland, like the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> the Centre Party, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance. The Finns Party opposes mandatory Swedish, {{and so does the}} youth wing of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
5000|$|While Fianna Fáil {{actually}} increased its {{percentage of the}} vote, it lost seats. The increase in the percentage was remarkable considering the party had been in power for so long, and {{also because of the}} [...] "Arms Crisis". A clever use of transfers between the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>parties</b> in the single transferable vote system enabled a change of government to take place.|$|R
50|$|As the Centre Party candidate, Vanhanen {{challenged}} President Tarja Halonen in the 2006 Finnish presidential election. He received 18.6% of the vote, coming {{third to}} the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> Sauli Niinistö (24.1%) and Social Democrat and incumbent Tarja Halonen (46.3%), and thus did {{not qualify for}} the runoff. Vanhanen expressed his support for Niinistö in the runoff election against his coalition partner's candidate Halonen.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the agricultural organizations, Jännes had plenty of other trusts. He was a longtime chairman of the Board of Governors of the Finnish Broadcasting Company, chairman of the Board of the Laboratory for Agricultural Chemistry in 1939-1954 {{and was a member}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> Party Confederation in 1929-1942. He was also one of the founders of Airam, who produced electricity lamps and chairman of the board of directors from 1921 to 1931 and again since 1948.|$|R
25|$|The City Council of Helsinki {{consists}} of eighty-five members. Following {{the most recent}} municipal elections, in 2012, the three largest parties are the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> (23), the Greens (19), and the Social Democrats (15). The Mayor, Jussi Pajunen, {{is a member of}} the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{city council}} of Turku has 67 seats. Following the 2017 {{municipal}} election, the council seats are allocated {{in the following}} way: <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> 17 seats, Green League 14, Social Democrats 12, Left Alliance 12, True Finns 5, Centre Party 3, Swedish People's Party 3 and Christian Democrats 1. The current chair of the city board is Minna Arve from <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
25|$|Halonen was an {{extremely}} popular president, with her approval ratings reaching a peak of 88% in December 2003. She was re-elected in 2006, defeating <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> candidate Sauli Niinistö {{in the second round}} by 51% to 48%. Ineligible to run in the 2012 presidential elections because of term limits, Halonen left office on 1 March 2012 and was succeeded by Niinistö.|$|E
5000|$|In {{areas where}} the {{governing}} parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna Fáil won a landslide victory in the Irish general election, 1977, {{two out of three}} seats in many cases, relegating the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>parties</b> to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term [...] "Tullymandering" [...] was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.|$|R

25|$|On 18 January 1973, the {{enacting}} of {{an emergency}} law saw Kekkonen's presidency extended by four years. By this time, Kekkonen had secured the backing of most political parties, but the major right-wing <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> which Kekkonen had opposed, was still sceptical, {{and stood in the}} way of the required 5/6 majority. Concurrently, Finland was negotiating a free-trade agreement with the EEC, and as the EEC agreement promoted economic integration with the West, it was supported by <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party.</b> Kekkonen had implied that if he did not remain president, the Soviets would not accept Finland's free trade agreement with the EEC. The tactic secured National Coalition support and the subsequent passing {{of an emergency}} law. The elimination of any significant opposition and competition meant he became Finland's de facto political autocrat. His power reached its zenith in 1975 when he dissolved parliament and hosted the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki with the assistance of a caretaker government.|$|E
25|$|After Frederick Charles of Hesse renounced the throne, Mannerheim secured {{recognition}} of Finnish independence from Britain and the United States. In July 1919, {{after he had}} confirmed a new republican constitution, Mannerheim stood as a candidate in the first presidential election, supported by the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> and the Swedish People's Party. He lost the election to Kaarlo Juho Ståhlberg and left public life.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the {{conservative}} <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party</b> (Kokoomus) {{has been the}} biggest party on Helsinki City Council, with the Social Democrats being the second biggest. In 2000 the Greens, for which Helsinki is the strongest area of support nationally, gained the position of second most popular party in the city, in 2004 the Social Democrats regained that position, and since 2008 the Greens have again been the second biggest party.|$|E
5000|$|Stubb {{is seen as}} a {{representative}} of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party's</b> liberal wing. He has characterized himself as a [...] "liberal" [...] and [...] "moderate liberal". Stubb wants to bring about a [...] "more positive way of doing politics". He believes everyone should be appreciated and respected even when there are disagreements. He supports same-sex marriage and has been the patron of Helsinki's Pride parade. He supports multiculturalism and believes that increasing immigration is necessary. Stubb believes that the most important political divide in modern politics is that between the supporters (like himself) and opponents of globalisation.|$|R

25|$|Hilja Elisabet Riipinen (30 October 1883 – 18 January 1966, née Miklin, later Metsäpolku) was a Finnish {{politician}} {{involved with}} the nationalist and anti-communist Lapua Movement and Patriotic People's Movement (IKL). She {{was a member of}} parliament between 1930 and 1939, first elected from the electoral list of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party,</b> but she defected to the Patriotic People's Movement after it was formed as a political party in 1933.|$|E
25|$|Halonen's {{received}} 46% of {{the first}} round vote in the election. Sauli Niinistö (of the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party)</b> was second with 24%. They faced each other in a runoff on 29 January 2006, where Halonen was re-elected with 51.8% of the vote against Mr. Niinistö's 48.2%. The re-election was a close call. She led in the advance voting, but she eventually received fewer votes on the actual voting day than Mr. Niinistö did.|$|E
25|$|Since leaving office, Ahtisaari {{has held}} {{positions}} in various international organisations. Ahtisaari also founded the independent Crisis Management Initiative (CMI) {{with the goal}} of developing and sustaining peace in troubled areas. On 1 December 2000, Ahtisaari was awarded the J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding by the Fulbright Association in recognition of his work as peacemaker in some of the world's most troubled areas. In May 2017 Ahtisaari suggested as new CMI leader Alexander Stubb a Finnish politician representing Finnish concervatives i.e. the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Kekkonen was reelected for a {{third term}} in 1968. That year, he was {{supported}} by five political parties: the Centre Party, the Social Democrats, the Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders (a short-lived SDP faction), the Finnish People's Democratic League (a communist front), and the Swedish People's Party. He received 201 votes in the electoral college, whereas the <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>party's</b> candidate finished second with 66 votes. Vennamo came third with 33 votes. Although Kekkonen was reelected with two-thirds of the vote, he was so displeased with his opponents and their behaviour that he publicly refused to stand for the presidency again. [...] Vennamo's bold and constant criticisms of his presidency and policies especially infuriated Kekkonen, who labelled him a [...] "cheat" [...] and [...] "demagogue".|$|R
