5000|$|The [...] {{hooded vulture}} (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus)</b> is an Old World vulture {{in the order}} Accipitriformes, which also {{includes}} eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Necrosyrtes and is native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a scruffy-looking, small vulture with dark brown plumage, a long thin bill, bare crown, face and fore-neck, and a downy nape and hind-neck. It typically scavenges on carcasses. Although this is a common species, numbers of these birds are decreasing rapidly. Threats include poisoning, hunting and loss of habitat, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as [...] "critically endangered".|$|E
50|$|A {{migratory route}} for birds, linking Western Europe with North Africa, passes across the Strait of Gibraltar and through Morocco. 490 species of bird have been {{recorded}} in the country, {{many of them in}} passage or winter visitors. A single endemic bird species, the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita) occurs here, and there are about 12 globally endangered species; the white-headed duck (Oxyura leucocephala), the Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus), the northern bald ibis, the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), the hooded vulture (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus),</b> the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), the Rüppell's vulture (Gyps rueppelli), the sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius), the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), the great knot (Calidris tenuirostris) and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Other birds with restricted ranges in north Africa include the Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii), the Moussier's redstart (Phoenicurus moussieri) and the Tristram's warbler (Sylvia deserticola).|$|E
50|$|There {{are reports}} of Verreaux's eagle-owls attacking even larger {{raptorial}} birds. A case of the Verreaux's eagle-owl killing an adult Pel's fishing owl in Botswana was verified. At roughly 2000 g in body mass, the fishing owl is of nearly {{the same size as}} the eagle-owl. Cases where they’ve attacked the nests of particularly large diurnal birds of prey have sometimes involved only nestlings being victimized, such as attacks on the hooded vulture (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus)</b> and the bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), none of the adults, which are about the same average adult body mass as the Verreaux's eagle-owls, have been reported as prey. However, in some even larger birds of prey, adults as well as nestlings and fledglings have been killed. Successful nighttime attacks have been reported on adults of the 2810 g African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) and the 4017 g secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius). In the Matobo Hills of Zimbabwe, the Verreaux's eagle-owl has been considered as one of the inferred predators of 4195 g Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), although whether adults or only nestlings are vulnerable is not definitely clear.|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{infrequently}} hunts other birds of prey, perhaps doing so {{only slightly more}} often than do crowned eagles and Verreaux's eagles. In comparison, the temperate-zone-dwelling golden eagle is a fairly prolific predator of other birds of prey. This {{may be due to}} more scarce prey resources in colder regions forcing eagles to pursue difficult prey such as this more frequently, whereas booted eagles in rich Africa biospheres may not need to do so as much. Nonetheless, a somewhat diverse range of raptorial birds have been identified as prey for martial eagles: the 0.61 kg lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus), the 0.65 kg spotted eagle owl (Bubo africanus) (with a surprisingly large number of 6 found at one nest in Tsavo East), the 0.67 kg pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 2.04 kg hooded vulture (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus)</b> (in one case after a protracted aerial battle), the 4.17 kg white-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) and even Africa’s largest bird of prey, the 9.28 kg Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres). As apex predators, martial eagles are themselves largely invulnerable to predation. A video exists that purportedly depicts a leopard killing a martial eagle but this eagle was misidentified as it actually features a leopard preying on an immature African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vociferus) (and, at that, one that was possibly grounded for unknown reasons). There are, however, verified (if rare) cases of caracals preying on sleeping martial eagles at night, by climbing trees and pouncing in an ambush. It is possible that leopards may too ambush sleeping eagles but post-fledgling martial eagles are known to be highly wary and healthy individuals a great majority of the time will successfully evade potential dangers by day. Predation on nests of martial eagles, beyond those by humans, are little-known, with no verified depredations known in the literature, but are likely to occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} is {{to some degree}} {{adaptable}} to varied habitats but shows an overall preference for open woods and woodland edges, wooded savannah and thornbush habitats. The martial eagle has been recorded at elevations of up to 3000 m but is not a true mountain dwelling species and resident eagles do not usually exceed an elevation of 1500 m. These eagles also avoid closed-canopy forests and hyper-arid desert. As such it is mostly absent from Guinean and Congolian forests, despite the species’ requirement for large trees for nesting purposes. It is shown that martial eagles can inhabit forests locally in areas where openings occur. For example, in a bird atlas for the country of Kenya, perhaps surprisingly, 88% of martial eagles were found to reside in well-wooded areas and they occurred in areas where annual rainfall exceeded 250 mm. In southern Africa, they have adapted to seemingly more open habitats than elsewhere in their range, such as semi-desert and open savanna with scattered trees, wooded hillocks and, as a recent adaptation, around pylons. In the desert areas of Namibia, they utilize ephemeral rivers that flow occasionally and allow large trees to grow. They usually seem to prefer desolate or protected areas. In the Karoo of South Africa, they consistently avoid areas with moderate to heavy cultivation or with heavier or more consistent winter rainfall. One study on the occurrence of diurnal raptors in protected areas versus outside unprotected areas, found that martial eagle detection was nearly twice as frequent in protected areas {{during the dry season}} and more than three times as frequent during the wet season. Some assorted diurnal raptors were even relatively rarer outside of protected areas such as hooded vultures (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus).</b>|$|E
40|$|Diurnal raptors have {{declined}} significantly in western Africa since the 1960 s. To evaluate {{the impact of}} traditional medicine and bushmeat trade on raptors, we examined carcasses offered at markets at 67 sites (1 – 80 stands per site) in 12 countries in western Africa during 1990 – 2013.

40|$|Mundy (1982, The {{comparative}} {{biology of}} southern African Vultures, Vulture Study Group, Johannesburg.) states that records exist for only 22 nests of the Hooded Vulture <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> in Rhodesia, {{of which he}} visited 15, while in only three nests were the eggs measured. He makes no specific mention of egg measurements from nests south of the Limpopo River, although the average of 10 "Southern African" eggs is given as 74, 72 (Range 68, 7 - 78, 1) by 55, 89 (Range 54, 0 - 57, 8) mm. Nevertheless, five South African breeding records exist, all from the Kruger...|$|E
40|$|Dry-season {{counts of}} diurnal raptors were {{performed}} in the wet season in the agricultural region in northern Cameroon along several road transects (total = 900 km), while assessing general land cover characteristics and land cover characteristics of the raptor habitats. 9 common diurnal residential raptor species (Milvus migrans, Elanus caeruleus, Melierax metabates, Falco alopex, Butastur rufipennis, <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus,</b> Buteo auguralis, Gyps rueppellii, Aquila wahlbergi) have been analyzed for their land cover preference at microhabitat scale regarding several land cover characteristics: agriculture, woodland, village, herbaceous layer, trees and shrubs/bushes. Overall all raptors, except <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> and Milvus migrans, showed, on a microhabitat scale level, a significant preference for {{a high percentage of}} natural woodland. Conservation of the woodland areas within the agricultural region is thus important for preservation of many raptors: only the scavenging raptors living of dead animals and refuse dumps significantly prefer villages above woodland and agricultural fields. Human presence may not be a problem for several raptors, but their activities might. For cover with agriculture and trees, there is a wide variety in preference, varying from a low level (resp. 0 - 20 % and 0 - 30 trees/hectare) to a high level (80 - 100 % and > 120 trees/hectare). On a microhabitat level, many of the investigated raptors seem to prefer a small cover of herbaceous layer above a larger cover, indicating that on a small scale, grazing can be possibly be positive for raptors, when bare soil is surrounded by areas with more grass. Regarding bush/shrub density, there was little variation in the area (88 % having a cover of 0 - 20 %), where only <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> and Buteo auguralis showed a significant preference for respectively a low to high cover. Maintaining a diverse landscape with a wide diversity in land cover characteristics is thus expected to be crucial for conservation of raptors. Through field experiments, I investigated the effect of very local land cover characteristics on the presence of prey animals for raptors, during the dry season. Literature shows that a wide variety of food types are eaten by different raptors. Analysis in 4 different land use types revealed that in each land use type, grasshoppers had a statistically significant positive correlation with the grass cover. In natural woodland, average grasshopper numbers found were significantly higher than in villages and cotton plantations. Differences are expected to be larger in the growth season (wet season) : in the dry season {{no significant differences were found}} between the intensive (cotton) plantations and the extensive (sorghum plantations), regarding grasshopper densities. For other types of prey animals, no significant relations have been found regarding land cover characteristics. Only in general, significantly more lizards were present in villages compared to the other three land use types...|$|E
40|$|Scavenging {{birds are}} very {{conspicuous}} in Kampala {{and a number}} of counts have been made of their numbers since the 1970 s. Between the 1970 s and mid- 2000 s the breeding population of Marabou Storks Leptoptilos crumeniferus increased from about 100 pairs to nearly a thousand, whilst roost counts of Black Kites Milvus migrans also showed large increases. Numbers of Pied Crows Corvus albus and Hooded Vultures <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus,</b> also counted as they came into communal roosts, showed lower rates of increase; from mid to late 2000 s however, Hooded Vultures seem to be decreasing. These increases perhaps reflect the four-fold increase in the human population over the same period, considerably adding to the refuse upon which these birds mainly feed. In view of alarming declines of scavengers elsewhere, especially vultures, we plan to continue monitoring these Kampala birds...|$|E
40|$|Despite major {{declines in}} the {{population}} of vultures around the world, noticeable increases were reported in the populations of Hooded Vultures <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> {{over the past decade}} in Accra—an important vulture habitat in Ghana. In recent times, however, there is a growing concern that the vulture numbers are decreasing even though scientific data to support this is nonexisting. As a vital zoogeographical and conservation tool, {{it is important to keep}} an up-to-date knowledge about urban bird populations amidst rapid urbanization and associated changes. Using a combination of field data, literature review, and stakeholder consultations, it was indicative that severe decline might have indeed occurred in the populations of Hooded Vultures in Accra. Evidence suggests the killing of vultures for consumption, traditional medicine, and black magic in an undercover trade with possible transboundary connections as important underlying factor. Additional factors suspected to underlie the declines include changes in management of urban facilities and destruction of roosting and nesting trees. The implications of interspecific competition with Pied Crows Corvus albus on Hooded Vultures however remain unclear. There is an urgent need for conservation campaign and education to save the Hooded Vulture in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|West African flood-plains have {{undergone}} major land-use transformations {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century. To obtain insight in the effect of flood-plain development for irrigated rice cultivation on the abundance, richness, and diversity of Palearctic and Afrotropical raptors, we conducted monthly transect surveys covering dry and wet seasons in four major habitats on the Waza-Logone flood-plain of Cameroon: dry grasslands, cultivated grasslands, rice fields, and seasonally flooded grasslands resembling natural flood-plain vegetation. We recorded 36 raptor species among 2, 533 individuals, dominated by Black Kite Milvus migrans, which comprised 42 % of counts. Although richness and diversity were not related to land-use for Palearctic raptors, Afrotropical raptor diversity was higher on the flooded grasslands compared to the newly created cultivated habitats and dry grasslands. The abundance of Afrotropical raptors did not significantly differ across habitats but was lower in rice-fields when Black Kite and Hooded Vulture <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> were excluded. Conversely, Palearctic raptor abundance was highest in post-harvest rice fields, demonstrating the importance of the rice fields as foraging habitat for Palearctic raptors. Further transformation of West Africa’s flood-plains is expected, reducing their capacity for Afrotropical raptors, while Palearctic raptors may benefit from expansion of rice-fields, but more research is needed on their vulnerability to pesticide use...|$|E
40|$|So far {{overlooked}} as a pigment {{involved in}} visual communication, the haemoglobin {{contained in the}} blood of all birds is responsible for the red flushing colours in bare skin areas of some species. Our aim has been twofold: (1) to study sub-epidermical adaptations for blood circulation in two flushing species: the crested caracara (Polyborus plancus) and the hooded vulture (<b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus),</b> and (2) to provide the first compilation of avian species with flushing skin. The bare facial skin of both the caracara and the hooded vulture contains a highly vascularised tissue under the epidermis that may be filled with blood and would thus produce red skin colours. In contrast, feathered areas of the head show very few vessels immersed in connective tissue and have no potential for colour changes. Species with flushing colours are few but phylogenetically diverse, as they belong to 12 different avian orders and at least 20 families. The majority are dark-coloured, large-sized species living in hot environments that may have originally evolved highly vascularised skin patches for thermoregulation. Bird behaviour as well as sex and age differences within species suggest that a signalling system for condition or status based on haemoglobin may have been super-imposed to the physiological process of heat dissipation. “Blushing is the most peculiar and the most human of all expressions. Monkeys redden from passion, but it would require an overwhelmin...|$|E
40|$|Basic {{ecological}} information is still lacking for {{many species of}} African vultures. The Hooded Vulture <b>Necrosyrtes</b> <b>monachus</b> {{is known as a}} rare breeding resident in north-eastern South Africa. This study set out to monitor the nests of Hooded Vultures and, secondarily, White-backed Vultures Gyps africanus in the Olifants River Private Nature Reserve over two breeding seasons in 2013 and 2014. A total of 12 Hooded Vulture nests, placed mostly in the tree Diospyros mespiliformis, were found along the Olifants River, with an average internest distance of 0. 76 km. Nest success was estimated to be between 0. 44 – 0. 89 offspring pair− 1 y− 1 in 2013 and 0. 50 – 0. 67 offspring pair− 1 y− 1 in 2014, which are the first estimates for Hooded Vultures in South Africa. It is thought that nests of this species have been under-reported {{due to the fact that}} they are placed within or below the canopy of densely leafed trees and hence difficult to view from aerial surveys. African White-backed Vultures also bred along the Olifants River, with nests placed in clusters of up to six. Nesting density of this species ranged from about 1. 0 to 1. 2 nests km− 1 and nests were predominantly placed in Ficus sycomorus trees.
