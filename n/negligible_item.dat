In Germany, human good will and every fine mind are subordinated to political forms that have for a mouthpiece a Chancellor with his brains manifestly addled by the theories of Welt-Politik and the Bismarckian tradition, and for a figurehead a mad Kaiser. Nevertheless there comes even from Germany muffled cries for a new age. A grinning figure like a bloodstained Punch is all that speaks for the best brains in Bulgaria. Yes. We Western allies know all that by heart; but, after all, the immediate question for {{each one of us}} is, [...] "What speaks for me?" [...] So far as official political forms go I myself am as ineffective as any right-thinking German or Bulgarian could possibly be. I am more ineffective than a Galician Pole or a Bohemian who votes for his nationalist representative. Politically I am a <b>negligible</b> <b>item</b> in the constituency of this Mr. Burdett Coutts into whose brain we have been peeping. Politically I am less than a waistcoat button on that quaint figure. And that is all I am--except that I revolt. I have written of it so far as if it were just a joke. But indeed bad and foolish political institutions cannot be a joke. Sooner or later they prove themselves to be tragedy. This war is that. It is yesterday's lazy, tolerant, [...] "sense of humour" [...] wading out now into the lakes of blood it refused to foresee.|$|E
40|$|Region {{policy of}} the European Union {{seems to be one}} of the most {{important}} policy at the supranational level. While it represented only a <b>negligible</b> <b>item</b> on the european budget in the 80 s, today it occupies, from the expenditure volume point of view, a second place already. During this dynamic period of time Cohesion policy has become an object of number of political but also special discussions, gained many favorers and opponents. With regard to the considerable amounts of money it has granted, it is worth of detailed attention. Italy has become the seond largest beneficiary from the Structural funds between 1989 an 2006. Its economy is characterised by a substantial geografic dualism where its Southern "periphery" has been struggling with continuous socio-economic difficulties. These regions have had a change to benefit from the generous Structural funds for a considerable period of time. This study tries to analyse the effectiveness of these financial resources, in other words, it considers empirical analysis of the marginal growth effects of these resources on the Southern Italian regions...|$|E

The text on page 5 reading, “Floor effects were <b>negligible</b> for all <b>items</b> (2 %– 14 %) while substantial ceiling effects were observed except Item 4 (30 %– 40 %) ” should instead have read, “Floor effects were negligible (2 %– 14 %) while substantial ceiling effects were observed for all items (30 %– 40 %) except Item 4 ”. In Table 5 (Table 1 here), there is a mistake in the ordering of items. The corrected table can be seen below...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:: With aging, the {{probability}} of experiencing multiple chronic conditions has increased, along with symptoms associated with these conditions. Symptoms form a central component of illness burden, and distress. To date, most symptom measures have focused on a particular disease population. OBJECTIVE:: We aimed to develop and evaluate a simple symptom screen using da ta obtained from {{a representative sample of}} community-dwelling older adults. METHODS:: Psychometric analyses were conducted on 10 self-reported dichotomous symptom indicators collected during in-person interviews from a sample of 1000 community-dwelling older adults. Symptoms included shortness of breath, feeling tired or fatigued, problems with balance or dizziness, perceived weakness in legs, constipation, daily pain, stiffness, poor appetite, anxiety, and anhedonia. RESULTS:: Over one third of the individuals (37. 4 %) had 5 or more concurrent symptoms. Stiffness and feeling tired were the most common symptoms. Confirmatory factor analyses were performed on the 10 symptoms for single factor and bifactor (physical and affective) models of symptom reporting. Goodness-of-fit indices indicated better fit for the bifactor model (χdf= 10 = 89. 6; P < 0. 001), but the practical significance of the improvement in fit was <b>negligible.</b> Differential <b>item</b> functioning analyses showed some differences of relatively high magnitude in location parameters by race; however, because the differential item functioning was in different directions, the impact on the overall measure was most likely lessened. CONCLUSIONS:: Among community-dwelling older adults, a large proportion experienced multiple co-occurring symptoms. This Brief Symptom Screen can be used to quickly measure the overall symptom load in older adult populations, including those with multiple chronic conditions.

40|$|Limnological and hydrobiological {{parameters}} {{were compared}} with food composition for three fish species (bream, roach, perch) in a meso-eutrophic reservoir (Czech Republic). Fish were sampled using a 100 m beach seine, a fry seine and gillnets at both the lower and upper ends of the reservoir in 2011 and 2012. Food composition was evaluated using gravimetric methods. 0 + bream (36 - 48 mm standard length) diet consisted of zooplankton only; while in 3 - 4 + bream (146 - 186 mm), detritus and aquatic vegetation dominated. In summer, diet of 6 - 9 + (210 - 315 mm) bream from beach seines consisted mainly of aquatic vegetation and mainly of detritus when caught in gillnets. Benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton were minor dietary components throughout the season. For all roach age groups studied, zooplankton were a <b>negligible</b> food <b>item.</b> Detritus was dominant in 0 + (36 - 52 mm) and 1 + (72 - 110 mm) fish. Detritus, periphyton and macrophyte fragments were dominant in 3 - 4 + (73 - 163 mm) and 6 - 8 + (150 - 266 mm) fish, with benthic macroinvertebrates taken rarely. Zooplankton was dominant in 0 + (16 - 86 mm) and 1 + (52 - 81 mm) perch diet. In summer and autumn, cyprinid and perch fry dominated in adult 5 - 7 + (112 - 300 mm) fish, while detritus dominated in spring. Benthic macroinvertebrates were recedent. The food intake of bream and roach could be explained the shallowness of the reservoir banks, the rich littoral zone being used for spawning, hiding and for food periphyton. Adult perch {{play an important role}} in fish stock management, consuming fish fry that otherwise consumes zooplankton, which subsequently affects phytoplankton levels and water quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract ⎯ A multi-item {{two stage}} {{production}} inventory system with imperfect production process is formulated. Here, a constraint {{on the total}} budget is imposed where the total budget is imprecise in nature. Shortages are allowed and completely backlogged. Stage I (raw materials to semi-finished products) is an automatic process and this process is treated by machines. Stage II (semi-finished products to finished products) is also an automatic process and this process is treated by another machines. It is assumed that the time of transporting items from Stage I to Stage II is <b>negligible.</b> The imperfect <b>items</b> are reworked and assumed that the inspection time and rework time are very short which also can be neglected. The model has been formulated as profit maximization problem in stochastic and fuzzy-stochastic environments by considering inventory costs as imprecise in nature. Credibility theory {{has been used to}} transform the fuzzy-stochastic model into an equivalent deterministic one. To solve the problems, Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm has been suitably developed and applied. Finally, to illustrate the model and to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach a numerical example is presented...|$|R
40|$|Reducing the {{response}} burden of standardized pain measures is desirable, particularly {{for individuals who}} are frail or live with chronic illness, e. g., those suffering from cancer and those in palliative care. The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System® (PROMIS®) project addressed this issue with the provision of computerized adaptive tests (CAT) and short form measures {{that can be used}} clinically and in research. Although there has been substantial evaluation of PROMIS item banks, {{little is known about the}} performance of PROMIS short forms, particularly in ethnically diverse groups. Reviewed in this article are findings related to the differential item functioning (DIF) and reliability of the PROMIS pain interference short forms across diverse socio-demographic groups. Methods: DIF hypotheses were generated for the PROMIS short form pain interference items. Initial analyses tested item response theory (IRT) model assumptions of unidimensionality and local independence. Dimensionality was evaluated using factor analytic methods; local dependence (LD) was tested using IRT-based LD indices. Wald tests were used to examine group differences in IRT parameters, and to test DIF hypotheses. A second DIF-detection method used in sensitivity analyses was based on ordinal logistic regression with a latent IRT-derived conditioning variable. Magnitude and impact of DIF were investigated, and reliability and item and scale information statistics were estimated. Results: The reliability of the short form item set was excellent. However, there were a few items with high local dependency, which affected the estimation of the final discrimination parameters. As a result, the item, “How much did pain interfere with enjoyment of social activities?” was excluded in the DIF analyses for all subgroup comparisons. No items were hypothesized to show DIF for race and ethnicity; however, five items showed DIF after adjustment for multiple comparisons in both primary and sensitivity analyses: ability to concentrate, enjoyment of recreational activities, tasks away from home, participation in social activities, and socializing with others. The magnitude of DIF was small and the impact <b>negligible.</b> Three <b>items</b> were consistently identified with DIF for education: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, and enjoyment of recreational activities. No item showed DIF above the magnitude threshold and the impact of DIF on the overall measure was minimal. No item showed gender DIF after correction for multiple comparisons in the primary analyses. Four items showed consistent age DIF: enjoyment of life, ability to concentrate, day to day activities, and enjoyment of recreational activities, none with primary magnitude values above threshold. Conditional on the pain state, Spanish speakers were hypothesized to report less pain interference on one item, enjoyment of life. The DIF findings confirmed the hypothesis; however, the magnitude was small. Using an arbitrary cutoff point of theta (θ) ≥ 1. 0 to classify respondents with acute pain interfer-ence, the highest number of changes were for the education groups analyses. There were 231 respondents (4...|$|R
