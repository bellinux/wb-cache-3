40|$|The {{growth cone}} {{at the front}} of a growing neurite often has F-actin-rich structures-digitate filopodia and sheet-like veils and lamellipodia-whose {{protrusion}} advances the leading edge. Microtubules and other cytoplasmic constituents later fill the protruded area, transforming it into new <b>neuritic</b> length. <b>Growth</b> can be initiated from an axon by transecting it. We have used video-enhanced contrast-differential interference contrast microscopy to observe the early events following transection of Apiysia axons in culture. Many filopodium-like protrusions (FLPs) grew rapidly (average instantaneous velocity of 1. 6 sm/sec) from the sides and end of the axon stump within minutes of transection. Some of these displayed bidirectional transport of swellings, at a rate similar to fast axonal transport. Dihydrocytochalasin B, which blocks actin polymerization, only halved the numbe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Huntington’s disease (HD) is a polyglutamine-expanded related {{neurodegenerative}} disease. Despite {{the ubiquitous}} expression of expanded, polyQ-Huntingtin (ExpHtt) in the brain, striatal neurons present a higher susceptibility to the mutation. A commonly admitted {{hypothesis is that}} Dopaminergic inputs participate to this vulnerability. We previously showed that D 2 receptor stimulation increased aggregate formation and neuronal death induced by ExpHtt in primary striatal neurons in culture, and chronic D 2 antagonist treatment protects striatal dysfunctions induced by ExpHtt in a lentiviral-induced model system in vivo. The present work was designed to elucidate the signalling pathways involved, downstream D 2 receptor (D 2 R) stimulation, in striatal vulnerability to ExpHtt. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using primary striatal neurons in culture, transfected with a tagged-GFP version of human exon 1 ExpHtt, and siRNAs against D 2 R or D 1 R, we confirm that DA potentiates neuronal dysfunctions via D 2 R but not D 1 R stimulation. We demonstrate that D 2 agonist treatment induces <b>neuritic</b> retraction and <b>growth</b> cone collapse in Htt- and ExpHtt expressing neurons. We then tested a possible involvement of the Rho/ROCK signalling pathway, which {{plays a key role}} in the dynamic of the cytoskeleton, in these processes. The pharmacological inhibitors of ROCK (Y 27632 and Hydroxyfasudil), as well as siRNAs against ROCK-II, reversed D 2 -related effects on <b>neuritic</b> retraction and <b>growth</b> cone collapse. We show a coupling between D 2 receptor stimulation and Rho activation, as well as hyperphosphorylation o...|$|R

We have developed an in vitro model of astrocyte cultures of the lateral and medial sectors of the embryonic mouse midbrain, that differ {{in their ability to}} support <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> of young midbrain neurons, and we have searched for the role of interactive proteins and proteoglycans in this model. Neurite production in co-cultures reveals that, irrespective of the previous location of neurons in the midbrain, medial astrocytes exert an inhibitory or nonpermissive effect on <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> that is correlated to a higher content of both heparan and chondroitin sulfates (HS and CS). Treatment of astrocytes with chondroitinase ABC revealed a growth-promoting effect of CS on lateral glia but treatment with exogenous CS- 4 indicated a U-shaped dose-response curve for CS. In contrast, the growth-inhibitory action of medial astrocytes was reversed by exogenous CS- 4. Treatment of astrocytes with heparitinase indicated that the growth-inhibitory action of medial astrocytes may depend heavily on HS by an as yet unknown mechanism. The results are discussed in terms of available knowledge on the binding of HS proteoglycans to interactive proteins, with emphasis on the importance of unraveling the physiological functions of glial glycoconjugates for a better understanding of neuron-glial interactions...|$|E
40|$|Astroglial cells {{derived from}} lateral and medial {{midbrain}} sectors {{differ in their}} abilities to support <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> of midbrain neurons in cocultures. These different properties of {{the two types of}} cells {{may be related to the}} composition of their extracellular matrix. We have studied the synthesis and secretion of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) by the two cell types under control conditions and ß-D-xyloside-stimulated conditions, that stimulate the ability to synthesize and release GAGs. We have confirmed that both cell types synthesize and secrete heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Only slight differences were observed between the proportions of the two GAGs produced by the two types of cells after a 24 -h labeling period. However, a marked difference was observed between the GAGs produced by the astroglial cells derived from lateral and medial midbrain sectors. The medial cells, which contain derivatives of the tectal and tegmental midline radial glia, synthesized and secreted ~ 2. 3 times more chondroitin sulfate than lateral cells. The synthesis of heparan sulfate was only slightly modified by the addition of ß-D-xyloside. Overall, these results indicate that astroglial cells derived from the two midbrain sectors have marked differences in their capacity to synthesize chondroitin sulfate.

40|$|During the {{development}} of the nervous system, all kinds of structural elements such as neurons, neuritic extensions and synapses are initially overproduced (socalled overshoot phenomena). Neurite outgrowth {{has been found to be}} regulated by electrical activity of the neuron. High levels of activity, resulting in high intracellular calcium concentrations, cause neurites to retract whereas low levels of activity, and consequently low calcium concentrations, allow further outgrowth. In this article, we have studied the implications of such activity-dependent neurite outgrowth for network formation, using a distributed simulation model. The model consists of initially disconnected cells that organize themselves into a network under the influence of their intrinsic activity.

Our data are consistent, in principle, with effects on other, flighted cells and suggest that "vector-free" gravity may simulate certain aspects of microgravity.

While {{the role of}} chloride homeostasis, through the regulation of ionotropic GABA receptors, in the growth status of immature neurons in {{the central nervous system}} begins to emerge, nothing is known of its role in the regenerative growth of injured adult neurons. To analyze the intracellular Cl- variation following a sciatic nerve section in vivo, gramicidin perforated-patch recordings were used to study muscimol-induced currents in mice dorsal root ganglion neurons isolated from control and axotomized neurons. We show that the reversal potential of muscimol-induced current, EGABA-A was shifted towards depolarized potentials in axotomized neurons. This was due to Cl- influx since removal of extracellular Cl- prevented this shift. Application of bumetanide, an inhibitor of NKCC 1 cotransporter and EGABA-A recordings in sensory neurons from NKCC 1 -/- mice, identified NKCC 1 as being responsible for the increase in intracellular Cl- in axotomized neurons. In addition, we demonstrate with a phospho-NKCC 1 antibody that nerve injury induces an increase in the phosphorylated form of NKCC 1 in dorsal root ganglia that could account for intracellular Cl- accumulation. Time-lapse recordings of the <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> of axotomized neurons show a faster growth velocity in comparison with control. Both bumetanide, the intrathecal injection of NKCC 1 siRNA and the use of NKCC 1 -/- mice demonstrated that NKCC 1 is involved in determining the velocity of elongated growth of axotomized neurons.

In addition, relationships between precursor proliferation and the apparent sequence of developmental processes, including cell migration, neurite elaboration, transmitter expression and synaptogenesis remain unknown. To address these issues, we used a fully defined neuronal cell culture system derived from embryonic rat sympathetic ganglia (DiCicco-Bloom, E., and I. B. Black. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Our observations indicate that mitotic neuroblasts expressed a wide array of neuron-specific characteristics including extension of <b>neuritic</b> processes with <b>growth</b> cones, elaboration of neurotransmitter enzyme, synthesis and transport of transmitter vesicles and organization of transmitter release sites. These data suggest that neuroblasts in the cell cycle may simultaneously differentiate. Consequently, the apparent sequence of ontogenetic processes is not an immutable, intrinsic neuronal program.

Here we examine this question {{in the case of}} the posterior lateral line (PLL) system of zebrafish, where sensory organs are deposited by a migrating primordium. Sensory neurites accompany this primordium during its migration and are thereby guided to their prospective target organs. We show that the inactivation of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signaling leads to defects of innervation and that these defects are due to the inability of sensory axons to track the migrating primordium. GDNF signaling is also used as a guidance cue during axonal regeneration following nerve cut.

The methylated species in the neurite fraction were identified by thin-layer chromatography as mono-, di-, and trimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (phosphatidylcholine).

The results from our study indicate that DYX 1 C 1 plays a role in the migration of neocortical neurons and more specifically is required for the transition out of the multipolar stage of migration. We also demonstrated that Dcdc 2 is a microtubule associated protein and functions not only in neuronal migration but also <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth.</b> Additionally, our data displayed that DCDC 2 and DCX are partially functionally redundant in neurodevelopment.

This is mainly because of the current lack of longitudinal observations of neurite growth within the endogenous niche.

Using this approach we show that dendritic processes show a linear growth pattern with a speed of 2. 19 ± 0. 2 μm per hour, revealing a much faster growth dynamic than expected by snapshot-based in vivo time series.

Through {{the use of a}} panel of non-specific poly-L-lysine micropatterns, we manipulated the neuronal shape. By applying geometrical constraints on the cell body we provided evidence that centrosome location was not predictive of axonal polarization but rather follows axonal fate. When the geometrical constraints were applied to the neurites trajectories we demonstrated that axonal specification was inhibited by curved lines. Altogether these results indicated that intrinsic mechanical tensions occur during <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> and that maximal tension was developed by the axon and expressed on straight trajectories. The strong inhibitory effect of curved lines on axon specification was further demonstrated by their ability to prevent formation of multiple axons normally induced by cytochalasin or taxol treatments. Finally we provided evidence that microtubules were involved in the tension-mediated axonal polarization, acting as curvature sensors during neuronal differentiation. Thus, biomechanics coupled to physical constraints might be the first level of regulation during neuronal development, primary to biochemical and guidance regulations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT To {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of membrane components during <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth,</b> we carried {{out a series of}} pulse-chase experiments with ferritin-conjugated and unconjugated lectins on sympathetic neurons sprouting in vitro. Labeling of aldehyde-prefixed cultures with wheatgerm agglutinin or with the galactose-specific lectin of Ricinus communis is consistently dense near the distal end of the neurites. By contrast, if live cultures are labeled with these lectins and chased for 3 - 20 min, label-free plasmalemmal areas appear in the most peripheral regions of the growth cone, on filopodia and, furthermore, over vesicle clusters (SPVs). These markerfree areas, however, contain lectin receptors, as can be shown by relabeling the chased cultures with the same lectins after the aldehyde fixation. In a further set of experiments, cultures are labeled with a saturating concentration of native lectin, chased, aldehyde-fixed, and then relabeled with the ferritin conjugate of the same lectin. In this case, the surfaces of filopodia and of SPV clusters are selectively labeled with the ferritin conjugate, indicating the insertion of new lectin receptors into the plasma membrane in the growth cone periphery. These results indicate that plasmalemmal expansion in the neuron occurs by a mechanism of polarized growth, possibly involving SPVs as plasmalemmal precursor vesicles...|$|E
40|$|The s~gnificance of a {{previously}} observed increase in retinal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4. 1. 1. 17) following optic nerve crush was investigated ingoldfish using a specific irreversible inhibitor of ODC, a-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO). Retinal ODC activity and putrescine l vels were reduced 80 70 and 40 ~, respectively, by intraperitoneal injection(s) of DFMO. In fish {{in which the}} right optic nerve was crushed and DFMO was injected {{at the time of}} crush, at 2 days and at 4 days later, retinal ODC levels were maximally decreased after the third injection and returned to normal evels by 14 days post-crush (PC). Retinal tubulin synthesis was examined at 10 days PC. No difference in the post-crush/normal r tio of tubulin synthesis was observed between saline-injected and DFMO-injected groups. Neuritic extension was also examined in retinal explant cultures from 1 l-day PC retina. The <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> index of DFMO-treated retinas did not differ from that of control retinas. Behavioral studies revealed no difference in the rate of recovery of vision between the two groups. Similar results were obtained in experiments using fish maintained in a 0. 1 70 DFMO solution. These results suggest that the increase in retinal ODC associated with nerve crush does not play a causal role in restoration of function...|$|E

40|$|Ultrastructural {{analysis}} of colloidal gold immunocytochemical staining and immunofluorescence microscopy {{has been used}} to study the presence of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) on the surface of neuronal growth cones. The studies were carried out with cultures of rat hypothalamic and ventral mesencephalic cells, using morphology and expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, neurofilaments, and glial fibrillary acidic protein as differential markers for neurons and glia. NCAM was found on all plasmalemmal surfaces of neurons including perikarya and neurites. The density of NCAM varied for different neurons growing in the same culture dish, and neurons had at least 25 times more colloidal gold particles on their plasmalemmal membranes than astroglia. Of particular interest {{in the present study was}} a strong labeling for NCAM on all parts of <b>neuritic</b> <b>growth</b> cones, including the lamellar and filopodial processes that extend from the tip of the axon. The density of NCAM was similar on different filopodia of the same growth cone. Therefore, in situations where homophilic (NCAM-NCAM) binding might contribute to axon pathfinding, a choice in direction is more likely to reflect differences in the NCAM content of the environment, rather than the distribution of NCAM within a growth cone. On the other hand, the variation in NCAM levels between single neurons in culture was significant and could provide a basis for selective responses of growing neurites...|$|E
