40|$|The first Nurture Group (NG) was {{established}} by Marjorie Boxall in 1969 to improve the emotional wellbeing of children in schools (Kirkbride, 2014). They aim to provide support to meet the individual needs of children {{with a focus on}} social and emotional growth away from the mainstream classroom in a safe and secure environment. There has been substantial evidence on the effectiveness of NGs (O’Connor & Colwell, 2002; Cooper & Whitebread, 2007 and Griffiths, Stenner & Hicks, 2014), but little research to attain the views of the children who attend NGs, this research aimed to do this. The two research questions aimed to explore the <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> children attending a secondary school NG and whether these experiences were helpful, and if they were similar to or different from their mainstream classroom experiences. Participants were six children who were attending a secondary school NG in one Local Authority in the North of England, who took part in individual semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (Smith, Flowers & Larkin, 2009). Five superordinate themes emerged from the interpretative analysis; control, systems, structural and physical elements, purpose of the NG and inter-relationships. The children’s experiences supported previous findings in that NGs provide a secure base where children can form positive relationships with their peers and adults whom they can trust and rely upon, something which they did not experience in the mainstream classroom. They also attributed an improvement in academic skills and feelings of confidence to their <b>NG</b> <b>experience.</b> However, the <b>NG</b> {{does not appear to be}} seen by the children or by their peers and mainstream teachers as an inclusive part of school with participants expressing a desire to return to their “normal” classrooms due to feeling different by being in the NG. Lack of power and choice over entering the NG and when they could leave was experienced by the children with no involvement from mainstream staff. Confusion over the purpose of the intervention is also apparent. These findings are discussed in relation to implications for Educational Psychologists supporting children and schools as well as making a set of recommendations for further research. ...|$|R

Participants were 322 undergraduates. The perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency were assessed by the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency scales developed by Maki et al. （ 2003 ）. This scale have 15 items corresponding to perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and 15 items corresponding to perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> incontingency. The emotional intelligence were measured by two scales, WLEIS（Wong & Law, 2002 ）and J-ESCQ（Toyota, et al., 2005 ）originally developed by Taksic（ 2002 ）. Analysis of results based on Structure equation modeling （SEM）indicated that the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and incontingency influended self-esteem and shyness via emotional intelligence, although those experiences have small direct influences on both of them. The levels of self-esteem and shyness in 8 groups by 2 levels（low and high）and 3 scales（the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency, those of incontingency and emotional intelligence）were compared. These comparisons revealed that the high levels <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency and emotional intelligence led to higher level of self-esteem and lower level of shyness, and that the effects <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> contingency on shyness were affected by the levels of emotional intelligence. Although the level of self-esteem was influenced by the level <b>of</b> the perceived <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> incontingency, the level of shyness was not.

The focus will be on psychological control, behavioural control, sexual communication with parents and peers, sexual attitudes of parents and peers, peer pressure, and sexual <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> peers. Method. Data of a longitudinal study has been used for the present study. A total of 1297 participants from four high schools provided information through online questionnaires.

Psychological control, sexual communication with parents and peers, sexual attitudes with parents and peers, and sexual <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> peers were associated with sexual <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> adolescents.

Despite these criteria, the details <b>of</b> inner <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> individuals with BD are generally unknown.
