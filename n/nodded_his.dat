25|$|On October 1, 2006, an {{interview}} of Woodward by CBS reporter Mike Wallace was broadcast {{on the television}} show 60 Minutes. Wallace mentioned the Murtha-Abizaid conversation. Wallace asked Woodward to confirm that Murtha had told him of this tale of meeting with Abizaid; Woodward <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head in assent and said yes.|$|E
25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, where he might find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|Liang faced Northern Ireland's Joe Swail in {{the last}} 16 of the tournament. In a humorous incident, Liang fluked a red after {{scattering}} the balls, but failed to notice {{and went back to}} his seat. To laughter, Swail pointed out his mistake and the referee called Liang back to the table. In the 23rd frame, Liang, with a 12–10 lead, prematurely celebrated winning after potting match ball, only to go on to lose the frame due to a snooker. Swail came back to level the match at 12–12. In the final frame, Liang made breaks of 34 and 30 early on. He missed the final yellow but snookered Swail, leaving the white in the jaws of the pocket. Liang played a safety and Swail snookered him behind the blue, but Liang failed to hit the ball and Swail had the white replaced. Liang then hit the yellow directly. This incident proved controversial as the referee replaced the white in the wrong position, giving Liang a better sight of the yellow. At the time, Swail <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> assent to the referee, but in a post-match interview, complained and accused Liang of unprofessional behaviour for not pointing out the referee's error. Commentators countered that Swail should have queried the placement of the ball before Liang took his shot, and given the tension of the situation Liang could be forgiven for not thinking clearly. Liang {{went on to win the}} frame 74–34, and thus, the match 13–12.|$|E
50|$|Mainwaring is {{convening}} a parade, and {{is growing}} fed up of Jones' slowness. Walker suggests <b>nodding</b> <b>his</b> head whenever {{he wants them}} to come to attention, and Jones will understand. Mainwaring dismisses this, but Jones takes it on board, standing to attention and standing at ease whenever Mainwaring <b>nods</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R

2500|$|On April 22, he {{was charged}} with [...] "using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass {{destruction}} resulting in death" [...] and with [...] "malicious destruction of properties resulting in death", both in connection with the Boston Marathon attacks.

Conductor Charles Groves <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> approval and said, [...] "I'd get him in".

2500|$|Four years later, the Indian villages on the Mad River {{would be}} {{destroyed}} by Benjamin Logan {{at the outset of}} the Northwest Indian War. Hugh McGary confronted the Shawnee chief Moluntha and asked if he had been at Blue Licks. In fact, the Shawnees had not taken part, the Indians being Wyandots. Moluntha <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head in agreement. McGary killed him with a tomahawk. Moluntha had voluntarily and peacefully [...] surrendered, waving an American flag and a copy of the peace treaty he had signed earlier that year, in the belief that these would protect him. Colonel Logan immediately relieved McGary of his command and ordered him court-martialed for killing a prisoner. McGary was stripped of his commission for a year, but was otherwise unpunished.|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he <b>nodded</b> <b>his</b> head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
