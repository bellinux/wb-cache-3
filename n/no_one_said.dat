I was caught out {{like a lot of}} artists were, with record companies figuring out how to do single releases these days. I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{opened with}} a musical number which parodied the song [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] from Mamma Mia! The Movie. Awards were presented by John Wilson, the ceremony's founder. Awardees received a gold spray-painted raspberry worth $4.97. The Love Guru received three awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor and Worst Screenplay. Worst Picture was the last award given out at the ceremony. John Wilson {{did not agree with}} the voters' determination on The Love Guru, and after viewing the film again in preparation for the ceremony, said to the Associated Press: [...] "A couple of things he did got me to laugh, and these days, two laughs in a comedy is a high ratio." [...] "The main thing wrong with it is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> to Myers that it wasn't funny. He managed to offend the entire Indian population and his investors," [...] said Wilson in a statement in The Guardian. Wilson shredded a copy of The Love Guru at the awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Facing an {{ultimately}} detached nature, {{the characters}} find solace in human solidarity. They are {{often referred to}} collectively as [...] "the men", rather than singularly by their professions, creating a silent understanding between them of their togetherness. The first few sentences of section three attest to this connection: [...] "It {{would be difficult to}} describe the subtle brotherhood of men that was here established on the seas. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> that it was so. No one mentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him. They were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they were friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may be common." [...] Survival is also an important thematic element in itself, as it is contingent upon the men to battle the elements in order to save themselves. The correspondent's desire to survive is evident in his refrain of the lyrical line: [...] "If I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned—if I am going to be drowned, why, {{in the name of the}} seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?" [...] By repeating himself, the correspondent expresses himself ritualistically, and yet he remains existentially adrift.|$|E
60|$|But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>said</b> anything; {{perhaps they}} were all too much ashamed, even then.|$|R
50|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> has <b>said</b> for 50 {{years that}} you go to college to learn the truth.|$|R
60|$|Fleete thanked <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> He <b>said</b> that {{he wanted}} to go to bed. He was gorgeously drunk.|$|R
2500|$|Sir Alan {{felt that}} Velocity's {{performance}} had merely been adequate, and their victory was mostly down to Invicta being a [...] "bloody shower". Notably, when Sir Alan questioned the women during the reward, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> that Mani {{had been a}} good leader. Ruth was most positive, claiming he was [...] "brave to take them on", while Sharon walked out of a meeting in spite of Michelle trying to stop her.|$|E
60|$|Every eye {{was turned}} moodily to the speaker, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} {{after this}} indignant burst of Cennini's till he himself spoke again.|$|E
50|$|Pinker {{responded to}} Fodor's criticisms in Mind & Language. Pinker argued that Fodor had {{attacked}} straw man positions, wryly suggesting a possible title for his riposte as <b>No</b> <b>One</b> Ever <b>Said</b> it Did.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here {{is a most}} {{remarkable}} bird which is called a Nightingale!' said the Emperor. 'They say {{it is the most}} glorious thing in my kingdom. Why has <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> anything to me about it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, pray, pray, Edward,' cried my mother, 'don't {{accuse me}} of being ungrateful. I am sure I am not ungrateful. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> I was before. I have many faults, but not that. Oh, don't, my dear!' ...|$|R
60|$|Winifred Dartie coughed, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> a word. It was {{the piece}} of {{evidence}} they had all unconsciously been waiting for.|$|E
6000|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Know what?" [...] {{because all}} were aware from {{experience}} that what he knew would declare itself in process of time.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything; but {{the dank}} night air seemed {{suddenly}} alive {{with all the}} passions of hate let loose by thirty beating hearts.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>said</b> a word. The captain did {{not even}} look up to see who had spoken. He felt the justice {{as well as the}} {{harshness}} of the remark, and poured the water back into the jar.|$|R

60|$|Hetty {{felt that}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> could deliver {{her from the}} evils that would make life hateful to her; and <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> she <b>said</b> to herself, should ever know her misery and humiliation. No; she would not confess even to Dinah. She would wander out of sight, and drown herself where her body would never be found, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> should know {{what had become of}} her.|$|R
60|$|Jo's {{sudden change}} of tone made the girls laugh, but all looked rather anxious, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> a word as Snodgrass took his seat.|$|E
6000|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything, {{and after}} a pause she went on. [...] "Edmund remarked a sort of indistinctness about the pupil, which he said {{was not a good}} sign." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{a minute}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> a word. Then Blacky the Crow leaned {{down from his}} perch in the Big Hickory-tree and looked very hard at Little Joe as he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You ordered us to wait, citoyen, {{until the}} tall Englishman arrived {{and joined the}} four men in the hut. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> came," [...] <b>said</b> the {{sergeant}} sullenly.|$|R
2500|$|ARMITAGE: Well, even Mr. Novak {{has said}} that he used the word [...] "operative" [...] and misused it. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> [...] "operative." [...] And I not only assumed it, as I say, I've never seen a covered agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said, it was foolish, yeah. Sure it was.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, Claude!' {{returned}} Lily, 'do not say so, {{you know}} it was Emily that I called an example of it, not myself, and see how forbearing she has been. Now I see that I am really wanted, I will help. It must be love, not duty, that calls me to the schoolroom, for <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> that was my province.' ...|$|R
60|$|Then Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle and Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter and Jerry Muskrat {{stared at}} one mother, {{and for a}} long time <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> a word.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Appin {{concluded}} {{his remarkable}} statement {{in a voice}} which he strove to divest of a triumphant inflection. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Rats," [...] though Clovis's lips moved in a monosyllabic contortion which probably invoked those rodents of disbelief.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} to this. When the factotum had disappeared {{round the corner}} of the house, Mrs. Alger turned her head' aside, and glanced downward with an air of fatigue. In this manner Barlow was dismissed from the ladies' minds.|$|E
6000|$|Whatever can {{be known}} of earth we know, [...] Sneered Europe's wise men, in their snail-shells curled; <b>No!</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> man in Genoa, and that No [...] Out of the {{darkness}} summoned this New World.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is Sihamba and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else," [...] <b>said</b> Sigwe. [...] "Sihamba {{come back}} to rule you in the hour of need, and with her own tongue she shall tell you her story {{and the story of}} the White Swallow who holds her by the hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|If <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{else has}} <b>said</b> {{a word about}} this {{important}} matter, ex-President Roosevelt would have sufficed to shout it {{to the ends of}} the earth. Every civilised community is drifting towards [...] "race-suicide" [...] as Rome drifted into [...] "race-suicide" [...] at the climax of her empire.|$|R
60|$|Everybody grinned, for Blacky {{has played}} so many sharp tricks {{that no one}} is really his friend unless it is that other mischief-maker, Sammy Jay, who, you know, is Blacky's cousin. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything, and Blacky went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Brer Possum, it isn't," [...] replied Ol' Mistah Buzzard. Everybody looked surprised. You see, no {{one ever}} had heard him called {{anything}} but Buzzard. But <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> anything, and {{after a minute or}} two Ol' Mistah Buzzard explained.|$|E
6000|$|Has <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>said</b> those daring [...] Kind eyes {{should be}} more learn'd? [...] Or warned you how despairing [...] The moths are when they are burned, [...] I could have warned you, but you are young, [...] So we speak a {{different}} tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} not get ill. If you do, and I hear of it--I shall {{come after you}} with a troupe of doctor's and nurses. If I am a failure as a wife, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has ever <b>said</b> I was {{anything}} but a success as a district visitor...." ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 28, in an {{interview}} with Anchorage Daily News, Monegan said, [...] "For the record, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> ever <b>said</b> fire Wooten. Not the governor. Not Todd. Not any of the other staff. What they said directly was more along the lines of 'This isn't a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers.' [...] " [...] He later added that he had resisted pressure from the governor and her husband to re-open the case against Wooten.|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{think that}} the course {{proposed}} by Mr. Mildmay will be the best," [...] said the Duke, who had no doubt already discussed the matter with his friend the Prime Minister in private. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> else <b>said</b> a word either of argument or disagreement, and the Cabinet Council was broken up. The old messenger, who had been asleep in his chair, stood up and bowed as the Ministers walked by him, and then went in and rearranged the chairs.|$|R
