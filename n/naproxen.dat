5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. <b>Naproxen</b> {{has been shown to}} be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, <b>naproxen</b> is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{medication}} typically recommended first are NSAIDs (though not aspirin) or {{skeletal muscle}} relaxants {{and these are}} enough for most people. Benefits with NSAIDs; however, is often small. High-quality reviews have found acetaminophen (paracetamol) {{to be no more}} effective than placebo at improving pain, quality of life, or function. NSAIDs are more effective for acute episodes than acetaminophen; however, they carry a greater risk of side effects including: kidney failure, stomach ulcers and possibly heart problems. Thus, NSAIDs are a second choice to acetaminophen, recommended only when the pain is not handled by the latter. NSAIDs are available in several different classes; {{there is no evidence to}} support the use of COX-2 inhibitors over any other class of NSAIDs with respect to benefits. With respect to safety <b>naproxen</b> may be best. Muscle relaxants may be beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or <b>naproxen,</b> or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Aleve D (made by Bayer Healthcare) — {{contains}} 120mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (also 240mg <b>naproxen).</b>|$|E
25|$|Poisoning {{with pain}} {{medications}} is common. Aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and <b>naproxen</b> (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, acetaminophen can cause liver disease, ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and <b>naproxen</b> can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment {{depends on the}} clinical signs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Naproxen</b> (Aleve)* {{has a long}} {{half-life}} in {{dogs and}} can cause gastrointestinal irritation, anemia, melena (digested blood in feces), and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, {{conducted}} by Bombardier, et al., which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and <b>naproxen,</b> had {{indicated a significant}} 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with <b>naproxen</b> patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over the 12-month span of the study. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There {{was no significant difference}} in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and <b>naproxen</b> treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. those meeting the criteria for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis of secondary cardiovascular events (previous myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or coronary artery bypass).|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evaluation}} {{from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{concluded that the}} overall benefit/risk profile of nimesulide is favourable and in line {{with that of the}} other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and <b>naproxen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} first {{selective}} COX-2 inhibitor was marketed, specialists began to suspect {{that there might be}} a cardiovascular risk associated with this class of medicines. In the VIGOR study (Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research), rofecoxib (Vioxx) was compared to <b>naproxen.</b> After a short time, it became evident that there was a fivefold higher risk of myocardial infarction in the rofecoxib group compared to the group that received <b>naproxen.</b> The authors suggested that the difference was due to the cardioprotective effects of <b>naproxen.</b> The APPROVe (Adenomatous Poly Prevention on Vioxx) study was a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial aimed to assess the effect of three-year treatment with rofecoxib on recurrence of neoplastic polyps in individuals with a history of colorectal adenomas. In 2000 and 2001, 2587 patients with a history of colorectal adenomas were recruited and followed. The trial was stopped early (2 months before expected completion) on recommendations of its data safety and monitoring board because of concerns about cardiovascular toxicity. When looking at the results of the study, it showed a statistically significant increase in cardiovascular risk when taking rofecoxib compared to placebo beginning after 18 months of treatment. Then on 30 September Merck gave out a news release announcing their voluntary worldwide withdrawal of Vioxx.|$|E
25|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (usually {{abbreviated to}} NSAIDs), are a drug class that groups together drugs that decrease pain and lower fever, and, in higher doses decrease inflammation. The most prominent {{members of this}} group of drugs, aspirin, ibuprofen and <b>naproxen,</b> are all available over the counter in most countries.|$|E
25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{members of this}} group of drugs are aspirin, ibuprofen and <b>naproxen,</b> all available over the counter in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only little anti-inflammatory activity. It treats pain mainly by blocking COX-2 mostly in the central nervous system, but not much {{in the rest of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{are also}} known by their more common, simpler names, {{many of which}} predate the systematic name. For example, the long-known sugar glucose is now systematically named 6-(hydroxymethyl)oxane-2,3,4,5-tetrol. Natural products and pharmaceuticals are also given simpler names, for example the mild pain-killer <b>Naproxen</b> is the more common name for the chemical compound (S)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthaleneacetic acid.|$|E
25|$|Many {{treatments}} {{have been}} tried in PMS. Reducing salt, caffeine, and stress along with increasing exercise is typically all that is recommended in those with mild symptoms. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation {{may be useful in}} some. Antiinflammatories such as <b>naproxen</b> may help with physical symptoms. In those with more significant symptoms birth control pills may be useful.|$|E
25|$|In {{treating}} chronic pain, opioids are {{an option}} to be tried after other less risky pain relievers have been considered, including paracetamol/acetaminophen or NSAIDs like ibuprofen or <b>naproxen.</b> Some types of chronic pain, including the pain caused by fibromyalgia or migraine, are preferentially treated with drugs other than opioids. The efficacy of using opioids to lessen chronic neuropathic pain is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Others include Merck's etoricoxib (Arcoxia), Pfizer’s {{celecoxib}} (Celebrex) and valdecoxib (Bextra). Interestingly, at {{the time}} of its withdrawal, rofecoxib was the only coxib with clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal adverse effect profile over conventional NSAIDs. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and <b>naproxen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Codeine is also {{commonly}} marketed {{in products}} containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, {{as well as}} codeine mixed with phenacetin (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), <b>naproxen,</b> indomethacin, diclofenac, and others, {{as well as more}} complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine ± caffeine ± antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|The pain {{medication}} acetaminophen {{is the first}} line treatment for osteoarthritis. However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to only have a small short-term benefit. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs such as <b>naproxen,</b> while more effective in severe cases, are associated with greater side effects, such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Diclofenac {{may be the most}} effective NSAID.|$|E
25|$|Non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and <b>naproxen,</b> {{can cause}} flares of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} in approximately 25% of patients. These flares tend to occur within one week after starting regular use of the NSAID. In contrast, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and aspirin appear to be safe. Celecoxib (Celebrex), a cox-2 inhibitor, {{also appears to be}} safe, at least in short-term studies of patients in remission and on medication for their Crohn's disease.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{palliative care}} {{following}} discharge often {{consists of a}} weak or moderate strength opioid (e.g. codeine or tramadol, respectively) depending on pain scores, an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g. <b>naproxen,</b> cortisone), and an antispasmodic (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, diazepam), {{for a few days}} to a week. If the pain and/or spasms have not resolved by this time, a second medical evaluation is generally advised, and differential diagnoses may be considered. Occasionally, an antibiotic is prescribed as well.|$|E
25|$|Diclofenac {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with significantly increased vascular and coronary risk in a study including coxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen and <b>naproxen.</b> Upper gastrointestinal complications were also reported. Major vascular events were increased by about a third by diclofenac, chiefly due to an increase in major coronary events. Compared with placebo, of 1000 patients allocated to diclofenac for a year, three more had major vascular events, one of which was fatal. Vascular death was increased significantly by diclofenac.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{prevented}} by hand washing, avoiding smoking, and immunization. Pain killers such as <b>naproxen,</b> nasal steroids, and nasal irrigation {{may be used}} to help with symptoms. Recommended initial treatment for ARS is watchful waiting. If symptoms do not improve in 7–10 days or get worse, then an antibiotic may be used or changed. In those in whom antibiotics are used, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate is recommended first line. Surgery may occasionally be used in people with chronic disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{cause of}} PMS is unknown. Some {{symptoms}} may be worsened by a high-salt diet, alcohol, or caffeine. The underlying mechanism {{is believed to}} involve changes in hormone levels. Reducing salt, caffeine, and stress along with increasing exercise is typically all that is recommended in those with mild symptoms. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation {{may be useful in}} some. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as <b>naproxen</b> may help with physical symptoms. In those with more significant symptoms birth control pills or the diuretic spironolactone may be useful.|$|E
25|$|While {{the use of}} paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen, <b>naproxen,</b> {{and other}} NSAIDS {{concurrently}} with weak to mid-range opiates (up to about the hydrocodone level) has been said to show beneficial synergistic effects by combatting pain at multiple sites of action, several combination analgesic products {{have been shown to}} have few efficacy benefits when compared to similar doses of their individual components. Moreover, these combination analgesics can often result in significant adverse events, including accidental overdoses, most often due to confusion that arises from the multiple (and often non-acting) components of these combinations.|$|E
25|$|The {{management}} of AKI hinges on identification {{and treatment of}} the underlying cause. The main objectives of initial management are to prevent cardiovascular collapse and death and to call for specialist advice from a nephrologist. In addition to treatment of the underlying disorder, {{management of}} AKI routinely includes the avoidance of substances that are toxic to the kidneys, called nephrotoxins. These include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or <b>naproxen,</b> iodinated contrasts such as those used for CT scans, many antibiotics such as gentamicin, {{and a range of}} other substances.|$|E
25|$|Tension-type {{headaches}} {{can usually}} be managed with NSAIDs (ibuprofen, <b>naproxen),</b> acetaminophen or aspirin. Triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines. For chronic tension type headaches, amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help. Amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain. It works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism. Studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed. Overall, they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{includes}} exercise, {{efforts to}} decrease joint stress, support groups, and pain medications. Efforts to decrease joint stress include resting {{and the use}} of a cane. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as <b>naproxen</b> or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is generally discouraged due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. If pain interferes with normal life despite other treatments, joint replacement surgery may help. An artificial joint typically lasts 10 to 15 years.|$|E
25|$|Most {{people with}} sickle-cell disease have {{intensely}} painful episodes called vaso-occlusive crises. However, the frequency, severity, {{and duration of}} these crises vary tremendously. Painful crises are treated symptomatically with pain medications; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on NSAIDs (such as diclofenac or <b>naproxen).</b> For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices are commonly used in this setting. Diphenhydramine is also an effective agent that doctors frequently prescribe to help control itching {{associated with the use}} of opioids.|$|E
25|$|Anti-inflammatory {{medicines}} such as aspirin, <b>naproxen</b> or ibuprofen {{among others}} {{can be taken to}} help with pain. In some cases the physical therapist will use ultrasound and electrical stimulation, as well as manipulation. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises are added gradually. If there is no improvement, the doctor may inject a corticosteroid medicine into the space under the acromion. However, recent level one evidence showed limited efficacy of corticosteroid injections for pain relief. While steroid injections are a common treatment, they must be used with caution because they may lead to tendon rupture. If there is still no improvement after 6 to 12 months, the doctor may perform either arthroscopic or open surgery to repair damage and relieve pressure on the tendons and bursae.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies of}} other coxibs have also shown {{increase}} {{in the risk of}} cardiovascular events, while others have not. For instance, the Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib study (APC) showed a dose-related increase in risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure when taking celecoxib compared to placebo; and the Successive Celecoxib Efficacy and Safety Study I (SUCCESS-I) showed increased risk of myocardial infarction when taking 100nbsp&mg twice a day of celecoxib compared to diclofenac and naproxen; but taking 200nbsp&mg twice a day had lower incidence of myocardial infarction compared to diclofenac and <b>naproxen.</b> Nussmeier et al. (2005) showed in a study increase in incidence of cardiovascular events when taking parecoxib and valdecoxib (compared to placebo) after coronary artery bypass surgery.|$|E
25|$|Opioids {{are being}} used more {{frequently}} {{in the management of}} non-malignant chronic pain. This practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids. Because of various negative effects the use of opioids for long term management of chronic pain is not indicated unless other less risky pain relievers have been found ineffective. Chronic pain which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. Paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and <b>naproxen</b> are considered safer alternatives. They are frequently used combined with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone (Percocet) and ibuprofen combined with hydrocodone (Vicoprofen), which boosts the pain relief but is also intended to deter recreational use.|$|E
25|$|The vaso-occlusive {{crisis is}} caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells that obstruct {{capillaries}} and restrict blood flow to an organ resulting in ischaemia, pain, necrosis, and often organ damage. The frequency, severity, and duration of these crises vary considerably. Painful crises are treated with hydration, analgesics, and blood transfusion; pain management requires opioid administration at regular intervals until the crisis has settled. For milder crises, a subgroup of patients manage on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as diclofenac or <b>naproxen.</b> For more severe crises, most patients require inpatient management for intravenous opioids; patient-controlled analgesia devices are commonly used in this setting. Vaso-occlusive crisis involving organs such as the penis or lungs are considered an emergency and treated with red-blood cell transfusions. Incentive spirometry, a technique to encourage deep breathing to minimise the development of atelectasis, is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation was studied by Li H. et al. (2008). They {{showed that in}} spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) non-selective NSAIDs and the coxibs produce oxidative stress, indicated by enhanced vascular superoxide(O2−) content and elevated peroxide in plasma, which is in tune with enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase, which was noticed with use of diclofenac and <b>naproxen</b> and, to a lesser degree, rofecoxib and celecoxib. Nitrite in plasma was also decreased suggesting a diminished synthesis of vascular nitric oxide (NO). This decrease in NO synthesis did not result from decreased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) because expression of eNOS mRNA was not reduced, and even upregulated for some products. The decrease in NO synthesis could, rather, be explained by loss of eNOS function. For eNOS to be normally functional, it needs to form a dimer and to have its cofactor BH4, {{which is one of}} the most potent naturally occurring reducing agents. BH4 is sensitive to oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO−), which is produced when NO reacts with O2−, so it has been hypothesized that depletion of BH4 can occur with excessive oxidative stress (that can be caused be NSAIDs) and, hence, be the cause of eNOS dysfunction. This dysfunction, which is referred to as eNOS uncoupling, causes the production of O2− by eNOS, thereby leading to more oxidative stress produced by eNOS. In a study, both the selective COX-2 inhibitors and the non-selective NSAIDs produced oxidative stress, with greater effects seen with non-selective NSAIDs use. This could fit with the hypothesis concerning the prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance. That is, although the non-selective NSAIDs produce more oxidative stress, they prevent platelet aggregation, whereas the COX-2 inhibitors reduce prostacyclin production, and, hence, the cardiovascular risk for the non-selective NSAIDs is not higher than for the coxibs.|$|E
2500|$|Merck's {{scientists}} {{interpreted the}} finding as a protective effect of <b>naproxen,</b> telling the FDA {{that the difference}} in heart attacks [...] "is primarily due to" [...] this protective effect. Some commentators have noted that <b>naproxen</b> {{would have to be}} three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of <b>naproxen,</b> although {{a number of studies have}} found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin.|$|E
2500|$|This {{coupling}} reaction is stereoselective with a propensity for trans coupling as the palladium halide {{group and the}} bulky organic residue move {{away from each other}} in the reaction sequence in a rotation step. The Heck reaction is applied industrially in the production of <b>naproxen</b> and the sunscreen component octyl methoxycinnamate. [...] The <b>naproxen</b> synthesis includes a coupling between a brominated naphthalene compound with ethylene: ...|$|E
2500|$|Grignard {{reagents}} are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions {{for instance}} with alkyl halides {{in a key}} step in industrial <b>Naproxen</b> production: ...|$|E
2500|$|Eesomeprazole {{magnesium}} is also {{combined with}} <b>naproxen</b> (under {{the brand name}} Vimovo®) {{for the prevention of}} gastric ulcers associated with chronic NSAID therapy. [...] Vimovo is available in 2 dosage strengths: 500/20mg. & 375/20mg. [...] Pivotal clinical trials of Vimovo (at the 6 month end point) demonstrated an incidence of GI ulcer in 24% of patients on <b>naproxen</b> (alone) versus 7% on naproxen/esomeprazole. [...] The FDA has added warnings to the label for Viomovo concerning acute interstitial nephritis, risk of kidney problems in some patients.|$|E
