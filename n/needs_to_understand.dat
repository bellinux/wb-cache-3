25|$|To {{understand}} why multiple return strokes utilize the same lightning channel, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the behavior of}} positive leaders, which a typical ground flash effectively becomes following the negative leader's connection with the ground. Positive leaders decay more rapidly than negative leaders do. For reasons not well understood, bidirectional leaders tend to initiate on {{the tips of the}} decayed positive leaders in which the negative end attempts to re-ionize the leader network. These leaders, also called recoil leaders, usually decay shortly after their formation. When they do manage to make contact with a conductive portion of the main leader network, a return stroke-like process occurs and a dart leader travels across all, or a portion of the length of the original leader. The dart leaders making connections with the ground is what causes a majority of subsequent return strokes.|$|E

25|$|Understanding {{the channel}} allows for {{manipulation}} of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the characteristics of the}} channel. This process is called channel sounding or channel estimation. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a closed-loop MIMO system. For beamforming, it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.|$|E
25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call this or that civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
25|$|The Duke of York {{decided to}} exploit this {{numerical}} superiority {{as soon as}} possible. He therefore prepared for {{an attack on a}} broad front. To understand the problems this attack encountered one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the peculiar nature of the terrain. The North Holland peninsula is bordered on the North-Sea side by a beach and a broad band of dunes (except for a short stretch south of Petten, where only a large dike defends the hinterland against flooding). Next to the dunes is a band of high land that can easily be traversed by a marching army. Further east, the terrain changes to former bogland and other low-lying areas consisting of former lakes that had been drained by the Dutch in the 17th century. These low-lying areas were criss-crossed by ditches and larger drainage canals, needed in the water-management of the area, that formed serious impediments to manoeuvring forces, even when they were not inundated. Such inundations were increasingly performed by the Dutch engineers the more the campaign progressed, to deny more and more freedom of movement to the Anglo-Russian forces. At the time of the Battle of Bergen that commenced on 19 September, most of those inundations were not yet completed, so that at that time the main obstacles were still the watercourses.|$|E

500|$|Znaniecki {{coined the}} term [...] "humanistic coefficient" [...] for a method of social {{research}} by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants' perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the subject's world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only {{if they can be}} objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.|$|E

Study Design A review of MEDLINE [1996 – 2007], six websites and key informants produced 302 publications, which reduced to 35 articles, 7 books, and 9 policy documents. Results Key themes that emerged from a thematic analysis of the literature that GP educators <b>need</b> <b>to</b> consider when teaching registrars about research were [i] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that learning research is influenced by attitudes; [ii] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> address organisational constraints on learning research; [iii] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> identify the educational barriers on learning research; [iv] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> there are gaps in GP research content – especially from GP registrars; And [v] the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the value {{of research on the}} GP registrar's educational cycle of learning, which develops in a culture that allows research to flourish. Conclusion Australian GP registrars will observe a research culture only if they encounter clinician-researchers paid to practice and conduct research in their general practice. </p...|$|R
