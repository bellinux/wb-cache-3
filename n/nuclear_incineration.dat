40|$|Most of {{the leading}} {{explosion}} scenarios for Type Ia supernovae involve the <b>nuclear</b> <b>incineration</b> of a white dwarf star through a detonation wave. Several scenarios have been proposed as to how this detonation may actually occur, but the exact mechanism and environment in which it takes place remain unknown. We explore the effects of an off-center initiated detonation on the spatial distribution of the nucleosynthetic yield products in a toy model [...] a pre-expanded near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. We find that a single-point near edge-lit detonation results in asymmetries in the density and thermal profiles, notably the expansion timescale, throughout the supernova ejecta. We demonstrate that this asymmetry of the thermodynamic trajectories should be common to off-center detonations where {{a small amount of}} the star is burned prior to detonation. The sensitivity of the yields on the expansion timescale results in an asymmetric distribution of the elements synthesized as reaction products. We tabulate the shift in the center of mass of the various elements produced in our model supernova and find an odd-even pattern for elements past silicon. Our calculations show that off-center single-point detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are marked by significant composition asymmetries in their remnants which bear potentially observable signatures in both velocity and coordinate space, including an elemental nickel mass fraction which varies by a factor of two to three {{from one side of the}} remnant to the other.

40|$|Public {{opposition}} to nuclear power {{has focused on}} the long-term risks from reactor waste. In the Purex process used in Europe, this waste is a concentrated nitric acid solution containing all nonvolatile fission products and the actinides Np, Am, and Cm, plus smaller amounts of U and Pu. Techniques have recently been described which guarantee an absolutely safe containment of this high-active waste (HAW) for about 1000 years. At longer times, the risk to the biosphere is dominated by the actinides. If these actinides are isolated {{from the rest of the}} HAW and destroyed through <b>nuclear</b> <b>incineration,</b> the long-term risks of the HAW will be dramatically reduced. This paper presents a detailed scheme for removing the actinides from the Purex-HAW solution. In principle, the process consists of three different solvent extraction cycles, using HDEHP and TBP in three successive steps. The scheme has been tested on a synthetic HAW solution containing all fission products and actinides (except Z 96, Cm) using laboratory-scale mixer-settler batteries. Results from runs on old Purex waste are also presented. If applied to fresh Purex waste, the process will encounter problems due to radiation damage to the reagents. In practice, this difficulty can be circumvented by using short contact times in the solvent extraction process. Extremely rapid multistage solvent extraction separations can be carried out by the SISAK technique (i. e., batteries of static mixers and special centrifugal separators).
