25|$|In {{response}} {{to the position of}} Solow and Stiglitz, Georgescu argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and energy resources in the economic process. This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. Energy resources, on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist — usually as fuel or electricity — in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a flow factor (resources transformed in the economy); but <b>never</b> <b>that</b> of a fund factor (man-made capital in the economy). Hence, substituting man-made capital for energy resources is physically impossible.|$|E
500|$|Head writer Maria Arena Bell {{dedicated}} the 4th of July episode to Sharon, {{stating that}} the episode would [...] "shed more light on Sharon and all the factors that caused her {{to be in this}} situation, why she's acted the way she has and why she's gone into the pit of [...] self-esteem." [...] Case noted that she wanted to show viewers why Sharon is in the place she's in, as well as examine her life over the years during the episode. Jae' Jones of Yahoo! analyzed the storyline in anticipation of Sharon's homecoming, hoping that Nick, Adam and Noah would not forgive her because of all the [...] "unforgivable things" [...] she has done (especially her devious move of letting them believe she was dead). Jones further said: [...] "Some will say she did what she thought she had to do. Even though it seemed as if it was easy, it's <b>never</b> <b>that</b> easy {{to walk away from the}} people you love".|$|E

2500|$|In 1958, Arthur Rubinstein {{performed}} {{a concert in}} New Orleans. Afterwards, eighteen-year-old Booker {{was introduced to the}} concert pianist and played several tunes for him. Rubinstein was astonished, saying [...] "I could <b>never</b> play <b>that</b> ... <b>never</b> at <b>that</b> tempo" [...] (The Times-Picayune, 1958). During this period, Booker also became known for his flamboyant personality among his peers.|$|R
500|$|In a pre-release comment, {{popular culture}} expert Robert Thompson said: [...] "The fact is, {{the story has}} {{developed}} in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something {{they did not know}} before. Now we're getting into the details, which is <b>never</b> <b>that</b> thrilling." [...] The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video [...] "overwhelmingly" [...] failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film. On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, said that the sequel was [...] "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" [...] and that, in comparison to the original video, the [...] "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop – displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict—than in a YouTube smash." ...|$|E
500|$|Strong {{states that}} [...] "...sections {{of what was}} [...] {{hardcore}} became known as grunge." [...] Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that [...] "here is no real difference...between Punk and Grunge." [...] Like punk bands, grunge groups were [...] "embraced as back-to-basics rock ‘n’ roll bands which reminded the public that the music {{was supposed to be}} raw and raunchy", and they were a response to [...] "bloated and over-the-top...progressive rock...or [...] "not seriou like the hair bands of the ‘80s." [...] One example of the influence of US hardcore on grunge is the impact that the Los Angeles hardcore punk band Black Flag had on grunge. Black Flag's 1984 record My War, on which the band combined heavy metal with their traditional sound, made a strong impact in Seattle. Mudhoney's Steve Turner commented, [...] "A lot of other people around the country hated the fact that Black Flag slowed down...but up here it was really great...we were like 'Yay!' They were weird and fucked-up sounding." [...] Turner explained grunge's integration of metal influences, noting, [...] "Hard rock and metal was <b>never</b> <b>that</b> much of an enemy of punk like it was for other scenes. Here, it was like, 'There's only twenty people here, you can't really find a group to hate.'" [...] Bands began to mix metal and punk in the Seattle music scene around 1984, with much of the credit for this fusion going to The U-Men.|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} game 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "one of those {{frustrating}} 'nearly' games that {{could and should}} have been brilliant." [...] He praised the concept of mixing two gameplay styles; [...] "it would be easy to get stuck in a rut as a gaming experience if you were constantly engaged in a blistering hack-and-slash the whole time. Likewise, a pure stealth experience would soon feel restrictive and frustrating." [...] However, he felt the stealth sections were underdeveloped, arguing [...] "they're just <b>never</b> <b>that</b> enjoyable on a basic level," [...] and calling them [...] "tedious, exacting, basic and inconsistent." [...] However, he was also critical of the action sections, calling them [...] "blister inducing," [...] and arguing [...] "the same tactics get you through every time."

2500|$|Obama and Clinton held {{a meeting}} on the subject on November 11. When the {{possibility}} became public on November 14, {{it came as a}} surprising and dramatic move, especially given the long, sometimes bitter battle the two had waged during the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Obama had specifically criticized Clinton's foreign policy credentials during the contests, and the initial idea of him appointing her had been so unexpected that she had told one of her own aides, [...] "Not in a million years." [...] However, {{it has been reported that}} Obama had been thinking of the idea as far back as the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Despite the aggressiveness of the campaign and the still-lingering animosities between the two campaign staffs, as with many primary battles, the political differences between the candidates were <b>never</b> <b>that</b> great, the two rivals had reportedly developed a respect for one another, and she had campaigned for him in the general election.|$|E

2500|$|Ghostface had a non-publicized {{feud with}} 50 Cent {{in the late}} 1990s and early 2000s. On 50 Cent's track [...] "How to Rob" [...] insults were aimed at many {{high-profile}} rappers, including Wu-Tang. In the early 2000s the argument made it on to wax with skits titled [...] "Clyde Smith" [...] on Supreme Clientele featuring a low-pitched recording of what most fans believe to be Raekwon's voice derisively making fun of 50 Cent's behavior and his methods of attracting attention to himself. The skit also joked at other unnamed [...] "gangster rappers" [...] in New York. 50 Cent took offense {{and came back with}} a short track dissing Wu-Tang Clan, and Ghostface in particular. That track was later reworked into the titled Too Hot with 50 rapping over a sample of Ghostface on Raekwon's album. 50 rose to fame, both he and Ghostface talked in interviews with SOHH.com and Hot 97 Radio about the supposed argument, both saying that the argument was <b>never</b> <b>that</b> serious and nothing major had happened.|$|E
