The model incorporates surface and bulk fields and includes a term in the free energy proportional to {{the square of the}} second derivative of the order parameter in addition to the usual term involving the square of the first derivative. In the limit of vanishing bulk field, three distinct types of surface ordering are possible: a wetting layer, a <b>non-wet</b> layer having a small deviation from bulk order, and a different <b>non-wet</b> layer with a large deviation from bulk order which decays non-monotonically as distance from the wall increases.

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} commercially available eyelid warming devices on ocular temperatures, tear film function, and meibomian glands in normal subjects and patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MethodsTen healthy volunteers were enrolled to {{evaluate the}} effects of a single warming and of repeated warming for 2 weeks. Ten MGD patients were enrolled for evaluation of repeated warming over 1 month. Two <b>non-wet</b> (Azuki no Chikara, Eye Hot R) and three wet (hot towel, Hot Eye Mask, Memoto Este) devices were compared in a masked manner. Visual analog scale (VAS) score for ocular symptoms, tear film breakup time (TFBUT), meibum grade, temperatures (eyelid skin, tarsal conjunctiva, central cornea), Schirmer test value, and meibomian gland area were measured before and after warming application. ResultsThe single application of the five warming devices improved the VAS score, TFBUT, and ocular temperatures. In the repeated warming application, Azuki no Chikara as a representative <b>non-wet</b> warming device induced a stable and significant improvement in TFBUT and increased the tarsal conjunctival temperature and meibomian gland area in both normal subjects and MGD patients. It also improved meibum grade in MGD patients. ConclusionOur results suggest that repeated eyelid warming with a <b>non-wet</b> device improves tear film function in normal individuals and may have beneficial effects on both tear film and meibomian gland function in MGD patients...|$|R

The influence of a chemical equilibrium reaction on the mass transfer through a wetted membrane was analysed mathematically (two-film concept).

40|$|The {{selective}} {{removal of}} H 2 S from gases containing several acidic components by absorption in aqueous alkanolamines {{is determined by}} the ratio of the partial mass transfer resistances in the gas and liquid phase and the solubility (physical and chemical) of these gases in the absorption liquid. The influence of the mass transfer resistances is experimentally studied in the present study. The simultaneous absorption of H 2 S and CO 2 in aqueous solutions of methyl-di-ethanol amine (MDEA) was studied in a stirred cell with flat, horizontal microporous wetted or <b>non-wetted</b> membranes which increase the partial mass transfer resistances in the liquid or gas phase, respectively. It was found that <b>non-wetted</b> membranes do not increase the H 2 S flux because the absorption rate determining mass transfer step which is located in the gas phase, is reduced, while the CO 2 transport is not affected significantly. Wetted membranes reduce the transport of the amine to the gas-liquid interface which introduces an additional transport limitation of the amine. Therefore the H 2 S and CO 2 flux are both determined by the mass transfer in the liquid phase which is generally not the case for H 2 S with a gas-liquid interface without a membrane. The introduction of a <b>non-wetted</b> membrane in the gas-liquid interface has no effect on the values of the liquid phase mass transfer coefficients, despite the different hydrodynamic situation at the interface. In this case however, a considerable difference was observed for the gas phase mass transfer coefficients. The influence of physical and chemical solubility is studied {{in the second part of}} the present paper in which a liquid membrane of pure MDEA is investigated. ...|$|R

An adsorption isotherm showing hysteresis is said to be of Type IV (for a wetting adsorbate) or Type V (for a <b>non-wetting</b> adsorbate), and hysteresis loops themselves are classified according to how symmetric the loop is.

50|$|Some {{atmospheric}} {{effects on the}} functionality of adhesive devices can be characterized by following the theory of surface energy and interfacial tension. It is known that γ12 = (1/2)W121 = (1/2)W212. If γ12 is high, then each species finds it favorable to cohere while in contact with a foreign species, rather than dissociate and mix with the other. If this is true, then it follows that when the interfacial tension is high, the force of adhesion is weak, since each species does not find it favorable to bond to the other. The interfacial tension of a liquid and a solid {{is directly related to}} the liquids wettability (relative to the solid), and thus one can extrapolate that cohesion increases in <b>non-wetting</b> liquids and decreases in wetting liquids. One example that verifies this is polydimethyl siloxane rubber, which has a work of self-adhesion of 43.6 mJ/m2 in air, 74 mJ/m2 in water (a nonwetting liquid) and 6 mJ/m2 in methanol (a wetting liquid).|$|E

Thus, a mass change of a core sample due to water imbibition is equal to a mass change of a core sample due to oil imbibition, because water or oil penetration of the porous media at any time is a function of a balance between gravity and capillary forces. The mass of water imbibed into a core sample is approximately equal to a mass of oil imbibed in the core sample core samples of a same rock type and dimensions, and for equal capillary forces; ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{contact angle}} is {{determined}} by solving the Young’s equation for the interfacial force balance. At equilibrium three interfacial tensions corresponding to solid/gas (γSG), solid/liquid (γSL), and liquid/gas (γLG) interfaces are counterbalanced. The consequence of the contact angle's magnitudes is known as wetting phenomena, which is important to characterize the capillary (pore) intrusion behavior. Degree of membrane surface wetting {{is determined by}} the contact angle. The surface with smaller contact angle has better wetting properties (θ=0°-perfect wetting). In some cases low surface tension liquids such as alcohols or surfactant solutions are used to enhance wetting of <b>non-wetting</b> membrane surfaces. [...] The membrane surface free energy (and related hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity) influences membrane particle adsorption or fouling phenomena. In most membrane separation processes (especially bioseparations), higher surface hydrophilicity corresponds to the lower fouling. Synthetic membrane fouling impairs membrane performance. As a consequence, a wide variety of membrane cleaning techniques have been developed. Sometimes fouling is irreversible, and the membrane needs to be replaced. Another feature of membrane surface chemistry is surface charge. The presence of the charge changes the properties of the membrane-liquid interface. The membrane surface may develop an electrokinetic potential and induce the formation of layers of solution particles which tend to neutralize the charge.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work OPC and OPC/slag {{concretes}} {{were exposed to}} elevated temperatures, 400 and 800 °C. The critical temperature of 400 °C has been reported for OPC paste. Above 400 °C, the paste hydrate Ca(OH) 2 dehydrates into CaO causing the OPC paste to shrink and crack. After cooling and {{in the presence of}} air moisture, CaO rehydrates into Ca(OH) 2, resulting in disintegration due to re-expansion of OPC paste. Therefore, the present work assessed whether this also applies to OPC concretes. Two cooling methods were used: furnace and water cooling. Following the heat treatment/cooling method, compressive tests and Infrared (IR) spectroscopic studies were conducted. Results showed that after 400 °C, water cooling caused all concrete, regardless of the type of blended cement binder, a further 20 % loss in the residual strength. After 800 °C, water cooling caused OPC concrete a further 14 % loss while slag blends presented around 5 % loss. IR indicated that the further loss observed in the OPC concrete is due to the accelerated CaO rehydration into Ca(OH) 2. Afterward, the <b>non-wetted</b> furnace cooled specimens were exposed to air moisture for one week, resulting in further strength loss of 13 %. IR results suggested that slow rehydration of CaO occur with exposure to air moisture. In conclusion, water cooling caused more damage in OPC concrete, while the concrete that has not been wetted undergoes progressive deterioration. This indicates a need to monitor the <b>non-wetted</b> concrete after a fire event has occurred for potential further deterioration...|$|R
