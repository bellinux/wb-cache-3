[...] "I was just {{thinking}} of her," [...] he confesses pleasantly; [...] "Miss Plym is so <b>nice</b> <b>and</b> plump, so <b>comforting</b> <b>and</b> domestic--such a perfect clergyman's daughter. You love her, don't you? Is she engaged to be married? In that case--between ourselves, dear Miss Wyvil, a clergyman is obliged to be cautious--I may own that I love her too." ...|$|R

However, London feels like our musical birthplace. It inspires art in a way no other city has." [...] She enjoys her returns to Australia: [...] "It's really good. It's really <b>nice</b> <b>and</b> warm <b>and</b> <b>comforting.</b> You know, {{to come back to}} a place and it's sunny and it's friendly and your friends and family are all there - it's a really nice combination." ...|$|R

How {{completely}} the fawning old wretch took me in--with all {{my knowledge of}} the world, too! He was so <b>nice</b> <b>and</b> sympathetic--such a <b>comforting</b> contrast, on that occasion, {{to you and your}} husband--I declare I forgot every reason I had for not trusting him. Ah, we women are poor creatures--we may own it among ourselves. If a man only has <b>nice</b> manners <b>and</b> a pleasant voice, how many of us can resist him? Even Romayne imposed upon me--assisted by his property, which in some degree excuses my folly. There is nothing to be done now, Stella, but to humor him. Do as that detestable priest does, and trust to your beauty (there isn't as much of it left as I could wish) to turn the scale in your favor. Have you any idea when the new convert will come back? I heard him ordering a fish dinner for himself, yesterday--because it was Friday. Did you join him at dessert-time, profanely supported by meat? What did he say?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Satisfaction and {{enjoyment}} comes {{for a man}} with possession of a beautiful woman. Men marry because of the peaceful gathering, love, <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> they often get <b>nice</b> <b>and</b> attractive women. But the men do not give the women full satisfaction The reason is due to the ignorance of the writings of the Kamashastra and the disdain of the different types of women. These men view women only from the perspective of an animal. They are foolish and spiritless".|$|R

40|$|Subjects {{were exposed}} to {{sequences}} of partial-body cooling and warming {{over a period of}} three hours. Skin temperatures, core temperature, thermal sensation, <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> responses were collected for nineteen local body parts, and for the whole body. This paper relates local thermal sensations <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> to skin <b>and</b> core temperatures, and examines how the thermal sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> perceived for individual body parts affect thermal sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> perceived for the whole body.

30|$|The {{method to}} assess the {{mobility}} <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> impacts of ITS on vulnerable road users was developed from the method introduced by Kulmala (2010), initially developed {{for the assessment of}} safety impacts of ITS for cars. The method for mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> impact assessment followed the steps defined by Kulmala (2010), but when assessing mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> numbers 1 – 5 (<b>comfort)</b> <b>and</b> 6 – 8 (mobility) were of interest. The method was enhanced and adjusted to take into consideration the mobility <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> of vulnerable road users covering: mobility and exposure of vulnerable road users measured in: trip length, duration <b>and</b> frequency; <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> of vulnerable road users measured in: how the users perceive their travel, i.e., change their opinion regarding the comfort of the travel undertaken, and perceived safety in relation to traffic.|$|R

In cool environments, {{hands and feet}} feel colder than other body parts. The head, insensitive to cold but sensitive to warm, feels warmer {{than the rest of}} the body in warm environments. Overall sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> follow the warmest local sensation (head) in warm environments and the coldest (hands and feet) in cool environments. Subjects evaluate neutral conditions as “comfortable”, never “very comfortable”, and overshoot of sensation <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> during wholebody step-changes is small...|$|R

The protection <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> requirements are always the contradicting fact in several protective clothing including fire-fighters’. Appropriate material selection, clothing design and final evaluation of the results {{play a critical role in}} predicting the clothing performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort.</b> Several researches have been done on the performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> improvement of fire-fighter’s protective clothing. However, detailed review related to these parameters is not being reported in recent years.

The clothing design and different materials used to achieve a balance between performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> is illustrated. Various test standards related to the performance <b>and</b> <b>comfort</b> is also being discussed. In addition, the future scopes and challenges while designing tomorrows advanced protective clothing are cited. This would provide a guideline in terms of <b>comfort</b> <b>and</b> performance while developing and designing the fire-fighter protective clothing for different climatic conditions.|$|R
