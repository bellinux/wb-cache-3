5|$|In 1889, the South Beach Branch was {{extended}} from Arrochar to a <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> at South Beach. In 1897, the terminal at Saint George, which served the railroad and the ferry to Manhattan, was completed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1910s, a {{completely}} reconstructed New West End Terminal (which gradually became {{better known as}} Coney Island Terminal) was built on an elevated structure. The <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> unified the terminals {{of most of the}} former steam railroad lines terminating at Coney Island, aside from the Long Island Rail Road-controlled New York and Manhattan Beach Railway. This <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> could accommodate hundreds of thousands of passengers a day. This project entailed rerouting the Brighton and Culver Lines from a ground-level alignment to an elevated structure with four tracks and eight platforms.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> emergence, such as smartphones, tablet {{personal}} computers and smart TVs, on telecommunications carriers and TV media companies. We choose event study methodology to analyze this research. Our research question is Does the emergence of <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> generate significant imact on the telecommunications carriers and the TV media companies? The {{results show that the}} impacts of <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> appear differently on telecommunications carriers and on TV media companies. 1) Regarding telecommunications carriers, some of the smartphone and tablet PCs generate significant positive imapct or no impact on smartphoner (or tablet PC) -affiliated telecom carriers, but generate significant negative impact on non-smartphone (or tablet PC) -related telecom carriers, 2) Regarding TV media companies, tablet PCs and smart TVs do not generate any significant impact on any researched TV medeia companies. The results imply some further reasons why the <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> emergences generate no significant imapct on TV media companies. The paper presents three possible reasons. 1) The <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> are not so powerful that they do not influence TV media companies. 2) The <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> are sufficiently powerful but their imapct does not go to the TV industry. 3) The <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> are sufficiently powerful but the services by the <b>new</b> <b>terminals</b> do not compete against incumbent TV media services.

50|$|Terminals 4, 5 and 6 will be {{built at}} a later stage, which will be {{triggered}} by growth in traffic, and once completed, all international flights will move to these three <b>new</b> <b>terminals,</b> while Terminal 3 will then solely be used for handling domestic air traffic.

5|$|In 1966, the Gulf Oil Corporation {{identified}} Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay, Ireland, {{as being}} the most suitable site for the <b>new</b> <b>terminal.</b> Whiddy Island offered a long, sheltered, deep-water anchorage. Furthermore, it was well away from any major population centres and shipping lanes. Construction started in 1967 and the terminal was completed in 1969.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the terminal was opposed by {{the residents of the}} Turtle Bay neighborhood, where it was planned to be located in, as it would have changed the character of their neighborhood. Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown that Third Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> under Third Avenue.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity. This plan included {{the building of a}} <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost factor is that a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the previously announced alignment of the Thomson-East Coast Line, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying whether to extend the TEL from Sungei Bedok station to the future Changi Airport Terminal 5, and then connecting to the existing Changi Airport MRT station on the East-West Line. With such an extension, {{there will be a}} direct connection between Changi Airport and the city. Its length is still being decided.

5|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, McCarran Field served over 35,000 passengers. As Las Vegas' casino {{industry}} grew and air travel became more popular during the 1950s, passenger traffic to the airfield rose significantly, with 959,603 passengers transiting through it in 1959. To cope with the increase, airport officials began planning a new passenger terminal. While the original terminal was located on Las Vegas Boulevard, the <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> was built on Paradise Road. The terminal, whose design {{was inspired by the}} TWA Flight Center in New York City, opened on March 15, 1963.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, and briefly made the SIRT profitable. During the second World War, all of the east coast {{military}} hospital trains were handled by the SIRT, with some trains stopping at Arlington on Staten Island to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The need to transport war material, POW trains, and troops, made the stretch of the Baltimore & New York Railway between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill extremely busy. The B also operated special trains for important officials such as Winston Churchill. On June 25, 1946, a fire wrecked the terminal at Saint George killing three people, injuring twenty-two people, and causing damage worth $22,000,000. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal and the four slips used for Manhattan service, the terminal for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains. Normal service was not restored until July 13, 1946. Bids to build a temporary terminal went out on August 21, 1946. The construction of a replacement terminal was promised by Mayor William O'Dwyer on February 10, 1948. The <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> opened on June 8, 1951, with ferry, bus and rail service all within one building. Previous portions of the terminal were phased into service at earlier dates. The <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> cost $23 million.|$|E
5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by state spending. Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business assistance that poured money into the city. To entice businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of the bars favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business to the location. This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A <b>new</b> <b>terminal</b> built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E
