5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of <b>Non-Self-Governing</b> <b>Territories</b> in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed {{to move out of}} their reserve areas. This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Charter {{contains}} a Declaration Concerning <b>Non-Self-Governing</b> <b>Territories.</b> In Chapter XI, of said charter, the ¨Declaration Regarding Non-Self-Governing Territories¨, specifically the Article 73 point ¨e¨ in the Charter, it states that all member States agree {{to report to}} the United Nations, annually, on the development of <b>non-self-governing</b> <b>territories</b> under their control. The initial List of <b>Non-Self-Governing</b> <b>Territories</b> was created by compiling lists of dependent territories submitted by the administering States themselves. In several instances, administering States were later allowed to remove dependent territories from the list, either unilaterally (as in the case of many French overseas departments and territories), or by vote of the General Assembly (as in the cases of Puerto Rico, Greenland, the Netherlands Antilles, and Suriname).|$|E
