Complexity explains many principals pertaining to self-organization, non-linearity, interaction, cybernetic feedback, discontinuity, emergence, and stability in food webs. Nestedness, for example, is defined as [...] "a pattern of interaction in which specialists interact with species that form perfect subsets of the species with which generalists interact", [...] "—that is, the diet of the most specialized species is a subset of the diet of the next more generalized species, and its diet a subset of the next more generalized, and so on." [...] Until recently, it was thought that food webs had little <b>nested</b> <b>structure,</b> but empirical evidence shows that many published webs have nested subwebs in their assembly.|$|E

Comparison to fossil and modern nests suggests that Socialites tumulus is more similar to nests produced by ants than by termites. This trace fossil preserves rare, tangible evidence of nest construction by social insects during the Late Cretaceous, adding new information on insect diversity and habitat utilization in Mesozoic terrestrial ecosystems.

50|$|In the {{previous}} section, one switches {{back and forth}} between a basis and its mirror image. Duality theorists take this concept further. They work at rephrasing the totality of science in terms of mirror images. The main idea is expressed in lattice theory. If there exists a set of <b>nested</b> <b>structures,</b> then there exists an algebra as well, with union and intersection playing the role of algebraic operations. Now if one reverses the role of the operations, and also reverses the <b>nesting</b> <b>structure,</b> then one has a dual structure.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the group lasso problem, where features are grouped into disjoint blocks, {{it may be the}} case that grouped features are overlapping or have a <b>nested</b> <b>structure.</b> Such generalizations of group lasso have been considered in a variety of contexts.

5000|$|Interaction {{strength}} may decrease {{with the}} number of links between species, damping the effects of any disturbance and cascading extinctions are less likely in compartmentalized networks, as effects of species losses are limited to the original compartment. [...] Furthermore, as long as the most connected species are unlikely to go extinct, network persistence increases with connectance and nestedness. No consensus on the links between network nestedness and community stability in mutualistic species has however been reached among several investigations in recent years. Recent findings suggest that a trade-off between different types of stability may exist. The <b>nested</b> <b>structure</b> of mutualisitic networks was shown to promote the capacity of species to persist under increasingly harsh circumstances. Most likely, because the <b>nested</b> <b>structure</b> of mutualistic networks helps species to indirectly support each other when circumstances are harsh. This indirect facilitation helps species to survive, but it also means that under harsh circumstances one species cannot survive without the support of the other. As circumstances become increasingly harsh, a tipping point may therefore be passed at which the populations {{of a large number of}} species may collapse simultaneously.|$|E
40|$|Capsule: Bearded Reedlings Panurus biarmicus show {{consistent}} nest timing, select old, compacted {{areas of}} reed when positioning their nests, and may adjust <b>nest</b> <b>structure</b> {{in relation to}} local reed characteristics and temperature. Aims: To investigate the nest timing, nest site selection and <b>nest</b> <b>structure</b> of a rare and elusive passerine, the Bearded Reedling at the northern limit of this species’ range. Methods: A sample of Bearded Reedling nests from the Tay Reedbeds in Scotland were located and monitored {{with regard to the}} timing of nesting, fate, fine-scale habitat characteristics and <b>nest</b> <b>structure.</b> Results: First egg dates and brood sizes were consistent between years of the study despite variation in spring temperatures. Bearded Reedlings nested within unmanaged patches of reed, positively selecting deep leaf litters and compacted reed. Attributes of <b>nest</b> <b>structure,</b> namely internal and external diameter, were influenced by nest site characteristics and local temperature. Conclusion: Despite a limited sample size, the study suggests that reedbed management should ensure adequate areas of old, dry and unmanaged reed are available when aiming to encourage breeding Bearded Reedlings. Additionally, the apparently flexible <b>structure</b> of the <b>nest</b> may assist this species when coping with changeable climatic conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{longitudinal}} studies has increased steadily in various social science disciplines {{over the last}} decade. Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) has emerged among the new approaches for analyzing longitudinal data. It {{can be viewed as}} a combination of Hierarchical Linear Modeling, Latent Growth Curve Modeling and Finite Mixture Modeling. The combination of both continuous and categorical latent variables makes GMM a flexible analysis procedure. However, when researchers analyze their data using GMM, some may assume that the units are independent of each other even though it may not always be the case. The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the impact of ignoring a higher <b>nesting</b> <b>structure</b> in Multilevel Growth Mixture Modeling on the accuracy of classification of individuals and the accuracy on tests of significance (i. e., Type I error rate and statistical power) of the parameter estimates for the model in each subpopulation. Two simulation studies were conducted. In the first study, the impact of misspecifying the multilevel mixture model is investigated by ignoring a level of <b>nesting</b> <b>structure</b> in cross-sectional data. In the second study, longitudinal clustered data (e. g., repeated measures nested within units and units nested within clusters) are analyzed correctly and with a misspecification ignoring the highest level of the <b>nesting</b> <b>structure.</b> Results indicate that ignoring a higher level <b>nesting</b> <b>structure</b> results in lower classification accuracy, less accurate fixed effect estimates, inflation of lower-level variance estimates, and less accurate standard error estimates, the latter result which in turn affects the accuracy of tests of significance for the fixed effects. The magnitude of the intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficient has a substantial impact when a higher level <b>nesting</b> <b>structure</b> is ignored; the higher the ICC, the more variance at the highest level is ignored, and the worse the performance of the model. The implication for applied researchers is that it is important to model the multilevel data structure in (growth) mixture modeling. In addition, researchers should be cautious in interpreting their results if ignoring a higher level <b>nesting</b> <b>structure</b> is inevitable. Limitations concerning appropriate use of latent class analysis in growth modeling include unknown effects of incorrect estimation of the number of latent classes, non-normal distribution effects, and different growth patterns within-group and between-group...|$|R

Therefore, we compare the results of nine <b>nesting</b> <b>structures</b> andfindthat the variation in welfare estimates across the models is not large.

50|$|The main {{function}} of the concept module is to generate the concepts of the currentbinary context and construct the corresponding lattice and <b>nested</b> <b>structure</b> (see Figures 2 and 3). It provides the user with basic operators such as projection,selection, and exact search as well as advanced features like pair approximation.Some known algorithms are included in this module such as Bordat’s procedure, Godin’s algorithm and NextClosure algorithm. The approximation feature implemented in Lattice Miner is based on thefollowing idea: given a pair (X,Y) where X ⊆ G, and Y ⊆ M, is there a set offormal concepts (Ai,Bi) which are “close to” (X,Y)? To answer this question, The tool starts to identify the type of couple that the pair (X,Y) represents. It can be a formal concept, a protoconcept, a semiconcept or a preconcept. In the last case, the approximationis given by the interval (X",X′),(Y′,Y") and highlighted in the line diagram.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} of {{pollination}} networks is their nested design. A study of 52 mutualist networks (including plant-pollinator interactions and plant-seed disperser interactions) {{found that most}} of the networks were nested. This means that the core of the network is made up of highly connected generalists (a pollinator that visits many different species of plant), while specialized species interact with a subset of the species that the generalists interact with (a pollinator that visits few species of plant, which are also visited by generalist pollinators). As the number of interactions in a network increases, the degree of nestedness increases as well. One property that results from <b>nested</b> <b>structure</b> of pollination networks is an asymmetry in specialization, where specialist species are often interacting {{with some of the most}} generalized species. This is in contrast to the idea of reciprocal specialization, where specialist pollinators interact with specialist plants. Similar to the relationship between network complexity and network nestedness, the amount of asymmetry in specialization increases as the number of interactions increases.|$|E
