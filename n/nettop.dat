50|$|Unlike its predecessors, the Q150 also {{included}} Wi-Fi b/g/n. Ports on the <b>nettop</b> {{were available for}} HDMI, VGA, two USB, Ethernet, and audio input and output. A stand was provided to support the <b>nettop,</b> and a VESA mount was provided as an alternative, so the <b>nettop</b> could be kept behind a TV or a monitor.|$|E
50|$|The Q100 <b>nettop</b> was {{slightly}} larger than a typical external hard disk drive, with a plastic stand {{to allow it to}} remain upright. The <b>nettop</b> was equipped with a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N230 processor, which was designed for low power consumption rather than processing power. The <b>nettop</b> also included 1GB of DDR2-667 RAM, and a 160GB hard disk drive. While the storage space was limited, PCWorld indicated that this was common in other, similar nettops, citing the Acer Aspire Revo 3610 and the MSI Wind <b>Nettop</b> CS120 as examples. While the <b>nettop</b> had four USB ports and a Gigabit Ethernet port there was no optical drive, and a mouse and keyboard {{were not included in the}} price. The Q100 could support a single VGA monitor. In its review of the <b>nettop,</b> PCWorld gave the PC one of five stars and indicated that it made a netbook seem like a better option.|$|E
50|$|These nettops are {{designed}} to be extremely compact processing units. A <b>nettop</b> is a desktop computer that uses the same (or similar) components found in netbook PCs. The first <b>nettop</b> in the IdeaCentre Q series was the Q100, launched in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The IdeaCentre Q Series PCs from Lenovo are {{a series}} of <b>nettops</b> meant {{primarily}} for home and personal use. The Q Series <b>nettops</b> are described by the manufacturer as being multimedia-oriented <b>nettops.</b> Comparing the size to a typical paperback book, Lenovo describes the Q Series <b>nettops</b> as the smallest desktops in production. The general features of the Q Series desktops are the small size, low energy requirements, ability to play HD video, and low noise levels.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nettops</b> {{fall into}} Intel's {{category}} of [...] "Basic PC", which usually cost from $100 to $299. Intel describes <b>nettops</b> {{as a large}} potential market. <b>Nettops</b> can serve as an affordable first computer for people in developing countries, or as an environmentally friendly choice as a secondary computer for people in developed countries.|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{ordinary}} desktop computers, <b>nettops</b> {{are not only}} smaller and cheaper, but they also consume much less power. For example, CompuLab's fit-PC2 consumes no more than 8 watts of power whereas a typical desktop would easily consume more than 100 watts of power; consequently, <b>nettops</b> require significantly less cooling and may even be completely fanless. Some {{do not have an}} optical disk drive and use a solid state disk, making them completely silent. The tradeoff is that the hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make <b>nettops</b> less appropriate for running complex or resource-intensive applications.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 2010, the IdeaCentre Q150 was a <b>nettop</b> {{like its}} predecessors: the Q100 and the Q110. In its {{review of the}} <b>nettop,</b> SlashGear {{described}} it as “a great little media PC that serves up high definition content with minimal fuss.” ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>nettop</b> (or {{miniature}} PC, Mini PC or Smart Micro PC) is a small-sized, inexpensive, low-power, legacy-free {{desktop computer}} designed for basic {{tasks such as}} Internet surfing, accessing web-based applications, document processing, and audio/video playback. The word <b>nettop</b> is a portmanteau of Internet and desktop.|$|E
50|$|Both the <b>NetTop</b> and Trusted Multi-Net {{solutions}} {{have been}} approved for use. In addition, Trusted Computer Solutions has developed a thin-client product, originally based on the <b>NetTop</b> technology concepts through a licensing agreement with NSA. This product is called SecureOffice(r) Trusted Thin Client(tm), and runs on the LSPP configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 5 (RHEL5).|$|E
50|$|A subtype of desktops, called <b>nettops,</b> was {{introduced}} by Intel in February 2008, characterized by low cost and lean functionality. A similar subtype of laptops (or notebooks) is the netbook, described below. The product line features the new Intel Atom processor, which specifically enables <b>nettops</b> to consume less power and fit into small enclosures.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{platforms}} that are primarily intended for <b>nettops</b> and netbooks: ...|$|R
5000|$|Bay Trail {{consumer}} SoCs {{aimed at}} tablets, hybrid devices, netbooks, <b>nettops,</b> and embedded/automotive systems ...|$|R
5000|$|Asus Express Gate motherboards, notebooks, Eee Box (<b>nettop),</b> and EeePCs (based on Splashtop) ...|$|E

50|$|On 2 March 2008, Intel {{announced}} lower-power {{variants of}} the Diamondville CPU named Atom N2xx. It {{was intended for}} use in <b>nettops</b> and the Classmate PC. Like their predecessors, these are single-core CPUs with Hyper-Threading.|$|R
50|$|Launched in mid-2009, the Q700 was the Q Series third <b>nettop</b> from Lenovo {{released}} in that year. Unlike the Q100 and the Q110, the Q700 featured an Intel Pentium Dual Core E5700 processor, 4GB RAM, and Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X4500 integrated graphics. The Q700 measured 2.36 x 7.87 x 9.84 inches, {{and could be}} equipped with up to a 640GB hard disk drive. A HDMI output port was also present, as well as options for Wi-Fi b/g, a TV tuner, and different version of Windows Vista. The front of the <b>nettop</b> included four USB 2.0 ports, a slot-loading DVD writer, a four-in-one media card reader, as well as headphone and microphone jacks.
