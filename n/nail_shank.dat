50|$|The {{protective}} {{nature of}} asphalt shingles primarily {{comes from the}} long-chain hydrocarbons impregnating the paper. Over time in the hot sun, the hydrocarbons soften and when rain falls the hydrocarbons are gradually washed out of the shingles and down onto the ground. Along eaves and complex rooflines more water is channeled so in these areas the loss occurs more quickly. Eventually {{the loss of the}} heavy oils causes the fibers to shrink, exposing the nail heads under the shingle flaps. The shrinkage also breaks up the surface coating of sand adhered {{to the surface of the}} paper, and eventually causes the paper to begin to tear itself apart. Once the nail heads are exposed, water running down the roof can seep into the building around the <b>nail</b> <b>shank,</b> resulting in rotting of roof building materials and causing moisture damage to ceilings and paint inside.|$|E
30|$|We used a {{two-dimensional}} {{finite element method}} to analyze the load-slip characteristics of nailed wooden joints sheathed with a panel. We used tests of nail bending, <b>nail</b> <b>shank</b> embedment in a wood or a panel, nail-head embedment in a face of a panel, nail withdrawing from a wood, friction between a wood and a panel, and initial axial forces of the nails. The values of the material properties for the analytical models were determined with the above tests. With a conventional one-dimensional analysis {{it is impossible to}} evaluate the shearing performance accurately because the axial forces of the nail are not calculated. Therefore, we used two-dimensional geometric nonlinear analysis. The computed load-slip curves closely matched the original experimental results; and when the friction and initial axial forces were considered, the computed curves were more likely to match the original experimental results. Our results suggested that it is better to use geometric nonlinear analysis to analyze the shearing characteristics of nailed joints, and that friction and axial forces are important factors for accurate analysis.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{mechanical}} durability of wood-based panels, roof sheathing panels {{that had been used}} in a model house for nine and a half years were collected and investigated for deterioration of lateral nail resistance (LNR), nail head pull-through resistance (NHPT), internal bond strength (IB), bending strength (MOR), and bending stiffness (MOE). The roof sheathing panels used are an aspen oriented strand board (OSB(A)), a Scots pine orieted strand board (OSB(P)), a phenol-formaldehyde resin bonded particleboard (PB(PF)), a methylene diphenyl diisocyanate resin bonded particleboard (PB(MDI)), a melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin bonded medium density fiberboard, and a structural plywood. The panel moisture content through the year ranged from around 6 to 11 %, which was estimated based on the equilibrium moisture contents of each panel and the attic temperature and humidity. Due to such arid conditions, there was no significant deterioration of MOR or MOE in any of the panels. There was some deterioration in IB, however, except in OSB(P) and PB(PF) which showed the largest IB reduction of 21 to 25 %. In connection with this decrease in IB, the LNR of PB(PF) exhibited a statistically significant reduction of 24 %, while other panels showed no significantly reduced by 6 to 26 % according to the panel type. The factors that affect NHPT were investigated by conducting some additional tests in terms of panel upper surface demage caused by nail-head pressing, panel lower surface damage caused by nailing, repeated heating of nails caused by high temperatures in excess of 80 ℃ on the roof surface especially in summer, and so on. From the test results it was found that part of the reduction in NHPT was explicable by the damage to the upper panel surface below the nail head, and the rest could be potentially explained by dew condensation on the <b>nail</b> <b>shanks,</b> which affects bond strength between panel elements surrounding <b>nail</b> <b>shanks...</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite {{solid element}} model for Japanese traditional post-and-beam connections was developed using the wood foundation method, which employed {{the concept of}} a beam on a nonlinear foundation. The wood foundation in the model was a three-dimensionally prescribed zone surrounding a <b>nail</b> <b>shank</b> in order to address the intricate wood crushing behavior induced by nail slip. Material models for the wood members and the foundation were developed based on the transversely isotropic plasticity from the software package ANSYS. The Japanese post-and-beam connection modeled was a ten-nail multiple connection with a mortise and tenon joint and is called the CPT (Corner Plate, T-shaped) connection. Details of the model development are presented. As a feasibility study, blind predictions of the model were compared with available connection test data and showed good results for predicting the progress of the load-deformation relations in three dimensions. However, the limitation of the model was found in simulating fracture failures such as wood splitting or nail tear-out from the wood. Model applications and the need for model improvement are discussed.|$|E

The cat's paw is well designed for demolition work, but because it tears up the wood around the nailhead, it should not be used for finish work.|$|R

40|$|The {{roofing nail}} is an {{important}} and often a limiting factor in successfully using metal building sheets. This study has been directed toward {{an analysis of the}} problems involved and the comparative performance of typical special nails offered commercially for fastening building sheets. All nails used for fastening steel sheets exposed to the weather should have a protective coating such as galvanizing, and a head which will exclude moisture from the hole made by the nail. The tendency of nails to 2 ̆ 2 creep 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 or move outward without any apparent cause, thus necessitating renailing, has been a troublesome problem. No definite conclusions have been reached regarding the causes of this phenomenon, but some suggestions are offered for its remedy. Forces exerted by the wind and by the expansion and contraction of the metal due to changes in temperature may have some influence in loosening the nail. Creeping of nails from asphalt roofing and from boxes, however, shows that internal forces are probably of major importance. These may be the minute changes in dimension and character of the wood as it absorbs or gives up moisture. Screw <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> probably creep less than plain <b>shank</b> <b>nails,</b> and it appears that ring <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> will not creep.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Threaded nails {{are used}} in wood {{construction}} because of their superior performance, but relatively few tests have been conducted on nails larger than 12 d (3. 76 mm diameter). Experience has suggested that threaded nail withdrawal design values are too conservative. The Forest Products Laboratory and Washington State University have been cooperatively characterizing the strength of threaded nails over a range of wood species and nail types. This paper focuses on the immediate withdrawal strength of annularly threaded nails in Douglas Fir and Spruce-Pine-Fir, helically threaded nails in Southern Pine, and smooth nails in Southern Pine and Spruce-Pine-Fir lumber. Average withdrawal strength of threaded nails was {{greater than that of}} smooth <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> of the same diameter. In comparison of experimental withdrawal strength to existing design proce-dures for assigning allowable withdrawal strength design values, annular <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> showed the greatest dif-ference. Withdrawal strengths of nails from five different manufacturers were not significantly different. Com-parisons of the effect of galvanizing on withdrawal strength were inconclusive...|$|R

50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full head nail guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped head so the nails can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip head nails are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full Round Head <b>nails</b> and ring <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of steel-to-timber joints with annular-ringed <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> is investigated using numerical modelling and a component approach. These joints {{are used in}} Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) buildings to anchor metal connectors such as hold-downs and angle brackets to the timber panels. At first, a general hysteresis model is introduced, where a single fastener joint is schematized as an elasto-plastic beam embedded in a non-linear medium with a compression-only behaviour. A second hysteresis model is then presented, where the {{mechanical behaviour}} of the joint is simulated by a non-linear spring with three degrees of freedom. Both models are calibrated on the design rules prescribed by the reference standards. Moreover, average strength capacities are determined from the corresponding characteristic values assuming a standard normal distribution and suitable coefficients of variation. As first applicative examples of the proposed models, shear tests are simulated on single steel-to-timber joints with annular-ringed <b>shank</b> <b>nails</b> and on a connection made of an angle bracket and sixty nails. The scatter of mechanical properties in steel-to-timber joints is also {{taken into account in}} the simulations and a stochastic approach is proposed, demonstrating acceptable accuracy...|$|R

25|$|Starting at {{the bottom}} of the <b>nail,</b> the ring <b>shanks</b> on the lower half of the nail are {{enhanced}} with angular barbs, which add maximum resistance to the nail being pulled out. The middle of the nail has no extra features, which leaves the section most likely to be damaged during an earthquake thicker and least prone to damage. The area directly below the head of the nail features a spiral-style shank used to enhance the nail's strength in holding boards together. This enhancement keeps boards that are nailed together from moving around under nature's forces and overall weakening the joints. The final feature of this nail is the nail head, which is 25% larger than the average, allowing it to be more resistant to being pulled completely through attached pieces of wood.|$|R
40|$|Connections in wood {{have been}} {{investigated}} and advanced ever since the ground-breaking work of Johansen {{in the early nineteenth}} century. Nevertheless, not much investigation has been undertaken on the existence of load-displacement path dependency in a sheathing-to-framing connection.

This work uses 3 D Finite Element beam-on-foundation models of an Oriented Strand Board (OSB/ 2) sheathing nailed to a C 24 wood framing, to study possible strategies to numerically simulate the displacement path dependency. The models are used to study if non-linear elastic or elastic-plastic embedment properties of an annular-ringed <b>shank</b> <b>nail</b> in the wood-based materials bring about the path dependency using Connector elements in combination with different material models in the FE software Abaqus.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental programme on Simpson Strong-Tie annular ringed <b>shank</b> <b>nails,</b> {{conducted at the}} Institute of Timber Engineering and Wood Technology, Graz University of Technology. The fastener under investigation is commonly used in cross-laminated timber (CLT) buildings to anchor typical metal connectors to the timber panels, and the understanding of its performances {{is of particular interest}} for the design of earthquake resistant timber structures. Shear tests in parallel and perpendicular direction to the face lamination of a CLT panel, and withdrawal tests, investigated the bearing capacity of a nail driven in the plane side of a CLT element. Furthermore, uniaxial tension tests and bending tests were performed on single fasteners to determine the ultimate tensile strength and the yielding moment, respectively. Mean and characteristic values of the mechanical properties were assessed in terms of strength, stiffness and ductility, and compared with the simplified calculation methods provided by the standards. Finally, a numerical model of the connection, considered as a non-linear spring with three degrees of freedom, is presented and calibrated on the experimental results. As an applicative example, the numerical model is used to simulate a shear and a tension test of a Simpson Strong-Tie AE 116 angle bracket...|$|R

Two 12. 7 mm GWB panels were installed oriented vertically on the face opposite the OSB using standard dry wall screws on some walls. Anchorage to the walls was provided by two 12. 7 mm A 307 anchor bolts installed 305 mm inward on the sill plate from each end of the wall. In addition to these anchor bolts, walls included hold-downs installed at the end studs of the wall and were attached to the foundation with 15. 9 mm Grade 5 anchor bolts making the walls fully anchored. The loading was monotonic and based on ASTM E 564 - 00. Sixteen walls were tested in total, out of which 11 (Type A) were sheathed on both sides with OSB and GWB, while 5 walls were tested without GWB (Type B). Optical measurement equipment based on the principle of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used for data acquisition and analysis. DIC is a full-field, non-contact technique for measurement of displacements and strains. The set up consist of a pair of cameras arranged at an angle to take stereoscopic images of the specimen. The system returns full field 3 D displacement and strain data measured over the visible specimen surfaces. The tests revealed that load is shared by both OSB and GWB initially in a shear wall assembly. GWB fails locally prior to OSB and load shifts to OSB as GWB starts to fail. Beyond this point, load continues to increase and walls finally fail in OSB. The tests also revealed that load path in wall type A and B is different. Failure in wall type A starts at the uplift corner in GWB and then moves to the uplift corner in OSB. Finally the walls fail at middle of top plate for GWB and OSB both. In wall type B the failure is initiated at the uplift corner in OSB followed by middle region at sill level and ends up at middle section of wall where two panels meet. The uplift corner fasteners are of prime importance in both types of wall and panels. Comparing the strain profiles created using DIC, strains only near fasteners are observed and no detectable strain is observed in the field of the panel. There is a steady built up of strain in wall type B from start to failure and there is no abrupt change in strain during entire loading indicating a ductile failure. Wall type B shows more ductile behavior than wall type A because of the lack of ability of GWB to deform at higher load in wall type A where as OSB in wall type B continues to deform at higher load. Also OSB panel in wall type B experiences higher strains than the OSB panel for wall type A for a given load. In wall type A, there is higher strain around the fasteners in GWB than in OSB in the initial part of loading. GWB is stiffer than OSB, it attracts load and in turn deformation is higher than OSB. But being brittle, GWB fails at around 60...|$|R
