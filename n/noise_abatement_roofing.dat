40|$|As part of {{the planned}} {{expansion}} work of the motorway A 8 between Rosenheim and Salzburg and the associated legal opportunity to develop new traffic noise protection measures, this study investigated properties of sustainable <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> in a community next to the A 8. A two-stage empirical survey was conducted integrating a citizen and an expert Delphi survey. The {{results show that the}} noise from the motorway heavily affects {{the quality of life in}} health, economic and ecological respects. Sustainable <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> should take into consideration ecological and social aspects like landscape integration and contribution to local development due to the unique location of the municipality. Enclosed motorway canopies are particularly beneficial to meet these criteria. The costs for sustainable <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> measures should be weighted as less important; however, financial costs are crucial for the federal government due to the requirements of the Federal Pollution Control Act. Hence, residents and experts assume that noise barriers as the cheaper <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> measures will be implemented. However, the results of the study and the latest developments in the expansion plans suggest that the implementation of enclosed motorway canopies, which go beyond the legal requirements, is feasible through extensive citizen participation and community-specific planning...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : A high {{prevalence}} of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is observed amongst {{employees in the}} steel manufacturing industry. OBJECTIVE : To determine the {{prevalence of}} NIHL and current <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> techniques implemented at a steel manufacturing plant. METHODS : Structured questionnaires were completed by permanent employees at a steel-manufacturing plant {{for the purpose of}} collecting information on occupational and medical histories, noise exposure in and outside the work environment, use of hearing protection devices (HPDs), and current <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> procedures. A walk-through survey was also conducted to observe implemented <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> techniques using the Noise Induced Hearing Loss Regulations of 2003 as a guideline. RESULTS : A total of 17. 9 % of workers suffered from NIHL (95 % CI 11. 8 % - 22. 5 %). Administrative controls, lubrication and mufflers were identified by more than 70 % of the respondents as control procedures most often implemented by the company. Most of the respondents (77 %) used HPDs always and 97 % indicated that they fit their HPDs {{at the beginning of the}} shift. CONCLUSION : NIHL remains a significant health problem in this steel industry despite the implementation of <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> techniques and the implementation of a noise conservation programme with all the required elements.

40|$|This paper reviews ways of {{reducing}} surface transport noise by natural means. The <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> solutions of interest {{can be easily}} (visually) incorporated in the landscape or help with greening the (sub) urban environment. They include vegetated surfaces (applied to faces or tops of noise walls and on building façades and roofs), caged piles of stones (gabions), vegetation belts (tree belts, shrub zones and hedges), earth berms and various ways of exploiting ground-surface-related effects. The ideas presented in this overview have been tested in the laboratory and/or numerically evaluated {{in order to assess}} or enhance the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> they could provide. Some in-situ experiments are discussed as well. When well-designed, such natural devices have the potential to abate surface transport noise, possibly by complementing and sometimes improving common (non-green) noise reducing devices or measures. Their applicability strongly depends on the available space reserved for the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> and the receiver position...|$|R

Landing approaches were flown in both zero wind and wind shear conditions. For both standard and <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> approaches, the situation display provided greater glidepath accuracy in the initial phase of the landing approaches, whereas the command display was more effective in the final approach phase. Glidepath accuracy was greater for the standard approaches than for the <b>noise</b> <b>abatement</b> approaches in all phases of the landing approach. Most of the pilots preferred the command display and the standard approach. Substantial agreement was found between each pilot's judgment of his performance and his actual performance...|$|R
