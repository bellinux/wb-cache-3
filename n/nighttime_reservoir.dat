40|$|The paper {{considers}} isotopic hydrogen fractionation {{processes in}} the Venusian exosphere due to ionosphere-exosphere coupling by addressing two deficiencies in the present theory of differential escape. First, a set of D/H isotopic fractionation curves is derived for the ion-neutral interactions of charge and collisional momentum transfer, and these are compared {{with the results of}} Gurwell and Yung (1993) for hot O collisional ejection. Then, the question of the relative importance of collisional ejection in atmospheric escape is reexamined using two simple exosphere models. It is shown that O-O collisions suppress the high energy component of the hot O distribution by more than a factor of 10. Moreover, the ballistic trajectories of fast O atoms that reach the <b>nighttime</b> <b>reservoir</b> of exospheric hydrogen favor downward scatter of D and H rather than their escape. It is concluded that, due to severe limits placed on the effectiveness of collisional ejection, the differential escape of D and H from Venus is determined by charge exchange interactions rather than the collisional ejection...|$|E
40|$|The {{chlorine}} chemistry under highly activated polar stratospheric spring conditions {{is critical to}} understanding the dramatic ozone losses {{that lead to the}} formation of the stratospheric ozone hole'. A particular flight pattern of the Geophysica high altitude aircraft during VINTERSOL-EUPLEX/SOLVE II on the 30 th January 2003 in the Arctic was designed to test our theoretical understanding of the ClO/ClOOCl system. The outbound and inbound flight legs followed a calculated pattern such that the same air masses were sampled before and after sunset. During the inbound flight three encounters of the contrail from the outbound flight confirmed the success of the flight planning. In-situ ClO measurements were examined to study the conversion of ClO into its <b>nighttime</b> <b>reservoir</b> during sunset. Applying a trajectory Match technique, traditionally used to examine ozone-sonde concentrations, we examined this 3 hour period of ClO observations. 72 ClO Match pairs were identified with temperatures ranging between 200 - 206 K and SZAs between 84 o and 95 o. For a given Match pair the total active chlorine ClOx is assumed to be constant, but allowed to vary between Matches. This allowed the kinetic parameters controlling the ClO concentration - Keq, kf and J with differing SZA and temperatures to be closely examined. Due to the particular design of the flight pattern we are able to retrieve robust values for Keq based on ClO measurements alone. Hence our results for Keq are independent of the more uncertain dimer measurements (ClOOCl). We find values for Keq that are about a factor of 3 - 4 smaller than current JPL recommendations relatively independent of kf and J, as long as kf is larger than 70 % of its recommended value. Derived values for J and ClOx are strongly anticorrelated. Hence, without dimer observations the retrieved J is very sensitive to assumptions about ClOx. However, using total available chlorine as an upper limit for ClOx, we find that the upper limits of the current JPL 2006 recommended range of uncertainty for J are required to explain the data of the self-Match fight. If measured values of ClOOCl are used to better constrain ClOx, even larger values of J are inferred. These results contrast with a recent laboratory measurement of the ClO dimer cross sections (Pope et al. 2007, J. Phys. Chem., in press), which leads to large differences between modeled and measured ClO. We shall explore additional chemical mechanisms that could account for observed ClO and ClOOCl during the self-Match flight, in light of the new laboratory cross section...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the effect of}} heterogeneous bromine reactions on stratospheric photochemistry. We have considered reactions on both sulfate aerosols and on polar stratospheric louds (PSCs). It is shown that the hydrolysis of BrONO 2 on sulfate aerosols enhances the HOBr concentration, which in turn enhances the OH and HO 2 concentrations, thereby reducing the HC 1 lifetime and concentration. The hydrolysis of BrONO 2 leads to a nighttime production of HOBr, making HOBr a major <b>nighttime</b> bromine <b>reservoir.</b> The photolysis of HOBr gives a rapid increase in the OH and HO 2 concentration at dawn, as was recently observed by $alawitch et al. [1994]. The increase in the OH and HO 2 concentration, and the decrease in the HC 1 concentration, leads to additional ozone depletion at all latitudes and for all season. At temperatures below 210 K the bulk phase reaction of HOBr with HC 1 in sulfate aerosols becomes important. The most important heterogeneous bromine reactions on polar stratospheric louds are the mixed halogen reactions of HC 1 with HOBr and BrONO 2 and of HBr with HOC 1 and C 1 ONO 2. Introduction phase chemistry, for the rapid conversion of HC 1 int...|$|R
40|$|The Nitrogen, Aerosol Composition, and Halogens on a Tall Tower (NACHTT) field {{experiment}} {{took place during}} late winter, 2011, at a site 33 [*]km north of Denver, Colorado. The study included fixed-height measurements of aerosols, soluble trace gases, and volatile organic compounds near surface level, as well as vertically resolved measurements of nitrogen oxides, aerosol composition, soluble gas-phase acids, and halogen species from 3 to 270 [*]m above ground level. There were 1928 individual profiles during the three-week campaign to characterize trace gas and aerosol distributions in {{the lower levels of}} the boundary layer. Nitrate and ammonium dominated the ionic composition of aerosols and originated primarily from local or regional sources. Sulfate and organic matter were also significant and were associated primarily with longer-range transport to the region. Aerosol chloride was associated primarily with supermicron size fractions and was always present in excess of gas-phase chlorine compounds. The <b>nighttime</b> radical <b>reservoirs,</b> nitryl chloride, ClNO 2, and nitrous acid, HONO, were both consistently present in nighttime urban air. Nitryl chloride was especially pronounced in plumes from large point sources sampled aloft at night. Nitrous acid was typically most concentrated near the ground surface and was the dominant contributor (80 %) to diurnally averaged primary OH radical production in near-surface air. Large observed mixing ratios of light alkanes, both in near-surface air and aloft, were attributable to local emissions from oil and gas activities...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} of stratospheric short-lived species Maryam Khosravi Chalmers University of Technology Department of Earth and Space Sciences Abstract The depletion of ozone {{in the stratosphere}} has {{a direct impact on}} the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earthâ€™s surface. The ozone abundance and distribution is controlled by the photo-chemical reactions and catalytic cycles involving halogens (chlorine and bromine), odd hydrogen and odd nitrogen species as well as by atmospheric transport. An introduction to ozone related chemistry of the stratosphere and modelling of short-lived species using photo-chemical models is presented. A one dimensional (1 D) atmospheric model is used in two distinct studies: modeling of short-lived species in the Arctic lower stratosphere (paper I) and in the tropical mid to upper stratosphere (paper II). The first part of this thesis describes the diurnal {{variation of}} chlorine monoxide, ClO, which is the most important short-lived species controlling ozone in the polar lower stratosphere during winter and early-spring. The ClO-dimer cycle, involving ClO and its <b>nighttime</b> <b>reservoir</b> Cl 2 O 2, contributes to about 75 %of the polar ozone loss. ClO measurements from an airborne submillimeter radiometer in the Arctic twilight have been compared with the results from a 1 D photo-chemical model (MISU- 1 D), in order to validate the model and to test the kinetics of the reactions controlling the partitioning of chlorine species {{during the course of a}} day. The results show that cross sections leading to faster photolysis rates of Cl 2 O 2 match best with the ClO observations. This is consistent with the recent version of the chemical kinetics evaluation by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Slower photolysis rates can not be reconciled with the observations since active chlorine higher than the total available chlorine would be required. The model reproduces higher nighttime ClO than the observations, however the nighttime ClOmodelled using recent JPL recommendations of the thermal equilibrium constant agree within the uncertainty range of the observations. The sensitivity of the model to the assumed albedo and temperature are also tested. Neither the temperature nor the albedo uncertainties allow us to reconcile the model with the lower observed nighttime ClO. Moreover, it is found that the ClO-BrO cycle decreases ClO mostly around sunrise and sunset. The second part of the thesis presents the partitioning and diurnal variation of chlorine, bromine, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen species in the tropics from the stratosphere to the lower mesosphere. Model results of the diurnal variation of HOCl (as one of the chlorine reservoirs), the related short-lived species ClO and HO 2 and HCl (as the main chlorine reservoir) for the tropics and three altitudes (35, 45 and 55 km) are compared with measurements from five satellite instruments. The model results generally agree with the observations both in terms of the absolute values and the differences between day and night...|$|E
40|$|Nighttime {{chemistry}} in polluted regions {{is dominated}} by the nitrate radical (NO 3) including its direct reaction with natural and anthropogenic hydrocarbons, its reaction with NO 2 to form N 2 O 5, and subsequent reactions of N 2 O 5 to form HNO 3 and chlorine containing photolabile species. We report nighttime measurements of NO 3, NO 2, and O 3, in the polluted marine boundary layer southwest of Vancouver, BC during a three week study in summer of 2005. The concentration of N 2 O 5 was calculated using the well known equilibrium, NO 3 +NO 2 â†”N 2 O 5. Median overnight mixing ratios of NO 3, N 2 O 5 and NO 2 were 10. 3 ppt, 122 ppt and 8. 3 ppb with median N 2 O 5 /NO 3 molar ratios of 13. 1 and median nocturnal partitioning of 4. 9 %. Due to the high levels of NO 2 that can inhibit approach to steady-state, we use a method for calculating NO 3 lifetimes that does not assume the steady-state approximation. Median and average lifetimes of NO 3 in the NO 3 -N 2 O 5 <b>nighttime</b> <b>reservoir</b> were 1. 1 â€“ 2. 3 min. We have determined nocturnal profiles of the pseudo first order loss coefficient of NO 3 and the first order loss coefficients of N 2 O 5 by regression of the NO 3 inverse lifetimes with the [N 2 O 5]/[NO 3] ratio. Direct losses of NO 3 are highest early in the night, tapering off as the night proceeds. The magnitude of the first order loss coefficient of N 2 O 5 is consistent with recommended homogeneous rate coefficients for reaction of N 2 O 5 with water vapor early in the night, but increases significantly {{in the latter part of}} the night when relative humidity increases beyond 75 %, consistent with heterogeneous reactions of N 2 O 5 with sea salt and/or other aerosols with rate constant k het = 1. 2 Ã— 10 âˆ’ 3 s âˆ’ 1. Analysis indicates that a correlation exists between overnight integrated N 2 O 5 concentrations in the marine boundary layer, a surrogate for the accumulation of chlorine containing photolabile species, and maximum 1 -h average O 3 at stations in the Lower Fraser Valley the next day when there is clear evidence of a sea breeze transporting marine air into the valley. The range of maximum 1 -h average O 3 increase attributable to the correlation is Î”O 3 =+ 1. 1 to + 8. 3 ppb throughout the study for the average of 20 stations, although higher increases are seen for stations far downwind of the coastal urban area. The correlation is still statistically significant on the second day after a nighttime accumulation, but with a different spatial pattern favouring increased O 3 at the coastal urban stations, consistent with transport of polluted air back to the coast...|$|E
40|$|Nitryl {{chloride}} (ClNO 2) {{is produced}} at night by reactions of dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) on chloride containing surfaces. ClNO 2 is photolyzed {{during the morning}} hours after sunrise to liberate highly reactive chlorine atoms (ClÂ·). This chemistry takes place primarily in polluted environments where the concentrations of N 2 O 5 precursors (nitrogen oxide radicals and ozone) are high, though it likely occurs in remote regions at lower intensities. Recent field measurements have illustrated the potential importance of ClNO 2 as a daytime ClÂ· source and a <b>nighttime</b> NO x <b>reservoir.</b> However, {{the fate of the}} ClÂ· and the overall impact of ClNO 2 on regional photochemistry remain poorly constrained by measurements and models. To this end, we have incorporated ClNO 2 production, photolysis, and subsequent ClÂ· reactions into an existing master chemical mechanism (MCM version 3. 2) box model framework using observational constraints from the CalNex 2010 field study. ClÂ· reactions with a set of alkenes and alcohols, and the simplified multiphase chemistry of N 2 O 5, ClNO 2, HOCl, ClONO 2, and Cl 2, none of which are currently part of the MCM, {{have been added to the}} mechanism. The presence of ClNO 2 produces significant changes to oxidants, ozone, and nitrogen oxide partitioning, relative to model runs excluding ClNO 2 formation. From a nighttime maximum of 1. 5 ppbv ClNO 2, the daytime maximum ClÂ· concentration reaches 1 Ã— 10 5 atoms cm âˆ’ 3 at 07 : 00 model time, reacting mostly with a large suite of volatile organic compounds (VOC) to produce 2. 2 times more organic peroxy radicals in the morning than in the absence of ClNO 2. In the presence of several ppbv of nitrogen oxide radicals (NO x = NO + NO 2), these perturbations lead to similar enhancements in hydrogen oxide radicals (HO x = OH + HO 2). Neglecting contributions from HONO, the total integrated daytime radical source is 17 % larger when including ClNO 2, which leads to a similar enhancement in integrated ozone production of 15 %. Detectable levels (tens of pptv) of chlorine containing organic compounds are predicted to form as a result of ClÂ· addition to alkenes, which may be useful in identifying times of active ClÂ· chemistry...|$|R
