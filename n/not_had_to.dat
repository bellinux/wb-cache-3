Combat with a MiG-15, which was {{faster and more}} heavily armed still, [...] was regarded as the apogee for a fighter pilot.

Glenn later wrote, [...] "Since {{the days of the}} Lafayette Escadrille during World War I, pilots have viewed air-to-air combat as the ultimate test not only of their machines but of their own personal determination and flying skills. I was no exception." [...] He hoped to become the second Marine jet flying ace after John F. Bolt. When Glenn complained about there not being any MiGs to shoot at, his USAF squadron mates painted [...] "MiG Mad Marine" [...] on his aircraft. He shot down his first MiG in a dogfight on July 12, 1953, downed a second one on July 19, and a third on July 22 during an aerial engagement in which four Sabres shot down three MiGs. These were the final air victories of the war, which ended with an armistice five days later.

500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools.

2500|$|In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two {{intellectuals who}} commit a murder simply {{to prove they}} can get away with it. The two {{characters}} and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, were supposed to be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy to be part of the experience, but wondered [...] "what the film would have been like had [...] shot it normally" [...] and [...] "had he <b>not</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> worry about censorship." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{differences}} between Romans and Goths in Ostrogothic Ravenna were never as clearly defined {{as they were}} along religious lines.

2500|$|Mallards {{world record}} {{has never been}} officially {{exceeded}} by a steam locomotive, though the German Class 05 was at least very close: in 1936, two years before Mallards run, 05002 had reached 200.4km/h (124.5mph) between Hamburg and Berlin. Stoke Bank is long, straight and slightly downhill, whereas the 1936 run of 05002 took place on a horizontal stretch of track. Unlike world records for cars and aircraft, there is no requirement {{for an average of}} two runs in both directions, and assistance from gradient or wind has always been acceptable in rail speed records. Also, unlike Mallard, 05002 survived the attempt undamaged: on the other hand, its train was only four coaches long (197 tons), whereas Mallards train was seven coaches (240 tons). In terms of rival claims, Gresley and the LNER had just one serious attempt at the record, which was far from a perfect run with a [...] permanent way check just North of Grantham. Despite this a record was set. Gresley planned to have another attempt in September 1939, but this was prevented by the outbreak of World War II.

It is very possible that around 1946, the American Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 class duplex steam locomotive could have attained faster operational speeds than Mallard. However, such claims were not officially verified, thus Mallard continues to hold the official record. The LNER A4 and PRR T1 classes had the same piston stroke and driving wheel diameter, which gave both locomotives the same piston speed for the same track speed.|$|E
