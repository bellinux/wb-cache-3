40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in the co-existence of geostationary satellite orbit (GSO) and non-geostationary satellite orbit (<b>NGSO)</b> <b>satellite</b> networks is to mitigate the in-line interference caused by an <b>NGSO</b> <b>satellite</b> to the GSO earth terminal, while the <b>NGSO</b> <b>satellite</b> is crossing the GSO satellite's illumination zone. The method recommended in ITU-R S. 1325 - 3 involves utilizing a range-based power control on the <b>NGSO</b> <b>satellite</b> for downlink communication to the NGSO earth terminals. In this paper, we investigate a cognitive range-based power control algorithm while {{taking into account the}} imposed interference level to the GSO fixed satellite service (FSS) system. Results show that the proposed cognitive power control algorithm can mitigate the harmful in-line interference on the GSO terminal receiver, while also providing the desired link quality for the NGSO system. More importantly, we formulate and solve an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the inter-site distance (ISD) of the GSO-NGSO earth user-terminals. Finally, we develop an analytical method to calculate the ISD between GSO and NGSO earth terminals and validate this with the help of simulation results...|$|E

The SpaceX non-geostationary orbit (<b>NGSO)</b> communications <b>satellite</b> constellation will operate in the high frequency bands above 24 GHz, [...] "where steerable earth station transmit antennas would have a wider geographic impact and significantly lower satellite altitudes magnify the impact of aggregate interference from terrestrial transmissions." ...|$|R
