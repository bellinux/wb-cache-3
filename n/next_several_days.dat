5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed east of Chuuk on July 31 and gradually increased in organization over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> {{as it moved}} northwestward. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system on August 4 and it was designated a tropical depression by both the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) later that day. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August 5, and the JMA designated it Tropical Storm Saomai.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if {{he would be willing to}} provide information on the effects of the air war. Speer agreed, and over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E

5|$|Identified by {{its lack}} of {{associated}} frontal boundaries and closed circulation center, the first tropical cyclone of the 1911 season formed on August 4 over southern Alabama in the United States. At only tropical depression strength, it tracked eastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>Several</b> <b>days</b> later, while located near Bermuda, the depression became a tropical storm and turned northeastward. The storm lasted <b>several</b> more <b>days</b> until dissipating on August 11. The storm produced heavy rainfall on the Bermuda, but no gale-force winds were reported. The storm was unknown until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane database revision recognized it as a tropical storm.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the club}} season, Santa Cruz had been removed from Paraguay's 2016 Copa América squad due to a knee problem; his loan with Málaga had concluded; and Mexican club Cruz Azul had communicated that Santa Cruz was not {{returning}} for the <b>next</b> season. <b>Several</b> <b>days</b> later, one of the directors of Santa Cruz's former club Olimpia, Ricardo Tavarelli (also the player's brother in-law), announced that he had spoken with Santa Cruz in relation to the player's possible return to the club.|$|R
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{acquired a}} closed circulation and became Tropical Depression One-C on August 22. It stayed disorganized for the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> It organized more fully and intensified into {{a tropical storm}} on August 25 and was named Alika. After peaking as a moderately strong tropical storm on August 25, wind shear caused by the pre-Ele tropical depression and an upper-level low near Hawaii weakened the storm to a depression on August 27. Alika dissipated the next day, having never threatened land.|$|E
5|$|Garrison {{commander}} James C. Neill {{went home}} on family matters February 11, 1836, leaving James Bowie and William B. Travis as co-commanders over the predominantly volunteer force. When the Mexican Army of Operations {{under the command}} of Santa Anna arrived in Béxar with 1,500 troops on February 23, the remaining Alamo garrison numbered 150. Over the course of the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> new volunteers arrived inside the fortress while others were sent out as couriers, to forage for food, or to buy supplies.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{arrived in}} his home town of Carterton to a hero's welcome on 25 April 1919, five {{years to the day}} after being landed at Gallipoli.

5|$|Hurricane Hernan was {{the ninth}} {{tropical}} depression, eighth named storm, fifth hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. Hernan developed {{out of a}} tropical wave that formed off {{the east coast of}} Africa on July 24. Over the next week, the wave traversed the Atlantic without development and entered the Eastern Pacific basin on August 2. The wave became better organized over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> and was declared Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 6. The depression quickly became Tropical Storm Hernan later that day. Hernan steadily intensified over the next two days and was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of August 8.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis {{was designated}} a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further {{over the next}} few days due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry air entrainment. PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> more Texian {{settlers}} {{joined the}} group at La Bahía. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates that these men were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100men remain at Goliad, {{under the command of}} Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2008USD). Hurricane Isabel formed from a {{tropical}} wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>Several</b> <b>days</b> before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike.

When Nana announces that she and Toto are engaged, her grandmother is furious; if Nana marries before her sister, she says, Nunung will never marry.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E formed {{out of a}} weak {{tropical}} wave, {{associated with}} scattered convection, which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave was moving towards the west at the rate of 23mph (37km/h), due to an area of high pressure located over the north-central Atlantic Ocean leading to a prevailing easterly flow. Some cyclonic turning was noted and convection was {{on either side of the}} axis the center of the stormbut was mainly in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The wave remained very close to the intertropical convergence zone for the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> without any further development.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Nelson, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Ibiang, was the worst {{tropical}} cyclone to affect Southern China in 16years. Typhoon Nelson, which developed on August 16, 1985, originated from an area of thunderstorm activity well east of the Philippines. It gradually intensified over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> while moving northwest. Nelson reached typhoon intensity early on August20 and two days later, attained peak intensity before turning west. The cyclone brushed northern Taiwan early on August23 after weakening slightly. Nelson then briefly restrengthened to peak intensity. During the afternoon of August23, it made landfall in eastern China before dissipating on August25.|$|E

5|$|At daybreak on 8 August, six Japanese infiltrators {{hiding under}} {{the porch of}} the former British colonial {{headquarters}} shot and killed three Marines. Within five minutes, other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades. Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements {{in the form of the}} 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the ravine, pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and ravine. Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed. Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days.</b> In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died. Three Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days</b> before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E
5|$|New {{orders were}} {{subsequently}} issued demanding further executions. According to eyewitness accounts, the Wehrmacht went {{from house to}} house over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> arresting all males between the ages of 14 and 60. They were herded into a makeshift detention centre at a former rolling-stock factory. Once there, their papers were checked and their names entered into a ledger. When the camp was full, the Wehrmacht ordered groups of 100 prisoners to march to pre-dug mass graves, where they were executed with heavy machine guns. The bodies were then examined for any signs of life; victims that had survived the initial volley were dealt a single bullet to the head. Once the first group had been liquidated, the soldiers returned to the factory and collected the next 100 victims. This process continued until all the men that were rounded up had been killed.|$|E

5|$|On August24, Marie {{developed}} an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h). At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575mi (925km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August25 which prompted steady weakening. Over the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength {{as it moved}} into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August29, after having lost all signs of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August30. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September2 about 1,200mi (1,950km) northeast of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The attack caused little direct damage, but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected Gambier to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but Gambier refused. Cochrane continued {{the battle over the}} <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier. This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety. Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E
5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the <b>next</b> <b>several</b> <b>days,</b> turning back to the south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west.
