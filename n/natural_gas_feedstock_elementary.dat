40|$|The Hynol Process for {{conversion}} of coal and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to methanol as a liquid fuel {{consists of three}} consecutive unit operations: (1) hydrogasification of coal, (2) steam reforming of the methane formed and added <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>feedstock,</b> and (3) catalytic methanol synthesis. The Hynol Process is a total recycle process. Using a process simulation computer program, mass and energy balances and yields and efficiency data have been obtained {{for a range of}} <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to coal <b>feedstock</b> ratios. Although the methanol yield increases with <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to coal feed ratio, the cost of feedstock per unit methanol is insensitive over a wide range of feedstock ratios. The Hynol Process produces a 13 % increase in methanol yield compared to the equivalent of two separate conventional coal gasification and <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reforming plants. The CO{sub 2 } emissions are reduced by 22 % for the Hynol plant compared to the conventional processes with greater CO{sub 2 } reductions at lower <b>gas</b> to coal <b>feedstock</b> ratios. A preliminary cost estimate for a 10, 000 tons/day Hynol methanol plant indicates a lower production cost than the current cost of methanol by the conventional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reforming plant.

A chromium and copper-doped hematite has been recently proposed as an industrial catalyst in the high temperature shift (HTS). This solid shows a stable performance but the search for non-toxic systems is much needed due to environmental restrictions related to chromium compounds. In this work, the use of thorium instead of chromium in iron- and copper-based catalysts for the HTS reaction was investigated. Catalysts were prepared in the active form (magnetite) in order to save energy, characterized by several techniques and then evaluated in operational conditions close to the industrial ones.

40|$|The Hynol {{process is}} {{proposed}} {{to meet the}} demand for an economical process for methanol production with reduced CO{sub 2 } emission. This new process consists of three reaction steps: (a) hydrogasification of biomass, (b) steam reforming of the produced <b>gas</b> with additional <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>feedstock,</b> and (c) methanol synthesis of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced during the previous two steps. The H{sub 2 }-rich gas remaining after methanol synthesis is recycled to gasify the biomass in an energy neutral reactor so that {{there is no need for}} an expensive oxygen plant as required by commercial steam gasifiers. Recycling gas allows the methanol synthesis reactor to perform at a relatively lower pressure than conventional while the plant still maintains high methanol yield. Energy recovery designed into the process minimizes heat loss and increases the process thermal efficiency. If the Hynol methanol is used as an alternative and more efficient automotive fuel, an overall 41 % reduction in CO{sub 2 } emission can be achieved compared to the use of conventional gasoline fuel. A preliminary economic estimate shows that the total capital investment for a Hynol plant is 40 % lower than that for a conventional biomass gasification plant. The methanol production cost is $ 0. 43 /gal for a 1085 million gal/yr Hynol plant which is competitive with current U. S. methanol and equivalent gasoline prices.

40|$|The {{chemical}} industry sector is energy-intensive and {{highly dependent on}} fossil feedstock. The primary long-term option to reduce fossil feedstock dependence and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is to switch to renewable feedstock. One promising technology is thermochemical gasification of lignocellulosic biomass feedstock into a raw syngas which can be processed into a spectrum of possible products. This study aims at assessing different opportunities to integrate biomass gasification-based processes {{in the production of}} chemicals. The work was conducted {{in the form of a}} case study involving a conventional oxo synthesis plant processing syngas derived from partial oxidation of <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> and olefins into various specialty chemicals. The following options were investigated: (i) retaining the existing syngas production unit and fully substituting the <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> <b>feedstock</b> by either importing or producing biomass-derived synthetic <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (bio-SNG) onsite; (ii) scrapping the existing syngas generator and directly producing biomass-derived syngas fulfilling the specifications for downstream oxo synthesis. The results show that the direct route to bio-syngas requires less lignocellulosic biomass compared with the route via intermediate bio-SNG production. Although the bio-SNG route features a higher heat recovery target for production of heat and power, the direct route achieves the highest thermodynamic performance, particularly if LP steam is exported to the oxo synthesis plant. Furthermore, the direct bio-syngas route shows promising opportunities to perform well from both an economic and GHG emission reduction perspective. For price projections based on current policies, a production cost lower than via the fossil route is indicated. The results also indicate that for future energy market conditions associated with major climate emission constraints, there is no direct economic incentive for switching to biomass-based syngas production, suggesting that other policy measures than a CO 2 emissions charge will be necessary to achieve switching from fossil to biomass feedstock in the chemical process industry...|$|R

The objective {{of the study was to}} establish targets for the development of catalysts for the LPMAS reaction. In the IGCC scenario, syngas conversions need only be moderate because unconverted syngas is utilized by the combined cycle system. A once through LPMAS plant achieving syngas conversions in the range of 38 [...] 49 % was found to be suitable. At a gas hourly space velocity of 5, 000 sL/Kg-hr and a methanol:isobutanol selectivity ratio of 1. 03, the target catalyst productivity ranges from 370 to 460 g iBuOH/Kg-hr. In the petroleum refinery scenario, high conversions ({approximately} 95 %) are required to avoid overloading the refinery fuel system with low Btu content unconverted syngas. To achieve these high conversions with the low H{sub 2 }/CO ratio syngas, a recycle system was required (because of the limit imposed by methanol equilibrium), steam was injected into the LPMAS reactor, and CO{sub 2 } was removed from the recycle loop. At the most economical recycle ratio, the target catalyst productivity is 265 g iBuOH/Kg-hr. In the standalone LPMAS scenario, essentially complete conversions are required to achieve a fuel balanced plant. At the most economical recycle ratio, the target catalyst productivity is 285 g iBuOH/Kg-hr.
