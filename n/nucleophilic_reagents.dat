A new interesting rearrangement of 3-substituted coumarins to 2-oxochromans-4-acetic acid derivatives was found for the first time.

50|$|The Laboratory of Organic Synthesis {{supervised}} by Ivanov also made breakthroughs in organic synthesis. New synthetic methods were developed, involving {{the reaction of}} ambident <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> (prepared by metalation of esters, nitriles and amides of alkanoic and arylacetic acids) with N-acylated aldimines and ketimines.

50|$|Since the {{discovery}} that copper(I) halides catalyze the conjugate addition of Grignard reagents in 1941, organocopper reagents have emerged as weakly basic, <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> for substitution and addition reactions. The constitution of organocopper compounds depends on their method of preparation and the various kinds of organocopper reagents exhibit different reactivity profiles. As a result, the scope of reactions involving organocopper reagents is extremely broad.|$|E
50|$|Anionic {{ring-opening}} polymerizations (AROP) are ring-opening polymerizations {{that involve}} <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> as initiators. Monomers with a three-member ring structure - such as epoxide, aziridine, and episulfide - {{are able to}} undergo anionic ROP due to the ring-distortion, despite having a less electrophilic functional group (e.g. ether, amine, and thioether). These cyclic monomers are important for many practical applications. The polarized functional group in cyclic monomers is characterized by one atom (usually a carbon) that is electron-deficient due to an adjacent atom that is highly electron-withdrawing (e.g. oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur etc.) Ring-opening will be triggered by the nucleophilic attack of the initiator to the carbon, forming a new species that will act as a nucleophile. The sequence will repeat until the polymer is formed.|$|E

50|$|These {{compounds}} react readily with nucleophiles {{other than}} water, like alcohols and amines (see Hinsberg reaction). If the nucleophile is an alcohol {{the product is}} a sulfonate ester, if it is an amine the product is a sulfonamide.

50|$|Among {{the types}} of {{reactions}} that can be catalyzed by Lewis acids, those with carbonyl-containing substrates have received {{the greatest amount of}} attention. The first major discovery in this area was in 1960, when Yates and Eaton reported the significant acceleration of the Diels-Alder reaction by AlCl3 when maleic anhydride is the dienophile. Early theoretical studies that depended on frontier orbital analysis established that Lewis acid catalysis operates via lowering of the dienophile's LUMO energy, which is still the accepted rationalization. The concept of lowered LUMO energy is also used to explain the dramatically enhanced electrophilic reactivity of carbonyl compounds (whose LUMO is the C-O π* orbital) towards mild <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents,</b> as in the cases of the Mukaiyama aldol reaction and Sakurai reaction.|$|E
50|$|Barluenga and {{coworkers}} developed {{the first example}} of using N-tosylhyrdrazones as nucleophilic partners in cross-coupling reactions. Typically, <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> in coupling reactions tend {{to be of the}} organometallic variety, namely organomagnesium, -zinc, -tin, -silicon, and -boron. Combined with electrophilic aryl halides, N-tosylhydrazones can be used to prepare polysubstituted olefins under Pd-catalyzed conditions without the use of often expensive, and synthetically demanding organometallic reagents. The scope of the reaction is wide; N-tosylhydrazones derived from aldehydes and ketones are well tolerated, which leads to both di- and trisubstituted olefins. Moreover, and variety of aryl halides are well tolerated as coupling partners including those bearing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, as well as π-rich and π-deficient aromatic heterocyclic compounds. Stereochemistry is an important element to consider when preparing polysubstituted olefins. Using hydrazones derived from linear aldehydes resulted in exclusively trans olefins, while the stereochemical outcomes of trisubstituted olefins were dependent {{on the size of the}} substituents.The mechanism of this transformation is thought to proceed in a manner similar to the synthesis of alkenes through the Bamford-Stevens reaction; the decomposition of N-tosylhydrazones in the presence of base to generate diazocompounds which then release nitrogen gas, yielding a carbene, which then can be quenched with an electrophile. In this case, the coupling reaction starts with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to Pd0 catalyst to give the aryl PdII complex. The reaction of the diazocompound, generated from the hydrazone, with the PdII complex produces a Pd-carbene complex. A migratory insertion of the aryl group gives an alkyl Pd complex, which undergoes syn beta-hydride elimination to generate the trans aryl olefin and regenerate the Pd0 catalyst. This reaction has also seen utility in preparing conjugated enynes from N-tosylhydrazones and terminal alkynes under similar Pd-catalyzed reaction conditions and following the same mechanism.Moreover, Barluenga {{and coworkers}} demonstrated a one-pot three-component coupling reaction of aldehydes or ketones, tosylhydrazides, and aryl halides in which the N-tosylhydrazone is formed in situ. This process produces stereoselective olefins in similar yields compared to the process in which preformed N-tosylhydrazones are used.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the reactions}} of 2 -diethylaminoethylchloride with <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> have been studied in N, N-dimethylformamide from 33 to 80 degrees C. An ethyleneimmonium ion is easily formed from 2 -diethylaminoethylchloride by {{the participation of the}} neighbouring nitrogen atom. This ion is rather stable in N,N-dimethylformamide solution and is in equilibrium with 2 -diethylaminoethylchloride. However, it reacts very rapidly with various <b>nucleophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> such as 8 -benzyltheophylline and 2 -(ethylamino) ethanol.

50|$|The SN1 {{mechanism}} has two steps. In {{the first}} step, the leaving group departs, forming a carbocation C+.
