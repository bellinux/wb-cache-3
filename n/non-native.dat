5|$|Yosemite National Park has {{documented}} more than 130 <b>non-native</b> plant species within park boundaries. These <b>non-native</b> plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of <b>non-native</b> plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. <b>Non-native</b> plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some <b>non-native</b> species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more <b>non-native</b> plants to become established. Many <b>non-native</b> species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E
5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or <b>non-native</b> species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by sticking to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of <b>non-native</b> plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E

40|$|Background. Several {{studies have}} shown that Alaska Native people have higher smoking {{prevalence}} than <b>non-Natives.</b> However, no population-based studies have explored whether smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours also differ among Alaska Native people and <b>non-Natives.</b> Objective.

50|$|Hunting furbearing {{animals is}} prohibited. Hunting of these birds by <b>non-natives</b> is permitted: Hungarian partridge, pheasants, ducks, geese, mergansers, and coots.

5|$|Native trumpeter (Cygnus buccinator) and tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) and <b>non-native</b> mute swans (Cygnus olor) may all {{be found}} on the lake in winter. Tundra swans are absent in summer as they migrate to the arctic and subarctic to nest, however, the <b>non-native,</b> Eurasian mute swans compete for habitat with the non-migrating trumpeter swan {{population}} and is an impediment to restoration of the native trumpeters around the Great Lakes. Additional native birds hosted by the lake include cardinals, blue jays, finches, orioles, woodpeckers, teal, mallards, resident and migratory Canada geese, and an occasional bald eagle.|$|E

40|$|Through a {{field study}} we measure {{differences}} in employment outcomes between natives, <b>non-natives,</b> and natives with an ethnic-minority background. It {{is suggested that}} the joint effect of productivity uncertainties and distastes against ethnic-minority groups should be higher for <b>non-natives</b> than for natives with an ethnic-minority background. However, it is revealed that both <b>non-natives</b> and natives with an ethnic-minority background face comparable occupational access constraints and are sorted into similarly lower paid vacancies. An ethnic name regardless of one 2 ̆ 019 s nationality is enough to generate unequal treatments...|$|R

Between 13 and 17percent of the <b>non-native</b> Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Around twenty <b>non-native</b> {{species of}} flora have been {{introduced}} to Caroline Island via human contact. Among these are the vine Ipomoea violacea, which has begun to proliferate. Domestic cats and dogs introduced alongside a small homestead have driven the seabird population away from the islet of Monu Ata-Ata.|$|E

5|$|Both Douglas fir and Suillus lakei are <b>non-native</b> {{introduced}} species in Europe. The fungus {{has been found}} in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas fir. These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Slovakia. It is considered endangered in the Czech Republic.

5|$|C.mutica {{were also}} {{discovered}} in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This {{was the first}} instance of a <b>non-native</b> marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have spread into British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other <b>non-native</b> species grown.|$|E
50|$|The Tolowa or Dee-ni’ {{population}} exceeded 10,000. In the 19th century, epidemics of new infectious diseases, such as smallpox, {{broke out}} among the Tolowa, resulting in high mortality. These occurred before they had face-to-face encounters with <b>non-natives</b> because of contact through intermediaries. In 1828 the American Jedediah Smith and his exploration party were the first known <b>non-natives</b> to contact the Tolowa.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} if the rate of peritoneal dialysis (PD) -related infections in our large Native population was higher than in <b>non-Natives</b> [...] Design: Prospective study of PD-related infections, 1987 to 1993 [...] Patients: Forty-eight Natives and 136 <b>non-Natives</b> were studied. Comparisons of infection rates were made as well as determinations {{of the effect of}} diabetes and of dialysis techniques on infection rate [...] Results: The chance of remaining free of peritonitis was far lower at 6 and 12 months in Natives versus nonNatives, 40 % versus 76 % at 6 months, and 24 % versus 54 % at 12 months (p < 0. 01). Having diabetes or adding intraperitoneal insulin did not confer additional risk of peritonitis. The Y-Iine reduced the risk of peritonitis in <b>non-Natives</b> only. Exit-site infection (ESI) was significantly higher in Natives versus <b>non-Natives,</b> 0. 42 versus 0. 19 episodes per patient year (p < 0. 01) mainly due to Staph. aureus...|$|R

5|$|Japanese Knotweed Fallopia japonica is an {{invasive}} species that threatens Jersey's biodiversity. It is easily recognisable and has hollow stems with small white flowers that are produced in late summer. Other <b>non-native</b> {{species on the}} island include the Colorado beetle, burnet rose and oak processionary moth.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{generally}} have thin tooth enamel compared to anthropoid primates. This {{may result in}} extra wear and breakage to the anterior (front) teeth due to heavy use in grooming, feeding, and fighting. Little other dental health information is available for lemurs, except that wild ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve occasionally exhibit abscessed maxillary canines (seen as open wounds on the muzzle) and tooth decay, possibly due to the consumption of <b>non-native</b> foods.|$|E

They also contend that there are higher safety risks when the ceremonies are conducted by <b>non-Natives,</b> pointing to deaths or injuries in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.|$|R
5|$|<b>Non-native</b> plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most {{commonly found in}} areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also spread into the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time consuming and expensive.|$|E
