5|$|Financial {{problems}} with the defense budget in 1964 prevented the substantial sums required from being allocated. Continuing financial short-falls prevented the proposed effort from getting off the ground. This, {{as well as a}} serious accident in 1969 which caused a partial meltdown in the small Lucens pilot reactor, strengthened opposition against the Swiss <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a spy {{working for}} the {{government}} of the United States, Berg traveled to Yugoslavia to gather intelligence on resistance groups the U.S. government was considering supporting. He was then sent on a mission to Italy, where he interviewed various physicists concerning the German <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> After the war, Berg was occasionally employed by the OSS's successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, but, by the mid-1950s, was unemployed. He spent the last two decades of his life without work, living with various siblings.|$|E

5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, {{the chief of the}} planning board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland made {{detailed}} {{plans to}} acquire and test nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Less {{than two weeks}} after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Swiss government started studying the possibility of building nuclear weapons, and continued its military <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> for 43 years until 1988. It has since signed and ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Switzerland never possessed biological or chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|The British {{governments of}} 1954–58 (under Conservatives Winston Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) also quietly {{resisted}} a test ban, despite the British public favoring a deal, until the US Congress approved expanded nuclear collaboration in 1958 and until after Britain had tested its first hydrogen bombs. In their view, testing was necessary if the UK <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> were {{to continue to}} develop. This opposition was tempered by concern that resistance to a test ban might lead the US and Soviet Union to pursue an agreement without Britain having any say in the matter.|$|E

5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anton was a {{scientist}} in Nazi Germany who, following a disagreement regarding {{the direction of}} its <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> is recruited by the US and flees via France, Spain, and Portugal. He becomes {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project, witnesses the tests, and travels to Hiroshima recording the aftermath. Anton regrets the consequences of the atomic bombs, attends the Pugwash Conference, but maintains his belief that it was necessary to end the war and prevented more deaths. He marries Sophie and becomes a professor at Columbia University in New York. With Sophie, he retires to a small town outside of Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E

North Korea had also agreed to turn off its main nuclear reactor this summer. [...] "One thing that we agreed on is that the D.P.R.K. will provide a full declaration of all of their <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and will disable their <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> {{by the end of this}} year, 2007", Hill told reporters.|$|R

5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He testified against the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, the United Nations Security Council {{has agreed}} {{resolution}} 1874 (2009) at its 6141 st meeting, on 12 June 2009. The {{decision was made}} by unanimous vote of {{all members of the}} Security Council. This action was done as a response of the Security Council to the nuclear test conducted by North Korea on 25 May 2009 (local time). Resolution 1874 (2009) was reaffirmed that the nuclear test that conducted by North Korea is a threat to international peace and security and in violation of resolution 1718 (2006). It contains some of economic sanctions and demands the North Korea to stop their <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and all related activities such as the nuclear test. The main problem that will be explained by this thesis is the influence of resolution 1874 (2009) to the North Korea’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs.</b> The purposes of this thesis are to find out and analyze the relevant data {{in order to understand the}} influence of resolution 1874 about the North Korea’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs</b> and also to reach my Bachelor’s degree at Atma Jaya Yogyakarta University. This research’s method was normative method with focus on norm (law in the book) and collected data by library research and by interviewing a capable informant. This thesis concludes that resolution 1874 (2009) has not given positive influence about the North Korea’s <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs.</b> Because the sanctions that it contain is not enough to take a pressure on the North Korea to stop its <b>nuclear</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{has since}} undertaken numerous missions during the Second Intifada and Operation Cast Lead. During the Second Lebanon War the Hammers flew 1,400 sorties, totalling 2,300 flying hours, {{more than any}} other IAF combat unit. During this conflict, the Ra'am's long range and endurance served it well in the close support role, as the aircraft could carry more munitions and remain on station longer than any other strike aircraft. It is these capabilities that place 69 Squadron at the forefront of Israel's strategic arm, and it is thus this unit that is reputed to have undertaken Operation Orchard, the destruction of a Syrian nuclear site on September 6, 2007. The squadron has also been linked to a possible Israeli strike against the Iranian <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|Through {{his opinion}} pieces and {{political}} fundraising, Ijaz has advocated for {{the integration of}} Muslims into the American political mainstream. He raised significant amounts for various Democratic Party causes during the 1990s when President Clinton had {{paved the way for}} minority communities to become more active in U.S. politics, encouraging fellow Pakistani and Muslim Americans to join his fundraising efforts along the way. In 1996, Ijaz raised or contributed more than $525,000 for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, bringing Ijaz into close proximity with Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Hillary Clinton as well as other Clinton administration national security officials with whom he would later engage on Sudan, Kashmir and Pakistan's <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Gore {{spoke out}} {{on a number of}} issues. In a 1992 speech on the Gulf War, Gore stated that he twice {{attempted}} to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to Saddam Hussein, citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning <b>nuclear</b> <b>program,</b> but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations. In the wake of the Al-Anfal Campaign, during which Hussein staged deadly mustard and nerve gas attacks on Kurdish Iraqis, Gore cosponsored the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, which would have cut all assistance to Iraq. The bill was defeated in part due to intense lobbying of Congress by the Reagan-Bush White House and a veto threat from President Reagan. In 1998, at a conference of APEC hosted by Malaysia, Gore objected to the indictment, arrest and jailing of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's longtime second-in-command Anwar Ibrahim, a move which received a negative response from leaders there. Ten years later, Gore again protested when Ibrahim was arrested a second time, a decision condemned by Malaysian foreign minister Datuk Seri Dr Rais Yatim.|$|E

5|$|Interest from {{military}} leaders for an airport at Banak returned in 1955. For {{the air force}} the main concern was {{that they could not}} reach the eastern-most parts of Norway from Bodø Main Air Station. This resulted in several Soviet infringements of Norwegian air space. Alternative locations were considered, such as Kautokeino, were there had been built a radar. NATO supported a reconstruction of Banak, partially raised by increased focus on flanking maneuver strategies, and also to serve {{as a part of the}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>program.</b> NATO was ready to provide funding in 1957, but by the Norwegian authorities wanted to delay its construction, citing lack of personnel to man the station and that it would not be usable in times of war. The government decided in 1957 to not allow nuclear warheads to be stored in Norway during peacetime, thus eliminating NATO's strategic need for Banak. The airport was therefore removed from the investment program.|$|E
5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning <b>nuclear</b> <b>program</b> under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E
