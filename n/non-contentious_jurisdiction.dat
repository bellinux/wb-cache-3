40|$|In an {{important}} {{article in the}} Yale Law Journal, James Pfander and Daniel Birk claim that adverseness is not required by Article III for cases arising under federal law. This Article takes the position that Pfander and Birk have not {{made the case for}} reconsidering adversity requirements for Article III cases. Adverseness may be present when there is adversity of legal interests, even when adverse argument is not present. From this perspective, a number of Pfander and Birk’s examples of <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> manifested adverseness. In rem-type proceedings such as bankruptcy and prize cases required the determination of adverse interests, in situations where impediments often existed to voluntary extrajudicial resolution. Service or notice in some form was generally provided, which gave opportunities for adverse argument. In addition, the issuance of warrants, while ex parte, involved adverse interests in a context where predeprivation notice would undermine the utility of the proceeding, notice occurred on execution of the warrant, and opportunity for argument was then often available. Pfander and Birk’s examples of pension and naturalization determinations are not as readily characterized as adverse. The Court, however, treated federal judges’ pension determinations as appropriate, if at all, as the work of individual commissioners rather than Article III judges. Naturalization petitions are perhaps Pfander and Birk’s best example of <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> but the Court explicitly approved the practice as appropriate under Article III only after provisions for notice to, and potential appearance by, the United States...|$|E
40|$|Scholars and jurists {{have long}} sought an {{explanation}} for why the Framers of Article III distinguished “Cases” from “Controversies. ” In a previous article that cataloged the exercise of federal jurisdiction over uncontested matters, such as pension claims, warrant applications, and naturalization proceedings, we tried to provide an answer to this question. We suggested that, at least as to “cases” arising under federal law, the federal courts could exercise what Roman and civil lawyers called <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> or, {{in the words of}} Chief Justice Marshall, could hear uncontested claims of right in the form prescribed by law. As for “controversies,” by contrast, the federal courts were limited to the adjudication of disputes between parties aligned as Article III specifies. Much that seems strange about the practice of federal jurisdiction becomes clear when viewed in light of our proposed interpretation. Thus, our Article accounts not only for the difference in Article III’s text, but also for the refusal of the federal courts to hear uncontested matters of state law, such as some probate and domestic relations proceedings. Our account also calls into question the claim that Article III embeds inflexible “injury” and “adverse-party” requirements in the definition of judicial power. It was those claims that triggered the response from Professor Ann Woolhandler, to which this Article briefly replies. Woolhandler argues that Article III requires not adverse parties, so much, as adverse interests. In the course of doing so, she embraces a late nineteenth-century revisionism that twisted the meaning of Article III. In the end, however, she fails to offer a coherent theory of the text of Article III or to explain why her newfangled adverse-interest construct better explains the history of judicial practice than the eighteenth-century construct of <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> with which the Framers were familiar...|$|E
40|$|Scholars and jurists {{have long}} debated {{the origins and}} current scope of the {{so-called}} domestic relations exception to Article III. Rooted in the perception that certain family law matters lie beyond {{the power of the}} federal courts, the exception was first articulated in the nineteenth-century decisional law of the Supreme Court and has perplexed observers ever since. Scholarly debate continues, despite the Court’s twentieth-century decision to place the exception firmly on statutory grounds in an effort to limit its potentially disruptive force. This Article offers a novel, historically grounded account of the domestic relations exception, connecting its origins to the Article III distinction between “cases” and “controversies. ” Much domestic relations law fails to present a “controversy” within the meaning of Article III; the consensual nature of many status-altering acts (marriage, consensual divorce, adoption) forecloses a federal dispute-resolution role. But when federal courts hear “cases” arising under federal law, they have full power to exercise both contentious and (what Roman and civil lawyers refer to as) <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b> Our non-contentious account explains a range of puzzles, including why Article III courts can issue decrees {{at the core of the}} domestic relations exception when the matter at hand implicates federal law...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} efforts of {{successive}} Governments of both persuasions to reform the ancient jurisdiction of the spiritual courts over the validity of wills of personal property. Those non-partisan efforts spanned three decades and resulted in the 1857 Court of Probate Act. A Royal Commission, reporting in 1832, recommended in effect that the jurisdiction be centralised in London by transferring it from the Province of York and from the diocesan and inferior courts to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury at Doctors' Commons, where the specialist civilian lawyers practised their separate and monopolistic body of law. Because the Real Property Commission preferred a secular solution, the 1832 Report was endorsed by a Commons Select Committee in 1833 and modified by a Lords Select Committee in 1836 to allow a limited <b>non-contentious</b> local <b>jurisdiction...</b>|$|R
40|$|The subject. This essay {{describes}} the procedural treatment of non-contentious matters in Italy. After a brief historical recount {{on the evolution}} of the concept of ‘non-contentious jurisdiction’, from Roman law to the law in force, the chapter emphasizes the extreme variety of non-adverse proceedings governed by the Code of civil procedure and special statutes as well. The purpose of the article is to understand the ‘default rules’ of non-adverse proceedings (meaning the rules applicable insofar as the law does not ordain otherwise) provided by the Code of civil procedure. These rules outline a procedure in chambers that is simpler and less time-consuming than the ordinary one: for these reasons, the procedure in chambers has been increasingly adopted for the judicial treatment of a few contentious matters, with mixed results. Methodology. The methodological basis for the study: general scientific methods (analysis, synthesis, comparison, description); private and academic (comparative legal, interpretation, formal-legal). Results. It is difficult to foresee whether in the near future more attention will be devoted by Italian legislators to <b>non-contentious</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> so as to lay down rules that are uniform and consistent. In recent decades, Italian civil procedure has been re-written again and again in the attempt to solve the most serious and enduring problem of the justice system, namely, the excessive length of proceedings. Conclusions. As far as non-contentious matters, in light of the notorious overload of Italian courts the author believes that they could be handles more efficiently by administrative authorities. </p...|$|E
