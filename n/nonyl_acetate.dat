40|$|Graduation date: 1967 New syntheses for 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonanone and 7 -bicyclo-(3. 3. 1) nonen- 2 -one were developed. The {{saturated}} ketone {{was prepared}} from phenol and acrylonitrile via a novel intramolecular S[subscript N] 2 cyclization process. A Friedel-Crafts cyclization of 3 -(3 -cyclohexenyl) propanoyl chloride permitted {{synthesis of the}} unsaturated ketone from 4 -cyclohexene carboxaldehyde. The formation of the bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonane rather than a bicyclo(3. 2. 2) nonane skeleton in the Friedel-Crafts cyclization was proven by comparative mass spectrometry. An attempt to prepare 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) <b>nonyl</b> <b>acetate</b> by solvolysis of 3 -(3 -cyclohexenyl) propyl tosylate led only to monocyclic products. The influence of the proximity of carbons 3 and 7 on the chemistry of the bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonane ring was studied via the transannular reactions from 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonene oxide. This epoxide was shown to be the exo- 2, 3 -epoxide by reduction to the known exo- 2 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonanol. Solvolysis of the epoxide in trifluoroacetic acid gave almost exclusively 7 -bicyclo(3. 3. 1) nonenexo- 2 -ol. Solvolysis in acetic acid-sodium acetate gave 20...|$|E
40|$|Background The {{mosquito}} Anopheles funestus {{is one of}} {{the major}} malaria vector species in sub-Saharan Africa. Olfaction is essential in guiding mosquito behaviors. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception. An improved understanding of the function of malaria mosquito OBPs may contribute to identifying new attractants/repellents and assist in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly mosquito controlling strategies. Methodology In this study, a large screening of over 50 ecologically significant odorant compounds led to the identification of 12 ligands that elicit significant electroantennographic (EAG) responses from An. funestus female antennae. To compare the absolute efficiency/potency of these chemicals, corrections were made for differences in volatility by determining the exact amount in a stimulus puff. Fourteen AfunOBP genes were cloned and their expression patterns were analyzed. AfunOBP 1, 3, 7, 20 and 66 showed olfactory tissue specificity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that among olfactory-specific OBPs, AfunOBP 1 and 3 are the most enriched OBPs in female antennae. Binding assay experiments showed that at pH 7, AfunOBP 1 significantly binds to 2 -undecanone, <b>nonyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> octyl acetate and 1 -octen- 3 -ol but AfunOBP 3, which shares 68...|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} the concentration-detection (i. e., psychometric) functions for the eye irritation evoked by three homologous n-alcohols (1 -nonanol, 1 -decanol and 1 -undecanol) and two homologous <b>acetates</b> (<b>nonyl</b> and decyl <b>acetate).</b> A vapor delivery device {{based on a}} dynamic dilution of stimuli in nitrogen served to present various concentrations of each compound, including the undiluted vapor, to the subjects (n >= 26). Delivered concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography. Detection probability (P) was assessed via a three-alternative, forced-choice procedure and quantified on a scale ranging from P = 0. 0 (chance detection) to P = 1. 0 (perfect detection). Flow rate to the eye equaled 2. 5 l/min and time of exposure was 6 s. The functions for 1 -undecanol and decyl acetate plateaued at P approximate to 0. 5 and P approximate to 0. 25, respectively, such that further increases in concentration failed to increase detection notably. Thus, both series reached a break point, or cut-off, in the detection of ocular irritation. The present outcome provides additional evidence that the cut-off does not rest on the low vapor concentration of the homolog but, more likely, on the homolog exceeding a critical molecular dimension(s), which prevents it from interacting effectively with the appropriate receptors...|$|R
