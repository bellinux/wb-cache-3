A question arises of what is the optimal use of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> as a transportation fuel. Is it more efficient to use <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in a stationary power application to generate electricity to charge electric vehicles, compress <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> for onboard combustion in vehicles, or re-form <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> into a denser transportation fuel? This study investigates the well-to-wheels energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from various <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to transportation fuel pathways and compares the results to conventional gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles using the US electrical generation mix. Specifically, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> vehicles running on compressed <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are compared against electric vehicles charged with electricity produced solely from <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> combustion in stationary power plants.
