The system features a non-compulsory three-year kindergarten, followed by a compulsory six-year primary education, a compulsory three-year junior secondary education, a non-compulsory two-year senior secondary education leading to the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examinations and a two-year matriculation course leading to the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examinations. The New Senior Secondary academic structure and curriculum was implemented in September 2009, which provides for all students to receive three years of compulsory junior and three years of compulsory senior secondary education.

5|$|Notosusanto {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Fourth Development Cabinet when it was formed on 16 March 1983, {{replacing}} outgoing minister Daud Jusuf and taking office three days later. During his two years as minister he worked on several programmes, including compulsory education and student selection systems. He also instituted a <b>new</b> <b>curriculum,</b> replacing the one which had been in use since 1975 and promoting the humanities. Concurrently with his work as Minister of Education and Culture, Notosusanto served as rector of UI; students were disapproving of his selection, considering him a military official sent to limit their freedom. He died at his Jakarta home on 3 June 1985 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage and was buried at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery.

40|$|The Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia {{underwent}} a major curriculum reform in 2005. There {{is a necessity}} to evaluate the <b>new</b> <b>curriculum’s</b> educational environment, {{as a part of}} the curriculum evaluation. In June 2007, the DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure) was administered to 210 second year students with an innovative curriculum and 259 third year students with the more traditional curriculum, to measure the students’ perceptions of the educational environment. One of the most significant differences between the perceptions of the two groups is that there are less cheating problems in the second year, but the third year is better timetabled. The almost similar profiles indicate that the <b>new</b> <b>curriculum’s</b> educational environment has not improved significantly. It is related with problems in managing and organizing the <b>new</b> <b>curriculum’s</b> detail aspects. The institution needs to re-evaluate the perceptions of the educational environment when the curriculum is more internalised.
