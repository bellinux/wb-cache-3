The muc 2 genes were predominantly transcribed in the intestinal region while the different genes in the muc 5 family were mainly transcribed in either skin, gill or pyloric caeca.

In the first experiment, handling stress induced mucin transcription in the gill, while transcription decreased in the skin and intestine. In the second experiment, long term intensive rearing conditions (fish biomass ~ 125 kg/m 3) interrupted by additional confinement led to increased transcription of mucin genes in the skin at one, seven and fourteen days post-confinement...|$|R

We <b>have</b> identified novel <b>MUC</b> 1 class I peptides that bind to HLA-A* 0201 molecules with significantly higher affinity and function than the native MUC 1 peptides. These peptides elicited CTLs from normal donors, as well as breast cancer patients, which were highly effective in killing MUC 1 -expressing MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. Each peptide elicited lytic responses in greater than 6 / 8 of normal individuals and 3 / 3 breast cancer patients.

MUC 7 mRNA expression, however, was limited to only muscle-invasive disease similar to the membrane-bound mucins described above. In a small proportion of patients in the recurrent progressive TMA, expression of MUC 4, MUC 5 AC and MUC 5 B in penultimate superficial tumours prior to tumour progression allowed prediction of impending disease progression to muscle invasive disease.   MUC 5 B, MUC 12 and MUC 13 were expressed at higher incidence in the single non-recurrent TMA, compared with the incidence of expression in the recurrent non-progressive TMA.

The α subunits are fully exposed at the cell surface and contain variable numbers of repeated amino acid sequences that are heavily glycosylated. In contrast, the β subunits are much smaller and are anchored within the cell membrane, with their amino-terminal portions exposed at the cell surface and their carboxy-terminal tails facing the cytosol. Studies {{over the last several}} years are challenging the long-held belief that α subunits play the predominant role in cancer by conferring cellular properties that allow tumor cells to evade immune recognition and destruction. Indeed, the β subunits of MUC 1 and <b>MUC</b> 4 <b>have</b> emerged <b>as</b> oncogenes, as they engage signaling pathways responsible for tumor initiation and progression. Thus, a switch in the emphasis from the large α to the small β subunits offers attractive possibilities for successful clinical application. Such a focus shift is further supported by the absence of allelic polymorphism and variable glycosylation in the β subunit as well as by the presence of the β subunit in most MUC 1 and MUC 4 isoforms expressed by tumors. MUC 1 α, also known as CA 15. 3, is a Food and Drug Administration-approved serum biomarker for breast cancer, but its use is no longer recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
