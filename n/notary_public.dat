5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to be a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E

The vice-coordinator of the campaign insisted that the boxes be opened and the contents catalogued and witnessed by the <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> before they were brought inside. A verbal confrontation ensued; during this confrontation, the boxes were opened and {{it was found that}} they were almost empty and contained only a handful of copies of documents the PRD had made public previously, and three CDs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the functions of}} <b>public</b> <b>notaries,</b> {{the evolution of the}} institution in Europe and its legal features in contemporary European law. The basic normative solutions of the German, Austrian, French, Italian, Hungarian, Slovakian, Slovenian and Croatian law are outlined. The importance of the European law on <b>notaries</b> <b>public</b> is also stressed, which aims to further the cooperation between national chambers on <b>notaries</b> <b>public</b> on European scale, in order to facilitate the cross-border transactions within the territory of the European Union. The gist of the converging common European rules pertaining to <b>notaries</b> <b>public</b> are the principle of independence of notaries and the principle of legality, which means that the notaries are in the performance of their duties bound only by the norms of civil substantive and procedure law. <b>Notaries</b> <b>public</b> perform also a function of public service, since they provide assistance to citizens in drafting their public instruments and private deeds (juridical acts and statements), that produce the required evidentiary strength. Depending on whether a given requirement of form of juridical act can be met only by the assistance of <b>notaries</b> <b>public</b> or by other public bodies, one may distinguish exclusively notarial acts from competing forms of juridical acts...|$|R

25|$|Unfortunately, {{there were}} accusations that both G.W. Lee and the Shoe-wae-cae-mette crew were not amateurs. This led in 1879 to a new, tighter, {{definition}} of amateurism (see above) and {{a requirement that}} any entries from outside the United Kingdom must be made on or before 1 March and must be ‘accompanied by a declaration made before <b>Notary</b> <b>Public</b> {{with regard to the}} profession of each member of the crew’, and this must be certified by the British Consul, the mayor, or the chief authority of the locality.|$|E
25|$|The Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia is vested with {{a number}} of {{governmental}} duties. One such task unique to the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia is authenticating with the Great Seal of British Columbia notarized documents to be used outside of the province. However, the issuance of a Certificate of Authentication only means the signature of the <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> matched the ones on file and not the authenticity or truthfulness of the texts themselves. Because Canada is not a signatory state to the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, this procedure is simply called authentication instead of apostille.|$|E
25|$|Herseni was {{a native}} of Transylvania, which, for most of his childhood, was an Austro-Hungarian province. His home village was Iași (Jás), in what was then Brassó County (present-day Brașov County), where his father worked as a <b>notary</b> <b>public.</b> On his {{paternal}} side, Herseni originated from nearby Hârseni, which gave the family its name. Born on February 20, 1907, Herseni went to school in Iași (1912–1915) and Făgăraș (1915–1924). These years coincided with World War I and the recognition of Transylvania's union with Romania: Herseni began his secondary education in a Hungarian-speaking regimen, and passed his baccalaureate examination in 1924, as a Romanian national.|$|E

25|$|In July 2011, the Constitutional Court {{ruled in}} a {{historic}} decision, that same-sex couples {{have the right to}} marry in Colombia. The Colombian Congress had to create an equivalent of marriage for same-sex couples by 20 June 2013, or else couples would automatically gain the right to go to any judge or <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> to formalise their union, according to the ruling. As the Colombia Congress failed to pass a same-sex marriage bill, the courts instead began approving marriages themselves. The same-sex marriage issue once again came before the Constitutional Court in 2015 after the country's Inspector General requested that the Court invalidate all the same-sex marriages approved in Colombia. A hearing took place in July 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Kafala system {{involves}} a sponsor {{who has the}} legal responsibility for a migrant domestic worker during a contract period, making the worker dependent upon the sponsor. The Kafala system is not legally binding in Lebanon because recruiters cannot act as a sponsor. Instead the system {{is made up of}} a number for administrative regulations, customary practices and legal requirements which bind the worker to the recruiter temporarily.. Once in Lebanon, the migrant domestic worker is assigned an employer. A worker may not change employer or break the terms of the contract unless the employer signs a release waiver. This must be done before a <b>notary</b> <b>public</b> and Lebanese authorities give an official release. A worker becomes illegal if they leave without the consent of their sponsor and the official release from the authorities. Human Rights Watch has said that the Kafala system in Lebanon puts workers at risk of exploitation and abuse, while Anti-Slavery International has said that the system {{is one of the major}} causes of vulnerability of migrant workers. The Kafala system means that the sponsor of the migrant domestic worker is legally responsible for the migrant and the state's responsibility for 'alien surveillance' is then passed on to the employer.|$|E
