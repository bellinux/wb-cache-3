5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible,</b> as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|For the German side, {{the battle}} left the 18th Army very {{stretched}} and exhausted. Lacking sufficient reinforcements, {{the command of}} Army Group North {{made the decision to}} shorten the front line by evacuating the Demyansk Pocket salient. The salient had been held throughout 1942, despite being encircled for a few months, as it was an important strategic bridgehead. Together with the Rzhev salient (which was also evacuated in spring 1943), it could potentially be used to encircle a large number of Soviet forces. However, in the situation that had developed, retaining it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> {{for active}} parliamentarians {{to sit on}} the committee, except for the last half year of {{parliamentary}} representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election.

The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E
5|$|NASA's {{original}} plan for safely de-orbiting Hubble was {{to retrieve it}} using a space shuttle. Hubble would then have most likely been displayed in the Smithsonian Institution.

Instead, NASA considered adding an external propulsion module to allow controlled re-entry.

5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> for the Germans to sail her to a major port.|$|E

During the night of 28 April, General Wenck {{reported}} to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front and it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> for his army to relieve Berlin. Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.|$|E

5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing {{synthetic oil}} and gasoline {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible.</b> Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course of an article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage {{and the demands of}} the war in the Pacific, it was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible</b> to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the division in the Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the division in the Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th Division in the Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E

5|$|The United Kingdom {{possessed the}} largest navy {{in the world}} for the whole of the ironclad period. The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them {{worldwide}} in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>possible,</b> so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the Devastation class. These 'breastwork monitors' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages—a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough Devastation-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act, which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.|$|E
