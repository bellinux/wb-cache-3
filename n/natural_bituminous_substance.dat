25|$|Amber is {{heterogeneous}} in composition, but {{consists of}} several resinous bodies {{more or less}} soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform, associated with an insoluble <b>bituminous</b> <b>substance.</b> Amber is a macromolecule by free radical polymerization of several precursors in the labdane family, e.g. communic acid, cummunol, and biformene. These labdanes are diterpenes (C20H32) and trienes, equipping the organic skeleton with three alkene groups for polymerization. As amber matures over the years, more polymerization takes place as well as isomerization reactions, crosslinking and cyclization.|$|R

50|$|His {{position}} {{as the head of}} the large chemical works, iron furnaces and machine shops upon the great estate of Count Hugo secured to him excellent opportunities for conducting large-scale experimental research. From 1830 to 1834 he investigated complex products of the distillation of organic substances such as coal and wood tar, discovering a number of valuable hydrocarbon compounds including creosote, paraffin, eupione and phenol (antiseptics), pittacal and cidreret (synthetic dyestuffs), picamar (a perfume base), assamar, capnomor, and others. Under the name of eupione, Reichenbach included the mixture of hydrocarbon oils now known as waxy paraffin or coal oils. In his paper describing the substance, first published in the Neues Jahrbuch der Chemie und Physik, B, ii, he dwelt upon the economical importance of this and of its associate paraffins, whenever the methods of separating them cheaply from <b>natural</b> <b>bituminous</b> compounds would be established.|$|R

Besides, it was alleged that the sulphureous and nitrous particles that are often found {{to be in the}} coal, with that <b>bituminous</b> <b>substance</b> which burns, are all assisting to clear and purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to breathe in, after the noxious particles (as above) are dispersed and burnt up.|$|R

The Medieval English term [...] "mummy" [...] was defined as [...] "medical preparation of the substance of mummies", rather than the entire corpse, with Richard Hakluyt in 1599 CE complaining that [...] "these dead bodies are the Mummy which the Phisistians and Apothecaries doe against our willes make us to swallow".

25|$|In {{order to}} obtain alum from alunite, it is {{calcined}} and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize. The alum schists employed {{in the manufacture of}} alum are mixtures of iron pyrite, aluminium silicate and various <b>bituminous</b> <b>substances,</b> and are found in upper Bavaria, Bohemia, Belgium, and Scotland. These are either roasted or exposed to the weathering action of the air. In the roasting process, sulfuric acid is formed and acts on the clay to form aluminium sulfate, a similar condition of affairs being produced during weathering. The mass is now systematically extracted with water, and a solution of aluminium sulfate of specific gravity 1.16 is prepared. This solution is allowed to stand for some time (in order that any calcium sulfate and basic ferric sulfate may separate), and is then evaporated until ferrous sulfate crystallizes on cooling; it is then drawn off and evaporated until it attains a specific gravity of 1.40. It is now allowed to stand for some time, decanted from any sediment, and finally mixed with the calculated quantity of potassium sulfate, well agitated, and the alum is thrown down as a finely divided precipitate of alum meal. If much iron should be present in the shale then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.|$|R
40|$|No {{reliable}} data {{exist on}} the beginning {{of work in the}} asphalt mine at Škrip, however, we suppose it could have been in mid-eighteenth century. Later on, about the year 1780, entrepreneurs got permission to excavate asphalt also on minor locations in the vicinity. In 19 th century, particularly by the middle of this century, production of <b>natural</b> bitumen from <b>bituminous</b> dolomites was intensified and it was carried out in two round furnaces. Natural bitumen was used in the Adriatic region, particularly in Venice. Searching for asphalt, miners of those times made a mine, i. e. an inclines of some 300 m length with the approximate altitude difference of 40 m, and shorter lateral galleries and inclines in the length of further 300 m. Bitumen is differently infiltrated and/or impregnated in dolomites. Due to this relatively variable stockwork, exploitation was probably terminated by the year 1874. A later try of exploitation with two shorter adits not meet the expected results (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} whether changes in persistence have occurred during the long-run evolution of U. S. prices of the non-renewable energy resources crude oil, <b>natural</b> gas and <b>bituminous</b> coal. Our main contribution is to allow for a structural break when testing for a break in persistence, thus disentangling the effect of a deterministic break from that of a stochastic break and advancing the existing literature on the persistence properties of non-renewable resource prices. The results clearly demonstrate the importance of specifying a structural break when testing for breaks in persistence, whereas our findings are robust to the exact date of the structural break. Our analysis yields that coal and natural gas prices are trend stationary throughout their evolution, while oil prices exhibit a break in persistence during the 1970 s. The findings suggest that especially the coal market has remained fundamentals-driven, whereas for the oil market exogenous shocks have become dominant. Thus, our results are consequential for the treatment of energy resource prices in both causal analysis and forecasting. non-renewable resource prices, primary energy, persistence, structural breaks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{potential}} {{impacts of}} climate change, recent world events, and a dramatic rise {{in oil prices}} have resulted in renewed interest in alternative transportation fuels. When considering the many options, tradeoffs exist between environmental, energy security and economic concerns. A portfolio of multiple alternatives that balances these concerns {{may turn out to}} be the most prudent. In particular, the coupling of conventional and non-conventional fossil resources with carbon sequestration and renewable biomass may mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil carbon-intensive resources, while providing economic and security benefits. To achieve this result, it is very desirable that all resources employed produce fungible fuel blending components, so that single, specificationfuels can be easily supplied. As a first step in examining the alternatives, it is necessary to establish baseline lifecycle greenhouse-gas emissions profiles for current and future alternative-transportation fuel supply-chains. JM Energy Consulting has been working with clients involved in development of alternative fuels technology to establish such baselines. This paper presents some results from these analyses, which examine both conventional and non-conventional resources for the production of jet and automotive diesel fuels. The primary focus here is on the upgrading/refining step that converts the energy resource as produced into finished distillate fuels. A bottom-up approach is taken to estimating GHG emissions using process-level data and models. This approach not only allows the carbon footprint of the various fuel chains to be distinguished, but also provides valuable insights relative to the carbon intensity of the various upgrading and refining steps required to produce specification distillate fuel blends. Resources considered here are seven classes of conventional crude oils, bitumen, shale oil, and three XtL feedstocks, <b>natural</b> gas, <b>bituminous</b> and subbituminous coal. Also briefly discussed are opportunities for co-processing of sustainable biomass resources and the capture and sequestration of CO 2 generated during processing...|$|R
40|$|Fly {{and bottom}} ashes {{are the main}} {{by-products}} arising from the combustion of solid biomass. Since the production of energy from this source is increasing, the processing and disposal of the resulting ashes has become an environmental and economic issue. Such ashes are of interest as a construction material because they are composed of very fine particles similar to fillers normally employed in bituminous and cementitious mixtures. This research investigates the potential use of ash from biomass as filler in bituminous mixtures. The morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of 21 different ashes and two traditional fillers (calcium carbonate and ‘‘recovered'' plant filler) were evaluated and discussed. Leaching tests, performed in order to quantify the release of pollutants, revealed that five ashes do not comply with the Italian environmental re-use limits. Experimental results show {{a wide range of}} values for almost all the investigated properties and a low correlation with biomass type in terms of origin and chemical composition. Furthermore, sieving and milling processes were found to improve the properties of the raw material in terms of grading and sample porosity. The effectiveness of these treatments and the low content of organic matter and harmful fines suggest that most of the biomass ashes investigated may be regarded as potential replacements for <b>natural</b> filler in <b>bituminous</b> mixture...|$|R
40|$|Bottom ashes {{derived from}} an Italian Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator (MSWI) were {{vitrified}} at 1450 °C and subsequently {{employed in the}} laboratory, after adequate size reduction, as sand fractions in partial or total substitution of <b>natural</b> aggregates in <b>bituminous</b> mixtures for road pavements. The experimental plan focused on the effects associated to variations both of the binder content (4. 5 - 5. 5 %) and {{of the percentage of}} sand substitution with vitrified MSWI ashes (comprised between 0 and 100 %). Investigations were carried out by considering performance-related compaction, volumetric and mechanical properties which were assessed in the laboratory by employing a number of different characterization techniques. It was observed that the key factor which allows a detailed interpretation of test results is the minimum absorption which takes place within the mixtures at the vitrified ash-bitumen interface. As a consequence, mixtures with this type of secondary (recycled) aggregate may lead to substantial savings associated to the reduction of binder dosage and to consequent economical and environmental advantages. Even though mixtures containing vitrified MSWI ashes still need to be thoroughly investigated with a special attention devoted to mix-design and moisture susceptibility issues, the results obtained in this study appear to be promising. The presence of vitrified ashes does not negatively affect the stiffness and fatigue failure properties of the mixtures, while benefits deriving from their high angle of internal friction may be beneficial with respect to resistance to accumulation of permanent deformatio...|$|R
40|$|Fly {{and bottom}} ash {{are the main}} {{by-products}} arising from the combustion of solid biomass. Since the production of energy from this source is increasing worldwide, the processing and disposal of the resulting ash have become environmental and economic issues. Fly and bottom ash are of interest as a construction material because they are composed of very fine particles similar to the fillers normally employed in bituminous and cementitious mixtures. This research investigates the potential use of ash from biomass combustion as filler in bituminous mixtures. The morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of twenty-one different types of ash and two traditional fillers (calcium carbonate and a recovered bituminous mixtures plant filler) were evaluated and discussed. Based on this characterization, several types of ash were selected in order to cover {{the whole range of}} morphological, physical and chemical properties. These ashes were subsequently used to create bituminous mastics (filler-bitumen blends), which were studied with the aim of obtaining indicators of bituminous mixture performance. A variety of rheological tests were performed to evaluate workability, rutting resistance, fatigue resistance, low temperature cracking resistance and moisture damage resistance of bituminous mastics. Experimental results showed a wide range of values for almost all the characteristics of the ash and a low correlation with biomass type in terms of origin and chemical composition. A sieving process was found to be necessary in order to improve the properties of the raw materials in terms of grading. Furthermore, mastics containing ashes with high values of porosity of a compacted sample of dry filler (Rigden voids) were found to have low workability, fatigue resistance and low temperature cracking resistance. It was found that in order to limit the Rigden voids values, a milling process should be adopted before biomass ashes reuse. The low content of organic matter and harmful fines and the effectiveness of sieving and milling treatments suggest that biomass ash may be considered as replacements for <b>natural</b> fillers in <b>bituminous</b> mixture...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{management}} of wastewater {{is a challenge}} for the cities in developing countries. The discharges of untreated wastewater into the urban rivers have huge impacts on public health as well as entire ecosystem of the earth. Therefore, treatment of wastewater {{is essential for the}} reduction of impacts on environment. Wastewater treatment plants remove the pollutant from the wastewater and thus reduce the pollutant load on the receiving water body. However the raw materials and energy required to build and operate the wastewater treatment systems also contribute to environmental burdens. Thereafter, the net environmental benefit of the wastewater treatment system can only be perceived by taking into account entire life cycle phases of the wastewater treatment system viz; construction, operation and demolition phases. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) {{has been used as a}} tool for the sustainability assessment of small-scale decentralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) commonly used in developing countries. LCA is supportive to analyze the environmental burdens of WWTP that need to be a part of decision-making process towards sustainability. Life cycle assessment is known as cradle-to-grave analysis. LCA is a compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impact of a product system throughout its life cycle. The overall objective of the study is to analyze the environmental performance of the representative small-scale decentralized sanitation system. In this study three-wastewater treatment scenario that consists of a combination of different small scale decentralized treatment methods are considered. The design capacities of the treatment modules used in the present study are 10 m 3 /day and 50 m 3 /day. The three Decentralized Wastewater Treatment (DEWATS) modules considered for the study are: 1) module 1 (DM 1) consisting of Settler (S), Anaerobic Baffled Reactor (ABR), and Planted Gravel Filter (PGF), 2) module 2 (DM 2) consisting of S, PGF and Collection Tank (CT) and 3) module 3 (DM 3) consisting of S and PGF. The Life Cycle Assessment was carried out as per ISO standards 14040 - 14044. In this study only the construction and operational phase was taken into account. The functional unit for this study is the treatment of wastewater generated by person equivalent over a period of 20 years. In all modules, the greenhouse gas contribution (GWP) from the construction phase is 95 % and 5 % from operational stage. Acidification potential (AP) and Ozone layer depletion potential (ODP) are found to be 100 % in construction periods. Among the treatment units, ABR has significant contribution to the eutrophication potential (EP). The other units like PGF, S and CT are responsible to the impact categories of AP, ODP and GWP. The study shows that configuration of the treatment units have an impact in the environmental performance. However, the more units the more environmental load is observed during the construction phase. On the other hand, increased in the units or treatment steps or modules increases the performance of system and hence decreases the environmental impacts of the whole system and vice versa. The production process of cement clinker, electricity, <b>natural</b> gas, brick, <b>bituminous</b> coal and transportation are responsible for the main impact during the construction phase. Based on the evaluation of three DEWATS modules, it cannot be said, which module is best, but the findings herein can support the decision-making process towards more sustainable DEWATS system...|$|R
