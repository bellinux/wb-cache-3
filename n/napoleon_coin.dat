5000|$|Jean-Pierre Droz (1746 - 1823) was a coin and medal {{engraver}} born in Switzerland {{and trained}} in Paris. Droz was most known for engraving the <b>Napoléon</b> <b>coin</b> at the Paris Mint.

In 1789, Droz devised a collar used to engrave the sides of coins and ensure a circular shape, and though it was unsuitable for large amounts of coins, it remained in use at the Soho Mint.|$|E
25|$|Copper coins {{were rarely}} issued between 1801 and 1848, so the quarter franc {{was the lowest}} current {{denomination}} in circulation.

50|$|Napoleon {{tried to}} unify Europe and almost succeeded, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} the coinage. The <b>Napoleon</b> <b>coin</b> was first authorized by a Monetary Ordinance of 28 March 1803 by the Premier Consul (First Consul) Napoleon Bonaparte. The 20 franc gold pieces which he authorized in 1803, became the model of all the coins of the Latin Monetary Union which circulated in Europe until 1914. The French coin carries the effigy, in profile, Napoleon, who would later become the French Emperor. The coins had the same value as the Louis, which bears the likeness of the pre-French Revolution King Louis XIV. For Napoleon, there were ostensibly seven types or varieties of the coins minted. In general the varieties differed in terms of obverse legend, reverse legends, portraiture, and calendaring system. For each variety, there was a new enabling statute or executive decree: 28 March 1803; 7 April 1803; 26 June 1804; 8 September 1805; 11 February 1807; 5 August 1807; and 22 October 1808. By extension, the term ‘‘Napoleon’’ is applied today to all the various types of 20 franc French gold pieces.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the return of {{investment}} in gold assets quoted at the Paris stock exchange during 54 years, from 1950 to 2003. Contrarily to what is thought about this mythical metal, its risk-return is very inferior to other financial assets (stocks and bonds). While it has {{a high degree of}} risk, its return is less than that of the risk-free asset. Moreover for individual investors, investment in gold has given a very low result in real terms. A capital of 100 new francs invested in the gold <b>coin</b> <b>napoleon</b> in December 1949 would have been liquidated for 56 new francs in December 2003. So its real rate of return was - 1 % per year. " (author's abstract...|$|R
25|$|On 1 April 1850 {{the auction}} was {{announced}} of equipment from the defunct Soho Mint, created by Matthew Boulton around 1788. At the auction on 29 April Ralph Heaton II bought the four steam-powered screw presses and six planchet presses for making blanks from strip metal. These were {{installed at the}} Bath Street works, and in that year trade tokens were struck for use in Australia. In 1851 coins were struck for Chile using the letter H as a mintmark. The same year copper planchets were made for the Royal Mint to make into pennies, halfpennies, farthings, half-farthings and quarter-farthings. In 1852 the Mint won a contract to produce {{a new series of}} coins for France. In this the Mint pioneered the minting of bronze. Ralph Heaton III (son of Ralph II) took key workers to Marseilles to equip and operate the French mint there, staying to fulfil the contract, and producing 750 tons of <b>Napoléon</b> III bronze <b>coins</b> from 1853 to 1857.|$|R
5000|$|The Napoléon is the colloquial {{term for}} a former French gold coin. The coins were minted (at various times) in {{denominations}} of 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, and 100 francs. This article focuses on the 20 franc coins issued {{during the reign of}} Napoléon Bonaparte, which are 21 mm in diameter, weigh 6.45 grams (gross weight) and, at 90% pure, contain 0.1867 troy ounces or 5.805 grams of pure gold. The coin was issued during the reign of Napoleon I and features his portrait on the obverse. The denomination (known as the Franc Germinal) continued in use through the 19th century and later French gold coins in the same denomination were generally referred to as [...] "Napoléons". Earlier French gold coins are referred to as Louis (the name of eighteen French kings) or écu (an old French word for shield). Gold Napoléons have historically proven more resilient than other gold coins to economic forces, such as after the Suez crisis when unlike other <b>coins</b> <b>Napoléons</b> did not weaken.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{depicts the}} history of using money in Montenegro {{covering}} the period before the Christ until nowadays. Montenegro mostly used foreign currencies throughout its long history, these being Roman, Austro-Hungarian, Turkish, Venetian, and even the <b>Napoleon</b> (French gold <b>coin)</b> money. The first ideas for Montenegro’s own money came from the Bishop Petar Petrovic Njegoš in the 19 th century. The first Montenegrin money, the Perper, was minted in 1906. The King Nikola`s Decree as of 11 April 1906 authorized the Ministry of Finance to mint the nickel and bronze coins. Silver and gold coins were minted later. The Perper disappeared from the scene with Montenegro’s joining the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, putting into circulation the Dinar, a currency of the newly established state. Montenegro, {{being a part of}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, used the Dinar as its currency after World War II until 1999. Dual currency system consisting of the German Mark and the Dinar was introduced in late 1999, whereby the German Mark became the only legal tender in 2001. With the introduction of the Euro the German Mark was replaced and the Euro became the official means of payment...|$|R
