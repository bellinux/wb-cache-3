Short-term biocompatibility {{was assessed using}} pure <b>CaP</b> <b>discs</b> and <b>CaP</b> <b>discs</b> incorporating PLGA microparticles (20 % w/w) with and without preincubation in water. Long-term biocompatibility was assessed using <b>CaP</b> <b>discs</b> incorporating varying amounts (5, 10, or 20 % w/w) and diameter sizes (small, 0 - 50 mum; medium, 51 - 100 mum, or large, 101 - 200 mum) of PLGA microparticles. The short-term biocompatibility results showed a mild tissue response for all implant formulations, irrespective of disc preincubation, during the early implantation periods up to 12 days. Quantitative histological evaluation revealed that the different implant formulations induced the formation of similar fibrous tissue capsules and interfaces. The results concerning long-term biocompatibility showed that all implants were surrounded by a thin connective tissue capsule (< 10 layers of fibroblasts). Additionally, {{no significant differences in}} capsule and interface scores were observed between the different implant formulations. The implants containing 20 % PLGA with medium- and large-sized microparticles showed fibrous tissue ingrowth throughout the implants, indicating PLGA degradation and interconnectivity of the pores. The results demonstrate that CaP/PLGA composites evoke a minimal inflammatory response. The implants containing 20 % PLGA with medium- and large-sized microparticles showed fibrous tissue ingrowth after 12 - and 24 -weeks indicating PLGA degradation and interconnectivity of the pores. Therefore, CaP/PLGA composites can be regarded as biocompatible biomaterials with potential for bone tissue engineering and advantageous possibilities of the microparticles regarding material porosity...|$|R

40|$|Upon activation, the apoptosis-inducing cell {{membrane}} receptor CD 95 (APO- 1 /Fas) recruits a set of intracellular signaling proteins (CAP 1 - 4) into a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). In the <b>DISC,</b> <b>CAP</b> 1 and CAP 2 represent FADD/MORT 1. CAP 4 was identified recently as an ICE-like protease, FLICE, with two death effector domains (DED). Here we show that FLICE binds to FADD through its N-terminal DED. This is an obligatory step in CD 95 signaling detected in the DISC of all CD 95 -sensitive cells tested. Upon prolonged triggering of CD 95 with agonistic antibodies all cytosolic FLICE gets proteolytically activated. Physiological FLICE cleavage requires association with the DISC and occurs by a two-step mechanism. Initial cleavage generates a p 43 and a p 12 fragment further processed to a p 10 fragment. Subsequent cleavage of the receptor-bound p 43 results in formation of the prodomain p 26 {{and the release of}} the active site-containing fragment p 18. Activation of FLICE is blocked by the peptide inhibitors zVAD-fmk, zDEVD-fmk and zIETD-fmk, but not by crmA or Ac-YVAD-CHO. Taken together, our data indicate that FLICE is the first in a cascade of ICE-like proteases activated by CD 95 and that this activation requires a functional CD 95 DISC...|$|R

These new materials show enhanced structure-property relations, specifically, in terms of photonic bandgap properties. In order to access these enchance properties, a viable method to assemble non-spherical based ordered structures is required. This dissertation describes {{the application of the}} convective self-assembly technique to fabricated regular two- and three-dimensional structures from <b>disc,</b> hemispherical <b>cap,</b> spherocylinder and dumbbell shaped colloids. Aqueous particle suspensions with controlled volume fraction permitted the assembly of large scale crystalline monolayers on substrates vertically immersed in the suspension, as the solvent was evaporated. Systematically tuning the particle volume fraction induced different particle packing arrangements in the monolayer. The monolayer structures were then correlated to the crystallization rate and suspension concentration, the two key convective assembly parameters, establishing process control of film structure in the monolayer regime. Adjusting the parameters for slower film deposition, higher suspension concentrations were used to extend the convective assembly technique three-dimensional structures from spherocylinder and dumbbell shaped particles. Additionally, the photonic band structures of crystals with face-centered cubic (FCC) and base-centered monoclinic lattices and dumbbell shape bases were calculated. The band structures revealed that a range of particle shapes produced complete photonic bandgaps...|$|R

Two more regions are identified on the target surface, beside the stagnation point/impingement region. One is the region in which the coefficients fall rapidly and the other is the region in which the fall in the coefficients is gradual and smooth as the impinging jet-flow is fully transformed into wall-jet flow. In view of the smooth transition of this fall from the transition region to the wall-jet region, these 2 regions are treated as a single region in the radial direction from the stagnation point. The mass transfer coefficients in this region showed similar trends of stagnation point with variation in <b>nozzle</b> hole and <b>disc</b> distributor, cell size, and height of the disc distributor from the target surface.

A metric description of the local deformations is used to study the intrinsic geometry of the resulting surfaces upon exposure to stimuli such as light and heat. We highlight specific patterns that encode constant Gaussian curvature of prescribed sign and magnitude. We present the first experimental results for such programmed solids, and they qualitatively support theory for {{both positive and negative}} Gaussian curvature morphing from flat sheets on stimulation by light or heat. We review logarithmic spiral patterns that generate cone/anti-cone surfaces, and introduce spiral director fields that encode non-localized positive and negative Gaussian curvature on punctured <b>discs,</b> including spherical <b>caps</b> and spherical spindles. Conditions are derived where these cap-like, photomechanically responsive regions can be anchored in inert substrates by designing solutions that ensure compatibility with the geometric constraints imposed by the surrounding media.

40|$|We are {{developing}} a novel classical over-the barrier model for electron transfer from an in nitely thin conducting disc to a point charge projectile to model multiple electron capture in e. g. keV collisions of atomic ions with poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In its nal form, the present model will incorporate the polarization of the PAH molecules due to the active electron and the point charge projectile at a general angle of incidence. This will drastically improve {{the description of the}} potential barrier in comparisons with simpler versions of the model where the nite size and polarizability of the target molecule is neglected or treated in an averaged fashion. In this work we arrive at expressions for the electrostatic potential energy barrier experienced by the active electron in the two spatial orientations where the point charge projectile is located along the normal symmetry axis and in the tangent plane of the disc. Applied to coronene (C 24 H 12) such barriers compare better with high level density functional theory (DFT) calculations than with the results from the simpler versions of the classical over-the-barrier models for atomic and spherical cluster targets. These results thus strongly supports the conducting disc approximation of PAHs.

For reasons of flux uncertainties in the CMS tracker, sensors are irradiated with a fluence 50 % higher than predicted.
