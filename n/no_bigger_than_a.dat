During the warmer summer months, an {{estimated}} 4–6 trillion brine shrimp inhabit the lake. Brine shrimp have no food value for humans, but are a staple for birds of the region. The brine shrimp feed on microscopic algae.|$|E
25|$|John Lambton {{does not}} catch {{anything}} until the church service finishes, {{at which point}} he fishes out a small eel- or lamprey-like creature with nine holes {{on each side of}} its salamander-like head. Depending on the version of the story, the worm is <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> thumb, or about 3 feet long.

The laser {{is powered by}} a single electron which passes through two quantum dots; a double quantum dot. The electron moves from a state of higher energy, to a state of lower energy whilst emitting photons in the microwave region. These photons bounce off mirrors to create a beam of light; the laser.|$|E

Joining the cast in 2002, she continued with the series until its cancellation later that same year. She later had significant guest appearances on NYPD Blue, Dharma & Greg, , House and NCIS. She also appeared as herself in Standing Tall at Auschwitz, which was a History Channel documentary on the Ovitz family, and in <b>No</b> <b>Bigger</b> <b>Than</b> <b>a</b> Minute, an independent documentary on dwarfism which aired on the PBS program P.O.V.|$|E
25|$|The {{satellite}} {{was designed}} and constructed {{in less than a}} month. Sputnik 1 was a simple polished metal sphere <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> beach ball, containing batteries powering a transmitter using 4 external communication antennae. Korolev personally managed the assembly at a hectic pace; and the satellite was placed in orbit using a rocket that had successfully launched only once before. International response to the accomplishment was electrifying, and political ramifications continued for decades. Nikita Khrushchev was pleased with this success, and encouraged launch of a more sophisticated satellite less than a month later in time for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution on 3 November.|$|E

Many of his sketches resemble cartoon strips where the pictures get bigger and more detailed. He would also do several versions of the same finished picture, such as one where the motif is depicted in a summer and winter scene. He did not observe the traditional hierarchy in the mediums or techniques at that time. He could make a complete work in pencil or charcoal just as well as a sketch in oil.|$|E

Due to its small size, and lack of a pastor, the church would later be locally known as the Tomahawk Chapel after the street it was on.

2500|$|A carpet is {{a textile}} floor {{covering}} typically consisting of an upper layer of pile attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but, since the 20th century, synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, nylon or polyester are often used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts which are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term [...] "carpet" [...] is often used interchangeably with the term [...] "rug", although the term [...] "carpet" [...] {{can be applied to}} a floor covering that covers an entire house, whereas a [...] "rug" [...] is generally <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> single room, and traditionally does not even span from one wall to another, and is typically not even attached as part of the floor.|$|E
2500|$|A hasty {{counter-attack}} by the Surreys on Fort MacGregor was attempted but {{the attack}} was stopped just forward of the start line and the Surreys withdrew with many casualties.

The paratroopers had been devastated by the shelling and {{had no choice but}} to withdraw. The summit was <b>no</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> football pitch and was strewn with human remains, mostly German but also the British dead of D Company.

She bought the box for a few shillings and took it, unopened, home with her.

The news extends into the [...] "future" [...] at least up to 2015, when it is reported that astronauts have landed on Mars and vandalised the landscape. There is an element of political satire within these broadcasts as well; the achievements and beliefs of countries opposed to America are usually mocked or condemned (Sputnik is [...] "proven" [...] to be a fake) by these broadcasters, whilst similar American policies are usually heartedly over-praised. Events such as the Iraq WMD scare are also referenced.|$|E
