5000|$|Today, Medina ("Madinah" [...] officially in Saudi documents), in {{addition}} to being the second most important Islamic pilgrimage destination after Mecca, is an important regional capital of the western Saudi Arabian province of Al Madinah. In addition to the sacred core of the old city, which is off limits to non-Muslims, Medina is a modern, multi-ethnic city inhabited by Saudi Arabs and an increasing number of Muslim and non-Muslim expatriate workers: other Arab <b>nationalities</b> (<b>Egyptians,</b> Jordanians, Lebanese, etc.), South Asians (Bangladeshis, Indians, Pakistanis, etc.), and Filipinos.|$|R

Egyptians who have acquired a foreign citizenship may keep their <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality</b> if the other country permits it and if within a period not exceeding 1 year from the date he/she acquires the foreign nationality, declares his wish to retain his Egyptian citizenship. Persons who become naturalized Egyptian citizens may keep their original nationality if the other country permits it. This contrasts with some Asian countries such as India, China, and Japan, whose nationals lose the original nationality when they voluntarily assume another. Egyptian nationals {{with at least one}} parent born in Japan will have to choose, by the age of 22, whether to keep their Japanese or <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similar to {{the other}} three compounds, Udhailiyah is {{surrounded}} by multiple perimeter fences, Saudi Aramco employees and their dependents live inside.

50|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality</b> law {{is based}} on a mixture the {{principles}} of Jus sanguinis and Jus soli with some alterations. In other words, both place of birth and Egyptian parentage are relevant for determining whether a person is an Egyptian citizen.|$|R
2500|$|With {{regards to}} Egyptian citizenship, {{refugees}} are barred from acquiring citizenship as <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality</b> is granted {{only on the}} basis of descent, or ius sanguinis.

50|$|In {{modern times}} the {{official}} 1907 census showed 62,973 Greeks living in Egypt. The expulsion of 2.5 million Greeks from Turkey saw {{a large number}} of those Greeks move to Egypt and by 1940 Greeks were numbered at around 500,000. Today the Greek community numbers officially about 3,000 people although the real number is much higher since many Greeks have changed their <b>nationality</b> to <b>Egyptian.</b> In Alexandria, apart from the patriarchate, there is a patriarchal theology school that opened recently after being closed for 480 years. Saint Nicolas church and several other buildings in Alexandria have been recently renovated by the Greek Government and the Alexander S. Onassis Foundation.|$|R

50|$|Najmah {{compound}} (Aramco code: RT) {{is one of}} four residential compounds {{built by}} ARAMCO in the 1940s and the only one located on the coast of the Persian Gulf itself. Ras Tanura refinery is surrounded by a heavily guarded security fence, and Saudi employees and their dependents may live inside the Najmah residential compound which is less heavily guarded. Built originally to allow expatriate oil company employees (mainly Americans) a degree of Western comfort and separation from the restrictions of Saudi and Islamic laws, the community today has shifted somewhat in line with the reduction of western residents into a multi-ethnic mosaic of Saudis, other Arab <b>nationalities</b> (e.g. <b>Egyptian</b> and Jordanian), Filipinos, Indians, Pakistanis, and a few Americans and British expats - all of whom live with English as the common language.|$|R

[...] After several decades of Saudization by the now 100% Saudi-controlled company, many Saudi families now live on the compound, which culturally and linguistically is still quite westernized (i.e. Islamic customs are followed to a lesser extent there than outside of the compound, and English is the common language of communication and education).|$|R
2500|$|Many {{companies}} that employ relatively {{large numbers of}} expatriates have built fenced-in compounds where only expatriates live, however the largest compound, the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran provides accommodation to many different nationalities. Although built originally to house only expatriate oil company employees (mainly Americans) to provide a degree of Western comfort and separation from the restrictions of Saudi and Islamic laws, the community today has shifted somewhat {{in line with the}} reduction of western residents into a multi-ethnic mosaic of Saudis, other Arab <b>nationalities</b> (e.g., <b>Egyptian</b> and Jordanian), Asians, Europeans, South Americans, Africans and Australians. [...] While only employees of Saudi Aramco live on the camp, their nationalities reflect those of the company as a whole. There are also several neighborhoods, or suburbs just outside the main Saudi Aramco Camp, such as Doha District (حي الدوحه) Dana District (حي الدانة) and Aljamiah District (حي الجامعة), where Saudi Aramco gives home loans to Saudi employees to build their own homes.|$|R
50|$|Most Sunni Muslims {{believe that}} visual depictions {{of all the}} prophets of Islam should be {{prohibited}} and are particularly averse to visual representations of Muhammad. In 1926, Egyptian actor Youssef Wahbi was in discussions to play Muhammad in a film financed by the Turkish government under Atatürk. When the Sunni Islamic Al-Azhar University in Cairo heard about it, scholars there released a fatwa stipulating that Islam forbids the depiction of Muhammad on screen and King Fuad then sent a severe warning to the actor, threatening to exile him and strip him of his <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality.</b> As {{a result of the}} controversy, the film was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Abu Zayd began criticizing President Sadat in the mid-1970s. She {{became a}} leader of the Egyptian National Front, which was set up in Damascus in 1980 by General Saad El Shazly. The {{organization}} called for the overthrow of Sadat's government. Due to her opposition to Sadat's peace overture to Israel, Abu Zayd was accused of high treason, terrorism and spying, and was consequently deprived of her <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality.</b> This turned her into a stateless political refugee. A long legal battle ensued, which was finally resolved in late 1991 when a judge ruled that Abu Zayd and her husband were entitled to their Egyptian passports. She was also acquitted of the charges of high treason and terrorism.|$|R
50|$|The {{interest}} in Ancient Egypt at the time, inspired by recent archaeological finds, {{as well as}} Gautier's Le Roman de la Momie, gave Petipa the push to create 'The Pharaoh's Daughter.' These interests and finds inspired {{a new wave of}} costuming, such as the newly shortened tutu being decorated with Egyptian jewelry and ornamentation. These decorations were meant to give the audience a better feel to the ballet and reflect <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Some of these costumes could be considered racist, as the leads were dressed in beautiful, expensive costumes, where the Nationalistic dances could be covered in blackface. They were meant to inspire a feeling of Egyptian taste, but authenticity was often compromised for opulence, and could be considered entirely offensive.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court {{upheld the}} right of {{hundreds}} of prisoners detained without charges to challenge their detentions in U.S. courts. Subsequently, detainees Sharif el-Mashad, Ayman Matrafi, Fadel Reda el-Wakili, Adel Fathi Ali, el-Gazzar and Ahmed Habib at the U.S. Naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba were categorized among the [...] "least dangerous" [...] detainees at the prison. Each had <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality,</b> with Ahmed Habib additionally having Australian nationality. In August 2004, the Egyptian human rights group Human Rights Association for Assistance to Prisoners (HRAAP) requested that Ambassador Welch provide [...] "the truth {{on the fate of}} Sharif Fathi el-Mashad and the precise reasons for his continued detention" [...] and to allow HRAAP's lawyers to visit the detainee. In November of that same year, Egypt asked the United States to return these five Egyptian detainees to Egypt.|$|R
50|$|Egyptian culture {{affected}} Quran tajweed (the way of chanting Quranic verses). Sheikh Mohammed Refaat {{used the}} oriental Nahawand {{scale in the}} tajweed while Sheikh Mustafa Ismail used the Bayaty scale.Andil was a staunch defender of illiterate Egyptians for the role they played in preserving and transmitting Egyptian culture {{from one generation to}} the next. Educated people connived with the Anglo-Americans to Arabise Egypt. Reactionary ideas and values were accordingly promoted and this climate bred millions of terrorists who antagonise those who believe in other religions.Andil concluded that the only way out of this dark tunnel is to revive the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Iranians, for instance, accepted Islam, but never accepted Arabism. They are proud of their pre-Islamic heroes, myths and gods. The same could be said about Finnish people who liberated themselves from the Swedish culture thanks to their intellectuals who spared no effort to revive the national heritage of the country. Indians preserved their culture in the face of the Mongols, while the great Spanish people under Queen Isabella liberated their country from the Arab invaders.|$|R
