5000|$|A {{study by}} economists Connan Snider and Thomas Youle, in April 2010 corroborated {{the results of}} the earlier Wall Street Journal study, {{concluding}} that the Libor submissions by some member banks were being understated. Unlike the earlier study, Snider and Youle suggested that the reason for understatement by member banks was not that the banks were trying to appear strong, especially during the financial crisis period of 2007 to 2008, but rather that the banks sought to make substantial profits on their large Libor interest-linked portfolios. For example, {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, Citigroup had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $14.2 trillion, Bank of America had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $49.7 trillion and JPMorgan Chase had interest rate swaps of <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> of $49.3 trillion. Given the large notional values, a small unhedged exposure to the Libor could generate large incentives to alter the overall Libor.

40|$|Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) are {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most versatile financial innovations of the 21 st century. Since its inception, the credit derivatives market has grown to a peak of $ 64 trillion in 2008 in terms of gross <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> (Cont, 2010). However, after the onset of the GFC, this market has decreased to a large extent. While there is evidence that promotes the risk reduction properties of CDSs, there is a growing body of research post GFC that identifies destabilising effects of these instruments. In this paper, I review the relevant scholarly literature and provide evidence of how the views on CDSs have changed post GFC due a deeper investigation of issues such as systemic risk, regulatory arbitrage, information asymmetry and risk-taking, among others, in the banking industry. This paper provides a survey of the literature of views ‘for’ and ‘against’ the use of CDSs during pre and post GFC periods and finally concludes that in comparison to the pre GFC period, post GFC there is a significant increase in the literature that highlights the detrimental nature of CDSs...|$|R
50|$|There is {{an amount}} {{guaranteed}} to be paid out called the sum assured and this can be increased {{on the basis of}} investment performance through the addition of periodic (for example annual) bonuses. Regular bonuses (sometimes referred to as reversionary bonuses) are guaranteed at maturity and a further non-guarantee bonus may be paid at the end known as a terminal bonus. During adverse investment conditions, the encashment value or surrender value may be reduced by a 'Market Value Reduction' or MVR (It is sometime referred to as a market value adjustment but this is a term in decline through pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority to use clearer terms). The idea of such a measure is to protect the investors who remain in the fund from others withdrawing funds with <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> that are, or risk being, in excess of the value of underlying assets at a time when stock markets are low. If an MVA applies an early surrender would be reduced according to the policies adopted by the funds managers at the time.|$|R

30|$|Recently, several {{research}} groups {{have focused on}} the problem of non-destructive measurement of the actual heat transfer conditions of building assemblies using thermal images. Madding's work (Madding [2008]) is one of the earliest studies that propose a method for analyzing thermal images to estimate the actual heat transfer conditions for building envelopes. Based on the environmental assumption of a steady-state heat transfer condition of building environments, this work measured the R-value of drywall assemblies using the indoor surface temperature data obtained from thermal images. The measurements were experimentally conducted in controlled lab environments, and then they were compared with the theoretical expected properties. Likewise, based on the similar environmental assumptions, methods proposed in (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]) measured the overall heat transfer coefficient of the building assemblies. For validation, several experiments were conducted for a few standard wall assemblies. In these studies, the difference between the measured values using thermal images and the <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> was reported to be in the range of ~ 10 % (Madding [2008]), 10 - 20 % (Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]), and around 15 % for cavity walls (Dall'O' et al.

3000|$|Difficulty in in-situ {{measurement}} of as-is thermal properties for building assemblies: Few participants had {{concerns about the}} difficulty in accurate {{measurement of}} thermal properties in building environments. Here, following prior works (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]; Madding [2008]), the deviation between the measurements and the <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> was examined. It is noted that wall assembles are not {{the best choice for}} such experiments since wall assemblies typically have multiple layers and are likely to suffer from non-uniform and time-variant degradations. Hence, in this case, using the notional R-values as the ground truth for the as-is thermal resistances may not be accurate. In contrary to walls, since windows are mostly standardized and their thermal properties {{are more likely to be}} consistent over time, their actual thermal resistance is less likely to deviate from the <b>notional</b> <b>values</b> derived from the as-built documents. Thus, window components were selected for experiments. It is not a trivial task to accurately estimate the thermal properties of the old building assemblies such as the case studies of this paper. Here, the estimation is based on (ColoradoENERGY [2013]; The Engineering Toolbox [2013]) which provide recommendations for such R-values and (European Standard (EN) [1997]). As a result for single-glazed clear windows, the averaged deviations were 12.81 % (= (0.301 - 0.260)/ 0.301) for case # 1 and 10.37 % (= (0.301 - 0.274)/ 0.301) for case # 2. Following the environmental assumptions presented in (Albatici and Tonelli [2010]; Dall'O' et al. [2013]; Fokaides and Kalogirou [2011]; Madding [2008]), the findings in the experiments are consistent with what was reported in those literatures (Section Thermal resistance (R-value) of building assemblies). Here, systematic errors on measuring the input variables for Equation (5) need to be considered. If the thermographic inspection is conducted in outdoor environments, the measurement accuracy would be affected by various external factors such as wind, sun radiation, and shadows. Since the temperatures are measured from inside surfaces and crumpled aluminum foils located in indoor environments, the accuracy of measuring those input variables is typically the same as it is claimed in the technical specification of the thermal camera. As can be seen in the Table 1, the measurement accuracy of the consumer-level thermal camera used is 2 °C or ± 2 % of reading. Here, another prevalent challenge for accurate measurement in thermal resistances in a non-destructive manner is that the measurement needs to be conducted under steady-state conditions as discussed in Section (Environmental Assumptions and Experimental Setups). Despite significant efforts to form a steady-state heat transfer condition during thermographic inspection (e.g., the timing of data collection and experimental setups prior to image data collection as described in Section(Environmental Assumptions and Experimental Setups), in practice, it is not trivial to maintain a perfect steady-state condition during thermogaphic inspection. More research needs to be conducted on how a steady state condition of heat transfer can be continued during thermographic inspection and how the measurement errors caused by non-steady-state conditions can be accounted for and minimized for more accurate analysis; [...]...|$|R
50|$|Credit {{derivatives}} provide market signals {{regarding the}} risk of particular investments. For example, the cost of providing CDS protection for particular bonds is a signal regarding {{the risk of}} those bonds. CDS also allow particular credit risks to be hedged, as an entity can purchase protection from many sources of credit risk, much like an insurance policy. While total <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> related to CDS are enormous (estimated between $25-$50 trillion), the true exposure related to that <b>notional</b> <b>value</b> is approximately $2.5-$3.0 trillion. This amount would only be lost if the underlying assets lost their entire value (i.e., akin to all the cars insured by car insurance companies being totaled simultaneously; CDS insure bonds instead of cars), which is outside any reasonable scenario.

30|$|In contrast, {{other studies}} (e.g., Belghitar et al. 2013; Graham and Rogers 2002; Knopf et al. 2002) propose a {{continuous}} hedging variable {{to measure the}} extent of hedging (e.g., the gross <b>notional</b> derivative <b>value</b> or the fair value of derivative contracts). However, studies using a hedging dummy variable routinely report the descriptive statistics for hedgers and non-hedgers or a mean difference test between both groups, consequently providing us with sufficient information to extract correlations. In contrast, studies examining a continuous hedging variable do usually not present this information. Moreover, the number of studies using a dummy instead of a continuous hedging variable is much higher, and therefore a meta-analysis based on these studies yields more reliable results.|$|R
