5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} for another war, the historic peace churches, represented by Friends who understood inner dealings of Washington D.C. politics, attempted to influence <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> bills {{to ensure their}} men could fulfill their duty in an alternative, non-military type of service. On June 20, 1940, the Burke-Wadsworth Bill came before Congress. The arrangements for conscientious objectors were almost identical to the World War I provisions.|$|E
5|$|When Lark {{received}} the first script, he was disappointed. He felt {{none of the}} characters were likable, and the scene Rucka had described to him over dinner was not included. Rucka wrote a <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> to address Lark's concerns and restored the missing opening scene. Lark began drawing the first issue in January 2013 and based the opening scene on the birth sequence in The Fifth Element.|$|E
5|$|Due in part {{to strong}} public support, the MTA Board {{committed}} in April 2000 to building a full-length subway line along the East Side, from East Harlem to Lower Manhattan. In May 2000, the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA's 2000–2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion {{for the construction of}} the Second Avenue Subway. In 2001, a contract for subway design was awarded to DMJM Harris/Arup Joint Venture. A <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> statement proposed the full-length line from 125th to 14th Streets. South of 14th Street, the line could either travel under Chrystie Street, St. James Place and Water Street to a terminal in Lower Manhattan, or link to the existing Nassau Street Loop tracks J1 and J2 at Kenmare Street to provide access to Lower Manhattan. The Water Street option was the one eventually chosen.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} raise yarn quality, a <b>new</b> <b>drafting</b> system concept for ring {{spinning}} machines is developed in this study, {{along with an}} analysis of its controlling effects. To optimize the <b>new</b> <b>drafting</b> system, its structural parameters are studied and two empirical equations for yarn unevenness and nep count model its design. The equation of yarn unevenness is used to find the optimum structural parameters of the <b>new</b> <b>drafting</b> system. Practical spinning tests with the optimized system prove that it can reduce unevenness, thin places, thick places, and neps in spun yarns, and that the equation for yarn unevenness {{can be used to}} satisfactorily estimate the unevenness of spun yarns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|The draft faced staunch {{opposition}} by royalist {{members of}} the convention, led by Kasem Chatikavanich. A <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> was demanded, granting the monarch greater power and increasing royal powers to the level granted by the 1949 constitution. The monarch would appoint a Senate with the countersign of the privy council president. The royal veto could be overridden only with a two-thirds majority of the combined parliament. Furthermore, the Senate could kill any laws by not voting on them for six months. Civil servants and soldiers could not become MPs, but could form {{up to half of}} the cabinet. The <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> would not require approval by a public referendum.|$|E
25|$|Shariah also {{includes}} stoning and explicitly states that stones used must be {{small enough to}} not kill instantly.

25|$|A {{preliminary}} {{proposal for}} a convention of astronomy organisations in these five countries was drafted in 1954.

In the fourth and final draft lottery drawing, on February 2, 1972, for men born in 1953 and to be inducted during 1973, Bush received a draft number of 26 on a calendar-based scale that went to 365. But no <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> orders were issued after 1972, because the U.S. changed to an all-volunteer military beginning in 1973.|$|E

25|$|In the Palestinian calendar, the {{day after}} Israel {{declared}} independence (15 May) is observed as Nakba Day. It is traditionally observed as an important day of remembrance. In May 2009 the political party headed by Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman introduced {{a bill that would}} outlaw all Nakba commemorations, with a three-year prison sentence for such acts of remembrance. Following public criticism the bill draft was changed, the prison sentence dropped and instead the Minister of Finance would have the authority to reduce state funding for Israeli institutions that hold the commemorations. The <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> was approved by the Knesset in March 2011.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, Truffaut {{showed a}} <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> to Gruault, which now {{included}} a deaf-mute child {{as the main}} character Julien Davenne's protégé, and had Davenne work as an obituary writer in a small Parisian magazine. The presence of Paul Massigny was also vital {{for the development of}} the story. Indeed, Truffaut stated that without Massigny there would be no film because it would be too static, and that The Green Room is a tale in which Massigny is the anti-hero. Gruault finished a new version of the script by February 1977. Truffaut worked on it with his assistant Suzanne Schiffman and completed the final draft in May 1977.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, {{that there are}} also {{critical}} voices from environmental organisations for example. That is {{in part due to}} the fact that there are European Organic Regulations such as (EC) No 834/2007 or the <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> from 2014 but no comparable regulations for Integrated Farming. Whereas organic farming and the “Bio-Siegel” in Germany for example are legally protected, EU Commission has not yet considered to start working on a comparable framework or blueprint for Integrated Farming. When products are marketed as “Controlled Integrated Produce”, according control mechanisms and quality-labels are not based on national or European directives but are established and handled by private organisations and quality schemes such as LEAF Marque.|$|E
25|$|Many {{that were}} to become active in the strike {{campaign}} had been suspicious of the language legislation from the beginning—they suspected {{this to be the}} first step towards “nationalization” of the republic at the expense of “their country,” the Soviet Union. However, on 10 August 1989 I. M. Zaslavskii, a deputy to the Moldavian Supreme Soviet and resident of the Transnistrian city of Tiraspol, leaked a <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> of the law to the factory newspaper of the “Tochlitmash” Tiraspol Machine-Building Factory im. Kirova. Seeing that the new version would establish Moldovan as the only official language of the MSSR, activists from a number of Tiraspol factories came together to create the United Work Collective Council (Ob"edinnennyi Sovet trudovykh kollektivov, OSTK) and called an immediate strike that eventually led to the shutdown of most major industrial activity (concentrated in the Transnistrian region) throughout the SSR.|$|E

25|$|In New York City, Laurents went to {{the opening}} night party for a new play by Ugo Betti, and there he met Sondheim, who had heard that East Side Story, now retitled West Side Story, was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to {{concentrate}} solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on Peter Pan instead. Laurents asked Sondheim {{if he would be}} interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (Saturday Night had been aborted), but Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted. Meanwhile, Laurents had written a <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: Anton, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish Maria had become a Puerto Rican.|$|E
25|$|The {{script for}} the pilot episode of Freaks and Geeks was written by Paul Feig as a spec script. Feig gave the script to Judd Apatow, who sold it to DreamWorks, where Apatow was under an overall deal. That company, in turn, sold it to NBC, who quickly greenlit the script as a pilot. Before the script was shot, Feig wrote a second episode {{at the behest of}} Apatow. He showed this second script to Apatow and pilot {{director}} Jake Kasdan, and they suggested that he combine the two episodes to form a stronger pilot. Notable additions in this <b>new</b> <b>draft</b> included the introduction of the character Kim Kelly and Lindsay Weir's recollection of her grandmother's death. Feig wrote a final draft after a read-through with the cast, this time incorporating into the episode a first formal meeting between Lindsay and the freaks (in previous drafts, Lindsay was already considered part of the group).|$|E
