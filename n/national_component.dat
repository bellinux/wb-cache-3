2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greek army {{numbering}} 300,000 soldiers, was the largest single <b>national</b> <b>component</b> of the Allied army in the Macedonian front. The presence of the entire Greek army gave the critical mass that altered the balance between the opponents in the Macedonian front. Under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army, starting on 14 September 1918. After the first heavy fighting (see Battle of Skra) the Bulgarians gave up their defensive positions and began retreating back towards their country. On 24 September the Bulgarian government asked for an armistice, which was signed five days later. [...] The Allied army then pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces that tried to halt the Allied offensive. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918 marking {{the dissolution of the}} Austro-Hungarian empire. The breaking of the Macedonian front was one of the important breakthroughs of the military stalemate and helped {{to bring an end to}} the War.

50|$|According to Roman Hrytskiv a {{characteristic}} of Polish historiography is the <b>national</b> <b>component</b> in its understanding of the problem. This is evident by {{the treatment of the}} Ukrainian-Polish conflict as an episode of purely Polish history; focusing attention to the anti-Polish terror of the UPA and demanding that the Ukrainians condemn these actions. The treatment of the anti-Ukrainian actions of the Polish underground is relegated to a secondary position, and the moral and emotional style of exposition of materials, the inclusion of materials whose authenticity is questionable (memoirs, eye witness accounts, works of literature etc.). At the same time, it is in Poland that the professional study of Ukrainian-Polish conflict was started. Polish historians were the first to thoroughly study and analyse the facts of this conflict, developed a periodization, collected a significant number of Polish historic sources and developed a number of alternative methods of studying the problem.|$|E

5000|$|... a canard…with the sub-variant {{that all}} those Germans were at least SS generals and other much wanted war criminals. As a rule, {{and in order to}} prevent any {{particular}} nation from making the Foreign Legion into a Praetorian Guard, any particular <b>national</b> <b>component</b> is kept at about 25 percent of the total. Even supposing (and this was the case, of course) that the French recruiters, in the eagerness for candidates would sign up Germans enlisting as Swiss, Austrian, Scandinavian and other nationalities of related ethnic background, {{it is unlikely that the}} number of Germans in the Foreign Legion ever exceeded 35 percent. Thus, without making an allowance for losses, rotation, discharges, etc., the maximum number of Germans fighting in Indochina at any one time reached perhaps 7,000 out of 278,000. As to the ex-Nazis, the early arrivals contained a number of them, none of whom were known to be war criminals. French intelligence saw to that.Since, in view of the rugged Indochinese climate, older men without previous tropical experience constituted more a liability than an asset, the average age of the Foreign Legion enlistees was about 23.

40|$|The {{regional}} {{distribution of}} income inequality in the European Union between 1993 and 1998 is examined. The results obtained reveal {{the existence of a}} process of convergence in regional inequality levels over the period analysed. This was due basically to the reduction in income dispersion that took place in regions registering relatively high levels of inequality in 1993. Polarization in the distribution under study is also found to decrease, irrespective of the number of groups considered. Nevertheless, since the observed level of intradistributional mobility is low, the European regions tend, over time, to maintain their relative positions in terms of inequality. Finally, the analysis carried out highlights the relevance of the <b>national</b> <b>component</b> in explaining the dynamics of regional inequality distribution. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{regional}} welfare {{distribution in}} the European Union between 1993 and 1998 is examined, using several complementary methodologies. The results obtained show a reduction in regional welfare disparities over the period analysed. It is worth noting, in this respect, however, that regional productivity differences {{prove to be the}} main determinant behind observed welfare inequality in the European context. Moreover, there has also been a decline in regional bipolarization over the six-year contemplated, while the degree of observed intradistributional mobility is relatively low. The empirical evidence presented, nevertheless, reveals the importance of variables such as the <b>national</b> <b>component,</b> the spatial location, the regional productive structure or the percentage of GDP devoted to investment or to R&D expenditure, in accounting for the dynamics of the distribution under analysis. ...|$|E
