Light in the room is controlled by brightness and the presence of people in the room. Operation of the system can be checked and adjusted via the internet. The development board Arduino Uno with added module Arduino Ethernet Shield was used. Movement is detected by a passive infrared sensor. Departure from the room is detected as interruption of signal from the infrared light emitting diode. The temperature is measured with a <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> <b>thermistor</b> connected to the analog input. The system is connected to the computer through a network connection. Computer collects and stores data. From the shared data the web application shows graphs of temperature, brightness and light use. On the website the highest, lowest and average temperature for a selected period can be observed. It is possible to monitor the entry and movement in the room. By turning off the lights when the room is not used, electricity is saved. This system can monitor temperature and thus heating. This way the energy consumption can be analyzed. When using only one room the savings due to this are small. If the system is extended to the entire house, the savings can be greater.

In our approach we use high quality silicon particles to replace the pigments in a graphics ink, and print semiconducting patterns together with conducting tracks and insulators to form electronic devices. The silicon nanoparticles are produced by high energy milling, which yields a particle size of about 80 nm. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) reveals that the nanoparticles have no noticable silicon dioxide layer. Due to their surface structure, the particles are not insulating, but allow charge transport from particle to particle so that the essential semiconducting features of silicon are maintained.

40|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (NTC) <b>thermistors</b> made of spinel {{structure}} {{transition metal}} manganites usually display ageing phenomena under thermal stress. Their resistance drift {{depends on their}} composition, crystal structure (cubic or tetragonal) and heat treatments. We have previously shown in iron manganite thermistors, Mn 3 -xFexO 4 (with 0 ≤x ≤ 1. 51), that the ageing {{is due to the}} migration of Fe 3 + and Mn 2 + ions between tetrahedral and octahedral sites of the spinel structure. Iron manganites were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) in order to relate microstructure to electrical stability. For iron manganites with iron content x ≤ 0. 78, two dimensional defects result in a domain microstructure (microtwins). As x increases and exceeds 0. 78, the domain structure gradually vanishes and transforms into a tweed microstructure (x = 1. 05) and, for x > 1. 30, no bidimensional defects are observed. Thus it is suggested that the microstructural disturbance {{plays an important role in}} the kinetics of the ion migration during the ageing of the studied ceramics. ...|$|R

The need on higher component density with advanced performance in terms of speed and bandwidth, but in a narrower space may cause thermal, mechanical, and thermomechanical effects that can lead to degradation, limited performance and possible failure of the elements of the assembly. Such effects must be studied and their influence must be predicted prior to the chip fabrication in order to predict any degraded performance or failure mechanisms in the dies, the system components and the package; in this direction Multiphysics simulation tools can be used. By defining the appropriate design and giving the model parameters, material properties (such as thermal conductivity, material density and heat capacity) and the right boundary conditions, we are able to investigate the behavior of the modeled IC, system, or package and observe any possible areas of elevated temperature. In this direction, we have modeled, simulated and investigated the thermal behavior of an advanced integrated microelectronics system, including a System-in-Package component, a CMOS analog multiplexer, several NTC (<b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient)</b> <b>thermistors,</b> and two chip power resistors of the CP series. Experimental measurements and simulations have been conducted for the described model; the temperature gradient and numerical values of temperature in selected points of the system have been extracted during the simulations and have been compared with the experimental results under 1 W applied power in the system. Moreover, several parameters and their influence to the system behavior have been studied during the simulations: the thermal conductivity of the components of the design (e. g. the FR- 4 and the copper part of the substrate, the nickel part of the resistors) and the natural convection coefficient. The first parameter is a material property, while the second concerns the heat transfer mechanism in the system and is related to the power dissipation and cooling processes. Under 1 W power (dissipated by the chip power resistor) the resulted temperature gradient in the design leads to elevated temperature values in the components. The closer the components are to the heat-source, the higher these numerical values are.

40|$|Inductor {{current sensing}} is very {{important}} in the control and monitoring of switching power converters. Traditional low cost implementation using a sensing resistor in series with the inductor will reduce the overall efficiency of the power converter. Conventional Hall effect current sensor could also be used to detect the inductor current. However, it will significantly increase the production cost of power converters. One simple and low cost implementation is to add a resistor-capacitor (RC) network in parallel with the inductor so that the inductor current can be derived from the added circuitry. The problem with RC sensing network is that the sensed variable is very sensitive to temperature variations. In this paper, a novel inductor current sensor using low cost <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (NTC) <b>thermistors</b> to compensate the variation in the parasitic resistance of the inductor due to temperature changes is proposed.

30|$|Micro gas sensors with micro-platforms, which {{consist of}} micro heaters and sensing {{electrodes}} on the membranes, have been actively researched, {{due to the}} possibility to miniaturize sensors and reduce power consumptions [1 – 4]. Micro heaters are necessary for elevated temperatures to operate micro gas sensors [5], because most of gas sensors need thermal energy to react gases [6, 7]. However, usually, {{it is hard to}} measure and control accurate temperatures of micro gas sensors with input powers to increase temperatures of micro heaters. In general, {{there are two kinds of}} measurement methods of temperature of micro heaters. One is contact type method such as thermocouples, <b>negative</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>coefficient</b> (NTC) <b>thermistors</b> and Pt resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), and so on. The other is non-contact type method such as IR cameras. Even though many researchers have measured the temperatures of micro gas sensors by IR cameras, there are some still problems in terms of measurement errors by setting the incorrect emissivity and not enough precision due to the resolution of the cameras [8]. For instance, temperature measurement of the same device is remarkably changed with variations of emissivity. The measured temperature is highly dependent on emissivity of materials. The reason why it is difficult to determine the exact emissivity of IR camera is that other materials exist surrounding micro heater layer in the micro gas sensor as reported in [8, 9] and the emissivity is affected by not only the kinds of materials but also morphologies of surfaces and shapes of materials [10]. Also, it is not possible to measure the operating temperature of packaged micro gas sensors using by IR cameras. In the case of the contact type of temperature sensors, it is also hard to measure the operating temperature of micro gas sensors with membranes due to the fracture problem from fragile structures of membranes and thermal conductivity problem between the micro heaters and contact type temperature sensors. So, special micro temperature sensors are needed.|$|R
