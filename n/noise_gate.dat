500|$|... "Vow" [...] {{began in}} rough demo form in January, 1994, as band members Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker {{performed}} sessions in Marker's basement recording studio and Vig and Marker's own Smart Studios business in Madison, Wisconsin. After Marker saw Shirley Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, the band invited Manson to Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple}} of tracks. After a dreadful first audition, she returned to Angelfish, which folded shortly thereafter. Manson decided to test for Garbage again, and after the successful second audition, she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer" [...] and [...] "Vow". While performing [...] "Vow", Manson ad-libbed the lyrics [...] "I can't use what I can't abuse" [...] and [...] "like Joan of Arc coming back for more". The song is written in the key of A minor, set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. It opens with Erikson playing a guitar through a <b>noise</b> <b>gate</b> [...] "with a lot of echo on it", and has a chord progression is A–C-F in the verses, [...] D-B♭-A-Em-D-B♭-F in the bridge, and F-C-D-G in the chorus, with a segue into F# minor in the interlude.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> play an {{important}} role in drum mic'ing in heavy metal shows. The drum and cymbal mic channels will typically have <b>noise</b> <b>gates</b> so that the mics will only be turned on when the specific drum or cymbal is being played. This dramatically reduces [...] "bleeding" [...] between the drum mics.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>noise</b> <b>gate</b> sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. [...] A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor. [...] Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or the rustling of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. [...] Without a <b>noise</b> <b>gate,</b> the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. [...] With a <b>noise</b> <b>gate,</b> the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Richard W. Peters of Industrial Research Products (IRP) {{was granted}} an {{improvement}} patent entitled [...] "Priority mixer control". IRP released the Voice-Matic series of 4×1 and 8×1 automatic mixers using [...] "Dynamic Threshold Sensing" [...] that weighed {{a combination of}} the amplitude and history of the signal to determine channel access. The master output was attenuated at the rate of 3dB for every doubling of NOM. This master output reduction was the solution used by Yamaha Pro Audio two decades later in their DME series of digital signal processing (DSP) products, incorporating an automixer function which was otherwise an 8- or 16-channel <b>noise</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Jones also {{occasionally}} {{played an}} Olympic White Fender Stratocaster (for live versions of [...] "Straight to Hell") and several Bond Electraglide Guitars that were donated {{to him by}} Andrew Bond, who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger, an analog delay and a <b>noise</b> <b>gate</b> {{as well as a}} Roland chorus or Space Echo effect. During his days with the Clash, Jones used a Marshall Plexi amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a Mesa Boogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.|$|E

50|$|<b>Noise</b> gate: <b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> {{attenuate}} hum, hiss, and static in {{the signal}} by greatly diminishing the volume when the signal falls below a set threshold. <b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> {{are often used}} by electric guitarist who play with vintage amps, which can have unwanted hum in the tone, and by guitarists from heavy metal who use high distortion levels, which add noise to the signal even when no notes are being played. <b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> mute the signal when it falls below a certain threshold. This means that during bars of rest for the guitarist in a song, the hum or noise from the amp or distortion pedal will not be heard by the audience. <b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> are expanders—meaning that, unlike compressors, they increase the dynamic range of an audio signal to make quiet sounds even quieter. If used with extreme settings and combined with reverb, they can create unusual sounds, such as the gated drum effect used in 1980s pop songs, a style popularized by the Phil Collins song In the Air Tonight.Noise gate effects: Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>gating</b> {{works well}} when the static is steady and either {{narrowly}} confined in frequency (e.g. hum from AC power) or {{well below the}} main signal level (15 dB minimum is desirable). In cases where the signal merges with the background static (for example, the brushed drum sounds in the Sun King track on the Beatles album Abbey Road) or is weak compared to the noise (as in very faint tape recordings), the <b>noise</b> <b>gating</b> can add artifacts that are more distracting than the original static.|$|R
2500|$|To {{make sure}} the beat was the same {{throughout}} the song, Porter took a <b>noise</b> <b>gate</b> and set it to be triggered by a drum machine, using percussion instruments Joyce typically did not, set to 16th notes. This created what he called [...] "a swirling signal" [...] that balanced the analog tremolo effect and made sure the whole song stayed on the same beat. The guitar tracks were then [...] "bounced" [...] down to three of the master recording's 24 available tracks, and the 15-minute version was cut down to 8 minutes. This was longer than any previous Smiths' song had been. But, Porter told Tony Fletcher, [...] "we {{looked at each other}} and said, 'It sounds fucking great; let's keep it like that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{announcement}} of the USA Production Series, Schecter announced their introduction into the amplification market. These new amps would be designed in part with well-known amplifier designer James Brown, who is most famous for designing the Peavey 5150 amplifier in part with Eddie Van Halen and his line of effect pedals under the Amptweaker name. The amps first announced were the [...] "Hellraiser USA 100", [...] "Hellraiser Stage 100", [...] "Hellwin USA 100", and the [...] "Hellwin Stage 100". The USA versions are built in Schecter's USA custom shop, while the Stage series is built overseas. The Hellwin is the signature amp for Avenged Sevenfold guitarist Synyster Gates, who helped design the head with James Brown. Both amps make use of EL34 power tubes, an on-board <b>noise</b> <b>gate,</b> a passive and active input that compensate for the output difference by changing the circuit instead of reducing output, and a [...] "Focus" [...] control that adjusts the low end response. The differences between the Hellwin and the Hellraiser is the Hellwin's use of MIDI to control the amp. The Hellwin is also a 3-channel amp, as opposed to the Hellraiser's 2-channel design. Along with these amps, Schecter introduced a line of speaker cabinets, one featuring a 200W sub-woofer. called the [...] "Depth Charge", that would increase the cabinet's bass response. These amps were debuted, along with the USA Production Line, at Winter NAMM 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Titled as an exhortation by Davis to McLaughlin, [...] "Go Ahead John" [...] {{features}} a basic, blues motif, centered around E and B♭, {{as well as}} modulations introduced by Davis into the D♭ scale. The recording begins with McLaughlin's funky wah-wah lines, backing Grossman's sharp, restrained playing, with Davis's first trumpet solo entering at four minutes with scattered ideas. In his book Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles Davis, Jack Chambers writes that the recording's first 11 minutes and its closing four-and-a-half minutes [...] "resemble Willie Nelson [...] as a head arrangement built on a riff, with the riff sustained this time by McLaughlin's steady wah-wah in the background. Approximately six minutes into it, McLaughlin's guitar solo succeeds Davis's first solo, as the band vamps. Music journalist Todd S. Jenkins writes of this passage in the recording, [...] "Thanks to the then-new wonders of <b>noise</b> <b>gate</b> technology, Jack DeJohnette’s drums and cymbals flit back and forth rapidly {{from left to right}} in the mix. With each switch, the guitar’s volume blasts in and out, over and over again, during McLaughlin’s relentlessly acidic solo". Following the passage, an unrelated theme opens with two minutes of a slow blues segment by Davis that is spliced into the recording, accompanied solely by occasional notes from Holland; According to Jack Chambers, Davis's blues solo [...] "becomes a duet with himself by overdubbing, and then builds into a quintet performance lasting ten more minutes". Phil Freeman wrote of this [...] "doubling effect", stating [...] "Miles's two solos fit together perfectly, creating a feel similar to that of New Orleans jazz, with two trumpets weaving intricate, complementary lines around each other".|$|E

50|$|<b>Noise</b> <b>gates</b> often {{implement}} hysteresis, that is, {{they have}} two thresholds: one to open the gate and another, set a few dB below, to close the gate. This means that once a signal has dropped below the close threshold, it has {{to rise to the}} open threshold for the gate to open, so that a signal that crosses over the close threshold regularly does not open the gate and cause chattering. A longer hold time also helps to avoid chattering, as described above.|$|R
